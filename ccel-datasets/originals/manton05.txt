THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY.

   To the Religious and Honourable Lady, Letitia Popham, wife to Colonel
   Alexander Popham.

   MADAM,--It is a lovely conjunction when goodness and greatness meet
   together. Persons of estate and respect in the world have more
   temptations and hindrances than others, but greater obligations to own
   God. The great landlord of the world expecteth a rent from every
   country cottage, but a large revenue from great houses. Now usually it
   falleth out so that they that hold the greatest farms pay the least
   rent. [1] Never is the Lord more neglected and dishonoured than in
   great men's houses, in the very face of all his bounty. If religion
   chance to get in there, it is soon worn out again. Though vices live
   long in a family, and run in a blood from father to son, yet it is a
   rare case to see strictness of religion carried on for three or four
   descents. It was the honour of Abraham's house that from father to son
   for a long while they were heirs of the same promise,' Heb. xi. 9; but
   where is there such a succession to be found in the houses of our
   gentry? The father, perchance, professeth godliness (for ou polloi,
   saith the apostle, 1 Cor. i. 26, not many noble,' &c., there are a
   few--he doth not say there are none), and a carnal son cometh and
   turneth all out of doors, as if he were ashamed of his father's God.
   The causes of this mischief may be supposed to be these:--(1.) Plenty
   ill governed disposeth to vice and sin, as a rank soil is apt to breed
   weeds. (2.) Brave spirits (as the world counteth them) think strictness
   inglorious,' [2] and the power of religion a base thing, that taketh
   off from their grandeur and esteem. A loose owning of Christianity is
   honourable, since the kings of the earth have counted it one of the
   fairest flowers of their crowns to be styled the Catholic King,' the
   most Christian King,' the Defender of the Faith,' &c. But a true
   submission to the power of it is made a scorn, as being contrary to
   that liberty of fashions, vanity of compliment, and some Gentile
   customs, which, in a fond compliance with the humour of the age, they
   are loath to part with. It were a rude zeal to deny them honest
   civilities, but certain customs and modes there are inconsistent with
   the severity of religion, which, rather than men will part with, they
   will even break with God himself. (3.) The marriage of children into
   carnal families, wherein they consult rather with the greatness of
   their house than the continuing of Christ's interest in their line and
   posterity. How careful are they that they should match in their own
   rank for blood and estate! Should they not be as careful for religion
   also? But even good people give a suspicion sometimes that they do not
   believe what they do profess. That this is the ready way to undo all
   that hath been set on foot for God, is evident by scripture and
   experience. See Gen. vi. 1-3; Ps. cvi. 38; Neh. xiii. 25, 26. In
   scripture, we read of Jehoram, who is said to walk in the way of the
   kings of Israel, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife,' 2 Kings viii.
   18; and in ecclesiastical history, of Valens the emperor, who, by
   marrying with an Arian lady, was himself ensnared in that wicked
   opinion.

   All this is spoken, madam, to quicken you to the greater care in your
   relations, that you may settle a standing interest for Jesus Christ so
   hopefully already begun in your house and family. It will not be
   pleasing to you that I should publish upon the house-top what God hath
   done for you, or enabled you to do for him. Go on still, and be
   faithful. There are few that I know in the world who have more cause to
   honour God than you have.

   That I have inscribed this Commentary to your name will not seem
   strange to those that know my great obligations to yourself and your
   worthy husband, and your interest in that beloved place [3] and people
   among whom I have had so many sweet opportunities of enjoying, and, I
   hope, of glorifying God, and from whom I should never have removed but
   upon those weighty causes and considerations which did even rend me
   from them. And though I am now transplanted, and owe very much service
   and respect elsewhere, yet that noble lord [4] that gave me the call
   will allow me full time and leave to pay my old debts, that afterward I
   may be the more in a capacity publicly to express my gratitude to
   himself.

   If any should be so foolish as to object the unsuitableness of
   dedicating a comment on the scripture to one of your sex (as it seemeth
   some did to Jerome [5] ), I shall not plead that two of the books of
   scripture are named from women, Ruth and Esther, that an epistle which
   maketh up a part of the canon is inscribed to an elect lady,' that if
   this be a fault, others have faulted in like kind before me; [6] but
   only that this is a practical commentary, and surely in matters of
   practice (which is every Christian's common interest) your sex hath a
   full share. Though your course of life be more private and confined,
   yet you have your service. The scriptures speak of the woman's gaining
   upon the husband, 1 Peter iii. 1; seasoning the children, Prov. xxxi.
   1, 2 Tim. i. 5; encouraging the servants in a way of godliness,
   especially of their own sex; it is said, Esther iv. 16, I also and my
   maidens will fast likewise.' These maidens were either Jews, and then
   it showeth what servants should be taken into a nearer attendance, such
   as savour of religion (see Ps. ci. 6), or else, which is more probable,
   such as she had instructed in the true religion, for these maidens were
   appointed her by the eunuch, and were before instructed in court
   fashions, Esther ii. 9; but that did not satisfy. She taketh time to
   instruct them in the knowledge of the true God, and it seemeth in her
   apartment had many opportunities of religious commerce with them in the
   worship of God. Madam, how far you practise these duties it is not
   necessary that I should tell the world. Persevere with cheer fulness,
   and in due time you shall reap if you faint not. The good Lord shed
   abroad the comforts and graces of his Spirit more abundantly into your
   heart, which is the unfeigned desire of him who is, madam, your most
   obliged and respectively [7] observant,

   Tho. Manton.

TO THE READER.

   GOOD READER,--The people of God have ever been exercised with two sorts
   of enemies persecutors and sectaries: it is hard to say which is worst.
   When the Christian church began first to look forth in the world, there
   were adverse powers without ready to crush it, and Libertines who, like
   worms bred within the body, sought to devour the entrails and eat out
   the very bowels of it. The first ringleader was Simon Magus, and there
   followed Menander, Saturninus, Basilides, Carpocrates, Cerinthus,
   Ebion, Cerdo, Marcion, Tatianus, Valentinus, and many others, who,
   being once turned aside from the truth and the fellowship of the
   faithful, lost all awe of God, and were given up to a sottish judgment
   to believe all kinds of fables and fancies. The monsters of Africa came
   from the unnatural commixtures of the beasts running wild in the
   deserts; so when men had once broken through the hedge, mingling their
   own fancies with the word of God, by an unnatural production they
   brought forth such monstrous and absurd opinions.

   In succeeding ages the devil hath often played over the old game,
   sometimes oppressing the church by the tyranny of pseudo-Christians, as
   many martyrs being made by antichristian as pagan persecutions, Rev.
   xiv. 13; at other times corrupting the truth by error, or rendering it
   suspicious by the divisions about it. Heresies revolve as fashions, and
   in the course of a few years antiquated errors revive again, and that
   by their means who did not so much as know them by name.

   When God first called his people out of Babylon by Luther's
   reformation, and the Christian religion began to be restored to its
   pristine purity, there was not only a Roman party to persecute, but a
   fanatical party to perplex the estate of reformation and retard the
   course of the gospel, as histories do abundantly declare, especially
   Sleidan in his Commentaries.

   What hath been our late experience we all know, and have cause to
   bewail: as soon as we were freed from our hard taskmasters, and a door
   of hope began to be opened to us, a swarm of Libertines have arisen
   among us, and do every day increase in number, power, and malice, and
   under various forms oppugn the unquestionable interests of Jesus
   Christ, to the great scandal of reformation, and the saddening of the
   hearts of the godly. We seem to be ripe for a judgment, but from what
   corner the storm shall blow we cannot tell; some fear a return of
   popery, and that a second deluge of antichristianism shall overwhelm
   the western churches. The Papists, I confess, are dangerous, but the
   great and next fear I think to be from Libertines and a yokeless
   generation of men, who are most reproachful to religion and most
   troublesome.

   The spirit and drift of this epistle is carried out mainly against this
   fanatical and libertine party, and therefore I suppose it to be a
   mistake in Dr Willet, Mr Perkins, and others, when they would turn the
   edge of it against the Papists. I confess they had a temptation that
   way, these being the only heretical party with whom the church of God
   was then in suit, and symbolising in many things with those of the
   other extreme, as usually darkness and darkness doth better agree than
   light and darkness; but certainly the party described here are not a
   domineering faction, that carry things by power and greatness and
   height of natural abilities, as the Papists do, but a creeping party,
   such as by sordid and clancular ways seek to undermine the truth, a
   kind of mean and loose sort of people, that vented monstrous and gross
   conceits, chiefly out of envy, against those that excelled in gifts and
   place; and if our modern Ranters, Familists, Quakers, be not here
   described in their lively colours (as if the apostle had lived to hear
   their blasphemous expressions and that contempt which they cast upon
   the officers of the church), I confess then I understand no thing of
   the whole epistle. If the judicious reader let alone the larger
   discussion of the observations, and go but over the explications of
   each verse, he will soon find my observation true.

   What I have done, through grace, to the clearer understanding of the
   apostle's scope, and the larger explanation of the common-places here
   offered, I shall not mention, but leave to the reader's judgment. Some
   will blame me for being too large, and others in many places for being
   too short. I shall only let the first sort know that in the larger
   explications of points of doctrine I have rather satisfied the desires
   of others than followed my own judgment, who, when these things were
   first delivered (which was long since) in the way of short notes, were
   willing to hear the points more largely debated, and so I went over
   them again in a sermon-fashion. If any blame me for being too short,
   let them know that therein I have more satisfied myself, as keeping to
   the laws of an expository exercise. I confess I am so conscious to the
   many imperfections of this work, that the reader had never been
   troubled with it had it not been extorted from me by such importunity
   as I could not withstand: especially did I judge the publication
   needless, the elaborate commentary of my reverend brother, Mr William
   Jenkyns, being already printed; but when I saw that we went different
   ways in prosecuting the same truth, that objection ceased. Seasonable
   things must be often urged, and the variety of method maketh the
   repetition grateful. I observe God's providence in it, when divers men
   fall upon the same work, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses
   every truth might be established. Beza, I remember, persuadeth Olevian
   to print his meditations on the Galatians, though many excellent
   writers had but lately and diligently explained that epistle. Dr King,
   Dr Abbot, and Dr Benefield all wrote upon Jonah, and with approbation,
   near about the same time. As much as my occasions would permit me, I
   consulted with my reverend brother's book, and when I found any point
   at large discussed by him, I either omitted it or mentioned it very
   briefly, so that his labours will be necessary to supply the weaknesses
   of mine.

   This work hath been long in the press, and no wonder, the author lying
   under such an oppression of business, it being carried on by snatches
   and spare hours. Many faults have been occasioned, whether by the
   obscurity of the copy or the negligence of the printer I will not now
   determine. Surely I have had to do with those that learned how to make
   a pitcher in a tub, or else they would never have so pitifully mangled
   the Greek and Latin sentences that in some places they are scarce
   intelligible. I have added the errata in the end, which must be
   consulted with, or else the reader will hardly find sense, [8] and in
   some places not true doctrine. The tables I have collected with some
   diligence, the one of scriptures, which are either vindicated or
   largely illustrated in this commentary, the other of the principal
   matters, especially the common-places here discussed. If by all thou
   findest any help in the way of thy heavenly calling, bless God, and
   forget not to put up one prayer for the meanest of the Lord's servants,

   Tho. Manton.

AN EXPOSITION, WITH NOTES,

    UPON THE

EPISTLE OF JUDE.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that
   are sanctified by God the Father, preserved in Jesus Christ, and
   called.--Ver. 1.

   THIS epistle, as others, beginneth with usual Christian salutations;
   these are continued through the two first verses, in which you have:

   1. The person saluting, Jude, the author of the epistle.

   2. The persons saluted, the believers of that age.

   3. The form of salutation, ver. 2, mercy, and peace, and love be
   multiplied.

   This first verse presenteth us with the two first circumstances, the
   saluter and the saluted. (1.) The saluter is described by his name,
   Judas; his office and condition of life, the servant of Jesus Christ;
   by his kindred and relation, and brother of James. (2.) The saluted,
   they are described--(1st.) By their condition, kle'tois, called, that
   is to read first, as Beza. (2d.) By the effects and manifestations of
   it, which are two: First, sanctified by God the Father; secondly,
   preserved in Jesus Christ. These are the parts: I shall explain them
   branch by branch in the order propounded, with practical hints from
   each, which I shall handle in no fuller latitude than the present text
   will allow.

   1. The saluter, and there his name, Judas,' called also Thaddeus,' Mat.
   x. 3, and Lebbaeus;' these several names implying the same thing, and
   were given him either by the people or the disciples, partly to
   distinguish him from Judas the apostate, partly to note his constancy
   in confessing and praising God; for so it signifieth, as you may see,
   Gen. xxix. 35, Now Leah said, I will praise the Lord, therefore she
   called his name Judah.'

   Obs. Divers note hence--(1.) That Christian names should be
   significant, such as may remember us of duty. (2.) That it is lawful to
   divulge or conceal our names in our writings, according as it may make
   for the glory of God to do either the one or the other. Jude mentioneth
   his name, but Paul doth not, or whosoever was the author of the Epistle
   to the Hebrews. (3.) That godly men and wicked may both be called by
   the same name; so Judas the apostle and Judas the apostate; there was
   Enoch, Cain's son, Gen. iv. 17, and Enoch, Seth's son, of the church
   line, that walked with God,' Gen. v. 22. But to mention these things is
   more than enough; the next circumstance will afford us more.

   2. His office and condition, the servant of Jesus Christ.' It is a
   thing usual with the apostles to prefix this among other their honorary
   titles; as Rom. i. 1, Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ;' so Phil. i. 1.
   The greatest honour that he would put upon himself and Timothy was
   this, Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ.' This term, a
   servant of God or Christ, in the use of scripture, is several ways
   applied. (1.) It may be understood of any kind of subserviency to God's
   will and secret counsels, or instrumentality in the execution of his
   decrees; so wicked men may be said to be God's servants, so far forth
   as he serveth his designs of their endeavours; as Cyrus was God's
   servant, because he should perform all his pleasure; so Nebuchadnezzar,
   Jer. xxvii. 6, These things have I given into the hands of
   Nebuchadnezzar, my servant,' (2.) It noteth a pious care to perform
   God's revealed will; they that out of a sense of his love resign up
   themselves to do his will are called his servants: so he that is called
   in the Lord,' whether he be bond or free, is said to be Christ's
   servant,' 1 Cor. vii. 22. So godly masters are said to have the Lord
   for their master: Eph. vi. 9, Knowing that your master is also in
   heaven,' In the former place he saith a servant is God's freeman; and
   here, that a master is God's servant. (3.) It noteth designation to any
   public office for God's glory; those that do more eminently or more
   nearly serve God in some peculiar office are called his servants; as
   magistrates: Rom. xiii. 4, He is the minister of God for thy good;' and
   ver. 6, God's ministers attending continually for this thing.' But yet
   more especially they are called ministers and servants who sustain the
   public offices of the church; as 2 Tim. ii. 24, The servant of the Lord
   must not strive, but be gentle to all men, apt to teach, patient,'
   meaning one employed in the public ministry. So the priests of the Old
   Testament were called the Lord's servants; as Ps. cxxxiv. 1, Behold,
   bless ye the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord, which by night stand in
   the house of the Lord.' He speaketh to the priests that were to watch
   in the temple; and in this sense it is said, Amos iii. 7, I have sent
   my servants the prophets.' But now among these ministers and officers
   of the church the prophets and apostles are styled so by way of
   eminency. Yea, yet further, Christ, because of his office of Mediator,
   which is the highest office, and proper to the head of the church, is
   called God's servant; as Isa. xlix. 3, Thou art my servant;' and Isa.
   liii. 11, By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many.' To
   apply all now to the case in hand: Jude is called a servant of Jesus
   Christ,' not only as one that had given up himself to do his will as a
   Christian, but as an apostle. [9] Let us now observe something hence.

   Obs. 1. Observe, first, that Jude placeth his service among his titles.
   He might have urged other things to render himself honourable to the
   world, but he doth not stand upon those things; it is enough for him to
   say, Jude, a servant.' As Jude, the Lord's cousin, calleth himself his
   servant, so doth Mary, the Lord's mother, style herself his handmaid:
   Luke i. 38, Behold the handmaid of the Lord.' And the apostles
   generally urge it as one of the fairest flowers in their gar land, the
   honour of being Christ's servants; yea, Christ himself counteth it no
   dishonour to be styled God's servant. The meanest offices about princes
   are accounted honourable; to be a groom there is better than to be a
   lord elsewhere. Servire Deo regnare est--it is royal and kingly to be
   God's servant; indeed, every servant there is a king, 1 Peter ii. 9,
   Rev. i. 6; as Zeba and Zalmunna said of Gideon's brethren, They each
   one resembled the children of a king,' so all these are spiritual
   kings, that live the noblest and freest life in the world. And as we
   have a glorious master, so consider your fellow-servants, the glorified
   saints and we make but one family, Eph. iii. 15. And the angels
   themselves are called his ministers: Ps. ciii. 21, Ye ministers of his
   that do his pleasure;' they are a part of God's attendance, and wait
   upon their master's person. When we have such fellow-servants, we
   should not count our work a slavery and baseness; it can be no
   disparagement to us to be in the same rank and order with the angels
   and saints departed. Well, then, learn to value the honour that you
   have by Christ's service; as that emperor counted it a greater
   privilege to be a member of the church than head of the empire. Look
   upon duty as an honour, and service as a privilege: honorabilia legis,
   Hosea viii. 12, so the Vulgar. And if ever you be put to your choice,
   either to enjoy the greatest outward honours, or to serve Christ with
   disgrace, choose the latter. Moses refused to be called the son of
   Pharaoh's daughter when he came to age,' Heb. xi. 24. 25. Galeacius
   Carraciolus left the honour of his marquisate for an obscure life and
   the gospel at Geneva. Indignities and dishonours done you in the way of
   duty are honours; reproaches for Christ's sake' are treasure, Heb. xi.
   26. One of Paul's honorary titles is, Paul, a prisoner of Jesus
   Christ,' Philem. 1; and elsewhere he holdeth up his chain in a kind of
   triumph: For the hope of Israel am I bound with this chain,' Acts
   xxviii. 20. Whatever befalleth us in and for our service to Christ, be
   it never so disgraceful, it is rather a mark of honour than a brand of
   shame.

   Obs. 2. Observe, again, his relation to Christ is expressed by service;
   as he describeth himself to be James's brother, so Christ's servant; by
   that means he was entitled to Christ; if we would be Christ's we must
   do his will: our relation ariseth from service, John xii. 26. Therefore
   I shall here take occasion to show you what it is to be Christ's
   servants. (1.) Whoever is Christ's servant must resign and give up
   himself wholly to the will of Christ; for he that is Christ's servant,
   he is so by covenant and consecration. We are indeed Christ's by all
   kind of rights and titles; he made us, and not we ourselves;' no
   creature is of itself, and therefore it is not its own, but another's.
   It is God's prerogative alone to love himself and seek himself, because
   he alone is without obligation and dependence; but we owe ourselves to
   him, and therefore cannot without robbery call ourselves our own. Your
   tongues are not your own to speak what you please, Ps. xii. 4, nor your
   hearts your own to think what you please, nor your hands your own to do
   what you please; by virtue of your creation you are another's, and are
   bound to live and act for another, according to his will, for his
   glory. But this is not all; by redemption you are Christ's: Ye are
   bought with a price,' 1 Cor. vi. 20, as the redeemed are bound to serve
   him that ransomed them. If a man had bought another out of captivity,
   or he had sold himself, all his strength or service belonged to the
   buyer. Christ hath bought us from the worst slavery, and with the
   greatest price; no thraldom so bad as bondage to sin and Satan, no
   prison so black as hell; and certainly Christ's blood is better than a
   little money. So that to live as if we were at our own disposal is to
   defraud Christ of his purchase. Thus we are Christ's by creation and
   redemption; but now, if we would be his servants, we must be his by
   voluntary contract and spiritual resignation: Yield up yourselves,'
   &c., Rom. vi. 13. Christ loveth to have his right and title established
   by our own consent. We take Christ for lord and master, and give up
   ourselves to him, that we may be no longer at our own disposal, and
   therefore it is not only robbery, but treachery and breach of covenant
   to seek ourselves in anything. This resignation must be made out of a
   sense of Christ's love to us in his death and sufferings: 2 Cor. v. 15,
   Christ died, that they which live should not henceforth live to
   themselves, but unto him that died for them.' We enter upon other
   services out of hopes, but we enter upon Christ's service out of
   thankfulness. Again, this resignation must be universal, without
   reservation of any part. You must have no other master but God: Mat.
   vi. 24, Ye cannot serve two masters, ye cannot serve God and mammon.'
   Usually men divide themselves between God and the world; they would
   give their consciences to Christ, and their hearts to mammon. The devil
   pleadeth for a part, for by that means he knoweth that the whole will
   fall to his share; therefore all, the whole man, in vow, purpose, and
   resolution, must be given up to God. (2.) Having given up yourselves to
   God's service, you must walk as his servants; that is, not as you list,
   but as the master pleaseth. The angels are God's ministers, doing his
   pleasure,' Ps. ciii. 21. A servant hath no will of his own, but hath
   given up his liberty to the directions and commands of another;
   therefore, if you be God's servants, you must earnestly desire the
   knowledge of his will, and readily comply with it; you must not do
   things as they please self and flesh, but as they please God. David
   beggeth for knowledge as God's servant: Ps. cxix. 125, I am thy
   servant, grant me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.' A
   faithful servant would not willingly offend his master, and therefore
   would fain know what is his will. They plead with God, and search
   themselves, Rom. xii. 2, and all to know his pleasure; and not only to
   know it, but to do it, otherwise they are worthy of many stripes by
   Christ's own sentence. The master's will should be motive enough, 1
   Thes. iv. 3, v. 13; 1 Peter ii. 15. If God will have it so if Jesus
   Christ will have it so, it is enough to a faithful servant. I he very
   signification of God's will carrieth with it reason enough to enforce
   the practice of it. Yea, you must equally comply with every will of
   God, not only with the easy and pleasant ways of obedience, but such as
   cross lusts and interests. When two men go together, a man cannot tell
   whom the servant followeth till they part. When God and our lusts or
   our interests command contrary things, then you are put to the trial
   whether you are God's servants.

   Obs. 3. Again, observe from the proper acception of the phrase, as it
   is applied to those that stand before the Lord in some special office
   and ministration; as to the apostles, and by consequence to the
   ministers of the gospel. The note is, that ministers are servants of
   Jesus Christ; Paul a servant, and Jude a servant. We are to deal
   between God and the soul, factors for heaven. There is many a good
   inference may be collected from this notion. I shall refer all to two
   heads, the ministers' duty and the people's. (1.) It hinteth duty to
   ministers; it teacheth us diligence in our Lord's work, for we are
   servants, and must give an account, Heb. xiii. 17, what good we have
   done in our places, how we have employed our parts, improved our
   interests, for his glory: Mat. xxv. 19, After a long time the lord of
   those servants cometh and reckoneth with them.' We are entrusted with
   the talent of gifts, with the talent of office and authority in the
   church; now God will see what we have done for his glory, whether we
   have beaten our fellow-servants, or helped them in the way of
   salvation; whether our pound hath been hidden in a napkin, or laid out
   for the gain of souls. Again, it hinteth faithfulness. We are not to
   trade for ourselves, and to drive on our own designs of credit and
   advantage; we are servants, employed for the master's uses: Gal. i. 10,
   Do I yet please men? If I pleased men, I should not be the servant of
   Christ.' A man that sets up for himself is to trade for himself; but
   all that a servant doth should be for his master's honour and profit.
   (2.) It hinteth duty to the people. Regard ministers as servants of
   Christ, that you may give their persons all due honour. Consider, God
   hath retained them as for a nearer service to himself: 1 Cor. iv. 1,
   Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards
   of the mysteries of the gospel.' The world counteth the calling
   probrosum artificium, a sordid artifice and way of living, whereby men
   set their tongues and parts to sale, and think that of all callings
   this can best be spared, therefore it is high time to assert the
   dignity of the office. Men should not think so basely of those who are
   Christ's servants, not only to do his business, but to wait upon his
   person, his special attendants; nay, ambassadors, that impersonate and
   represent their Master, 2 Cor. v. 20. Again, bear our doctrine with
   meekness and patience; we are but servants. If the message which we
   bring be displeasing, remember it is the will of our master; it is not
   in our power to comply with your lusts and humours, if the scripture
   doth not. As God said to Jeremiah, Jer. xv. 19, Let them return unto
   thee, but return not thou to them.' So you should comply with the word;
   we cannot comply with you. The false prophets returned to the people,
   complied with their humours. We must deliver our message, pardon to
   whom pardon, terror to whom terror is due: servants must be faithful.
   Thus must you look upon them as servants, yet but as servants, that you
   may not fondly idolise their persons: What is Paul and Apollos, but
   ministers by whom ye believe?' 1 Cor. iii. 5. It is the old way of
   flesh and blood to sacrifice to the next hand. And that you may know to
   whom to go for the fruit of the ordinance, when we have done our work,
   there is one that cometh after us who is mightier than we,' Mat. iii.
   11, who giveth the increase' to what we have planted and watered,' 1
   Cor. iii. 6.

   3. The author of the epistle is described by his kindred and relation,
   and brother of James. There were two in the college of the apostles of
   that name, James of Zebedee, and James the son of Alpheus,' who was
   also called the brother of the Lord,' that is, his cousin-german, who
   is the person intended, for Jude was his brother, as Mat. xiii. 55, Is
   not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and
   Simon, and Judas?' Now this clause is added, partly to distinguish him
   from the other Judas, called Iscariot, who betrayed our Lord.

   Obs. It is good to prevent all visible scandals and exceptions against
   our persons. I observe this, because the scripture doth elsewhere: John
   xiv. 22, Judas saith unto him, not Iscariat, How is it that thou wilt
   manifest thyself to us, and not unto the world?' The scripture would
   not have you mistake him that said so. Men drink less freely of a
   suspected fountain. Partly because this would make the epistle the more
   welcome. James was of great credit and repute, reckoned by Paul among
   the pillars,' Gal. ii. 9. From whence observe:--

   Obs. 1. That it is lawful to use the credit of others, for the
   advantage of the truth. In the 15th of the Acts, the apostles might
   have deter mined the case by their own infallible spirit, but for the
   greater credit sake they take in the consent of others: ver. 23, The
   apostles, and elders, and brethren,' &c. Paul, dealing with heathens,
   quoteth the sayings of their own writers in divers places, which may
   justify the unaffected use of sentences and passages out of the ancient
   writers of the church. It is good to bait the naked hook of truth
   sometimes with the advantage of carnal credit. Again, observe:--

   Obs. 2. That we should walk so that we may be an honour to our
   relations. This is one of Jude's titles, the brother of James.' He took
   it for an honour to. be related to so eminent an apostle. Worthy men
   reflect a credit upon their families. To be brother, father, son, to
   such as have deserved well of the church, is no mean honour and
   engagement to virtue. Well, then, live so that you may not disgrace
   your lineage; and you that come of worthy ancestors, walk answerably to
   the dignity of your extraction. The images of your progenitors are not
   more sullied with dust, and smoke, and age, than they are with your
   vices. The Spirit of God brands a degenerate issue for walking unworthy
   their birth and the privileges of their blood, 1 Chron. iv. 22, 23.
   Vide Junium et alios in locum. So much for the saluter.

   Let us now come to the saluted; they are described by their condition,
   called; by the effects and manifestations of it, which are two,
   sanctification and preservation.

   1. Their condition, called, for that both in the construction of the
   words, and the order of nature, is to be read first. There is an
   outward calling, and in that sense Christ speaketh, Mat. xx. 16, Many
   are called, but few are chosen;' that is, outwardly called in the
   invitations of the word; so all wicked men that live within the hearing
   of the gospel; but it seemeth they are only called obiter, by the by,
   as they live among the elect: those are called kata prothesin,
   according to purpose.' Rom. viii. 28. But there is an inward and
   effectual calling, by the persuasion of the Spirit, or the voice of the
   Son of God,' which causeth life, John v. 25. The apostle speaketh here
   of the called according to purpose,' and that by an inward and
   effectual calling. Whence note:--

   Obs. That it is the condition of the people of God to be a called
   people; this is first in their description: see Rom. i. 6, Among whom
   are ye also the called of Jesus Christ.' So the Corinthians are said to
   be saints by calling, 1 Cor. i. 2, and Heb. iii. 1, Holy brethren,
   partakers of the heavenly calling.' Now the saints are a called people,
   first, because all they have and enjoy is from God's calling; a
   Christian is nothing and hath nothing but what God is pleased to work
   in him by his creating word: Calling the things that are not as though
   they were.' Rom. iv. 17. Now God is pleased to work this way, partly to
   give us a warrant, that we may possess our privileges in Christ without
   intrusion and usurpation: No man taketh this honour upon him till he be
   called of God,' Heb. v. This is that they have to show to conscience,
   that we do not presume and usurp; we have a calling so to do. Why dost
   thou, vile wretch, go to God in the name of Christ? How dost thou that
   art a sinner look him in the face, lay hold of Christ, hope for glory?
   Still the call is our warrant and title. If it should be asked of the
   guests that came in a wedding garment, Friends, how durst ye come
   hither, and approach the presence chamber of the king's son? they might
   answer, We were bidden to the wedding, Mat. xxii. So in Mat. xx., Why
   do not you go into the vineyard?' Their answer was, No man hath hired
   us;' they had no calling. Partly to give us encouragement: we need not
   only leave to come to God by Christ, but also quickening and
   encouragement, for we are backward. In other preferments there needeth
   nothing but leave, for there men are forward enough; but here guilt
   maketh us shy of God, and God is forced to call and holloa after us. By
   nature we are not only exiles, but fugitives. Before God banished Adam,
   he first ran away from him, he ran to the bushes, and then God called
   him, Adam, where art thou?' Gen. iii. 9. How often doth God holloa
   after us in the word before we return and come out of the bushes! He
   maketh proclamation, Isa. lv. 1, Ho, every one that thirsteth,' &c. We
   are under spiritual bondage, as the Israelites were in Egypt under
   corporal bondage, and God sendeth again and again, and out of very
   anguish of heart we will not believe him; therefore he calleth and
   crieth, Sinners, where are you? why will you not return unto me? God's
   outward call is managed by men, and therefore it is very hard to
   persuade them to discern the voice of God; as Samuel would not be
   persuaded but that it was Eli called him, when it was the Lord. We
   think it to be the charity of the minister, and will not easily
   acknowledge a call from God, and therefore do not only need leave, but
   encouragement. Partly because God will work in a way suitable to his
   own nature and ours; fortiter et suaviter, strongly like himself, and
   sweetly with respect to us; and therefore he doth not only draw but
   call; not only put forth the power of his Spirit, but exhort and invite
   by the word. The efficacy of divine grace is conveyed this way more
   suitably to the nature of man; there is grace offered in the gospel,
   and the Spirit compelleth to come in. In all the works of God, there is
   some word by which his power is educed and exercised. In the creation,
   Let there be light,' &c. At the resurrection there is a trump, and the
   voice of an archangel, Arise, ye dead, and come to judgment.' In all
   Christ's miraculous cures there are some words used, Be thou clean,'
   and Be thou whole,' and Be thou opened;' and to Lazarus in the grave
   Christ useth words of ministerial excitation, Lazarus, come forth.' So
   in converting a sinner, there is not only a secret power, but a sweet
   call and invitation; some word by which this power is conveyed and
   represented in a way suitable to our capacity. For all these reasons
   doth God work grace by calling.

   Again, God's people are well styled a called people, because they are
   so many ways called: from self to Christ, from sin to holiness, from
   misery to happiness and glory. They are called from self to Christ:
   Mat. xi. 28, Come unto me, all ye that are heavy laden.' The main end
   of a call is to bring Christ and the soul together; every dispensation
   of God hath a voice; and God speaketh to us by conscience, by his
   works, by benefits, by crosses, but chiefly by his word, the
   application of which by the Spirit is, as it were, an awakening call;
   but the chief call of God is by the voice of the gospel, wherein the
   offers of grace are discovered to us: Come, poor wearied soul, come to
   Christ, and thou shalt find ease and comfort. Again, they are called
   from sin to holiness: 1 Thes. iv. 7, God hath not called us to
   uncleanness, but to holiness.' Though the immediate end of divine
   calling be faith, yet the intermediate end is holiness, as the ultimate
   end is glory. Thus we are called out of Babylon into Sion, from the
   tents of Kedar into the tents of Shem, from nature to grace, and the
   power of Satan into the kingdom of God; in short, this call is a
   separation from uncleanness, and all common and vile uses. Again, they
   are called from misery to happiness and glory, from aliens to be
   friends, from darkness to light, 1 Peter ii. 9, from being enemies to
   be reconciled, from bastards to become sons, from vessels of wrath to
   be heirs of glory. With respect to all these sorts of calling it is
   termed sometimes a high calling,' Phil. iii. 14; sometimes a holy
   calling,' 2 Tim. i. 9; and sometimes a heavenly calling,' Heb. iii. 1.
   It is a high calling,' because of the honour and dignity of it; it is
   no small matter to be children of God, John i. 12; co-heirs with
   Christ, Rom. viii. 17; kings and priests to God, Rev. i. 6. Many are
   lifted up because they have borne offices, and are called to high
   places in the world: a Christian hath a calling more excellent, he is
   called to be a saint, a spiritual king, a holy priest to God. It is a
   holy calling,' because of the effect and purpose of it. Man's calling
   may put dignity and honour upon us, but it cannot infuse grace; it may
   change our condition, but not our hearts. It is a heavenly calling'
   because of the author of it, God by his Spirit; and because of the aim
   of it; the grace whereby we are called came from heaven, and its aim
   and tendency is to bring us thither. See 1 Thes. ii. 14; 2 Peter i. 3,
   Called us to glory and virtue,' &c. We are first called to grace, and
   then to heaven; first the sweet voice saith, Come unto me,' and then
   the great voice, Come up hither:' from self, sin, and the world we are
   called off, that we may enjoy God in Christ for evermore. You see the
   reasons, let us apply it now.

   Use 1. First, It serveth to press us to hearken to the Lord's call.
   Many are kept off by vanity and pleasures, others by their own fears.
   To the first sort I shall only represent the danger of neglecting God's
   invitation, and slighting a call: Prov. i. 25, 26, Ye have set at
   nought my counsel, therefore I will laugh at your calamity, and mock
   when your fear cometh.' God's wrath is never more terrible than when it
   is stirred up to avenge the quarrel of abused mercy. Men cannot endure
   that two things should be despised--their anger or their kindness.
   Nebuchadnezzar, when he thought his anger despised, he biddeth them
   heat the furnace seven times hotter; and David, when he thought his
   kindness despised, threatened to cut off from Nabal every one that
   pisseth against the wall.' Certainly the Lord taketh it ill when the
   renewed messages of his love are not regarded; and that is the reason
   why where mercy is most free, God is most quick and severe upon the
   refusal of it: the Lamb's wrath is most terrible, Ps. ii. 10; no fire
   so hot as that which is enkindled by the breath of the despised gospel.
   What a terrible threatening is there in the place alleged! I will laugh
   at their calamity.' It is the greatest happiness when the Lord
   rejoiceth to do us good,' and the greatest misery when he rejoiceth to
   do us evil: God's laughing will certainly be the creatures' mourning.
   Consider, then, what an affront you put upon grace, when every vile
   thing is preferred before it. When the Lord offered Canaan to the
   Israelites, and they preferred Egypt before it, he swore, They should
   not enter into his rest,' Ps. xcv. 11; and those that preferred a yoke
   of oxen, a farm, or marriage, before the king's feast, the king
   protesteth against them, Luke xiv. 24, None of those that were bidden
   shall taste of my supper.' Whoever have glory and grace by Christ, they
   shall have none.

   For the other sort, that are kept off by their own fears, they are wont
   to allege, It is true there is mercy in Christ for sinners, but Christ
   doth not call them. My brethren, what do you look for? an audible voice
   to speak to you, Thou John, thou Thomas, &c.? In the tenders of the
   gospel you are included as well as others, and why will you exclude
   yourselves? If God say sinners, you should subsume and reply, I am
   chief.' I remember it is said, John x. 3, Christ calleth his sheep by
   name, and leadeth them forth.' How doth Christ call them by name? By
   speaking expressly to their case, as if he did strike them upon the
   shoulders, and say; Here is comfort for thee. As at a feast, when there
   is a dish that we affect set upon the table, though all the company be
   free to make use of it, yet we say, Here is a dish for me. So should
   you apply and take to yourselves your own portion; though it be
   propounded generally, yet when God directeth the tongue of his
   messengers to speak so expressly to your case, that is all the calling
   by name which you can look for, since oracles are ceased, and therefore
   you should say, This was a dish provided for my hungry conscience,
   intended to me, &c. But they will reply, Sure there is no mercy for me,
   I am so unworthy. I answer--The invitation taketh no notice of worth,
   but of thirst: Rev. xxii. 17, Let him that is athirst come, and
   whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely.' Thou art not
   worthy, but thou art thirsty, or else whence come these groans? And by
   the way take notice of the pride that is in legal dejection. Men are
   loath to be beholden to Christ; they would be worthy before they will
   come to him; and therefore the apostle useth that expression, ouch
   hupetagesan, Rom. x. 3, They have not submitted to the righteousness of
   God.' A proud creature would fain establish a righteousness in himself,
   and is loath to submit to take all from another; as an outward proud
   man preferreth a russet coat of his own before a silken garment that is
   borrowed or given him by another. But they are such sinners, &c. Ans.
   The more need to come to Christ; he came to call sinners,' Mat. ix. 13.
   It is no matter what thou hast been, but what thou wouldst be; Christ
   doth not call us because we are holy, but that we may be holy. Is it a
   rational plea in outward cases, I am too poor to take alms, I am too
   filthy to go to the water to be washed? But they have stood out against
   so many calls already, and scorned God's counsel. Ans. Wisdom calleth
   scorners, Prov. i. 22, Turn ye scorners; how long will ye delight in
   scorning?' It is a mercy that thou hast one call more; do not increase
   the guilt that thou complainest of. But I know not how to come to
   Christ. Ans. The blind and the lame are invited to the wedding, Mat.
   xxii., and wisdom calleth fools, Prov. ix. 4, Whoso is simple,' &c. The
   stray lamb is brought home upon the shepherd's shoulders, Luke xv. Oh!
   that these words might be spirit and life to you!

   Use 2. Again, it presseth us to make our calling and election sure,' 2
   Peter i. 10; that is, to evidence our election by our calling; for
   calling it is but election put in act. Election is nothing but God's
   love and intention to bestow saving grace upon such and such persons;
   and calling is nothing but the actual manifestation of God's love, or
   the application of saving grace: Rom. viii. 30, Whom he hath
   predestinated, them he called.' Calling is the first and immediate
   fruit of election, by which it springeth forth, and is exercised on the
   vessels of mercy: So 2 Thes. ii. 13, 14, God hath from the beginning
   chosen you to salvation, through the sanctification of the Spirit, and
   the belief of the truth, to the obtaining of the glory of God,
   whereunto he hath called you by my gospel.' Here is the whole method of
   salvation. The first rise and spring of mercy was at election, which
   breaketh out by effectual calling, and so floweth down in the channels
   of faith and holiness, till it lose itself in the ocean of everlasting
   glory. So that by calling, God executeth in time what he decreed before
   all time; and he that is called, may look backward upon eternal
   purposes of grace, and forward upon an eternal possession of glory.
   Well, then, if we would get any assurance of God's favour, or of our
   interest in everlasting glory, the great business we should labour in
   is to clear up our calling; it is the freest and surest discovery of
   God's love, and so fittest to bottom a confidence or assurance. In
   elective love, we have the best view of mercy, and a call is the first
   discovery and copy of it; for it is an act of God, which ariseth merely
   from his choice, preventing and anteceding, not only the merit, but the
   acts and industry of the creature: see 2 Tim. i. 9. Other acts of God's
   bounty follow the acts of the creature, but this is the first motion
   God maketh to the soul; he accepts us when we come, but he called us
   when we did not think of coming. In short, calling is the key of the
   gospel, the plank that is cast out to save a sinking sinner, a sure
   pledge of glory, which is therefore called the high prize of our
   calling,' Phil. iii. 14. Once more, here we have the clearest and most
   sensible experience of the work of grace. After conversion, the work
   may be carried on tacitly, and with more silence; but in calling and
   conversion, as in all changes, the operations of grace are more
   sensible; we may grow insensibly, as a plant doth. The step from sin to
   grace is a work of greater difficulty and power than to go on from
   grace to grace; as the apostle maketh it a matter of more ease to save
   a saint than to gain a sinner, Rom. v. 8-10, and therefore degrees
   cannot be alike sensible as change of state. The apostle, speaking of
   the first conversion of the Thessalonians, he saith, 1 Thes. i. 9, Ye
   know what manner of entering we had unto you.' The first approaches of
   God's power and word to the soul, as they meet with more opposition, so
   they cannot but be more sensible, and leave a greater feeling upon us.
   It were strange if an almighty power should work in us, and we no way
   privy or conscious to it, and all done as in our sleep; to think so
   were to give security a soft pillow whereon to rest, and to suffer men
   to go away with golden dreams, though they feel no change in
   themselves, pleasing themselves with the supposition of imaginary
   grace, wrought without their privity and knowledge. I would not press
   too hard upon any tender conscience. I do foresee the objection that
   may be made, namely, that if calling giveth such a sensible experience
   of the work of grace, how cometh it then to pass that so few of God's
   children have assurance or any sense of their conversion? I
   answer--(1.) It is possible God's power may work in us, and we not be
   sensible of it. There is a difference between our outward and inward
   senses: we may lose our spiritual feeling; and inward sense doth not so
   clearly discern its object, because of the way in which God conveyeth
   His power; it is strong, but sweet; like the influences of the heavens;
   of a great efficacy, but scarce discerned: as there was a great power
   wrought in the Ephesians, but they did not discern it so sufficiently,
   Eph. i. 18, 19. (2.) It is the fault of God's children not to be
   sensible of the power that worketh in them; sometimes it is their
   carelessness, sometimes their peevishness. Their carelessness in not
   observing the approaches of God, and how he worketh and breaketh in
   upon their hearts in the word; so that the time of love is not marked
   when it is present, nor remembered when it is past. As God said of
   Ephraim, Hosea xi. 3, When Ephraim was a child, I taught him to go,
   taking them by the arms, but they knew it not,' that is, did not
   observe it. So God communicateth grace to his people, giveth in help
   and supports, but they observe it not. Sometimes it is peevishness and
   perverseness of judgment: sense of sin, and many weaknesses, like a
   thick cloud, hinder their clear discerning. God hath called them, but
   they will not own and acknowledge it, and so underrate their spiritual
   condition. (3.) God doth not call every one in a like violent and
   sensible manner. Some men's conversion is more gentle and silent;
   whereas, to others, Christ cometh like a strong man armed, and
   snatcheth them out of the fire: some are drawn they know not how, and
   love, by a gentle blast, sweetly and softly bloweth open the door: Ere
   ever I was aware,' &c., Cant. vi. 12. Upon others the Spirit cometh
   like a mighty rushing wind,' and they are carried to Christ, as it
   were, by the gates of hell. As in the natural birth, some children are
   brought forth with more ease, others with greater pains and throes, so
   the new birth in some is without trouble and delay. God opened the
   heart of Lydia,' we read of no more, Acts xvi.; but others are brought
   in with more horror of conscience, extreme sorrow, and desperation. God
   biddeth men put a difference,' Jude 22, 23; so doth God himself. (4.)
   This different dispensation God useth according to his own pleasure; no
   certain rules can be given. Sometimes they that have had good education
   have least terrors, as being restrained from gross sins; sometimes most
   terrors, because they have withstood most means. Sometimes they that
   are called to the greatest services have most terrors, that they may
   speak the more evil of sin, because they have felt the bitterness of
   it; sometimes it is quite otherwise; those that are not called to such
   eminent service drink most deeply of this cup, and taste the very dregs
   of sin, and serve only as monuments of the power of God's anger;
   whereas others are spared, and public work serveth instead of sorrow
   and trouble of conscience. Again, sometimes men and women of the most
   excellent and acute understandings are most troubled, as having the
   clearest apprehensions of the heinousness of sin, and terribleness of
   wrath. Again, at other times it cometh from ignorance, as fears arise
   in the dark, and weak spirits are apt to be terrified: sometimes these
   terrors fall on a strong body, as best able to bear it; sometimes on a
   weak, the devil taking advantage of the weakness of the body to raise
   disturbances in the mind. Many times in hot and fiery natures their
   changes are sudden, and carried on in an extreme way; whereas soft
   natures, whose motions are slower, are gently and by degrees surprised;
   they take impressions of grace insensibly. Thus you see no certain
   rules can be given; only in the general way we may observe, that this
   different dispensation maketh the work of God in calling more or less
   sensible. Those that are brought in by the violent way and roughly,
   must needs be sensible of that omnipotent pull by which their hearts
   are divorced from their corruptions, and can discourse of the time, the
   means, and the manner, and all the circumstances of their calling with
   exactness: as Paul, 2 Cor. xii. 2, I knew a man in Christ fourteen
   years ago,' &c. Now, every one cannot deliver a formal story, nor tell
   you the exact method and successive operations of grace in conversion.
   (5.) Though there be a different dispensation used in calling, yet
   there is enough to distinguish the uncalled from the called; partly
   because though God's call be not discerned in the acts of it, yet it
   may be discerned in the effects of it. Conversion is evident, if not in
   feeling, yet in fruit. Many works of nature are for the convoy of them
   insensible, but the effects appear: Eccles. xi. 5, We know not the way
   of the spirit, nor how the bones grow in the womb.' We know not the
   manner, point of time, but yet the birth followeth. They are not
   Christ's that neither know how they are called, nor can give any proof
   that they are called. The blind man, John ix., when they asked him, How
   did he come to open thine eyes?' answered, How he did it I cannot tell;
   but this one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, I now see.' Early
   or late the soul will give this testimony, How I got him I cannot tell,
   but I am glad I find he is here. Partly because where conversion and
   calling is carried on more tacitly or silently, there will be something
   felt and found in them; there is at least an anxiousness about their
   everlasting estate. Every soul doth not walk in the region of the
   shadow of death,' but every soul first or last is brought to What shall
   I do? which is usually upon some secret or open sin into which God
   suffereth them to fall against conscience: there will be care, though
   not horror; and solicitousness, though not utter despair. No soul ever
   came to Christ without a load upon his back, though every one be not
   ready, with the jailor, to kill himself for anguish. You will be at a
   loss sometimes; it is easy security that goeth on from the cradle to
   the grave in the same tenor of hope without variation. There will be a
   time when you will smite upon the thigh,' and cry, What shall I do?'
   And as there will be some trouble found in them, so some change; all
   are not converted from profaneness to religion, some from civility to
   religion, from profession to sincerity, from servility to ingenuity.
   Time was when they were careless of communion with God, prayed now and
   then out of custom, had no delight in the Almighty, but now it is
   otherwise. Partly because there is a constant calling, so that first or
   last we shall be sensible of the motions of the Spirit, and the heart's
   answer: to some God speaketh in thunder, to others in a still voice,
   but to all he speaketh; therefore did you ever discern God's calling
   and your answering? Ps. xxvii. 8, The Lord said, Seek ye my face; my
   heart said, Thy face, Lord, will I seek.' There is no gracious heart
   but they are often sensible of such a dialogue between God and the
   soul. This discourse is constant; he speaketh to us by the injection of
   holy motions and the actual excitations of his grace, and we speak to
   him by serious promises and resolutions of obedience. God calleth us
   into his presence often, and the heart echoeth, Lo, I come.'

   Well, now, upon all these considerations labour to get your calling
   evidenced. That will clear up your title to the great privileges of
   grace. By it you may rebuke your doubts and fears. When conscience
   asketh, What have you to do with these comforts, to look upon
   yourselves as objects of God's election, as heirs of glory? you may
   answer, I did not take this honour upon me. I was called of God. But
   you will say, What are the infallible notes and marks of effectual
   calling? I answer--These. I shall contract larger discourses. You may
   know your effectual calling partly by the preparations made for it.
   Though the work itself be done in an instant, and many times when we
   least think of it, yet usually God maketh way for his mighty work. As
   the husbandman harroweth and breaketh the clods before he throweth in
   the seed, so by some preparative conviction God breaketh the heart, and
   maketh it meet to receive grace. Redemption needed no preparation, but
   conversion doth. Look, as Moses brought them to the borders, but Joshua
   led them into the land of Canaan, so usually there is some foregoing
   law work, though we are called properly by the gospel: 2 Thes. ii. 14,
   Called by my gospel.' The law driveth us out of ourselves, but the
   gospel pulleth in the heart to Christ. Look, as in outward generation
   the matter is gradually prepared and disposed, so is the soul for the
   new birth. A man is awakened by the sight of his own wretchedness,
   convinced of sin, and the evil consequences of it; and then the work is
   done by the mild voice of the gospel, Hosea ii. 14; Gal. iii. 1; as
   manna came down in sweet dews. It is God's way to speak terror before
   he speak comfort. Christ showeth the method: John xvi. 8, The Spirit
   shall convince of sin.' The word elenxei is notable. To convince is to
   show a thing to be impossible to be otherwise than we represent it.
   [10] So the Spirit convinceth, and maketh the person yield, and say,
   Certainly I am a sinner, an unbeliever, a very wretch, that hath no
   interest in Christ. This is God's method. We come to some certain issue
   about our being in the state of nature, before we come to some certain
   issue about our being in the state of grace. The soul saith, Surely I
   am stark naught, in a deplored lost condition. Well, then if you had
   always good thoughts of yourselves, or only a slight and general
   knowledge, we are all sinners, &c, you are not prepared. The blind man,
   John ix., could say, I was blind.' Were you ever brought to say, I was
   a wretch, a miserable, forlorn creature out of Christ? This feedeth
   presumption and security, because we never bring the debate to an issue
   concerning our being in either of the states, but content ourselves
   with blind guesses and loose acknowledgments that we are all sinners,
   and Christ must save us, &c. This is not enough; there must be a
   particular and humbling sense of sin. Unworthiness and wretchedness
   felt is the first occasion to bring us to Christ. Never a poor soul
   that taketh sanctuary at the throne of grace but he standeth guilty
   there, Rom. iii. 19; Heb. vi. 18; and in danger of damnation.

   2. Again, the next note or occasion of discovery may be taken from the
   instrument or means by which God hath called us, namely, the word: 2
   Thes. 14, By my gospel.' Oracles and audible voices are not his usual
   course. Some Christians talk of such things, but, to say the least of
   the mistake, they are but the suppositions of an over-troubled fancy,
   delusions which God, who bringeth light out of darkness, may at length
   order for good, and in the wisdom of his providence make use of them to
   bring off his people from their discouragements. [11] But usually God's
   way of calling is by the word, and most usually by the word preached,
   seldom otherwise; for God loveth to own and honour the means of his own
   appointing with a blessing. I suppose scarce an instance can be given
   of any converted by reading or meditation that neglected prophesying
   where it was to be had. I confess the word may not work always in time
   of hearing. There is a notable instance, Cant. v. 6, My soul failed
   when he spake;' or rather, it may be rendered, because of his speech.'
   Now compare it with the time of Christ's visit, ver. 2, 3, Open, my
   sister, my dove,' &c. While Christ was speaking she is careless and
   sluggish, I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on?' You see her
   heart was far from failing then; but when she remembered it afterward,
   then her bowels were troubled. As Peter also was wrought upon by the
   remembrance of Christ's words a great while after they were spoken,
   Mat. xxvi. 75. Thus many times God reviveth old truths, and maketh them
   effectual long after the time of delivery. The word worketh, then,
   either in the hearing or in the remembrance or deep meditation upon it.
   Well now, can you remember such an experience when God called you by
   his word, and spake comfortably to your hearts?' Did he ever move you
   to go aside into the closet, that you might be solitary and serious,
   and consider of your condition? Usually at our first call we are moved
   to go aside, that God and we may confer in private; as Hosea ii. 14,
   God calleth into the wilderness, that he may speak to the heart.' And
   Ezekiel was called into the field,' that God might more freely talk
   with him: Ezek. iii. 22, Arise, go forth into the plain, that there I
   may talk with thee.' So Cant. vii. 11, Come, my beloved, let us go
   forth into the fields,' &c. Usually his first motions are to go aside
   and consider. Christ is bashful before acquaintance, and doth not speak
   to us in company, but in private. Did he ever thus invite you into
   secret places? did he ever call thee by name, speak so expressly to thy
   case, as if he had said, Here is mercy for thee, comfort for thee; here
   is thy portion? First or last God's children have such experiences.
   There is a time of loves,' Ezek. xvi. 6, 7, which they cannot forget;
   at least a time wherein the master of the assemblies' fastened a nail
   in their hearts. God's people are wont to talk how seasonably and yet
   how strangely providence cast them upon such opportunities; as David,
   Ps. cxix. 93, I shall never forget thy precepts, for by them thou hast
   quickened me.' Oh! I shall never forget such an ordinance, such a
   sermon, wherein the Lord was pleased to take notice of me, and to speak
   to my heart. Weak impressions are soon razed out, but powerful effects
   of the word leave a durable mark and character that cannot be defaced.

   3. The next mark may be taken from the formal answer or correspondent
   act of the creature to the call of God, for that is it which sealeth
   our election; for otherwise many be called,' but they are not chosen,'
   unless the heart be prevailed with to obey the call. Yea, the notion of
   vocation in its full latitude implieth not only God's act, but ours,
   our answer to his call: Christ's sheep hear his voice.' When Christ
   saith, Mary,' she answereth, Rabboni,' my Lord, John xx. 16. God's call
   is the offer of grace, our answer is the accepting of grace offered;
   there must be receiving as well as offering; vocation is not effectual
   unless it end in union; it is receiving that giveth us interest, John
   i. 12. The scriptures do everywhere imply and signify this answerable
   act of the creature to the call of God. God saith, Seek ye my face,'
   and the soul, like a quick echo, Thy face, Lord, will I seek,' Ps.
   xxvii. 8. So Jer. iii. 22, Return, ye backsliding children, and I will
   heal you;' and then, Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord
   our God.' The soul is enabled to do that which it is exhorted to do.
   God saith, Come to Christ, and the soul saith, Lord, I come. Well,
   then, is the call obeyed? do you receive Christ for your Lord and
   Saviour? The proper answer of the call is the consent and full purpose
   of the heart to take Christ; for offering is the call, and receiving is
   the answer. Have you subscribed and consented to take Christ upon his
   own terms? as the prophet, when he was to take a wife, maketh an offer,
   Hosea iii., I will be for thee, and thou shalt be for me.' Are you
   content? Christ will be for you in all his graces, merits, benefits, if
   you will be for him in all your motions, tendencies, aims. Alas! your
   hearts know that you are for yourselves, lusts, interests, &c.

   4. Again, you may know your calling by the concomitant dispositions of
   the soul that go along with such a return and answer. Wherever Christ
   is received, he is received with worthy and suitable affections; these
   are most notable:--(1.) Godly sorrow: Jer. xxxi. 9, They shall come
   with weeping and supplication, and I will lead them.' It is spoken of
   the Jews' conversion; when God cometh to lead them, they shall bewail
   their hardness of heart and unbelief. Such kind of workings there are
   in the heart of every returning sinner; as, that God should look upon
   such a worthless creature as I am, that have all this while gainsayed
   and stood out many an invitation! that ever God should care for such a
   vile and stubborn wretch! seek to reclaim such a wayward heart! Usually
   there are such mournful and self-humbling reflections that get the
   start of faith and comfort, and do more sensibly bewray themselves.
   Never did any child of God get home to him, but smiting on the thigh,
   Jer. xxxi. 18, and complaining of themselves before they could take
   comfort in God. (2.) Holy wonder, which ariseth from comparing their
   own wretchedness with God's rich mercy in Christ; and therefore the
   apostle saith, 1 Peter ii. 9, Who hath called us out of darkness into
   his marvellous light;' implying that God's grace is most wonderful at
   first conversion, as light is to a man that cometh out of a dungeon;
   woful darkness maketh it marvellous light. In this change there is
   nothing but what is wonderful; both the sweetness and the power of that
   grace by which it is wrought. The sweetness of grace: When God came to
   offer Abraham the grace of the covenant, he fell upon his face, Gen.
   xvii. 3, in a humble adoration and reverence. The power of grace: If
   Peter wondered at his deliverance by the angel out of that strong
   prison, we have much more cause to wonder that the yoke is broken, and
   that we are set free by Christ; the sweet effects of this grace cause
   wonder: The peace of God, which passeth all understanding,' &c. (3.) A
   free resolution and confidence; come whatever cometh, they will obey
   God; as Abraham, being called, obeyed God, not knowing whither he
   went,' Heb. xi. 8. So when they have a warrant, they will make
   adventures of faith, though they know not the success; as Peter would
   cast out the net at Christ's command, though there were little
   likelihood of taking fish: Howbeit at thy command,' &c., Luke v. 5. So
   it is unlikely God will receive me to grace, yet I will adventure; I
   know not what will come of it. Where faith is sensible of a command, it
   doth not dispute a duty, but accomplish it. The Spirit speaketh to the
   soul as the disciples did to the blind man, Mark x. 49, Be of good
   comfort; rise, because the master calleth thee.' I instance in these
   dispositions because they are most sensible.

   5. It may be evidenced by the fruits and effects of a call; the call
   inferreth a change of the former estate, both in heart and life.

   [1.] There will be a change in the whole heart. In the mind and
   judgment; there the activity of the new nature is first discovered:
   Eph. iv. 23, Renewed in the spirit of the mind;' in that which is most
   intimate and excellent there. In our discourse and reason; all the
   discourses, debates, purposes, and cares of the soul will be to please
   God. The mind is made a forge for holy uses, wherein to debate and
   contrive how to carry on the work of grace, how to glorify God in our
   relations, concernments; certainly this will be found in all those that
   are called and converted. So in the will and affections there will be a
   constant inclination towards God as the chiefest good: Ps. cxix. 57,
   Thou art my portion, Lord; I have said that I will keep thy words.' The
   soul is resolved; there is a decree issued forth in that behalf to
   dedicate itself to God and his will. This is the great difference
   between men and men in fixing their chiefest good and utmost end. The
   soul, finding comfort in God, setteth the whole bent of her endeavours
   towards him. So for the other affections which attend upon the other
   act of the will, aversion and loathing; a soul that is called and
   converted hateth sin, its own beloved sin, as the greatest evil: Hosea
   xiv. 8, What have I any more to do with idols?' Isa. xxx. 22, Thou
   shalt say to it as to an abominable rag, Get thee hence.' A keen
   displicency and hearty indignation is kindled in the soul against sin:
   when God changeth a soul, he putteth a disposition into it somewhat
   like his own nature. God cannot abide sin, and a sanctified heart
   cannot abide it; Get thou hence,' &c.; the new life hath an antipathy
   to that which is contrary to it.

   [2.] In the life there will be a change; men will walk worthy their
   calling, not disgracing it by scandals or unseemly practices: Eph. iv.
   1, I beseech you, brethren, walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye
   are called;' that is, suitable to the purity, suitable to the dignity
   of it. When David was a shepherd, he thought of nothing else but
   keeping his father's sheep; but when God called him to be a shepherd of
   the people, then he had other projects, and was of other manner of
   behaviour. A new calling requireth a new conversation: so 1 Thes. ii.
   12, Walk worthy of God, who hath called you to his kingdom and his
   glory.' The divine calling puts an honour upon you: it is not for
   princes to embrace the dung,' nor for eagles to catch flies; to be
   vain, voluptuous, carnal, and worldly, as others are: you are called to
   the fellowship of saints and angels; will it become one of your hopes
   to drive on such a low design as a worldly interest? If you saw a man
   labouring in filthy ditches, and soiling himself as poor men do, would
   you believe that he were heir-apparent to a crown, called to inherit a
   kingdom? Who will believe your calling when you stick in the mud of
   pleasures, and are carried on with such a zealous respect after secular
   interests? The apostle reproveth the Corinthians for walking as men,' 1
   Cor. iii. 3. Some walk as beasts, others are of a more civil strain;
   but this is but as men: you should walk more sublimely, above the
   ordinary rate of flesh and blood. When Antigonus was going into the
   house of a harlot, one told him, Thou art a king's son. Oh! remember
   your dignity, and walk worthy of your high calling; walk as having the
   world under your feet, with a holy scorn and contempt of sublunary
   enjoyments. And as you should walk worthy of the dignity of your
   calling, so of the purity of it: He that hath called you is holy,' 1
   Peter i. 15; and your condition is a holy calling,' 2 Tim. i. 9; and
   the end of your calling is holiness: 1 Thes. iv. 7, God hath called us
   unto holiness.' All which are so many engagements to urge us to the
   more care. A filthy, loose conversation will never suit with this
   calling; you are a shame and a stain to him that calleth you if you
   walk thus: as some in the prophet are said to pollute God, Ezek. xxxi.
   9, namely, as their pollutions were retorted upon God.

   Let us now come to the manifestations and effects of this calling; and
   the first effect mentioned is sanctification, sanctified in God the
   Father. Where you may note two things:--(1.) The state, sanctified;
   (2.) The author of it, by God the Father.

   1. The state, egiasme'nois, to them which are sanctified;' instead of
   which some copies have, egapeme'nois, beloved by God the Father:' but
   let us keep to our own reading, the other being a mistake, and in few
   Greek copies. The note is:--

   Obs. That God's people, whom he hath called out of the world to
   himself, are a sanctified people. I shall show you--(1.) What it is to
   be sanctified; and then (2.) Why God's called people must be
   sanctified.

   First, What it is to be sanctified. There are many acceptions of the
   term; the most famous are two--to sanctify is either to set apart, or
   to cleanse. These two notions will be enough for our purpose, if in
   each of them we suppose both something privative, and something
   positive; as when it signifieth to set apart, you must conceive not
   only a setting apart from common use, but a dedication to holy uses, or
   a setting apart for God, which is the most proper acception of the
   word. So when it signifieth to cleanse, you must not only conceive a
   purgation from filthiness, but a plantation of seeds of grace; not only
   an abolition of natural corruption, but a renovation of God's image. In
   this method let us a little consider the thing in hand.

   1. To sanctify is to set apart and dedicate. Now, God's people are set
   apart by God, Ps. iv. 3, and they dedicate themselves to his use and
   service: 2 Tim. ii. 21, Vessels of honour for the master's use.' They
   are set apart by God both in time and before time. Be fore all time
   they are set apart by God's decree, to be a holy seed to himself in and
   by Christ, separated from the perishing world to be vessels of honour;
   as the reprobate are called vessels of wrath and dishonour;' thus we
   are said to be chosen to be holy,' Eph. i. 4. But then in time they are
   regenerated, and actually set apart. Sanctification is an actual
   election (as before) by which we are set apart from the perishing world
   to act for God, and to seek the things that make for his glory. Thus we
   are called God's first-fruits,' which were the Lord's portion, James i.
   18, and is there made a fruit of regeneration. And thus we are said to
   be a holy priesthood,' 1 Peter ii. 9, the priests being men set apart
   to minister in God's presence. Now, this consecration inferreth a holy
   preciseness and singularity in the godly, that they may keep themselves
   unspotted from the world,' James i. 28, as holy things were to be kept
   from a common use; [12] and it implieth that every sin is a kind of
   sacrilege, it stealeth a holy thing from God. But over and above all
   this, they dedicate themselves, or set apart themselves, by the consent
   of their own vows: Rom. xii. 1, Present yourselves,' &c., as every man
   was to bring his own sacrifice; and for this dedication the Lord
   calleth when he saith, My son, give me thy heart;' because God loveth
   to put the honour upon us of a gift, when it is but a debt; and because
   our voluntary consent to this surrender is a necessary fruit of grace,
   and the immediate effect of his own choice.

   2. To sanctify is to cleanse, together with its positive act, to renew
   and adorn with grace.

   Let us first speak of the privative or cleansing work; this notion is
   necessary to be added to the former. They that are sanctified must not
   only be separated to a holy use, but must also be cleansed: as to
   sanctify signifieth to separate, so there is a difference between them
   and others; and as it signifieth to cleanse, so there is a difference
   between them and themselves. They differ from others, because they are
   a people set apart to act and live for God; they trade for God, eat for
   God, drink for God, more or less, all is for God's glory, 1 Cor. x. 31,
   and so are a distinct company from the men of the world, who are merely
   swayed by their own interests, a company that merely act for themselves
   in all that they do. And then there is a difference between them and
   themselves, for sanctification is the cleansing of a thing that was
   once filthy: 1 Cor. vi. 11, Such were some of you, but now ye are
   washed, but now ye are sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by
   the Spirit of our God;' they are not the same men they were before. We
   all come into the world polluted with the stain of sin, which is purged
   and done away by degrees, and at death wholly, and never before. When
   Christ cometh to bring us to God as the fruits of his purchase, then we
   are without spot and blemish,' Eph. v. 27. The Papists cavil, yea,
   trifle, when they argue from that place, that either we must grant a
   perfection in this life; or a purgation after death, or how else cometh
   the soul to be without spot and blemish? I answer--That place asserts
   the thing to the comfort of the elect, that once they shall get rid of
   the filthy spots of sin; but for the time, most probably in the moment
   of expiring. As the soul in the very moment wherein it is joined to the
   body becometh sinful, so in the moment wherein it leaveth the body it
   is sanctified, and presented by Christ to God; as many pious souls
   breathe out their last with the profession of this hope. Then we shall
   be cleansed indeed; now the work is in fieri, it is a-doing. The work
   of grace for the present consists in rubbing away the old filth, and
   weakening original corruption more and more; [13] as also in washing
   off the new defilement which we contract every day by conversing in the
   world. See John xiii. 10, where our Saviour alludeth to a man that hath
   been bathing himself, but after his return by treading on the ground
   again staineth his feet, and needeth another washing, of his feet at
   least. So by conversing in the world, there are stains and spots
   contracted, which must always be washed off by daily repentance,
   besides our general bathing at first conversion or regeneration, Titus
   iii. 5. I have no more to say to this cleansing work, but only this,
   that it is not merely like the washing off of spots, but like the
   purging of sick matters or ill humours out of the body; it is a work
   done with much reluctation of corrupt nature, and therefore it is
   expressed by subduing our iniquities,' Micah vii. 19. In outward
   filthiness there is no actual resistance, as there is in sin.

   But to speak now of the positive work, or the decking and adorning the
   soul with grace. As the priests under the law, when they came to
   minister before the Lord, were not only washed in the great laver, but
   adorned with gorgeous apparel, so to be sanctified is more than to be
   purified; for besides the expulsion of sin, there is an infusion of
   grace, a disposition wrought clean contrary to what we had before,
   therefore called a new heart and a new spirit;' see Ezek. xxxvi. 25-27;
   from whence also there floweth newness of life and conversation; there
   is a new heart or conformity to God's nature, and a new life or
   conformity to God's will. The pattern of that sanctification which is
   wrought in the heart is God's nature or image, 2 Peter i. 4, Eph. iv.
   24; and the pattern of that sanctification which is wrought in the life
   is God's law or revealed will, 1 Thes. iv. 3; the one is our habitual
   holiness, and the other our actual.

   [1.] For habitual sanctification, or that which is wrought in the
   heart, I observe, that it is thorough but not full; there must be all
   grace, and every faculty must be adorned with grace: [14] 1 Thes. v.
   23, The very God of peace sanctify you wholly: I pray God your whole
   spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless until the coming of Jesus
   Christ.' All of man is made up of spirit, soul, and body; that is the
   theological distinction of the faculties:--the spirit, that is the more
   rational and angelical part of the soul, understanding, conscience,
   will; and then there is soul, the lower part, the more brutish and
   sensual affections and desires; and then body, the outward man, the
   instrument of soul, which needeth to be sanctified, that is, kept in a
   good order and frame, that it may not rebel, or disobey the motions of
   the better part. You see, then, every faculty must be seasoned with the
   new nature; [15] this leaven must get into the whole lump; the mind,
   memory, conscience, will, desires, delights, all must be brought into
   conformity to the image of God. And as every faculty must be
   sanctified, so there must be every grace. In conversion there is
   introduced into the soul a stock of truth, and a frame of grace, called
   in other terms the anointing,' 1 John ii. 27, and the seed of God,' 1
   John iii. 9. There is a stock of truth brought into the understanding
   to season that; not that every one that is regenerate doth actually
   know all truths, but there is a saving light and knowledge of things
   necessary; they see enough to avoid courses of damnation, and to cleave
   to the ways of God: and there is an inquisitiveness after truth, and a
   suitableness to them when they are revealed; they are teachable, though
   actually ignorant; there is something in their hearts that carrieth a
   cognation and proportion to every truth, and claimeth kin of it
   whenever it is revealed. And then there is a frame of grace; for the
   mind is not only enlightened, but the will and affections are
   sanctified, and the heart inclined to choose the ways of God, and to
   obey him whenever occasion is offered. The habits of all grace are
   brought into the heart by regeneration, as original sin containeth the
   seeds and habits of all sin: though there be not explicit workings of
   all graces at that time, yet they are introduced, and make up one
   sincere bent of the soul towards God, called Holiness in truth,' Eph.
   vi. 24. Thus you see the new creature doth not come out maimed; the
   person sanctified hath all the parts of a new man, not one member is
   wanting. But now though this sanctification be thorough, yet it is not
   full and complete for degrees; every part is sanctified, but every part
   is not wholly sanctified. In the most gracious there is a double
   principle--hell and heaven, Adam and Jesus, the flesh and the spirit,
   the law of the members, and the law of the mind. Such a medley and
   composition are we during the present state! We know but in part,' and
   we are sanctified but in part, and there being such a mixture in the
   principles of operation, every action is mixed. It is notable, that
   there is no commendable act in scripture recorded but there is some
   mixture of corruption in it, even in the most heroical exercises and
   discoveries of faith: Moses believeth, and therefore smiteth the rock,
   but he smiteth twice; Sarah believeth the promise, but giveth her maid
   to Abraham; Rebecca was told that the elder should serve the younger,
   and believeth it, but yet she sets Jacob a-work to get the blessing by
   a wile; Rahab saveth the spies, but maketh a lie, &c. Thus is our wine
   mingled with water, our honey with wax, Cant. v. 1, and our silver with
   tin. All the trial is, that the better part prevaileth; and that we are
   still growing and hasting on to perfection, as the morning sun doth to
   high noon, Prov. iv. 18.

   [2.] For actual sanctification, which standeth in a conformity to God's
   will, when the heart is changed so as the life, thoughts, words,
   actions, all are sanctified: there is a spirit of holiness working
   within, and breathing without, in sanctified discourse and holy
   exercises; all the actions savour of grace. Now our actions are
   sanctified and savour of grace when they are performed upon new
   principles and new ends.

   (1.) New principles: Duty swayeth the conscience, and love inclineth
   the heart, 1 Tim. i. 5, The end of the commandment is charity, out of a
   pure heart and good conscience, and faith unfeigned.' No act is
   gracious and an act of pure obedience, unless it have these
   qualifications. It is not the matter that maketh the work good, but the
   principles: all that we do must come from a principle of faith, love,
   and obedience. Obedience respects the command, love the kindness and
   merit of the lawgiver, and faith his bounty and reward: the first
   swayeth the conscience, the second inclineth the heart, and the third
   giveth encouragement. This is to do duties with a gospel frame of
   spirit; obedience takes notice of the laws of God, love of the kindness
   of God, and faith of the rewards of God; and so obedience showeth us
   the matter of the duty, and faith the encouragement; so that whatever
   is done as an act of the new nature or sanctified estate, it is an act
   of obedience, out of gratitude, upon the encouragement of our glorious
   hopes and advantages in Christ. As if it be asked, Why do I do it? God
   hath commanded it, 1 Thes. iv. 3, and v. 18; His will is motive enough;
   God will have it so. Why with such strength of affection and
   earnestness? God hath deserved it, because of his love and bounty in
   Christ, 2 Cor. v. 14, 15; Titus ii. 11-14. Conscience is sensible of
   the obligation, and love and hope sweetens the duty. There is a natural
   conscience of good and evil, which is known by legal aims and carnal
   motives. What is done out of natural conscience is not done out of
   obedience and thankfulness, but out of bondage, and with a servile
   frame of spirit; like fruits that are ripened by art and force, not
   naturally nor kindly.

   (2.) New ends. Here indeed the discovery is most sensible; principles
   are more hidden, and discovered mostly by ends. Now the only end must
   be God's glory. All that is done in the spiritual life, be it an act of
   piety, justice, temperance, or charity, it must be done with this aim,
   that God may be glorified by our obedience to his will: I owe this duty
   to God, and I must do it for God's sake; be it a duty of worship, or in
   your civil relation and traffic; as if I pray, the last end of prayer
   must be God's glory, whether I seek grace and pardon, or the
   conveniences and supports of the present life. Grace still sublimateth
   the intention of the creature, therefore carnal men are taxed for
   praying out of self-interests: Hosea vii. 14, They have not cried unto
   me when they howled upon their beds; they assembled themselves for
   corn, and wine, and oil.' It is but a brutish cry when men seek only
   their own commodity and welfare; as beasts will howl when they are
   sensible of any smart and injury; dogs or any brute beasts may do the
   same; there is no act of grace in it. So in charity, many men make it a
   kind of bargain and traffic; they do it to be seen of men,' Mat. vi. 2,
   to gratify their wordly interests, not to please God or honour God, for
   their credit and repute, to be well thought of; and there Christ saith,
   misthon auton apechousin, that is, they have that which they look for;
   for other things they give God a discharge and acquittance. Briefly,
   the aims of men not regenerate or sanctified are either carnal, or
   natural, or legal. (1st.) Carnal, when men make a market of religion,
   their worship, righteousness, and charity is set to sale, and by a vile
   submission made to stoop to their own private interests; as the
   Pharisees made long prayers to devour widows' houses, that is, to beget
   a fame and repute of honesty, that they might be intrusted with the
   management of their estates. So some may pray to show parts, preach out
   of envy, and to rival others in esteem, Phil. i. 15. Often is this vile
   scorn put upon God, that his worship is made a cover and pretence to
   unclean intents; which is as if a cup of gold, made for a king to drink
   of, should be filled with excrements; or as if we did set up another
   god beside him; for that which we make our utmost end, we make it our
   God; as false teachers are said to make their belly their God,' Phil.
   iii. 19, because all that they did was for belly cheer, to flow in
   abundance of wealth and worldly pleasures, by this means setting up the
   belly, and the concernments of the belly in God's stead. (2d.) There
   are natural ends. It is grace, as I said, that sublimateth the
   intention of the creature. A carnal man can go no higher than self, as
   water cannot ascend beyond its spring. Now all natural men are not
   hypocrites, to put on a pretence of strictness out of design: the
   apostle saith, They do by nature the things contained in the law.' Rom.
   ii. 14; that is, upon the impulses of natural conscience, they avoid
   such sins as nature discovereth, upon such arguments and reasons as
   nature suggesteth. If they worship, it is to satisfy their own
   consciences; if they be strict and temperate, it is not out of reasons
   of obedience, but because the matter of carnal pleasure is gross and
   burdensome, and hindereth the free contemplation of the mind; or
   because these pleasures emasculate and quench their natural bravery,
   and so hinder their reputation in the world. If they be just, it is to
   maintain commerce between man and man; if they be kind in their
   relations, it is for their own peace and quiet; nothing is done as in
   and to the Lord, as the apostle enjoineth, Eph. v. God is neither at
   the beginning nor at the end of any of these actions; the love of God
   is not their spring and rise, nor the glory of God their aim. If they
   pray, there is no intention beyond self, and the welfare of their own
   natures; the matter is but the outward work of the law, ergon nomou,
   Rom. ii. 15, and their aim is but the freedom and welfare of nature.
   (3d.) There are legal ends. When wicked men are most devout, it is but
   to quiet conscience, to satisfy God for their sins by their duties;
   they would fain buy out their peace with heaven at any rate: Micah vi.
   6-8, Wherewith shall I come before him? what shall I give for the sins
   of my soul?' They are devout, charitable, that by diligence in worship,
   and exceeding in charity, they may expiate the offences of a carnal
   life. If peace of conscience were to be purchased with money, they
   would not spare; they would rather part with anything than their
   corruptions, because nothing is so dear to a carnal heart as sin. So
   that you see devout nature is very corrupt and perverse, and therefore
   all its actions are justly hated of God: Prov. xxi. 27, The sacrifice
   of the wicked is an abomination; how much more when he offereth it with
   an evil mind?' that is, to buy an indulgence in other sins, that he may
   sin them freely and with leave from heaven. In short, all their duties
   of worship and charity are performed as a sin-offering, and not as a
   thank-offering; to satisfy God, not to glorify him; usually they are
   extorted from him in a pang of conscience, as a mariner casts out his
   goods in a storm, or a traveller yieldeth his money when beset with
   thieves; there is no true delight in God or in obedience. And thus I
   have showed you what it is to be sanctified in heart and life, which
   was the first thing propounded.

   Secondly, Let me now show why God's called people must be sanctified,
   and that briefly and in few words.

   1. For the honour of God, of every person in the Trinity, Father, Son,
   and Spirit. For the honour of the Father, that his choice may not be
   disparaged: Eph. i. 4, He hath elected us to be holy;' 2 Thes. ii. 14,
   Chosen to the sanctification of the Spirit.' There is some conscience
   in the world that maketh them adore strictness; mere morality hath some
   majesty with it in the eye of nature, but especially gospel holiness;
   whereas looseness is looked upon with scorn and contempt; so that his
   chosen people would be a dishonour to him if they were not sanctified.
   Therefore God the Father aimeth at it in all his dispensations; he
   chooseth us that we may be of a choice spirit. As when Esther was
   chosen out among the virgins, she was purified and decked with
   ornaments, and had garments given her out of the king's wardrobe, so we
   are made holy, being chosen of God. And then he calleth us, that he may
   put this honour upon us in the eye of the world, to make us like
   himself: Be ye holy, as he that hath called us is holy,' 1 Peter i. 15.
   It were monstrous that God should set his affections upon a people
   altogether unlike him; [16] that he should call them to be so near
   himself that continue corrupt and carnal. It is the aim of his
   providences as well as his special grace; we are afflicted that we may
   be partakers of his holiness,' Heb. xii. 10; threshed that our husk may
   fly off. God certainly delighteth not in the afflictions of his people;
   no, he loveth the prosperity of the saints,' Ps. xxxv. 27, but he had
   rather see them in any condition than see them sinful. Again, it is for
   the honour of God the Son, whose members we are. Head and members must
   be all of a piece, like one another. It were monstrous that Christ
   should have such a body as Nebuchadnezzar saw in his dream, where the
   head was of pure gold, and the thighs brass, and the feet iron, &c.;
   and it were an odd sight that a face of Europe should be put upon the
   body of a negro or Ethiopian; and as strange and odd it is that Christ
   should have a disproportioned body, quite unlike himself; yea, it is
   little for his honour that he should be the head of an ulcerous body,
   as well as a monstrous body. So much of sin as you continue, so much
   you disparage your Redeemer and put him to shame; therefore all
   Christ's aim is to make us holy; for that end he redeemed us, that he
   might sanctify us, and make us a glorious church, without spot and
   wrinkle, Eph. v. 26, 27. When Christ was upon the cross, in the height
   of his love, he was devising what he should do for his church to make
   her honourable and glorious, and he pitched upon sanctification as the
   fittest blessing that he could bestow upon us. Every distinct society
   must have some distinct honour and privilege; now Christ had set apart
   the church as a distinct society to himself, and therefore he would not
   bestow upon her pomp and worldly greatness--other societies had enough
   of that--but holiness, grace, which is our splendour and ornament: Ps.
   xciii. 5, Holiness becometh thy house, O Lord, for ever.' And indeed
   this was a far better gift than any outward greatness and excellency
   could be; for moral excellences are far better than civil and natural.
   It is God's own honour to be holy, therefore it is said that he is
   glorious in holiness,' Exod. xv. 11. He is elsewhere said to be rich in
   mercy.' Rom. x. 12; Eph. ii. 4; but here, glorious in holiness.' His
   treasure is his goodness, but that which he accounts his honour is his
   holiness or immaculate purity; as you know among men their wealth is
   distinguished from their honour. But in this gift Christ hath not only
   respect to the excellency of it, but to our need and want. Christ was
   then repairing and making up the ruins of the fall. Now we lost in Adam
   the purity of our natures as well as the favour of God; therefore, that
   the plaster might be as broad as the sore, he would not only reconcile
   us to God, but sanctify us; his blood was not only lu'tron, a price,
   but lou'tron, a laver, wherein to Wash us and make us clean: as under
   the law there was in the tabernacle a great laver as well as an altar,
   to show we must be washed and sanctified as well as reconciled to God;
   and Christ came not only to abolish the guilt of sin, which is against
   our interest, our peace and comfort, but also to destroy the power of
   sin, which is against God's glory. And as this was Christ's aim in
   redemption, so also in the gospel, and all the precious promises of it:
   he died that ordinances might be under a blessing, and conduce to the
   promotion of holiness; for so it is there in Eph. v. 26, That he might
   sanctify us by the washing of water through the word.' There is a
   treasure of grace purchased, and left in the church to be conveyed to
   us by the use of these ordinances. So John xvii. 19, I sanctify myself
   for their sakes, that they may be sanctified through the truth.'
   Whenever we come to the word, or enjoy the use of the seals, we may
   expect to reap the fruits of Christ's purchase. Celsus objected against
   Christianity that it was a sanctuary for villains and men of a
   licentious life. Origen answered him, that it was not a sanctuary to
   nourish them in their evil practices, but an hospital to cure them. As
   under the law all the cities of refuge were cities of Levites and
   schools of instruction, so Christ hath made the church a school wherein
   to learn the trade of holiness; and the word and the seals, and all the
   ordinances, look that way. Lastly, it is for the honour of God the
   Spirit that the called people should be holy, because they are his
   charge, in pupilage to the Holy Ghost, for this end and reason, that
   they may be sanctified. Sanctification is made his personal operation:
   The sanctification of the Spirit,' 2 Thes. ii. 14, and 1 Peter i. 2. He
   is to shape and fashion all the vessels of glory, to deck the spouse of
   Christ with the jewels of the covenant. This is the great advantage
   that we have in the economy and dispensation of grace, that we have God
   to purpose it, God to purchase it, and God to work it; the Father,
   Word, and Spirit, who agree in one, to sanctify the creature and make
   it holy. Now it is a great grief to the Spirit when the work doth not
   go on and prosper in the soul; for he worketh us to this very thing,'
   and is therefore called the Spirit of holiness.' It is not for his
   honour to dwell in defiled temples, and to let the called people go
   naked and without their ornament. Well, then, you see, God, for his
   honour's sake, will have his purposes accomplished for which he chose
   us, and Christ his purchase made good, and the Spirit who is left in
   charge to see all accomplished, he goeth on with the work.

   2. Another reason why we must be sanctified is, because of the hopes to
   which we are called and the happiness which we expect. Now we cannot
   have it unless we be holy: Heb. xii, 14, Without holiness no man shall
   see God.' We are bidden in that verse to follow peace,' but chiefly
   holiness;' for it is not said that without peace no man shall see God.
   [17] Peace may be often broken in the quarrel of truth and holiness,
   and so God's children may be passively men of contention. Ay! but for
   all that they shall see God: but those that are not holy he cannot
   endure their presence, and therefore they shall never see his face, and
   enjoy him hereafter. Usually by a fond abuse we restrain the word
   saints to the saints departed. Ay! but we must be saints here, or else
   we shall never be saints hereafter. I mean true saints; for by another
   abuse the word saints is made matter of pretence in some, and matter of
   scorn by others; but to be saints indeed, that is all the evidence you
   have to show for your interest in your glorious hopes. What should
   others do with heaven that are not saints? How can they see God that
   have not a pure eye? A dusky glass cannot represent the image: the
   degree of vision is according to the degree of sanctification. [18] And
   what should a carnal heart, that knoweth no other heaven but to eat,
   drink, and sleep, and wallow in sensual delights, do with the
   inheritance of the saints in light?' The apostle saith, we must be made
   meet' for such a state, Col. i. 12. The vessels of glory are first
   seasoned with grace. Alas! otherwise carnal men can no more tell what
   to do with heaven than swine with pearls. We do not look for a Turkish
   paradise, but a sinless state; not to bathe our souls in carnal
   pleasures, but to be consorts of the immaculate Lamb. Our hopes engage
   us to holiness: 1 John iii. 3, He that hath this hope purifieth
   himself, as Christ is pure.' If his heart be fastened upon such a hope
   as to see Christ as he is, and to be like him both for temper of soul
   and state of body, certainly he must needs be a holy man; he will be
   practising and trying here upon earth how he can conform to Christ, and
   begin his happiness as well as he can. Certainly he that expecteth that
   his body shall be like to Christ's glorious body,' he will possess his
   vessel in sanctification and in honour.' He cannot use his body, that
   is under so great hopes, merely as a strainer for meats and drinks, and
   a channel for lust to pass through; his mind, that shall see God, he
   cannot fill it with chaff, or suffer it to be occupied with vanity,
   toying thoughts, and vile cares and unworthy projects; and his
   affections, that should cleave to God inseparably, to be prostituted to
   every base object. Thus, with respect to our hopes, we must be
   sanctified; the foundation and seed of glory is laid in grace, and that
   life begun which we must live for ever.

   Use 1. It serveth for conviction. If God's people are a sanctified
   people, then here is but sad news for two sorts of persons. (1.) The
   profane, that care not for holiness; God hath no birthright for such
   Esaus; the portion of the Lord are a holy portion, but these have a
   spot that is not as the spot of his children,' Deut. xxxii. 5. See what
   John speaketh of such persons as wallow in their filthiness: 1 John
   iii. 8, He that committeth sin is of the devil, for the devil sinneth
   from the beginning,' o poion amarti'an, he that tradeth in sin, and
   maketh it his work and business. You may presume that you belong to
   God, but you are of the devil; you have not, indeed, the least pretence
   of a claim, and do not go so far as hypocrites, being so little careful
   to be holy, that you are not moral. Are you called? from what? where is
   the least evidence of it? Ay! but our hearts are better than we show
   for. [19] This is to appeal to a witness that cannot be found; it is
   all one as if a man should claim to another's land, and pretend that he
   hath lost the evidences. Your guilt is written in legible characters,
   that he that runneth may read it. (2.) It convinceth persons that scoff
   at holiness. Scoffing is the overflow of gall and malice, and a black
   mark, let it be found where it will. In the general it argueth a bad
   spirit, but especially when religion is made a byword and a reproach.
   When you deride men for their holiness, you deride them for that which
   is the express image of the glorious God, and so deride God himself.
   Holy brethren, as the saints are styled, Heb. iii. 1, should no more be
   a disgrace than holy Father, as God himself is styled, John xvii. 11.
   You hate God more than you do the saints, if you hate them for their
   holiness, which shineth in them with a faint lustre, but is infinitely
   and originally in God. Take heed of the chair of scorners.' Those are
   dogs that are without, Rev. xxii. 15, that bark at the splendour of
   God's image, that make saints a word of disgrace. Scoffing Ishmaels
   that will be mocking are sure to be cast out, Gen. xxi. 9; they do not
   belong to God. The apostle interprets that mocking to be persecution,
   Gal. iv. 27; so it is in God's account; and yet it is always found in
   those that are born after the flesh,' Profane spirits think religion a
   matter of nothing; and men are wont to mock at those which make a great
   matter of what they account nothing. Oh! remember, holiness is the
   badge of those which are the Lord's called people, and it should be a
   matter of reverence, not reproach.

   Use 2. Again, it serveth for caution, to prevent mistakes. Christians,
   look to your sanctification: Ps. iv. 3, Know that God hath set apart
   him that is godly for himself.' The beast's worshippers have the
   beast's mark, Rev. xiii. 16. So also God's children are stamped with
   his seal and impress: 2 Tim. ii. 19, The foundation of the Lord
   standeth sure, having this seal,' &c., they are sealed with a mark of
   preservation, The Lord knows those that are his;' and they are sealed
   with a mark of distinction, Let every one that nameth the name of God
   depart from iniquity.' As Cain is stamped on both sides, so hath God's
   seal a double motto--one that noteth his owning the saints, the other
   that noteth their temper and disposition; they depart from iniquity.
   Take heed, then, have you this seal and impress? There are many things
   that look like sanctification, but are not. I shall touch upon
   four--civility, formality, restraining grace and temporary grace.

   1. Civility, which is nothing else but a fair demeanour in the world,
   or, in the apostle's expression, a fair show in the flesh,' a darker
   representation of holiness, rather heathenish strictness than
   Christian. You may descry it by these notes:--(1.) It is usually
   accompanied with ignorance, and little knowledge of God's institutions.
   Men live well, are no drunkards, no swearers, but know little of God,
   have no insight in matters of religion; like Nicodemus, a strict
   Pharisee, but grossly ignorant, John iii. 10. Spiritual life beginneth
   with knowledge, and endeth in a rational strictness, and what they do,
   they do upon principles. Conscience is swayed by the acknowledgment of
   God's will. Others live plausibly, but know not the ground and reason
   of their actions, and therefore are soon satisfied; never troubled
   about imperfections, because where there is no light there is not that
   tenderness which is found in real Christians, who look into the purity
   of the law, and are troubled because they know so much of the will of
   God, and do so far come short of it, as in a clear glass the least mote
   is soon espied. (2.) There is little of Christ in such souls; for a man
   that is satisfied with his own righteousness doth not prize Christ.
   Paul, a Pharisee, counted his works gain,' which afterward he found to
   be loss,' Phil. iii. 7. By gain he meaneth an advantage to procure the
   favour of God. Self is wont to take up all their thoughts, and
   therefore moral strains suit more with them than gospel comforts, and
   doctrines that breed faith. The law is more natural to men than the
   gospel, and therefore with those that are of a moral disposition, and
   no more, it findeth better entertainment and welcome than the gospel
   doth. There is no hungering and thirsting' after Christ; they do not
   see the need of the sweetness of his grace, of the help of his Spirit,
   going on in a plausible, moral course, without rub or difficulty.
   Whereas, in the spiritual life, Christ doth all, and every day they see
   more cause to bless God for him, Gal. ii. 20. (3.) Usually there is
   some great prevailing sin. Civility is but a freer slavery; one way or
   another Satan holdeth them captive, and their honesty and fair show to
   the world is but to serve their carnal interests, to hide a lust or
   feed a lust, and most commonly this sin is worldliness. Christ's young
   man, that had kept all those things from his youth,' had great
   possessions,' and they were a great snare to his heart, Mat. xix. 22.
   The sin of the Pharisees was vainglory and ambition. Some morsel there
   is reserved under the tongue, some sin kept with the greater allowance
   from conscience, and the less shame from abroad, because otherwise the
   life is fair and honest. (4.) There is a greater care about actions
   than lusts. Wrath, and pride, and wanton thoughts, are digested,
   because there is no violence and uncleanness in the conversation.
   Civility is all for the carriage, nothing for tempering the affections
   to such an order and moderation as becometh grace. Paul complaineth of
   his lusts, and the law of sin within, Rom. vii.; yea, of such sinful
   workings as do not fall under the cognisance and discovery of the light
   of nature, Rom. vii. 7, the first risings and stirrings of sin
   forbidden in the tenth commandment, the least rebellion of nature. Thus
   for civility.

   2. Formality, or pretended grace: you may be deceived in that; and
   therefore the apostle speaketh Of a true holiness,' en hosioteti tes
   aletheias, Eph. iv. 24, in opposition to that which is feigned and
   counterfeit. Now, false grace is always acted by foreign and external
   considerations; as pupils [20] have not a principle of life within
   them, but are moved by an external force. The hypocrite's principles of
   motion are without him, as carnal respects, self-ends, &c. True grace
   hath an inward propensity to comply with the will of God; there is a
   law upon their bowels;' [21] by-ends work by constraint, and carry the
   soul contrary to its native inclination; a man would not do such a
   thing, were it not for such ends; therefore the apostle saith, 1 Peter
   v, 2, Feed the flock that is among you, not by constraint, but
   willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind.' When a man
   acteth genuinely in a work; his own heart carrieth him to it more than
   all outward encouragements. Again, false grace is shy of God's presence
   and sight: pretences are to deceive men; therefore such persons strive
   to get God out of their thoughts, they know his eye will find them out.
   But now truth of grace is ready to draw everything into God's sight;
   though they tremble to think what defects God can find in them, yet
   they appeal to him for the sincerity of their hearts: John xxi. 17,
   Lord, thou knowest all things, and thou knowest that I love thee.' He
   would not excuse miscarriages; yet, for the general temper and bent of
   his heart, he referreth himself to God's omnisciency. So Job xxxi. 6,
   Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine
   integrity;' and yet elsewhere he saith, Job xlii. 5, 6.' Mine eye seeth
   thee, and therefore I abhor myself in dust and ashes,' in the one place
   he appealeth to God, for he was confident that his integrity would hold
   weight; and yet in the other he could even loathe himself when he
   thought of God, because of so many defects and failings. So David, Ps.
   cxxxix. 23, Search me, O Lord, and know my heart,' &c. No doubt David
   was sensible that God could find enough in him; but Lord, search, see
   if anything be allowed with full leave of conscience. Again, false
   grace doth not grow, unless it be worse and worse. Pretences wither
   rather than thrive: God complaineth, Jer. vii. 24, that they went
   backward rather than forward.' False grace is always declining till it
   be wholly lost; like bad salt, that loseth of its acrimony and
   smartness every day till it be cast to the dunghill. But now true
   grace, from a grain it groweth into a tree, Mat. xiii., from a morning
   glimpse to a perfect noon, Prov. iv. 18, from smoking flax it is blown
   up into a flame. The least meal in the barrel, and oil in the cruse,
   when it is fed with a supply from heaven, shall prosper into abundance.
   Nicodemus, that at first came to Christ by night, after boldly
   declareth himself for him, John xix. 39. Grace gets ground upon the
   flesh, and holiness by degrees advanceth into a triumph. Examine, then,
   whether you increase or decrease: if you go backward from zeal to
   coldness, from strictness to looseness; if you lose your care of duty,
   and choiceness of spirit, and there be no complaining, it is a sign
   grace was never wrought in truth. Once more, false grace is not
   accompanied with humility. When men, the more they profess, the prouder
   they grow, and more self -conceited, there is cause of suspicion. With
   true grace there always goeth along a spiritual poverty, or a sense of
   our spiritual wants; the more knowledge, the more they discern their
   ignorance; compare 1 Cor. viii. 2, with Prov. xxx. 2, 3; the more
   faith, the more they bewail unbelief, and see a need of increase and
   further growth: Mark ix. 24, Lord, I believe, help mine unbelief.' Oh!
   I want faith, what shall I do? still I am haunted with prejudicial and
   lessening thoughts of God's all-sufficiency and goodness. It is
   excellent when the soul is thus kept hungry and humble under our
   enjoyments, and we forget the things that are behind,' because the
   things that are before us,' or not yet attained, are much more, Phil.
   iii. 13.

   3. The next thing is restraining grace, [22] which is nothing else but
   an awe upon the conscience, inclining men to forbear sin, though they
   do not hate it. Now you may discern it, partly because love is of
   little use and force with such kind of spirits; they are chained up by
   their own fears. The great evangelic motive is mercy: Rom. xii. 1, I
   beseech you by the mercies of God.' The heart is most ingenuous when it
   yieldeth to such entreaties. It is good to serve God with reverence,
   but a servile awe hath little of grace in it. It is true, in deed, it
   is better to have a slavish fear than none at all; therefore David
   saith to them that would be held in with no other restraints, Ps. iv.
   4, Stand in awe, and sin not.' To cool and charm their fury he maketh
   use of the argument of God's vengeance; though this is also the fault
   of slavish spirits, that carnal respects and thoughts of outward
   inconvenience do equally sway them, as a servile fear of God's
   judgments. Again, you may know it, because it doth not destroy sin, but
   only prohibit the exercise of it. Abimelech's lust was not quenched,
   yet God withheld him from sinning against Sarah, Gen. xx. 6. The heart
   is not renewed, though the action be checked; as Israel had an
   adulterous heart towards God, when her way was hedged up with thorns,'
   Hosea ii. 6. Again, it is their trouble that they are held in the
   stocks of conscience; they would fain be enlarged and find out their
   own paths.

   4. The next thing that looketh like sanctification, but is not, is
   common grace. This is a distinct thing from all the rest, yet I call it
   common grace, because it may be in them that fall away and depart from
   God. It differeth from civility, because it is more Christian and
   evangelical; from formality, because that is only in pretence and show,
   whereas this is a real work upon the soul; from restraining grace,
   because that is only conversant about sins and duties out of a servile
   awe of God, but this seemeth to carry out the soul with some affection
   to Christ. It is a common work, good in itself, which God ordaineth in
   some to be a preparation and beginning of the work of grace. Of this
   the apostle speaketh, Heb. vi. 4, 5, where he calleth it an
   enlightening,' a taste of Christ and of the powers of the world to
   come,' and a partaking of the Holy Ghost;' meaning the gifts of the
   Spirit, abilities for holy duties, &c., of all which elsewhere; only
   now let me note three things:--(1.) That the light there spoken of is
   not humbling; (2.) The taste is not ravishing, and drawing out the soul
   after more of Christ; (3.) Their gifts are not renewing and
   sanctifying.

   [1.] That light is not humbling. He saith, they are enlightened,' but
   he doth not say they are humbled. Foundations totter that are not laid
   deep enough. The more true light a man hath, the more cause of
   self-abasement will he find in himself. You can never magnify Christ
   enough, and you can never debase self enough; and certainly Christ is
   most exalted when you are most abased, Isa. ii. 19. Dagon must fall
   upon his face if you mean to set up the ark; and if Christ shall be
   precious to you, you must be vile in your own eyes; none have such true
   revivings as the humble, Isa. lvii. 15, 16. True humiliation is far
   from weakening your comforts, it maketh them more full and sure;
   therefore a main thing that was wanting in those spoken of in Heb. vi.,
   was humiliation, and their fault was a rash closing with Christ in the
   pride of their hearts.

   [2.] Their taste was not ravishing and affecting the heart so as to
   engage it to seek after Christ; they had but loose and slight desires
   of happiness, glances upon the glory of heaven and the comforts of the
   gospel, which possibly might stir up a wish, Oh! that I might die the
   death of the righteous,' &c. They were not serious and holy desires
   after Christ, after grace and strength to serve him. The saints, that
   have a taste, groan after a fuller communion in his graces as well as
   comforts, Rom. vii. 24, Ps. cxix. 5; that experience which they have
   had of Christ maketh them long for more. But now in temporaries there
   is a loose assent and slight affection, a taste enough to prevail with
   them, to make some profession for a while, a rejoicing for a season,
   &c.

   [3.] Their gifts are not renewing and sanctifying; such possibly as may
   make them useful to the church, but do not change the heart. The
   apostle saith, they were made partakers of the Holy Ghost;' that is,
   had some share--it may be a plentiful share,--of church gifts, so as to
   be able to carry on duties to the edification and comfort of others.
   But, alas! what is a man the better, if the heart be oppressed with
   sins in the meantime, and be not upright with God? 1 Cor. xiii. 1,
   Though I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not
   charity, I am become but as a sounding brass and tinkling cymbal.'
   Though you can speak of the things of God with much enlargement and
   affection, pray sweetly, all is but as tinkling with God, if there be
   not saving grace. It is a great evidence that we are such as the
   apostle speaketh of, when the affection doth not answer the expression
   of a duty, nor the life our knowledge, and gifts have not a
   proportionable influence upon practice. So much for that point.

   Having spoken of the state, I come now to speak of the author of it,
   God the Father. But why is it so distinctly attributed to the Father?
   Is not Christ our sanctification?' 1 Cor. i. 30, and is it not called
   the sanctification of the Spirit?' 2 Thes. ii. 13. The answer shall
   draw out the strength of the phrase in these propositions. (1.) It is
   true that the whole Trinity, one way or other, concurreth to the work
   of holiness; those works ad extra are indivisa, common to all the
   persons--the Father sanctifieth, the Son sanctifieth, and the Holy
   Ghost sanctifieth: the same may be said of preserving and calling. (2.)
   Though all work jointly, yet there are distinct personal operations, by
   which they make way for the glory of each other; the love of the Father
   for the glory of the Son, and the glory of the Son for the power of the
   Spirit. See how the scripture followeth these things. You shall find
   first, that no man cometh to the Son, but from the Father, by election:
   John vi. 37, All that the Father giveth me shall come to me:' so ver.
   65, No man cometh unto me, unless it be given him of my Father,' Look
   again and you shall find that no man cometh to the Father from the
   bondage of sin and Satan, but by the Son, through his redemption and
   mediation: John xiv. 6, I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man
   cometh unto the Father but by me.' Again, you shall see no man is
   united to the Son but by the Holy Ghost, who worketh in those whom the
   Father did choose, and the Son redeem; and therefore the sanctification
   of the Spirit' is as necessary as the blood of Jesus,' 1 Peter i. 2. So
   that you see all have their distinct work; the inchoation is from the
   Father, the dispensation by the Son, and the consummation by the
   Spirit: from the Father, in the Son, and through the Spirit. There is
   God's choice, Christ's purchase, and the Spirit's application; all are
   joined in one verse,--for indeed they must not be severed,--even in the
   place last alleged, 1 Peter i. 2. (3.) Because the first distinct
   operation is the Father's, therefore the whole work in scripture is
   often ascribed to him. He is said to justify;' the justifier of them
   that believe in Jesus,' Rom. iii. 26. So he is said elsewhere to purge:
   John xv. 1, 2, I am the vine, and my Father is the husbandman; he
   purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.' All dependeth upon the
   decree of his love. Christ doth not work upon a person, unless he be
   given to him by the Father; and, therefore, he being first in order and
   operation, the whole work is made his work: Sanctified in God the
   Father.' Observe:--

   Obs. 1. That sanctification is God's work, wrought in us by the Father.
   To cleanse the heart is beyond the power of the creature; it can no
   more make itself holy, than make itself to be. We could defile
   ourselves, but we cannot cleanse ourselves: as the sheep can go astray
   of itself, but it can never return to the fold without the shepherd's
   care and help. [23] Lusts are too hard for us, and so are the duties of
   obedience. God, that gave us his image at first, must again plant it in
   the soul. [24] Who can repair nature depraved, but the author of
   nature? When a watch is out of order we send it to the workman: We are
   his workmanship in Christ,' Eph. ii. 10. God taketh it to his
   prerogative: Lev. xxi. 8, I am the Lord that sanctifieth thee.' Grace
   is his immediate creature; man's will contributeth nothing to the work
   but resistance and rebellion; and outward means work not, unless God
   put in with them; else why should the same word preached by the same
   minister work in some and harden others? All the difference ariseth
   from God's grace, which acteth according to pleasure. Well, then:--

   Use 1. Let us wait upon God till the work be accomplished. Our wills
   are obstinate and perverse, but God never made a creature too hard for
   himself; he is able to do this thing for us, and it is our comfort we
   have such a God to go to. The heathens, that groped and felt after God,
   were to seek of a power to quell their lusts, and therefore were put
   upon sad remedies: whereas all is made easy to you in the power of God
   through Christ. Crates gave this advice to one that came to him to know
   how he should subdue the lust of uncleanness; he answered, that he
   should either famish himself or hang himself; [25] they knew no remedy
   but offering violence to nature, or else death and despair. Democritus
   blinded himself, because he could not look upon women without lusting
   after them. Now God teacheth us to put out the eye of our lust, not of
   our bodies. [26] Bless God that you know whose work it is, and to whom
   to go for sanctification.

   Use 2. Praise the Lord whenever this work is accomplished. Not I, but
   grace; it must not be ascribed to our works, or to any power that is in
   ourselves, but to God's mercy, Christ's merits, and the Spirit's
   efficacy. There is God's grant: To her it was granted to be covered
   with fine linen, the righteousness of the saints,' Rev. xix. 8. God the
   Father giveth leave or issueth forth an authentic act and decree in the
   court of heaven; as Esther by the grant of the king was supplied out of
   the king's wardrobe. Then there is Christ's merit; the stream wherein
   we are washed floweth out of Christ's own heart: 1 John i. 7, The blood
   of Christ cleanseth us from all sin.' Then there is the Spirit's
   efficacy; no less power will vanquish the proud heart of man. It is
   notable, that grace is expressed not only by the notion of creation,
   Ps. li. 10; Eph. ii. 10; 2 Cor. iv. 6, which is a making things out of
   nothing, but also by victory, Luke xi. 21, 22; 2 Cor. x. 5; 1 John iv.
   4, or a powerful overcoming of opposition. In creation, as there was
   nothing to help, so there was nothing to resist and hinder; but in man
   there is, besides a death in sin, a life of resistance against grace;
   therefore sanctification must entirely be ascribed to God: we deserve
   it not, it cometh from the Father's good-will and Christ's merit; we
   work it not, it is accomplished by the power of the Holy Ghost

   Obs. 2. Again observe, that though the work of grace be immediately
   wrought by another person, yet our thoughts in believing must not stay
   till we ascend and come up to God the Father. You shall see the
   scripture carrieth out our acts of faith to him everywhere: Rom. iv.
   24, If we believe in him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;'
   that is, in God the Father. So John xii. 44, He that believeth in me,
   believeth not in me, but in him that sent me.' That not is not
   negative, but corrective. Not only in me, but his thoughts must ascend
   to the Father also, who manifesteth himself in me. So John xiv. 1, Ye
   believe in God, believe also in me.' Both expressions may be
   imperative. Besides believing in Christ, we must also believe in God,
   as the first fountain and author of grace. Now the reasons are--(1.)
   Because all grace beginneth with the Father. The first in order of
   being is first in order of working. It is the Father that floweth out
   to us in Christ and by the Spirit. Whatever Christ hath and is, he hath
   from him as the original author: 1 Cor. i. 30, Of him Jesus Christ is
   made to us sanctification.' The high priest went into the sanctuary
   before he blessed the people. So doth Jesus Christ sanctify you in the
   Father and from the Father. As Mediator certainly he is to be
   considered as God's servant and instrument. Well, then, reason is in
   its progress till it climb up to the first cause of a thing. So should
   faith. Do not leave till you come to the Father, who is the highest
   fountain of grace. (2.) Because whatever is done to you by Christ, is
   done with a respect to his Father's love: John xvii. 2, Thou hast given
   him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many
   as thou hast given him.' So see ver. 6, I have manifested thy name unto
   them; thine they were, and them thou gavest me.' That was the ground of
   Christ's respect, the Father's donation, or the charge he received from
   him; and therefore you must look upon the Father's love as well as
   Christ's care; for in all his respects to us he still acknowledgeth his
   obedience to the Father, and, indeed, it giveth us a double ground of
   hope. The Son loveth us because the Father required it, and the Father
   loveth us because the Son asketh it. [27] If Christ be faithful to his
   Father, we are sure to be loved, or if the Father have any respect and
   love to Christ. (3.) Because it is a great support and comfort to faith
   to consider of the Father in the act of believing. Two are better than
   one; and it is often made a privilege to have the Father and the Son,'
   1 John i. 3, and ii. 23, 24; 2 John 9., et alibi. There is the Father's
   love and the Son's merit. Either severally will not yield that joy and
   peace in believing, and therefore it is good to have them both
   together. There is no access to the Father but in the Son. What will
   guilt do with justice? stubble with consuming fire? God out of Christ
   is terrible rather than comfortable. Therefore it is said, 1 Peter i.
   21, that by him we believe in God;' that is, by Christ through his
   merit we come comfortably to pitch upon God the Father. So again,
   Christ separate from the Father doth not yield such firm grounds of
   confidence. There must be some act of the Father to give us full
   security: for in the business of redemption God the Father is
   represented as the offended, wronged party, who is to receive
   satisfaction. We are sensible of the wrong and offence; conscience
   feeleth that. We must be also sensible of his favour and grace towards
   us. Now when we see him first in all acts of grace, that taketh away
   all jealousy and scruple. (4.) Because in the Father's love there are
   many circumstances which are very engaging to the soul, which are not
   to be found in the rest of the divine persons; for he being first in
   order, hath the chiefest work ascribed to him; but especially are not
   to be found in Christ as Mediator. And because Christ as Mediator is
   most known to the creatures, I shall prosecute this matter with respect
   to that consideration. (1st.) In the Father's love and acts of grace
   there is an original fulness. Christ's fulness as Mediator is but
   derived out of the Father's plenty: Col. i. 19, It pleased the Father
   that in him all fulness should dwell.' And it is limited by the
   Father's will in the dispensation of it. All that Christ dispensed was
   according to the charge and commandment given him by his Father. See
   Mat. xx. 23, It is not mine to give, save to those for whom it is
   prepared of my Father.' Christ doth not deny his authority to give
   glory as well as grace; only he showeth how in all the dispensations
   proper to the Mediator he was limited by the will and counsel of the
   Father. And so he denieth to dispense the knowledge of times and
   seasons, because the Father had kept it in his own power,' Acts i. 7.
   So that now it is an engaging consideration to remember that the
   Father, whose will is absolute, who hath an original fulness of all
   grace, that he himself loveth us,' and is first in all acts of
   blessing. (2d.) In the Father's acts you have the purest and freest
   apprehension of love. He began and first broke the business of our
   redemption. God the Son can have a higher motive, the Father's will;
   but God the Father can have no higher motive than his own love. His
   elective law was the first rise and spring whence all that love that
   passeth out to the creature issueth forth, and therefore here we have
   the freest apprehension of love. There was a love of the Father
   anteceding the merit of Christ: John iii. 16, God so loved the world,
   that he gave his only Son.' There was the most independent and free act
   of love.

   Use. It serveth to press us to give a distinct glory in believing to
   God the Father. Get a right apprehension of the divine persons, and the
   several endearments with which their personal operations are
   represented. It is said, John v. 23, that God will have all men honour
   the Son as they honour the Father.' God is most honoured when your
   thoughts are most distinct and explicit in this matter. Do not forget
   the Father; you are his gift, as well as the Son's purchase, and the
   Spirit's charge. If God the Father had not loved you before all worlds,
   Jesus Christ would not have redeemed you; and if Christ had not
   redeemed you, the Spirit would never sanctify you: and as the Spirit
   will not work unless you look upon him as Christ's Spirit, John xvi.
   14, He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine;' so Christ came
   to glorify the Father, and to finish his work, John xvii. 4. Bless them
   and praise them all then. If you receive anything, see the Father's
   bounty in it, the freeness and everlastingness of his love stamped upon
   what you have. So if you want anything, holiness, comfort, grace,
   pardon, reflect not only upon the fulness of Christ's merit, but the
   freeness of the Father's love. You deal with a God of bowels and
   bounty; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, all are yours. There is a fond
   affectation in some to carry all things in the name of Christ, even
   such acts wherein the Father is most concerned; as the former age
   carried all dispensations in the name of God Almighty, without any
   distinct reflection, upon God the Son, in whom the Father will be
   honoured, and by whom we have an access to the Father. So many in this
   age, in their popular discourses and prayers, carry all things in the
   name of God the Son, and with a fond and luscious affectation
   ingeminate the name, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ,' so that the honour
   and adoration due to the other persons is neglected and forgotten;
   whereas Christ is to be acknowledged Lord in all tongues, and among all
   nations, to the glory of God the Father,' Phil. ii. 11.

   But now it is high time to proceed to the second and last manifestation
   of their effectual calling, preserved in Jesus Christ, teteremenois en
   Chri'sto, kept in or by him; the meaning is, they were not only
   sanctified for the present out of the store and plenty of God the
   Father, but should for ever be kept in that estate by Jesus Christ. The
   point is:--

   Obs. That God's called and sanctified people are preserved and kept in
   their state of grace and holiness in and by Jesus Christ. The point
   asserteth two things--that they are kept by Christ and in Christ; that
   is, not only for his sake, but by virtue of union with him. Jesus
   Christ is the cabinet wherein God's jewels are kept; so that if we
   would stand, we must get out of ourselves, and get into him, in whom
   alone there is safety. I might handle this latter branch apart, namely,
   that union with Christ is the ground of our safety and preservation.
   But because I am sensible that I have staid too long upon this verse
   already, I shall content myself with handling upon this occasion the
   general doctrine of the perseverance of the saints. And, first, I shall
   give you the state of it, how far we may expect to be preserved;
   Secondly, The grounds of certainty and assurance in this kind.

   1. How far we may look for preservation. The doctrine of perseverance
   is much impugned; but the earth is never the more unsettled because to
   giddy brains it seemeth to run round. However, let us grant what must
   be granted, and then the truth will be burdened with less prejudice.
   Seeming grace may be lost: Take from him that which he hath,' Mat. xxv.
   29, is, Luke viii. 18, Take from him that which he seemed to have.'
   Blazing comets and meteors are soon spent, and fall from heaven like
   lightning, while stars keep their orb and station. A building in the
   sand will totter, and hypocrites be discovered before the congregation,
   Prov. xxvi. 26. Again, initial or preparative grace may fail, such as
   is spoken of in Heb. vi. 4, 5, to wit, illumination, external
   reformation, temporary faith, devout moods, some good beginnings, &c.
   Plenty of blossoms do not always foretell store of fruit; some die in
   the very pangs of the birth, and are still-born. Yet again, true grace
   may suffer a shrewd decay, but not an utter loss; the leaves may fade
   when the root liveth. In temptations God's children are sorely shaken;
   their heel may be bruised, as Christ's was, but their head is not
   crushed. Peter denied Christ, but did not fall from grace; there is a
   remaining seed, 1 John iii. 9. It is notable what Chrysostom observeth
   concerning Christ's prayer for Peter, Luke xxii. 32, I have prayed for
   thee that thy faith fail not.' Mark, saith he, he doth not say, I have
   prayed for thee that thou shouldst not deny me, but I have prayed that
   thy faith should not altogether vanish and be abolished. [28] Once
   more, such grace as serveth to our well-being in Christ may be taken
   away, joy, peace, cheerfulness, &c. As a man may have a being, though
   his well-being be lost; he is a man, though a bankrupt, though poor,
   though sick, though diseased: so a Christian may be living though he be
   not lively. Yet further, the operations of grace may be obstructed for
   a great while: a fit of swooning is not a state of death; there may be
   no acts, and yet their seed remaineth; this may last for a long time.
   David lay in a spiritual swoon nine months; for he awaked not till
   Nathan came to him, Ps. li., the title; and when Nathan came to him,
   the child begotten upon Bathsheba was born; for he saith, 2 Sam. xii.
   14, The child which is born to thee shall die.' Yet further, grace if
   left to us would soon be lost; we showed that in innocency: but it is
   our advantage that our security lieth in God's promises, and not our
   own; that we are not our own keepers; that grace is a jewel not trusted
   but in safe hands; that perseverance is God's gift, not man's act; and
   that Christ hath a charge to conduct the saints, and keep them safe to
   everlasting glory, John vi. 37-40; and x. 28, I give unto them eternal
   life, and they shall never perish (neither shall any perish); none
   shall pluck them out of my hand. My Father which gave them is greater
   than all; none is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.' They
   neither shall nor can; God and Christ are engaged in the keeping of
   them; Christ by God's command as Mediator, and God by Christ's merit:
   therefore he that separateth us from God must tug with Jesus Christ
   himself, and be too hard for him also, or else he can never pluck them
   out of his hands. If they should question Christ's power, because of
   the ignominy of the cross, the Father's hands are also engaged, for our
   greater assurance. Can any creature loose his eternal and almighty
   grasp, and pluck out those whom the Father hath a mind to keep?

   We do not plead for any wild assurance and certainty of perseverance;
   we do not say that they that neglect means, or grieve the Spirit, and
   do what they list, are sure that they shall not miscarry; that is
   against the nature of God's dispensation, and the nature of this
   assurance, and therefore but a vain cavil, It is against the nature of
   God's dispensation; whom he maketh to persevere, he maketh them to
   persevere in the use of means. Hezekiah had assurance from God of life
   for fifteen years, yet he taketh a lump of figs, and applieth it as a
   plaster to the boil, Isa. xxxviii. 5, with 21. More clearly, Acts
   xxvii. 31, All shall come to land;' but, Except ye abide in the ship ye
   cannot be safe.' We are sure of life as long as God hath any service to
   do for us, yet we are bound to get food and raiment, and to use all
   means to preserve life. This was Satan's cavil against God's protection
   over Christ, Thou art sure not to fall, therefore neglect means, cast
   thyself upon danger, Mat. iv. 9, 10. You learn this doctrine from the
   devil; thou mayest do what thou list, thou art sure to be safe; it is
   the devil's divinity. Again, it is against the nature of this
   assurance; he that hath tasted God's love in God's way cannot reason
   so. A child that hath a good father that will not see him perish, shall
   he waste and embezzle his estate he careth not how? A wicked child may
   presume thus of his father (though it be very disingenuous) because of
   his natural interest and relation to his father; the kindness which he
   expecteth is not built upon moral choice, but nature: but a child of
   God cannot, because he cannot grow up to this certainty but in the
   exercise of grace; it is begotten and nourished by godly exercises; and
   the thing itself implieth a contradiction; this were to fall away
   because we cannot fall away. You may as soon say that the fire should
   make a man freeze with cold, as that certainty of perseverance in grace
   should make us do actions contrary to grace.

   Again, we do not say that a believer is so sure of his conservation in
   a state of grace, as that he needeth not to be wary and jealous of
   himself: 1 Cor. x. 12, Let him that standeth take heed lest he fall.'
   There is a fear of caution, as well as a fear of diffidence and
   distrust; and there is a great deal of difference between weakening the
   security of the flesh, and our confidence in Christ. None more apt to
   suspect themselves than they that are most sure in God, lest by
   improvidence and unwatchfulness they should yield t6 corruption. Christ
   had prayed that Peter's faith might not fail, yet together with the
   other apostles he biddeth him watch, Luke xxii. 40-46. The fear of God
   is a preserving grace, and taken into the covenant: Jer. xxxii. 40, I
   will put my fear into their hearts, and they shall not depart from me.'
   This is a fear which will stand with faith and certainty; it is a fruit
   of .the same Spirit, and doth not hinder assurance, but guard it; it is
   a fear that maketh us watchful against all occasions to sin and
   spiritual distempers, that we may not give offence to God: as an
   ingenuous man that hath an inheritance passed over to him by his friend
   in court is careful not to offend him.

   Again, this certainty of our standing in grace doth not exclude prayer:
   Luke xxii. 46, Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.'
   Perseverance is God's gift, and it must be sought in God's way; by
   Christ's intercession, to preserve the majesty of God, and by our
   prayers, that we may constantly profess our dependence upon God, and
   renew our acquaintance with him; besides, by asking blessings in
   prayer, we are the more warned of our duty; it is a means to keep us
   gracious and holy. As those that converse often with kings had need be
   decently clad, and go neat in their apparel, so he that speaketh often
   to God is bound to be more holy, that he may be the more acceptable to
   him.

   Again, it is not a discontinued, but a constant perseverance that we
   plead for; not as if an elect person could be quite driven out of the
   state of grace, though he be saved at length; he cannot fall totus a
   toto in totum, the whole man with full consent, from all grace and
   godliness; he may sin foully, but not fall off totally, no more than
   finally; there is something that remaineth, a seed, an unction, a root
   in a dry ground, that will bud and scent again. Briefly, true grace
   shall never utterly be lost, though it be much weakened, but in the use
   of means it shall constantly be preserved to eternal life.

   Once more, and I have done with the state of the question. God doth not
   only require the condition of standing, or continuing in the exercise
   of grace, but give it infallibly. The precepts of the covenant of grace
   are also promises: Heb. viii. 10, This is the covenant that I will make
   with the house of Israel,' &c., where all the articles carry the form
   of promises. God undertaketh to fulfil our part in us when we submit to
   the covenant. So Jer. xxxii. 40, I will put my fear into their hearts,'
   &c. If there be any breach, it must be from our departing from God, or
   God's departing from us. [29] Now God never departeth, his love never
   permitteth him to repent of giving his fear and putting his grace into
   our hearts; but all the fear is our departing from God. So some say,
   God will not depart from us, if we be not wanting to ourselves. And
   Bernard observed that our own flesh is not mentioned, Rom. viii., What
   shall separate us from God?' &c. Soli eum deserere possumus propriâ
   voluntate--our own will may separate us and withdraw us from God. And
   the Remonstrants: Though God doth not repent doni dati, of what he hath
   given, yet we may repent doni accepti et retenti, of what we have
   received, and grow weary of the service of God. But all is answered by
   God's undertaking in the covenant: I will put my fear into their
   hearts, that they shall not depart from me.' He will give faith, and
   love, and fear, bestow and continue such graces as dispose the soul to
   perseverance.

   2. The grounds of certainty, by which it may appear that we shall be
   preserved in that state of grace unto which we are called in Jesus
   Christ. The grounds are many; put them altogether, and you may easily
   spell out of them the perseverance of the saints.

   [1.] There are some grounds on God the Father's part; there is his
   everlasting love and all-sufficient power. His everlasting love. God
   doth not love for a fit, but for ever, From everlasting to
   everlasting,' Ps. ciii. 17, before the world was, and when the world is
   no more. God's love is not founded upon any temporal accident, but on
   his own counsel, in which there can be no change, [30] because the same
   reasons that moved him to choose at first continue for ever. God never
   repented in time of what he purposed before all time: Rom. xi. 29, His
   gifts and calling are without repentance.' By gifts he meaneth such as
   are proper to the elect; and by calling, effectual calling; such is
   kata` pro'thesin, according to his eternal purpose; of these he never
   repents. The fruits of repentance in men are shame and sorrow; now God
   is never ashamed of his choice, nor sorry for his choice, so as to wish
   it undone. And then the other ground is his all-sufficient power.
   Almightiness is engaged in the preservation of grace by his eternal
   love and will, John x. 28, 29. Can they pluck Christ from the throne?
   are they stronger than Christ's Father?

   [2.] There are grounds on Christ's part; his everlasting merit, and
   close union between him and us, and constant intercession. For his
   merit, see Heb. ix. 12. He is entered into the holy place, having
   obtained an eternal redemption for us.' Legal expiations did but last
   from year to year, but Christ's merit for ever and ever; his redemption
   is eternal, not only as it is of use in all ages of the church, but in
   respect of every particular saint. Those who are once redeemed by
   Christ, they are not redeemed for a time, so as to fall away again;
   that, would argue that the virtue of Christ's blood was spent, and
   could preserve them no longer; but they are for ever kept to salvation.
   So Heb. x. 14, By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
   sanctified.' He hath not only purchased a possibility of salvation, but
   all that we need to our full perfection; it is not for a certain time,
   but for ever. Then there is a close union between him and us; this is
   the notion of the text, preserved in Christ,' Look, as it is impossible
   to sever the leaven and the dough, when they are once mingled and
   kneaded together, [31] so Christ and a believer, when they are united
   together, there is no parting more. Can Christ's mystical body be
   maimed, or lose a joint? Then his constant intercession; that is
   another ground, a copy of which we have in the 17th of John, where he
   saith, Keep them through thy name,' &c., and Keep them from the evil,'
   &c. See Heb. vii. 25, He is able to save to the uttermost those that
   come to God by him, for he liveth for ever to make intercession for
   them.' He is interceding with God, that the merit of his death may be
   applied to us; and what is that? Salvation to the uttermost,' or to the
   end,' eis to te'los. The heirs of salvation need not fear miscarrying.
   Jesus Christ, who is the testator, who by will and testament made over
   the heritage to them, he also is the executor, he liveth for ever to
   see his own will executed; he died once to make the testament, and he
   liveth for ever to see it made good. Whenever we are in danger, he is
   entreating his Father for supports and assistances of grace.

   [3.] On the Spirit's part there is a continued influence, so as to
   maintain the essence and seed of grace. The Father's love is continued
   by the merit of Christ, that he may not depart from us; and we are
   preserved by the Spirit of Christ, that we may not depart from him. He
   doth not only put into our hearts faith, fear, love, and other graces
   at first, but he maintaineth and keepeth them, that the fire may never
   go out. Our hearts are his temple, and he doth not love to leave his
   dwelling-place. And besides, in the economy of salvation, it is his
   office to glorify Christ as his vicegerent, and to be our comforter;
   therefore, with respect to the honour of Christ, and the comfort of
   believers, he preserveth and maintaineth that grace that is once really
   wrought in our hearts. To preserve the glory of Christ thus, Christ,
   you know, hath received a charge from the Father to lose nothing,' John
   vi. 39, neither body nor soul--nothing that belongeth to an elect
   person. Now, that he may be true to his trust, he sendeth the Spirit as
   his deputy or executor, that his merit may be fully applied. It is for
   the honour of Christ, that wherever the work is begun, wherever he hath
   been an author, there he may be a finisher also, Heb. xii. 2. It was
   said of the foolish builder, that he began, and was not able to make an
   end.' This dishonour can never be cast upon Christ, because of the
   power and faithfulness of the Spirit; he doth katerga'zesthai, Phil. i.
   6, go through with the work which he hath begun; the Spirit is to fit
   vessels for glory. He doth not use to leave them half carved; he is
   faithful to Christ, as Christ is to his Father. The Father chooseth the
   vessels, Christ buyeth them, and the Spirit carveth and fitteth them,
   that they may be vessels of praise and honour. But this is not all. He
   preserveth and continueth us in the state of grace as our Comforter; by
   working grace he puts us into an expectation of glory and happiness,
   and to make it good he carrieth. on the work without failing; therefore
   grace is called the first-fruits of the Spirit.' Rom. viii. 24, and the
   earnest of the Spirit,' 2 Cor. i. 22, and v. 6, for it hath a double
   use, to be a taste and a pledge. It is a taste to show us how good
   eternal life is; and a pledge to show us how sure it is. The first
   degree of regeneration is of this nature; it is an earnest, or gage,
   assuring us of a more perfect enjoyment--the livery and seisin of glory
   to come. As soon as a real change is wrought, the Spirit of God doth
   give us earnest; and will God lose his earnest? will he give us a
   pledge, and fail our expectation? Surely no.

   Let us now come to application.

   Use. 1. It presseth us to persevere with the more care. It is no
   unreasonable inference: see 1 John ii. 27, 28, Ye shall abide in him;
   and now little children abide in him;' Since we have so many advantages
   of standing, let us not fall away. Oh! how great will your sin be, if
   you should miscarry and dishonour God! We pity a child that falleth
   when it is not looked after; but when a froward child wresteth and
   forceth itself out of the arms of the nurse, we are angry with it. You
   have more reason to stand than others, being brought into an
   unchangeable state of grace; being held in the arms of Christ, God will
   be very angry with your slips and failings. Mercy holdeth you fast, and
   you seek to wrest yourselves out of mercy's arms. None can sin as you
   do, with such frowardness, with such dishonour to God; you disparage
   the Spirit's custody, the merit of Christ, and the mercy of the Father.
   See Heb. iv. 1, Let us therefore fear, a promise being left to us of
   entering into his rest, lest any should seem to come short of it.'
   Look, as some seem to stand that do not, so some seem to fall utterly
   that do not. A child of God indeed cannot come short, but he should not
   seem, that is, give any appearance of coming short. When our religious
   course is interrupted, and we give way to sin and folly, that is a
   seeming to come short, and so you bring a scandal upon the love of God,
   as if it were changeable; upon the merit of Christ, as if it were not a
   perfect merit. Scandalous professors make Arminians; in an age of
   defection, no wonder if men plead for the apostasy of the saints.

   Use 2. If you fall through weakness, be not utterly dismayed. As the
   spinster leaveth a lock of wool to draw on the next thread, so there is
   somewhat left. When you are departed from God, you have more holdfast
   upon him than another sinner; a child, though a prodigal: go to him and
   say, Father. David pleadeth the relics of grace yet left, Ps. cxix.
   176, I have gone astray like a sheep; seek thy servant, for I do not
   forget my commandments;' as if he had said, Lord, I have sinned through
   weakness, but I hope there is some grace left, some bent of heart
   towards thee. So the church, Isa. lxiv. 8, 9, Now, O Lord, thou art our
   father,' &c. Yea, God is angry when we do not plead. So Jer. iii. 4,
   Wilt thou not cry, Thou art my father?' &c. You have an interest,
   though you have been disobedient. Thus do, and your falls will be an
   advantage; as you have seen men go back to fetch their leaps more
   commodiously.

   Use 3. When you stand, let it excite you to love and thankfulness.
   Nothing maketh the saints love God more than the unchangeableness of
   his love. When they see themselves safe in the midst of weaknesses and
   Satan's daily assaults, it doth much endear God to their souls.
   Certainly Daniel was much affected with his preservation in the lions'
   den, when he saw the lions ramping and roaring about him, and yet
   restrained with the chains of providence, that they could do him no
   harm. So the children of God must needs love their preserver when they
   consider what dangers are round about them, how little they subsist by
   their own strength, 1 Sam. ii. 9, and how much they have done a
   thousand times to cause God to withdraw his Spirit from them; and
   therefore the great argument why the saints do love and praise him is
   not only the freedom of his grace, but the unchangeableness and
   constancy of it: His mercy endureth for ever;' it is several times
   repeated, Ps. cxxxvi. So Ps. cvi. 1, Praise ye the Lord; O give thanks
   unto the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever.' No
   form is more frequent in the mouths of the saints: and good reason; for
   alas! if we were left to ourselves, we should damn ourselves every
   hour. We have a revolting heart,' Jer. v. 23, xiv. 10. We are like
   glasses without a bottom; as soon as they are out of hand they are
   broken; we cannot stand of ourselves: and we have a restless enemy,
   that desireth to toss us and vex us, as wheat is tossed from sieve to
   sieve, Luke xxii. 31; and we have often forfeited God's protection, and
   grieved him day by day. Were it not for everlasting mercy, what would
   become of us? Certainly they that do not love God for their
   preservation, they are not sensible of their condition in the world.
   What a naughty heart they carry about with them! It is a miracle that
   ever grace should be preserved there, where there is so much pride,
   love of pleasures, worldly cares, brutish lusts; that such a heavenly
   plant can thrive in the midst of so many weeds. And what a busy devil
   they have to do withal, who watcheth all advantages, as a dog that
   standeth waving his tail (it is Chrysostom's comparison) and expecting
   a bit; and his envy and malice is most bent against them that have most
   grace. Finally, they do not consider that the world is full of snares
   and dangerous allurements; for if they did, they could not choose but
   fall a-blessing of God for Jesus Christ, who yet fasteneth them as a
   nail in the holy place. I remember one of the fathers bringeth in the
   flesh saying, Ego deficiam, I will surely fail and miscarry; and the
   world Ego decipiam, I will deceive them and entice them; and Satan, Ego
   eripiam, I will snatch them and carry them away; and God saith, Ego
   custodiam, I will keep them, I will never fail them nor forsake them;'
   and there lieth our safety and security.

   Use 4. It informeth us that if any fall often, constantly, frequently,
   easily, they have no interest in grace: 1 John iii. 9, He that is born
   of God sinneth not,' ou poiei amarti'an, he makes not a trade of sin;
   that is the force of the phrase. God's children slip often, but not
   with such a frequent constant readiness into the same sin. As fair
   meadows may be everflown, but marsh ground is drowned with the return
   of every tide, so are wicked men carried away with every return of the
   temptation; therefore he that liveth in a course of profaneness,
   worldliness, drunkenness, his spot is not as the spot of God's
   children.' You are tried by your constant course and walk, Rom. viii.
   1. What is your road? what do you do constantly, easily, frequently? I
   except only those sins which are of usual incidence and sudden
   surreption; as sudden stirrings of passion in a choleric temper, and
   vanity of thoughts, and distractions in duties, &c. And yet for these a
   man should be the more humble and watchful; if they be not felt and
   striven against, and mourned for, it is a bad sign.

   Use 5. It provoketh us to get an interest in such a sure condition. Be
   not contented--(1.) With outward happiness; things are worthy according
   to their duration. Nature hath such a sense of God's eternity, that the
   more lasting things are, it accounteth them the better. An immortal
   soul must have an eternal good. Now all things in the world are frail
   and pass away, therefore called uncertain riches,' 1 Tim. vi. 17. It is
   uncertain whether we shall get them, and uncertain whether we shall
   keep them, and uncertain whether we shall live to enjoy them if they
   stay with us. All of this side grace is uncertain; these things are
   usually blasted in their flower and beauty, as Herod was stricken in
   the midst of all his royalty: so that a man may out live his happiness,
   which is the greatest misery; or at least it must terminate with death;
   there is no use of wealth in the other world. But now the better part
   can never be taken from us,' Luke x. 42; and by seeking that we may
   have other things with a blessing, Mat. vi. 33. (2.) Rest not in gifts,
   they are for the body rather than the person that hath them; as many
   are carnal, and yet come behind in no gift. God useth them like
   negroes, to dig in the mines of knowledge, that others may have the
   gold. Judas could cast out devils, and yet afterward was cast out among
   devils; see 1 Cor. xii. 31. The apostle had discoursed largely of
   gifts, and then concludeth thus: But yet I show you a more excellent
   way;' and what is that? Grace that abideth and endureth for ever, as in
   the next chapter. Many that have great abilities to pray, preach,
   discourse, yet fall away. According to the place which they sustain in
   the body, so they have great gifts of knowledge, utterance, abilities
   to comfort, direct, and instruct others, to answer doubts, to reason
   and argue for God, for conference and holy discourse, and yet fall
   foully; as those Heb. vi. 4, are said to be partakers of the Holy
   Ghost;' that is, to have a great share of church gifts. Nay, this is
   not all; gifts themselves wither and vanish when the bodily vigour is
   spent: The glory of a man is as the flower of the grass,' 1 Peter i.
   24. By the glory of a man is meant whatever excellency we have by
   nature, wit, knowledge, strength of natural parts, as well as wealth
   and riches. Many times we, like the dry stalk, remaineth [32] when the
   flower is gone; nothing but the gracious work of the Spirit will last
   for ever. (3.) Seeming and unsound grace, as false faith, such as
   beginneth in joy, will end in trouble; [33] it easeth you for the
   present, but you shall lie down in sorrow. General probabilities, loose
   hopes, uncertain conjectures, vanishing apprehensions of comfort, all
   these things soon come to nothing. The planting of true faith is
   troublesome at first, but it leadeth to true comfort; otherwise you may
   look upon the gospel with some kind of delectation for a while, as
   thorns may blaze under the pot though they cannot keep in the fire:
   therefore do not rest in tasting the good word,' Heb. vi. 5, in some
   slight and transitory comfort. Again, there is formal profession. Many
   may begin in the Spirit' and end in the flesh,' Gal. iii. 3. A man may
   seem to himself and to the church of God to have true grace; he may
   profess the truth, escape the pollutions of the world,' that is, foul
   gross sins; yea, and all this not out of a carnal aim, but out of a
   slight and insufficient touch of the truth upon the conscience, and yet
   fall away, like the corn in the stony ground, that grew up, but had no
   root. But much more, Christians, will that form which is taken up out
   of private aims fail and miscarry. God delighteth to take off the mask
   and disguise of a hypocrite by letting him fall into some scandalous
   sin, or by changing the times and posture of affairs, or by sending a
   storm. Paint is soon washed off: therefore rest not in these outward
   and superficial changes, till solid and substantial grace be wrought in
   you.

   Use 6. Is comfort to God's children: grace is sure, and the privileges
   of it are sure. Grace itself is sure; through your folly it may be nigh
   unto death, but cannot die. This is the advantage of spiritual
   comforts, that they do not only satisfy our desires, but secure us
   against our fears. The redeemed of the Lord have an everlasting joy,'
   Isa. xxxv. 10. Once in Christ, and for ever preserved in Christ. Grace
   would be little better than temporal things if it did yield but a
   temporary refreshing. They weaken Christian comfort that make believers
   walk with Christ like dancers upon a rope, every moment in fear of
   breaking their necks. This is the comfort of a gracious heart, that as
   nothing shall altogether cut him off from enjoying God, so nothing
   shall utterly make him cease to love God. The children of God would be
   troubled if grace should fail, though their privileges should not be
   cut off; you are sure of both; for as grace is sure, so are also the
   privileges of grace. This was figured under the law; an Israelite could
   never wholly alienate his inheritance and title to the land: Lev. xxv.
   23, His title to the land shall not be cut off, nor sold for ever.'
   This was a type of our spiritual inheritance in Christ, which cannot be
   alienated from us; he might for. a while pass it away, but it was to
   return again; so those that are made co-heirs with Christ are never
   disinherited. It is true we forfeit it by the merit of our actions, but
   God doth not take the advantage of every offence. It is true we lose
   the evidences that are in our keeping, peace of conscience, and joy in
   the Holy Ghost; but the estate itself is indefeasible, and cannot be
   made away from us. Sometimes we are under a kind of sequestration, and
   there is a suspension of comfort and grace; as the Israelite might make
   away his inheritance for a time; but we shall recover possession again,
   though not by ourselves, yet by our Goel, our kinsman, or him that is
   next of blood. As under the law, if a person were not able to redeem
   the inheritance, the kinsman was to redeem it; so Jesus Christ, our
   kinsman after the flesh, he is our Goel, he interposeth by his merit,
   and reconcileth us to God. Well, then, you see grace is kept, and the
   privileges of grace are kept in Christ. But now, because comforts are
   never prized but in their sea son, and men that have not been exercised
   in spiritual conflicts nauseate these sweet truths, they know not what
   it is to be left to uncertainty when troubles come like waves, one in
   the neck of another; therefore let us see when this truth will be most
   sweet and seasonable. (1.) In great troubles, when God seemeth to hide
   his face. Oh! how sweet is it to hear him say, I will not forsake thee
   till I have performed all that I promised thee,' Gen. xxviii. 15; all
   this shall better thy heart and hasten thy glory. In times of distress
   we are apt to think that God hath cast us off, and will never look
   after us more, though formerly we have had real experiences of his
   grace. What a foolish creature is man, to weaken his assurance when he
   should come to use it! to unravel all his hope and experiences in times
   of trouble, which is the only season to make use of them! (2.) In the
   hour of temptation and hard conflicts with doubts and corruptions. When
   we are sensible of the power of sin, and how difficult it is to remove
   it out of the heart, we are apt to say, as David after all his
   experiences, I shall one day perish by the hand of Saul,' 1 Sam. xxvii.
   1; and many times out of distrust give over the combat. Oh! then,
   remember now you are preserved in Christ, and that nothing shall
   separate: as Sarcerius came to Camerarius' wife, when she had been
   exercised with a long and tedious conflict, and read to her the latter
   end of the 8th of the Romans, she brake out in triumph, using Paul's
   words, Nay, in all these things we are more then conquerors.' O
   Christians! neither sin, nor devil, nor world can divide you from
   Christ; for he did not only tread down Satan,' but under your feet.'
   Rom. xvi. 20. (3.) In times of great danger and defection, either
   through error and persecution; as Saunders trembled to think of the
   fire. Especially when others fall fearfully, who were before us in
   knowledge and profession of zeal and piety; when the first become last,
   when glorious luminaries are eclipsed, and leave their orb and station;
   as the martyrs were troubled to hear of the revolt of some great
   scholars that had appeared for the gospel. When Hymeneus and Philetus,
   two eminent professors, fell, there was a great shaking, 2 Tim. ii. 18,
   But the foundation of the Lord standeth sure,' &c.; that is the comfort
   the apostle opposeth in such a case. (4.) In times of disheartening, be
   cause of the difficulties of religion, when the use of means groweth
   troublesome. To quicken you in your Christian course, think of the
   unchangeableness of God's love. All graces rise according to the
   proportion and measure of faith; loose hopes weaken endeavours: 1 Cor.
   ix. 26, I run not as one uncertain.' Those that ran a race gave over
   when one had far outgone them, as being discouraged and without hope.
   When hope is broken, the edge of endeavours is blunted. Go on with
   confidence, you are assured of the issue; God will bless you, and keep
   you to his everlasting kingdom. (5.) In the hour of death. When all
   things else fail you, God will not fail you: this is the last brunt; do
   but wait a little while, and you will find more behind than ever you
   enjoyed; death shall not separate:' as Olevian comforted himself with
   that, Isa. liv. 10, The hills and mountains may depart, but my
   loving-kindness shall not depart from you,' [34] Being in the agonies
   of death, he said, Sight is gone, speech and hearing is departing,
   feeling is almost gone, but the loving-kindness of God will never
   depart. The Lord give us such a confidence in that day, that we may die
   glorying in the preservation of our Redeemer.

   Ver. 2. Mercy unto you, and peace and love be multiplied.

   We are now come to the third thing in the inscription, and that is the
   form of salutation, delivered, as all apostolical salutations are, in
   the way of a prayer. In which we may observe--(1.) The matter of the
   prayer, or blessings prayed for, which are three, mercy, peace, and
   love. (2.) The manner or degree of enjoyment, be multiplied.

   I begin with the matter, or blessings prayed for. It will not be
   altogether unuseful to observe that diversity which is used in
   salutations. In the Old Testament peace was usually wished without any
   mention of grace; as Ps. cxxii. 8, For my brethren and companions' sake
   I will say, Peace be within thee;' and Dan. vi. 25, Peace be multiplied
   unto you.' But in the times of the gospel, grace being more fully
   delivered, that was also added and expressed in the forms of
   salutation. But yet in the times of the gospel there is some variety
   and difference. Sometimes you shall meet with a salutation merely
   civil, as James i. 1, To the twelve tribes chai'rein, greeting;' so
   Acts xv. 23, which was the usual salutation among the heathen; but most
   usually it is grace and peace.' Rom. i. 7; and in other places, grace,
   mercy, and peace,' as 2 John 3 and 1 Tim. i. 2; and here it differeth
   from them all, for it is mercy, peace, and love.' And Causaubon
   observeth that the Greek fathers, if they wrote to a carnal man, they
   would wish him grace, but not peace; if to a godly man, they would wish
   him grace and peace too. To touch upon these things is sufficient. From
   these blessings mentioned in this place I shall observe something in
   general, and then handle them particularly and apart.

   First, In the general consideration you may observe:--

   Obs. 1. That spiritual blessings are the best blessings that we can
   wish to ourselves and others. The apostles in their salutations do not
   wish temporal felicity, but spiritual grace. God's people pray for one
   another out of the communion of the Spirit, and for themselves out of a
   principle of the divine nature; and therefore they do not seek wealth
   and honour for themselves or one another, but increase of God's favour
   and image. It is true, nature is allowed to speak in prayer, but grace
   must be heard first. Our first and chiefest requests must be for mercy,
   peace, and love, and then other things shall be added to us,' Mat. vi.
   33. [35] The way to be heard in other things is first to beg for grace:
   Ps. xxi. 4, He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him length of days
   for ever.' Solomon sought wisdom, and together with it found riches and
   honour in great abundance. Well, then, if thou prayest for thyself,
   make a wise choice, beg for spiritual blessings. So David prayeth, Ps.
   cvi. 4, Remember me, O Lord, with the favour that thou bearest unto
   thine own people.' Nothing less would content him than favour ites'
   mercy. Other blessings are dispensed out of common pity to the
   generality of men; but these are mercies privilegiate, and given to
   favourites. Now, saith David, Of this mercy, Lord. No common blessing
   would serve his turn. So Ps. cxix. 132, Look upon me, and be merciful
   to me, as thou usest to do to those that love thy name.' Surely that
   which God giveth to his people, that is a better mercy than that which
   God giveth to his enemies. Again, these are mercies that cost God
   dearer. They flow to you in the blood of his Son; yea, they are mercies
   that are better in themselves. Wealth and honour may become a burden,
   yea, life itself may become a burden, but not mercy, not grace, not
   peace of conscience; and therefore they are better than life,' Ps.
   lxiii. 3, than wealth, than honour. None ever complained of too much
   mercy, of too much love of God. These are blessings that swallow up
   other miseries, yea, the loss of other blessings. Grace with poverty,
   it is a preferment, James i. 9. Peace of conscience with outward
   troubles is a happy condition. If there be a flowing of spiritual
   comforts, 2 Cor. i. 5, as there is an ebbing of outward comforts, we
   are not much wronged. Therefore first seek these blessings. Again, if
   you pray for others, pray for grace in the first place. That is an
   evidence of spiritual affection. Carnal men wish such things to others
   as they prize and affect themselves; so also do gracious men, and
   therefore their thoughts run more upon mercy, peace, and grace than
   wealth and honour and greatness. When a man sendeth a token to a
   friend, he would send the best of the kind. These are the best mercies.
   If you were to deal with God for your own souls, you can ask no better.
   You may ask temporal things, for God loveth the prosperity of his
   saints;' but these special blessings should have the preferment in your
   wishes and desires of good to them, and then you are most likely to
   speed. Our Lord Christ, in the 17th of John, commendeth the college of
   the apostles to the Father; and what doth he ask for them? dominion and
   worldly respect? Surely no; nothing but preservation from evil, and
   sanctification by the truth. These are the chiefest blessings we should
   look after as Christians.

   Obs. 2. Observe, again, the aptness of the requests to the persons for
   whom he prayeth. Those that are sanctified and called' have still need
   of mercy, peace, and love.' They need mercy, because we merit nothing
   of God, neither before grace received nor afterward. The very
   continuance of our glory in heaven is a fruit of mercy, not of merit.
   Our obligation to free grace never ceaseth. We need also more peace.
   There are degrees in assurance as well as faith. There is a temperate
   confidence, and there are ravishing delights, so that peace needs to be
   multiplied also. And then love, that being a grace in us, it is always
   in progress. In heaven only it is complete. Take it for love to God;
   there we cleave to him without distraction and weariness or satiety.
   God in communion is always fresh and new to the blessed spirits. And
   take it for love to the saints; it is only perfect in heaven, where
   there is no ignorance, pride, partialities, and factions--where Luther
   and Zuinglius, Hooper and Ridley, join in perfect concert.

   Obs. 3. Again, observe the aptness of these requests to the times
   wherein he prayed, when religion was scandalised by loose Christians,
   and carnal doctrines were obtruded upon the church. In times of
   defection from God, and wrong to the truth, there is great need of
   mercy, peace, and love. Of mercy, that we may be kept from the snares
   of Satan. Christians, whence is it that any of us stand? that we are
   found faithful? It is because we have obtained mercy. They would
   deceive, if it were possible, the very elect,' Mat. xxiv. 24. Why is it
   not possible to deceive the elect as well as others? of what mould are
   they made? wherein do they differ from other men? I answer--Elective
   grace and mercy interposeth; it is not for any power in themselves, but
   because mercy hath singled them out, and chosen them for a distinct
   people unto God. And we need peace and inward consolations, that we may
   the better digest the misery of the times; and love, that we may be of
   one mind, and stand together in the defence of the truth.

   Obs. 4. Again, note the aptness of the blessings to the persons for
   [36] whom he prayeth. Here are three blessings, that do more eminently
   and distinctly suit with every person of the Trinity; and I do the
   rather note it, because I find the apostle elsewhere distinguishing
   these blessings by their proper fountains; as Rom. i. 7, Grace to you,
   and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.' Sort the
   blessings right; there is grace from the Father, and peace from Christ.
   So here is mercy from God the Father, who is called the Father of
   mercies, and the God of all comfort,' 2 Cor. i. 3; and peace from the
   Son, for he is our peace,' Eph. ii. 14; and love from the Spirit: Rom.
   v. 5 , The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost,
   which is given to us.' Thus you see every person concurreth to our
   happiness with his distinct blessing.

   Obs. 5. In the next place, how aptly these blessings are suited among
   themselves: first mercy, then peace, and then love. Mercy doth not
   differ much from that which is called grace in Paul's epistles, only
   grace doth more respect the bounty of God, as mercy doth our want and
   need. By mercy, then, is meant the favour and good-will of God to
   miserable creatures; and peace signifieth all blessings inward and
   outward, as the fruits and effects of that favour and good-will; more
   especially calmness and serenity of conscience, or a secure enjoying of
   the love of God, which is the top of spiritual prosperity. And then
   love sometimes signifieth God's love to us; here I should rather take
   it for our love to God, and to the brethren for God's sake. So that
   mercy is the rise and spring of all, peace is the effect and fruit, and
   love is the return. He beginneth with mercy, for that is the fountain
   and beginning of all the good things which we enjoy: higher than love
   and mercy we cannot go, for God's love is the reason of itself, Deut.
   vii. 7, 8; Rom. ix. 15; Isa. xlv. 15, and we can deserve nothing at
   God's hands but wrath and misery; and therefore we should still honour
   mercy, and set the crown upon mercy's head (as further anon); that
   which you give to merit you take from mercy. Now the next thing is
   peace. Mark the order still; without mercy and grace there can be no
   true peace: Isa. lvii. 21, There is no peace, saith my God, to the
   wicked;' they say, Peace, peace,' but my God doth not say so. Christ
   left his peace with his own disciples, John xiv. 27, and not as worldly
   and external peace is left, in the happiness of which both good and bad
   are concerned; that is general, but this is proper, confined, within
   the conscience of him that enjoyeth it, and given to the godly. It is
   the Lord's method to pour in first the oil of grace,' and then the oil
   of gladness.' Alas! the peace of a wicked man it is but a frisk or fit
   of joy, whilst conscience, God's watchman, is napping; stolen waters
   and bread eaten in secret,' Prov. ix. 17. The way to true peace is to
   apply yourselves to God for mercy to be accepted in Christ, to be
   renewed according to the image of Christ; otherwise sin and guilt will
   create fears and troubles. Again, the last thing is love; great
   privileges require answerable duty. Mercy and peace need another grace,
   and that is love. It is God's gift as well as the rest; we have graces
   from God as well as privileges, and therefore he beggeth love as well
   as mercy and peace; but it must be our act, though we have the grace
   from above. We would all have mercy and peace, but we are not so
   zealous to have love kindled in our hearts. Mercy, peace, all this
   runneth downward, and respects our interest, but love, that mounteth
   upward, and respects God himself. Certainly they have no interest in
   mercy, and were never acquainted with true peace, that do not find
   their hearts inflamed with love to God and a zeal for his glory; that
   as he hath ordered all things for our profit, so we may order and refer
   all things to his glory and honour. Mercy runneth down from God, and
   begets peace of conscience, for peace of conscience is nothing else but
   a solid taste of God's mercy; and peace of conscience begets love, by
   which we clasp about God again; for love is nothing else but a
   reverberation or beating back of God's beam upon himself, or a return
   of duty in the sense of mercy; so that God is at the beginning and
   ending, and either way is the utmost boundary of the soul: [37] all
   things are from him and to him.

   Secondly, Let me handle them particularly and apart. And first, mercy,
   which is the rise and cause of all the good we have from God. The Lord
   would dispense blessings in such a way as might beat down despair and
   carnal confidence. Man hath need of mercy, but deserveth none. Despair
   would keep us from God, and carnal confidence robbeth him of his glory;
   therefore, as the Lord would not have flesh to glory, so neither to be
   cut off from all hope. Mercy salveth both; we need not fly the sight of
   God: there is mercy with him, why he should be feared, 7 Ps. cxxx. 4.
   False worships are supported by terror; but God, that hath the best
   title to the heart, will gain it by love and offers of mercy. And we
   have no reason to ascribe anything to ourselves, since mercy doth all
   in the court of heaven, and not justice. If you reckon upon a debt, you
   are sure to miss. It is a part of God's supremacy that all his
   blessings should come as a gift; that he should act freely, and
   entertain us as a king, not as an host. Merit taketh off something of
   his royalty and supreme majesty. Touching the mercy of God, give me
   leave to give you a few observations.

   1. It is the aim of the whole scripture to represent God merciful. [38]
   It is true, God is infinitely just, as well as infinitely merciful; but
   he delighteth in gracious discoveries of himself to the creature; he
   counteth it his glory. Moses was earnest with God to show him his
   glory, and then God proclaimeth his name: Exod. xxxiv. 5, 6, The Lord,
   the Lord, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in
   goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity,
   transgression, and sin,' &c. In this description there is more spoken
   of his mercy than of his justice; and, first, his mercy is described,
   and then his justice; for justice is only added to invite men to take
   hold of his mercy, and to show that justice is never exercised but in
   avenging the quarrel of abused mercy. So he is called a God of pardon,'
   Neh. ix. 17, as if wholly made up of sweetness. So 2 Cor. i. 3, he is
   called pate`r oikti'rmom, Father of mercies, and God of all
   consolations.' He is a just God, but he is not called the Father of
   justice. Mercy is natural to him; he counteth it as the proper fruit
   and product of the divine essence.

   2. Mercy is represented as his delight and pleasure: so Micah vii. 18,
   Mercy pleaseth him.' It is an act exercised with complacency. Judgment
   is called his strange work,' Isa. xxviii. 21. God loveth to bless and
   protect; to destroy is not suitable to his disposition; it is a thing
   that he is forced to. Punitive acts in the representations of the word
   are most against his bowels, drawn and extorted from him; [39] as Jer.
   xliv. 22, The Lord could no longer bear because of your doings: their
   sins were so clamorous that they would not let God be quiet; he would
   bear no longer, unless they would make an idol of him. But now all acts
   of grace and favour are exercised with delight: I will rejoice over
   them to do them good,' Jer. xxxii. 41. It is as pleasing to God to do
   it as it is to us to receive it. The scripture, after the manner of
   men, doth often represent a conflict in the attributes about sinners;
   and if mercy get the upper hand, it is always with joy and triumph:
   James ii. 13, Mercy rejoiceth over judgment;' but if he be compelled to
   strike, and justice must be exercised, the scriptures represent a
   reluctation in his bowels: Lam. iii. 33, He doth not afflict willingly,
   nor grieve the children of men;' in the original, from his heart;' but
   is like a father, with a rod in his hand, and tears in his eyes.

   3. The scripture representeth God as exercising mercy, though with some
   present disadvantage to his glory; as mercy to the Ninevites, though
   the credit of his message lay at stake: Nineveh shall be destroyed in
   forty days;' yet God spared it, and therefore Jonah, in a pet,
   challengeth him for it: Jonah iv. 2, Lord, was not this my saying when
   I was in my country? for I knew that thou wert a gracious God.' As if
   he said, I knew it would come to this; that the prophets of Israel
   should be disgraced before the men of Nineveh; and to threaten
   judgments in his name is to expose ourselves to derision. When we have
   done our errand, free grace will make us all liars. To this effect did
   he expostulate with God. God might easily destroy sinners with much
   honour to himself; but he is long-suffering, even then when his
   patience for a while seemeth to impair the revenues of heaven. The
   world suspects his being, the saints quarrel his justice and question
   his love, and all because the wicked are prosperous, and God keepeth
   silence. The great stumbling-block at which most have dashed the foot
   of their faith, is the suspension of due judgments. What was the
   effects of his patience to them of Assyria and Babylon? The Lord
   himself telleth you, Isa. lii. 5, My name every day is blasphemed.'
   That was all he got by it: his people suffered in person, and God
   himself in his reputation; all that he got was blasphemies, and
   reproaches, and injuries: so Ps. 1. 21, I kept silence, and thou
   thoughtest that I was every way like thyself;' that was the
   effect--gross conceits of his glory and essence. When judgments are
   quick and speedy, the world is under greater awe, the confidence of the
   saints is strengthened and supported, and God's honour is more clear
   and un stained; yet, with all these disadvantages to his glory, if we
   may speak so, God forbeareth. Certainly his heart is much set upon the
   honour of his mercy, that God will glorify it though other attributes
   seem to suffer loss.

   4. The scriptures speak much of his readiness to receive returning
   sinners. Though they have done infinite wrong to his holiness, yet upon
   repentance, and as soon as they begin to submit, mercy embraceth and
   huggeth them, as if there had been no breach: Luke xv. 20, I will go to
   my father,' and the father ran to meet him.' So Isa. lxv. 24, Before
   they call,' &c. So Ps. xxxii. 5.'1 said, and thou forgavest,' &c. So
   Jer. xxxi. 18, with 20, I have heard Ephraim be moaning himself,' &c.;
   and presently, O my dear and pleasant child!' The first relentings of
   the creature work upon the bowels of mercy. Love's pace is very swift,
   it runneth to meet a returning sinner. Christ cometh skipping over the
   mountains,' Cant. ii. 8. He thinketh that he can never be soon enough
   with us. He would fain have the company of sinners, and therefore
   meeteth them more than half-way. When we but conceive a purpose, we
   presently receive the fruit of his early mercies.

   5. God doth not only admit them to come, but of his own accord inviteth
   them that are slack and backward. The scriptures do every where record
   the intreaties of God: he draweth us with cords of love; cords that are
   woven and spun out of Christ's heart and bowels. In one place thus,
   Cant. iv. 8, Come away from Lebanon, my sister, my spouse, from the
   lions' dens, from the mountains of leopards.' Christ's love is hot and
   burning, he thinketh we tarry too long from his embraces. So Cant. v.
   2, Open to me, my sister, my spouse,' &c. Christ stands begging for
   entrance. Lost man! do but suffer me to save thee; poor sinner! suffer
   me to love thee. These are the charms of gospel rhetoric. So Isa.
   xlix., Hearken to me, and attend to the words of my mouth,' &c. O
   sinners! you will not hearken to me for the good of your souls! You see
   none singeth so sweetly as the bird of paradise, the turtle that
   chirpeth upon the church's hedges, that he may cluck sinners to
   himself. The scripture is full of such a holy witchcraft, such
   passionate charms, to entice souls to their happiness.

   6. They that constantly refuse the offers of his grace are borne with
   for a long time: Rom. ix. 22, polle` makrothumi'a, He endured with much
   long-suffering,' &c. All may bless God for patience; they owe a heavy
   debt to divine justice, yet it is a long time ere God putteth the bond
   in suit; though they dare him to his face, yet they walk up and down
   without the arrest of vengeance. He beareth with them years and years,
   after a thousand and a thousand affronts, from their cradles to their
   graves. When they were green wood, they were fuel fit enough for divine
   wrath. Oh! consider, there can be no cause of this but his mercy to his
   worst creatures. It is not out of any delight in sin, for he is holy,
   and cannot endure to look upon it: Hab. i. 13, Of purer eyes,' &c. It
   is not out of any stupid neglect; he is just, and will not clear the
   guilty,' Exod. xxxiv. 7. It is not out of any ignorance; he telleth man
   his thoughts;' nor for want of power; so men forbear. The sons of
   Zeruiah may be too hard for them; but, 1 Sam. xxiv. 19, If a man
   findeth his enemy, will he let him go well away?' When they are in our
   power, we satisfy our wrath and revenge to the full. But now God
   upholdeth all things by the word of his power;' he can in a minute
   speak us into nothing. As the impression of a seal upon the water
   dependeth upon the seal, if the seal be taken away the impression
   vanisheth; so do our beings depend upon providential influence and
   supportation. If God should withdraw the word of his power, we should
   soon vanish and disappear; therefore it is not for want of power, but
   merely out of mercy that we are forborne. How may we wonder at this! We
   are of eager and tart spirits, sharp-set upon revenge. Could we have
   put up so many refusals of love, such despites done to mercy, such
   wrongs, such grievings of spirit, and yet have contained? The disciples
   themselves, though holy men, when they were sensible of being slighted
   in the village of Samaria, called for fire from heaven,' Luke ix. 54.
   Certainly we could not endure such a contradiction of sinners. If
   thunderbolts were in our power we should soon kindle a burning, and
   turn the world into smoke and desolation.

   7. It is not only the aim of the word, but of providence, and of all
   the dispensations of God to the creature, to represent him merciful.
   The whole world is a great volume, written within and without with
   characters and lines of mercy: Ps. cxlv. 9, His mercy is over all his
   works.' Every creature beareth the marks and prints of divine goodness
   and bounty. Once more, the world is a great theatre and stage whereon
   mercy has been acting its part for these six thousand years. Justice is
   to have a solemn triumph at the last day. Now and then God hath kept a
   petty sessions, and given us occasion to say, Yerily there is a God
   that judgeth the world,' as well as preserveth the world. But the
   greatest part that hath been acted upon the theatre of the world is
   mercy; as you will easily see, if you consider--(1.) The black lines of
   providence. If God threaten, it is that he may not punish; if he
   punish, it is that he may not punish for ever. In the sadder
   providences, though there be misery at the top, yet there is mercy at
   the bottom. Many times God threateneth, but it is to reclaim; though he
   doth not change his counsel, yet he doth often change his sentence,
   [40] Jer. xviii. 7, 8: when the message is nothing but plucking up and
   pulling down, free grace cometh in with a sudden rescue, and prevents
   the execution. Mercy, you see, is forced to use all methods, and to
   speak in the language of justice, that men may be more capable to
   receive it. Sometimes God punisheth, but with what aim? That he may not
   for ever punish. It is we that make punishment to be a pledge of
   eternal damnation; in its own aim it is a prevention, and so it proveth
   to the elect: We are judged of the Lord, that we may not be condemned
   with the world,' 1 Cor. xi. 32. So Hosea ii. 6, I will hedge up her way
   with thorns,' &c. We should soon grow worldly, and drowned in carnal
   business and projects, if God did not come now and then and blast our
   enterprises, and make us see our folly. We are puffed up, and God
   pricketh the bladder, 2 Cor, xii. 7. How sweet is this, when in the
   midst of judgment God remembereth mercy!' Yea, the very executions of
   justice are found to be one of the methods of mercy. In the middle of
   the first curse God dropped out a promise of the blessed seed; so often
   mercy overtaketh a judgment, and maketh it cease in the midway. Look,
   as there was a conflict between the twins in Tamar's womb, Zarah did
   put out the hand, but Pharez broke out first; so is there between God's
   mercy and justice: justice puts out the hand in a threatening, or some
   beginnings of a judgment, but mercy gets the start and breaketh out
   first. (2.) Consider the white lines of providence. He entreateth that
   he may do us good, and doth us good that he may do us good for ever.
   For his entreaties: It is not duty so much that is in the bottom of the
   exhortation as mercy. To glorify mercy is the last aim of God and his
   eternal purpose: He hath accepted us in the beloved, to the praise of
   his glorious grace,' Eph. i. 6. God receiveth no profit; he entreateth
   us not that he may be happy, but that he may be liberal. See Prov. ix.
   12, If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself; but if thou
   scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.' God dealeth with us as earnestly,
   as effectually, as if the profit were his own, but it wholly redoundeth
   to us. Again, he doth us good that he may do us good for ever. He
   trusteth us with mammon to prepare us for the true riches, Luke xvi.
   11, and with the riches of grace to prepare us for glory. Look, as men,
   when they would put precious liquor into a vessel, first try it with
   water to see whether it leaketh or no, so doth God try us with common
   mercies; he giveth us an estate in the world, that, being moved with
   his goodness, we may look after an estate in the covenant and an
   interest in Christ, and so fit us for heaven. It is our wretchedness to
   make our table a snare and our welfare a trap. As the sea turneth all
   that it receiveth into salt water, the fresh streams, the influences of
   the heavens, &c., so do carnal men assimilate and corrupt their
   comforts, and by little and little all their blessings are cursed; for
   mercy can bear anything but a constant abuse and neglect of itself.
   Certainly God's revealed will is otherwise; that which cometh from God
   should lead us to God. See Rom. ii. 4, 5.

   8. Consider in how many notions mercy is represented to us. God's mercy
   hath many names; a distinct consideration of them yieldeth an advantage
   in believing; for though they express the same thing, yet every notion
   begetteth a fresh thought, by which mercy is more taken abroad in the
   view of conscience. This is that pouring out of God's name,' spoken of
   Cant. i. 3. Ointment in the box doth not yield such a fragrancy as when
   it is poured out, and spices do not give forth their smell till they
   are chafed. Nothing is more conducible to beget a trust than distinct
   thoughts and conceptions of God's mercy. Let us take notice of some
   places where it is set forth. See Ps. ciii. 8, The Lord is merciful and
   gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.' The expression is
   diversified, and I note it the rather, because in other places the same
   notions of mercy are punctually expressed: see Neh. ix. 17; so Ps.
   cxlv. 8, and in divers other places: Joel ii. 12; Jonah iv. 2; chiefly
   see that Exod. xxxiv. 7, and you will find that this is the very
   description which God hath given of himself. Now what doth the Spirit
   of God aim at in this express enumeration and accumulation of names of
   mercy, but to give us a help in meditation, and that our thoughts may
   be more distinct? (1.) The first notion is mercy, which is an attribute
   whereby God inclineth to succour them that are in misery. It is an
   attribute that merely respecteth the creature. The love and knowledge
   of God first falleth upon himself, but mercy is only transient, and
   passeth out to the creatures. God knoweth himself, loveth himself, but
   he is not merciful to himself. And then it respecteth the creatures in
   misery; for misery is mercy's only motive; justice seeketh a fit
   object, but mercy a fit occasion; justice requireth desert, but mercy
   only want and need. (2.) The next notion is grace, which noteth the
   free bounty of God, and excludeth all merit of the creature. Grace doth
   all gratis, freely.' Rom. iii. 24, though there be no precedent,
   obligation, or debt, or hope of recompense, whereby anything may accrue
   to himself; only that it may be well with the creature. God's external
   motive is our misery, his internal motive is his own grace and elective
   love. Am I in want? there is mercy; am I unworthy? there is grace.
   Mercy respects us as we are in ourselves worthy of condemnation, grace
   as compared with others not elected. The ultimate reason of the choice
   is God's grace. The angels that never sinned are saved merely out of
   grace, but men that were once miserable are saved not only out of
   grace, but also out of mercy. (3.) The next notion is long-suffering,
   or slowness to anger. The Lord is not easily overcome by the wrongs or
   sins of the creature, but easily overcometh them by his own patience
   and goodness. He doth not only pity our misery, that is mercy; and do
   us good for nothing, that is grace; but beareth long with our
   infirmities. Alas! if God were as short and swift in the executions of
   revenge as men are, God must create another world to raise up seed to
   Christ. [41] If he did not wait upon sinners, there would be none made
   saints. We provoked him to cut us off long since, but wrath is not
   easily heightened into rage, and therefore he waiteth that he may be
   gracious,' Isa. xxx. 18. (4.) Kindness or bounty, plenteous in
   goodness,' berab chesid. God's communications of his grace to the
   creature are every way rich and full. You may say, God is merciful,
   gracious, patient, but will he be thus to me? Yes, he is plenteous in
   goodness,' kind and communicative: Ps. cxix. 68, Thou art good, and
   dost good;' therefore David goeth to him for grace. Well, then, study
   God's name, and answer all your discouragements out of the descriptions
   of his mercy.

   9. Consider your own experiences. We have not only heard that God is
   merciful, [42] but we have known it. All men may speak of patience, and
   common mercy, and outward deliverances, but few improve them to a
   spiritual use and purpose. (1.) Consider God's patience; how long hath
   he waited for your conversion? and he that hath spared you can save
   you. It is said, The wages of sin is death.' Rom. vi. 23. The word
   implieth that God is bound to pay it by virtue of an implicit bargain
   and agreement between him and the creature. But as yet the hand of God
   hath not found you out; you are indebted to justice, but mercy stoppeth
   the arrest of vengeance. Many others have been taken away in their sins
   by a sudden arrow and dart from heaven; vengeance hath trodden upon the
   heel of sin; as Zimri and Cosbi unloaded their lusts and their lives
   together; the angels for an aspiring thought were turned out of heaven;
   Gehazi was blasted with leprosy just upon his lie; and Lot's wife
   turned into a stone for a look, a glance upon Sodom; and Herod smitten
   with lice in the midst of his pomp and vainglory: and some have
   perished in the midway,' Ps. ii., in the very heat of some carnal and
   wicked pursuit. God can do the like to you; therefore reason thus: If
   mercy would not save me, why hath mercy spared me? God might have sued
   out the bond long since; what is the meaning of the dispensation? Is
   God weak or unjust? or hath he a mind to be gracious? Surely he would
   not have spared me all this while, if he had not a mind to save my
   soul. Such reasonings as these many times give us the first
   encouragement to apply ourselves to God. Wicked men, like spiders, draw
   other conclusions, Ps. l. 21. But should not his patience, &c., Rom.
   ii. 4. (2.) Consider God's goodness in giving thee food, and clothing,
   and honour, and gladness of heart, and all this without thy desert.
   Say, Certainly all these benefits are but so many baits to catch my
   soul. I see the sun riseth every day with a fresh countenance, and
   shineth upon the fields of just and unjust; to what purpose, but to
   show that God is gracious without hire? This bodily sun is but an
   obscure type of the Sun of Righteousness, that is willing to display
   his beams and wings over a poor languishing soul. Common mercies are
   the tastes of God's love while you are sinners, and the common fruits
   of Christ's death, that you may be invited to come for more. Why hath
   he given me the unrighteous mammon,' but that I may look after the true
   riches'? What a vile unthankful heart should I have, if I should be
   contented with mammon without Christ, and be like Judas, with the bag
   in my hand, and the devil in my heart! God's children are wont to make
   these gifts a step to higher dispensations: they know God, like the
   good householder, bringeth forth the best at last; therefore they must
   have something above and beyond all these things. Common hearts are
   contented with common mercies; but they are still waiting when the
   master of the feast will bid them sit higher. I may have this and be
   damned; where are the arguments of his special love? (3.) Consider
   deliverances from imminent dangers. Then the curse began to seize upon
   you; but God-snatched you out of the fire like brands out of the
   burning,' Amos iv. 11; or like a debtor that escapeth out of the
   sergeant's hands. Every deliverance is a temporary pardon: see Ps.
   lxviii. 38, Then he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity,
   and destroyed them not;' the meaning is, respited vengeance, as
   appeareth by the context. So Mat. xviii. 32, He forgave them the debt;'
   yet it was after required; the meaning is, spared them for the present.
   Thus when God taketh you out of the teeth and jaws of wrath, when you
   are delivered out of sickness and apparent danger, you have a reprieve
   or a temporary pardon. Oh! if you had died, you had died in your sins,
   and so been eternally miserable: if the Lord had taken the present
   advantage, you had been howling a sad note among the screech-owls of
   darkness. For ever blessed be that mercy that made a rescue!

   10. Consider God's invitations. Mercy pointeth and beckoneth to thee to
   come and be saved. How many means hath God used to call thee to
   himself! Every good motion is a call, every preacher a messenger sent
   from heaven to invite thee to Christ, every sermon a new summons. Plead
   with thyself, Though God hath not drawn me, yet he hath warned me. The
   elect have no more favour in the general means than thou hast. Though
   God's grace be limited by the pleasure of his wisdom, yet thou hast a
   fair warrant and encouragement, and every way as good a ground to come
   to Christ as others have: Whosoever,' &c., John vi. 37. When the gospel
   doth not exclude me, why should I exclude myself? Doubts that God will
   not accept me if I come, are but foolish jealousies without a cause.
   But it is time to leave off this meditation upon God's mercy, which
   hath carried me out so far, and to come to the uses.

   Use 1. It informeth us that those that would apply themselves to God
   must make mercy their only plea and claim. Returning sinners have this
   form put into their mouths, Hosea xiv. 2, Take away all iniquity,
   receive us graciously,' Lord, we desire to be entertained by mercy, to
   have our suits dispatched by mercy. So David professeth that he had no
   other claim: Ps. xiii. 5, I have trusted in thy mercy.' Upon which
   Chrysostom [43] sweetly glosseth: If any others have any thing to
   allege, let them plead it; Lord, I have but one thing to say, one thing
   to plead, one thing upon which I cast all my hopes, and that is thy
   mercy. So must you come to the throne of grace: Lord, my plea is mercy,
   all the comfort I expect to receive is from mercy. The apostle, I
   remember, maketh a challenge: Rom. xi. 35, Who hath first given him,
   and it shall be recompensed to him again?' Is there any man that can
   enter this plea, This is due to me? Lord, give me what thou owest, I
   desire no more; let me have no blessing till I do deserve it.
   Merit-mongers [44] are best confuted by experience. Let them use the
   same plea in their prayers which they do in their disputes; let them
   say, Give me not eternal life till I deserve it at thy hand; let them
   dispute thus with God or with their own consciences, when they are in
   the agonies of death, or under the horrors of the Lord's wrath. Surely
   men that cry up the merit of works are men of little spiritual
   experience, and seldom look into their own consciences. Dare they plead
   thus with God in their agonies and horrors? The best claim God's
   dearest servants can make is mercy. Possidius, in the life of Austin,
   reporteth of Ambrose, when he was about to die, he said thus, Though I
   have not lived so that I should be ashamed to live among you, yet I am
   not afraid to die; not that I have lived well, but because I have a
   good and gracious Master. [45] This hath still been the ground of the
   saints' confidence.

   Use 2. It exhorteth us to use this encouragement to bring our souls
   into the presence of God. Think of the mercies of God; the vile abuse
   of this doctrine hath brought a suspicion and prejudice upon it: but
   children must not refuse their bread because dogs catch at it. When
   Benhadad was dejected, and in danger not only of losing his kingdom but
   his life, his servants comforted him with this fame, 1 Kings xx. 31, We
   have heard that the kings of Israel are merciful kings.' You have heard
   how the God of Israel delighteth in mercy. When you come for mercy, you
   speak to his very bowels. You shall read in 2 Sam. xiv. 1, that when
   Joab perceived the king's heart was to Absalom,' then he setteth the
   woman of Tekoah a-begging. The king's heart is to show mercy; he hath
   sworn that he hath no pleasure in thy destruction, Ezek. xviii. 32;
   therefore take courage and come to him. He hath sent Christ to you as a
   pledge of his good will and mercy; why will you not come to him? He
   that had love enough to give us Christ, hath bowels enough to give us
   pardon, and bounty enough to give us heaven, and whatever we stand in
   need of. Fear not his justice; justice and mercy are made friends, Rom.
   iii. 25, 26, and 1 John i. 9. Christ hath taken up the quarrel between
   them; so that nothing hindereth but that God may act according to the
   natural inclination of his own grace. And let not the multitude of your
   sins discourage you: The free gift is of many offences to
   justification.' Rom. v. 16. Take it for the offences of many persons,
   as the context seemeth to carry it, and it is an encouragement to think
   of the multiplied instances of mercy, and how many monuments of free
   grace we shall see when we come to heaven, and that all this while
   mercy is not tired. Or take it for the many offences of the same
   person, and still it is an encouragement that mercy can so often bear
   with our vanity and folly, and not only pardon several sorts of sin,
   but frequent relapses into the same sin. He will multiply to pardon,'
   Isa. lv. 7. If the soul still draw back, and be under discouragement,
   consider your own need. If the Lord were never so tenacious and hard to
   be entreated, yet such is your need that you should follow him with
   incessant complaints. It is blasphemy to wrong his mercy by lessening
   thoughts. But grant the sinner his supposition, yet you should be
   instant, and try what he will do for importunity's sake. See Luke xi.
   8, dia te` anaidei'an, and Luke xviii. 5, i'na me` upopia'ze me`, &c.
   In those parables there is a kind of condescension and yielding to our
   unbelief; as if the Lord had said, If you will not believe all this
   that is said concerning my mercy, yet your want is great; that is
   enough to make you earnest and frequent in your addresses to me; come
   and see what I will do for your importunity; the unjust judge was moved
   with the widow's clamour: be it as you imagine, that I have no bowels
   for creatures' miseries, nor ears for their requests, which yet is a
   blasphemy confuted by every object in the world; the young ravens will
   tell you otherwise, Job xxxviii. 41; Mat. vi. 26; Luke xii. 24; but be
   it so; you are undone if I be not merciful; see what I will do for
   constant asking. Upon all these encouragements be persuaded to make an
   essay: faith at first standeth but upon one weak foot. Who knoweth but
   that God will be gracious?' Jonah iii. 9; Joel ii. 14. There is
   encouragement enough to venture, though we do not know what will come
   of it. Take up a resolution to make trial; you will find better welcome
   than you can expect. God desires to exercise mercy as much as you
   desire to feel it.

   Use 3. It presseth us in all our enjoyments to acknowledge mercy. The
   saints are wont to do so, Eph. ii. 4; 1 Tim. i. 13; Gen. xxxii. 10;
   Phil. ii. 27. It is good to refer all things to their head and proper
   fountain. Everything that we enjoy is the fruit of mercy, especially
   saving grace. It is a sure sign a man hath received no benefit by grace
   if his heart be not stirred up to praise it. We have cause to praise
   God for his mercy above the angels. I mean, not only the bad angels,
   with whom God entered not into a treaty; he dealt with them in justice
   and not in mercy; but even the good angels; in some respects we have
   more cause to bless God than they have. Gratitude respecteth the
   freeness and graciousness in giving, rather than the greatness of the
   benefit. God was bountiful to the angels in making them such excellent
   creatures out of nothing; but he is merciful to us, notwithstanding the
   demerit of our sins. There was no let in his doing good to the angels;
   goodness floweth out freely from a holy God to righteous creatures: but
   wronged justice interposed, and put in a bar against us: so that his
   justice must be satisfied before mercy can have a free course. We are a
   generation of sinful men, the wretched offspring of fallen Adam: we had
   forsaken God, and cast him off, which the angels had not; and
   therefore, though they have a large experience of God's goodness, yet
   they wonder at the grace showed to us, 1 Peter i. 12. But now much more
   is this mercy to be acknowledged if we consider the difference between
   us and other men, who, it may be, excelled us in moral accomplishments;
   but God hath passed them by, choosing us poor things of nought, poor
   base creatures, that the glory might entirely redound to his own grace.
   But especially should this mercy affect us. when it hath made a
   distinction between us and others that were involved in the same guilt;
   when one is taken and another left;' as the bad thief went to his own
   place, when the good thief was taken to paradise; and many of God's
   elect were as deep in sin as those in hell. I say, in all such cases we
   should still be crying out Mercy, mercy; for certainly justice could
   make no such distinction; it awardeth a like punishment to all that are
   found in a like crime; but God's infinite and eternal mercy only maketh
   the difference.

   Use 4. It is caution. Do not wrong grace and mercy, if it be the cause
   of all the good which we enjoy. This is to close up the fountain, and
   to make mercy our enemy; and if mercy be our enemy, who shall plead for
   us? If mercy be an accuser, where shall we get an advocate? But how do
   we wrong grace? I answer--Partly by neglecting the offers of it, when
   you make God speak in vain, 2 Cor. vi. 2. It is a great affront we put
   upon God, to despise him when he speaketh to us in the still voice, and
   all the wooings and pleadings of mercy do not move to look after our
   salvation; though you do not despise, there is danger in bare neglect,
   Heb. ii. 3. [46] When all the charms of mercy do no more work with you
   than a story of golden mountains, or rubies and diamonds fallen from
   heaven in a night dream, this neglect argueth a greater suspicion and
   distrust of God's mercy than doubts and troubles of conscience do.
   Mercy speaketh to them, and they do not think the message worth the
   hearing or regarding. Again, you wrong grace by refusing it out of
   legal dejection, for by this means you straiten the riches, and darken
   the glory of it; as if there were not more in grace than there is in
   sin, or as if an emperor's revenue could not discharge a beggar's debt.
   The prodigal could say, there was bread enough in his father's house.'
   If we perish, it is not for want of mercy, but for want of faith. Grace
   is God's treasure; he is rich in mercy,' Eph. ii. 4. As far as we
   straiten grace, we make him a poorer God. Again, we wrong grace and
   mercy by intercepting the glory of it. It is the greatest sacrilege
   that can be to rob God of his glory, especially of the glory of his
   grace;' for that is his great aim in all his transactions with man, to
   make his grace and mercy glorious; see Eph. i. 6. Now when you think
   God accepteth you rather than others for some worth and good qualities
   that he seeth in you more than others, it may be in this light of the
   gospel which we now enjoy such thoughts are not expressed, but if they
   lurk secretly in the heart, you think God foresaw you would bring him
   more glory, Deut. ix. 4; you take the crown from grace's head, and put
   it upon your own. So also you wrong grace when you ascribe anything to
   your power and strength. As Joab sent for David to take the honour of
   winning Rabbah: 2 Sam. xii. 28, Lest I take the city, and it be called
   after my own name;' so send for God to take the honour: Not I, but
   grace,' 1 Cor. xv. 10. Throw the crown at grace's feet. The industrious
   servant said, Thy pound hath gained ten pounds,' Luke xix. 16; not my
   industry, but thy pound. Once more, we wrong grace by turning it into
   wantonness; see ver. 4. It is made there to be a heavy charge and black
   note when men presume on grace, and use it only as a dung-cart to carry
   away their filth. Grace must bear all, and pardon all; as riotous
   children that have a rich father care not how they spend; his estate
   shall pay for all. It is a mighty wrong to grace this, when you make it
   pliable to such vile purposes, and father the bastards of your own
   carnal hearts upon gospel encouragements. It is the devil's covenant,
   not God's, when you think that you may live as you list, be at your own
   dispose, and mercy shall be at your beck, and you shall have comfort
   when you please; and that you may sin freely because God pardoneth
   freely, as if mercy gave you a privilege and liberty to sin. In short,
   if a man slacken any part of his duty for mercy's sake, or lets loose
   the reins to vile affections with more freedom, upon the presumption
   that God will not be rigorous, he wrongeth grace exceedingly. I say, if
   he grow more careless, secure, negligent, not so constant in duty, not
   so watchful and strict in conversation, or abateth aught of his
   humiliation for sin, he is a spider that sucketh poison out of this
   flower. Lastly, we wrong grace by slighting it after a taste. At first
   coming to Christ we make an essay and trial, and usually then God
   giveth us a taste to engage us to look for more, 1 Peter ii. 3; Heb.
   vi. 4-6. Now after trial you are not satisfied, but return to your
   sinful courses again, and so do, as it were, proclaim to the world that
   you found carnal comforts and pleasures to be better than communion
   with God. This is but the interpretation of your apostasy. The whole
   aim of the word is to persuade us to make trial of the sweetness of
   grace. Now you that have once tasted of it, and grow weary, do by your
   practice tell the world that there is no sweetness in it at all, which
   is a great wrong to grace and mercy.

   It is high time now to speak of the second thing prayed for, which is
   peace; whence observe that peace is a great blessing, one of the main
   privileges of the gospel.

   I shall, first, Show you what it is; secondly, Give you some obser
   vations concerning it; and thirdly, Come to application.

   1. What it is. It is a tranquillity of mind arising from the sense of a
   sure estate with God. To this peace two things concur. First, a sure
   estate, or terms of amity with God. This is called in scripture peace
   with God,' and is the immediate effect and fruit of actual
   justification, Rom. v. 1. And then, secondly, there is a sense of this
   sure estate, or the reflex of this amity upon the conscience, and is
   usually called peace of conscience,' and is a special privilege of
   Christ's spiritual kingdom. See Rom. xiv. 17; the apostle speaketh
   there of a peace,' which is ranked with joy in the Holy Ghost.' But it
   will be better opened to you in the ensuing propositions.

   [1.] Man by nature is at enmity with God, and upon ill terms with him.
   When we lost God's image, we lost his favour. This enmity is mutual;
   man is an enemy to God, and God is an enemy to man. On God's part there
   is wrath, which is all that we are born to by nature, Eph. ii. 3; and
   on man's part there is hatred; we hate God because we love sin, Col. i.
   21. God's enmity is suspended in the day of his patience. Now and then
   wrath breaketh out, but it is not executed to the full; sentence is
   passed, but not executed. Nay, it may be reversed if we take sanctuary
   at grace; for God is now upon a treaty with us, or offer of peace;
   therefore it is said peace on earth,' Luke ii. 14. The next world is a
   time of vengeance and recompense; but during our earthly state God
   wooeth us and inviteth us to lay down the weapons of our defiance, and
   accept of terms of peace. Thus matters stand on God's part. But now on
   our part this enmity is carried on with a great deal of spite. We seek
   to destroy God, and to deface all the memorials of him that are
   impressed upon the conscience; we ungod him in our thoughts and
   affections. It is a pleasing thought to us to suppose if there were no
   God, as guilty prisoners wish there were no judge, no assizes, that
   they may not be called to account.

   [2.] Man being at enmity with God, all God's creatures are at enmity
   with him. Angels, men, fire, air, water, they are all at God's beck,
   and are ready to destroy man whenever the Lord biddeth them; as good
   subjects take part with their prince against rebels. The angels hearken
   for the voice of his word,' Ps. ciii. If he do but hiss for the fly of
   Egypt,' Isa. vii. 18, it is ready presently. It is ill contesting with
   him that can command legions. The fire saith, Let me burn his house or
   dwelling-place; the water saith, Let me drown his ships; the earth, Let
   me swallow him up quick, as I did Korah and his accomplices. Certainly
   the Lord cannot want instruments of vengeance. Man as God's creature is
   his own enemy. God needeth not fetch forces from without, there is
   enough within; the humours of the body, the passions of the mind, all
   these are willing to serve God as creatures for our punishment; so that
   if God should but arm our own thoughts, our own affections against us,
   man is soon overwhelmed. Who can bear the wounds given him by his own
   conscience?

   [3.] We, being in this estate, can only be reconciled by Jesus Christ.
   He obtaineth it by his merit, and conferreth it by his power. For his
   merit, see Col. i. 20, and Isa. liii. 5, The chastisement of our peace
   was upon him.' It will not stand with the majesty of God to make peace
   with us without satisfaction. That there might be no wrong done to his
   sovereignty, his law, his truth, his justice, his holiness, it was meet
   that we should be chastised either in our own persons or in our surety;
   and also all the notions of the Godhead are kept inviolable. Then for
   his power: He worketh it at first, and then maintaineth and keepeth it
   afoot between God and us. He worketh it at first, and bringeth it about
   thus, by opening the gospel, wherein God is revealed as pacified in
   Christ; which is the only doctrine that can calm the conscience, and
   establish the soul in peace and hope. All false religions are
   accompanied with scruples and jealousies: Jer. vi. 16, there is no rest
   for the soul.' And then he applieth the gospel by his Spirit. The
   gospel is a sovereign plaster, but Christ's own hand must make it
   stick. There is a double ground of enmity in man's heart--the guilt and
   power of sin. Christ wipeth guilt out of the conscience by the
   application of his own blood, and weakeneth the power of sin more and
   more. Sin is the makebate, and Christ is the Prince of peace,' Isa. ix.
   6. The great end for which God set him up, was to plant grace in our
   hearts, and so to work a friendship between God and us. But Christ is
   not only the author, but the great conservator of the peace between us
   and heaven. Partly by his intercession: as foreign states have their
   agents in princes' courts to preserve a mutual correspondence, so
   Christ taketh up all differences that fall out between us and God, that
   no breach may ensue, Heb. ix. 24. Partly by a further declaration of
   God's love to the conscience, Isa. xxvi. 3. Partly by stirring us up to
   watchfulness, that no occasion may be given on our part by returning to
   folly,' Ps. lxxxv. 8. Thus you see what Christ doth: all is briefly
   summed up by the apostle in 2 Cor. v. 19, God was in Christ reconciling
   the world.' Where note, that our peace with God is a reconciliation or
   a peace after a breach, and this reconciliation is mutual. God
   appeareth in a form of grace and mercy to us, and we lay down our
   enmity against God; he is gracious to us, and we love and serve him.
   Only observe, that God beginneth first, though he be the wronged party;
   he was reconciling.' And mark again, it is in Christ' to show it is
   sure. Those that are reconciled to men are still in umbrage and
   suspicion with them; they that have once been enemies, they may be
   again; therefore they do not return to perfect grace; [47] when the
   wound is cured, the scars remain. But our reconciliation with God, it
   is like the soldering of a vessel, which is strongest in the crack; or
   as a leg broken, if well set, it is the stronger; so are we upon firmer
   terms than we were in innocency; there was a possibility of being at
   odds with God, which is now taken away.

   [4.] God being reconciled in Christ, all things else are at peace with
   us, tranquillus Deus tranquillat omnia. For his league with us is
   offensive and defensive: My horses are as thy horses, and my chariots
   as thy chariots.' God and all his confederates are in the league, or
   rather God and all his subjects, as a prince doth not only contract for
   his person, but his subjects and estates. Angels are at peace with us;
   instead of being instruments of vengeance, they become ministering
   spirits,' Heb. i. 14. A Christian hath an invisible guard; Satan is
   sensible of it, though we be not; he saith of Job, Thou hast hedged him
   round about.' God's heirs are well attended; angels wait upon them at
   Christ's direction. Other creatures serve us, as if they were in league
   and covenant with us; stars, winds, seas, beasts: Job v. 23, Thou shalt
   be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts shall be at
   peace with thee.' They are included in God's league, which is as much
   as if there were an express covenant between us and them that they
   shall not do us harm: they are at the beck of providence, and
   therefore, so far as it conduceth to our good, at our service. So Hosea
   ii. 18, I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field,
   and the fowls of the heaven,' &c. So for men; they are wolves one to
   another, yet God can change them. The gospel civiliseth, and pulleth
   the beast out of men's bosoms where it worketh least, [48] see Isa. xi.
   7-9. The hearts of men are in God's hands; he can either destroy their
   persons, or restrain their rage, or turn out their respects to you:
   When a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh his enemies to be at peace
   with him,' Prov. xvi. 7. We think to carry all by force and violence
   many times, but obedience to God is the best way to gain the respects
   of men, as a key openeth a door sooner than an iron bar. If you be in
   with God, you stop enmity and strife at the fountainhead. So for peace
   with the saints; Jesus Christ breaketh down the partition wall, Eph.
   ii. 16-18, removeth prejudices and jealousies, changeth interests,
   cleareth up truths, and by his Spirit meekeneth their hearts that they
   may be at one. Surely his blood is the best cement and bond of
   friendship. [49] Christ hath called us into a body, that there might be
   peace in the church, Col. iii. 15. Brothers have defaced the feelings
   of nature, but fellow-members are wont to care one for another. Peace
   with fellow-saints was his dying charge, his legacy, John xiv. 27, his
   prayer, John xvii., and his constant care now he is in heaven. Then for
   peace with ourselves. Sin rendeth and teareth a man from himself; it
   maketh a mutiny in his own heart, Rom. ii. 15, thoughts accusing and
   excusing by turns,' met' alle'lon. A man and his conscience are at
   odds, and a man and his affections. Now, we being reconciled to God,
   the foundation is laid for peace of conscience, that we and our hearts
   may talk together as loving friends, without scolding, without
   reproaching. And then grace giveth us a calm and contented spirit,
   which easeth us of a great deal of trouble, for a discontented man is
   his own burden. We need the peace of God not only in our consciences,
   but to bear rule in our hearts, Col. iii. 16, that we may refer all
   matters to God's disposal, Ps. iv. 8.

   [5.] Though all things are at peace with us; yet some troubles are left
   for our exercise, but not for our hurt and destruction. The peace of
   God it is a very riddle: Phil. iv. 7, It passeth all understanding.' To
   sense who more wretched than God's children, hated, reviled,
   persecuted, afflicted? How are they at peace with God and all his
   creatures? I answer--The privileges of Christ's kingdom are spiritual:
   whatever troubleth the saints, nothing can harm them, 1 Peter iii. 13.
   They may harm the man, but not the Christian. All things are at peace
   with them, because they are at the disposal of a wise and gracious
   providence, and cannot do hurt to the better part: they work for good.
   Death is at peace with them, which doth the greatest hurt to the body.
   Ask old Simeon and he will tell you so: Luke ii. 29, Lord, now lettest
   thy servant depart in peace,' &c. They are sent for by their friend;
   the king of fears is a grim messenger, but they know his errand, and
   therefore are not afraid.

   [6.] In heaven there is a perfect peace; in the new Jerusalem all is
   quiet: It is just with God to give you that are troubled, a'nesin,
   rest,' 2 Thes. i. 7; and there is a rest that remaineth for the
   children of God,' Heb. iv. 9. There we rest both from our sorrows and
   our labours; there is no trouble nor affliction more; all privileges
   are at the height; no more apprehensions of God's wrath, fears of
   death. There we are not only free from hurt, but danger; our exercise
   is at an end: there we do immediately behold the king's face, which is
   not granted us here; now we are in Absalom's condition, pardoned,
   reconciled, but cannot see the king's face. So much for the nature of
   this peace, and the observations that open it to you. Let us now apply
   all.

   Use 1. If peace be such an excellent blessing, and a main privilege of
   the gospel, then it puts us upon trial. Are we at peace with God
   through Christ? If it be so, then--(1.) Enmity is laid aside; God's
   enemies will be yours, and yours will be God's; otherwise what peace?
   What! do we talk of peace with God, as long as we are in league with
   God's enemy? What peace as long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel
   are so many?' Our league with God is defensive and offensive. There is
   a war with Satan, [50] if we be at peace with God: the spiritual
   conflict is the best evidence we have of our unity with God. With the
   wicked, God is at open war: There is no peace,' &c., Isa. lvii. 21. The
   devil may be at a secret peace with them, but God is at a distance, and
   abhorreth all communion with them. Christ is called the Prince of
   peace,' Isa. ix. 6; but it is to those that submit to his government;
   to his subjects, he saith, Take my yoke upon yon, and ye shall find
   rest,' Mat. xi. 29. We are not in a capacity to receive this blessing
   till we take an oath of allegiance to Christ, and continue in obedience
   to him. (2.) The next note is, delight in communion with God: Job xxii.
   21, Acquaint thyself with him, and be at peace.' A man that is at peace
   with God will be often in his company: bondage and servile awe keepeth
   us out of God's presence; we cannot come to him, because we cannot come
   in peace. A man never delighteth in duties of commerce with God when
   either he hath a false peace or no peace: duties disturb a false peace;
   and when we are raw and sour, we are unfit for work. When a peace is
   concluded between nations that were before at war, trading is revived:
   so will it be between God and you; commerce will be revived, and you
   will be trading into heaven, that you may bring away rich treasures of
   grace and comfort.

   Use 2. It presseth us to make peace with God by Christ. We speak to two
   sorts--the careless and the distressed. (1.) To the careless. Consider
   you are born enemies to God: they that loved him from their cradle
   upward, never loved him. You must make peace with God, for you cannot
   maintain war against him: Are you stronger than he?' What! will you arm
   lusts against angels? And do you know the terror of his wrath? One
   spark of it is enough to drink up all your blood and spirits, Job vi.
   4. The present life is but a vapour, soon gone. If God be angry, he can
   arm the least creature to kill you: the whole creation taketh part with
   God: Adrian was strangled with a gnat. But death will not end your
   sorrows. None can punish their enemies as God can; he can ruin your
   body and soul for ever and for ever. How will you screech and howl like
   dragons? But your torments are without end and without ease. Be wise,
   then, and do not sleep when your damnation sleepeth not,' 2 Peter ii.
   3; now is the time to make your peace with God. Ah! that you knew in
   this your day the things that belong to your peace,' Luke xix. 41.
   Peace must be had now, or else it can never be had hereafter. The day
   of patience will not always last; therefore let us get into the ark
   before the flood cometh. It is a dreadful thing to be under the wrath
   of God, and you know not how soon it will light: our care should be to
   be found of him in peace,' Peter iii. 14. Christ is now a Saviour, then
   a judge: you will yell and howl for mercy when it is too late. (2.) I
   am to speak to distressed consciences. Lift up your heads, God offereth
   you peace; he sent angels from heaven to proclaim it, Luke ii. 14. The
   ground of the offer is good-will, and the end of the offer is only his
   own glory. God hath no other reasons to move him to it but his own
   good-will, and no other aim than to glorify his grace; see Eph. i. 6;
   and therefore take hold of his covenant of peace, as it is called, Isa.
   liv. 10. He is content we shall have peace upon these terms, and peace
   assured us by covenant. Certainly it is not a duty to doubt, nor a
   thing accept able to God, that we should always be upon terms of
   perplexity, and keep conscience raw with a sense of wrath and sin:
   wherefore did Christ bear the chastisement of our peace'? God is more
   pleased with a cheerful confidence than a servile spirit, full of
   bondage and fear.

   Use 3. It is caution. If peace be a privilege of the gospel, let us
   take care that we settle upon a right peace, lest we mistake a judgment
   for a blessing. It is the greatest judgment that can be, to _be given
   up to our own secure presumptions, and to be lulled asleep with a false
   peace. When the pulse doth not beat, the body is in a dangerous estate;
   so when conscience is benumbed, and smiteth not, it is very sad. The
   grounds of a false and carnal peace are--(1.) Ignorance of our
   condition. Many go hoodwinked to hell; a little light breaking in would
   trouble all, Rom. vii. 9. Sluttish corners are not seen in the dark.
   Things are naught that cannot brook a trial; [51] so you may know that
   it is very bad with men when they will not come to the light,' John
   iii. 20, or cannot endure to be alone, lest conscience should return
   upon itself, and they be forced to look inward; their confidence is
   supported by mere ignorance. (2.) Sensuality. Some men's lives are
   nothing else but a diversion from one pleasure to another, that they
   may put off that which they cannot put away; there is bondage in their
   consciences, and they are loath to take notice of it: Amos vi. 3, They
   drink wine in bowls, and put far away the evil day.' This is to quench
   the spirit' without a metaphor. All their pleasures are but stolen
   waters, and bread eaten in secret;' frisks of mirth when they can get
   conscience asleep. Cain's heart was a trouble to him, therefore he
   falleth a-building of cities. Saul, to cure the evil spirit, ran to his
   music; and so usually men choke conscience either with business or
   pleasures. (3.) From formality and slightness in the spiritual life.
   First, either they do not seriously perform duty; that will make men
   see what carnal, unsavoury, sapless spirits they have. He that never
   stirreth doth not feel the lameness of his joints. Formal duties make
   men the more secure; as the Pharisee thought himself in a good case,
   because, &c., Luke xviii. 11; but spiritual duties search us to the
   purpose, as new wine doth old bottles. Or else, secondly, they do not
   exasperate their lusts, and seriously resist sin. Tumult is made by
   opposition. When a man yieldeth to Satan, no wonder that Satan lets him
   alone: Luke xi. 21, The goods are in peace,' because the devil's
   possession is not disturbed; he rageth most when his kingdom is
   tottering, Rev. xii. 12. Please the worst natures, and they will not
   trouble you. There is no tempest where wind and tide go together. You
   let Satan alone, and he lets you alone; this is a peace that will end
   in trouble.

   I now come to speak of the third thing prayed for, and that is love,
   which, being taken here, not for God's love to us, but our love to God,
   may be thus defined:--It is a gracious and holy affection, which the
   soul, upon the apprehension of God's love in Christ, returneth back to
   God again by his own grace. The grounds and causes of it are two; the
   one worketh by way of argument and suasion, the other by way of
   efficacy and power.

   1. It ariseth from the sense and apprehensions of God's love in Christ.
   Love is like a diamond, that is not wrought upon but by its own dust: 1
   John iv. 19, We love him, because he loved us first.' Love is like an
   echo, it returneth what it receiveth; it is a reflex, a reverberation,
   or a casting back of God's beam and flame upon himself. The cold wall
   sendeth back no reflex of heat till the sun shine upon it, and warm it
   first; so neither do we love God till the soul be first filled with a
   sense of his love. And as radius reflexus languet, rays in their
   reflection are more faint and cold, so our love to God is much weaker
   than God's love to us. Valdesso saith, God loveth the lowest saint more
   than the highest angel loveth God. Once more, the more direct the
   stroke and beam is upon the wall, or any other solid body, the stronger
   always is the reflection; so the more sense we have of the love of God,
   the stronger is our love to him.

   2. The next cause of love is the grace of God. There is not only an
   apprehension of love, but the force of the spirit goeth along with it.
   Our thoughts, our discourses upon the love of God to us in Christ, nay,
   our sense and feeling of it, is not enough to beget this grace in us.
   Love is a pure flame, that must be kindled from above, as the vestal
   fire by a sunbeam: 1 John iv. 7, Love is of God;' that is, of a
   celestial or heavenly original. There is in the soul naturally a hatred
   of God, Rom. i. 30, theostugeis, and a proneness to mingle with present
   comforts, which can only be cured by the Spirit of grace. Our naked
   apprehensions will not break the force of natural enmity; and it is God
   that must circumcise and pare away the foreskin of the heart before we
   can love him, Deut. xxx. 6. There is a natural proneness to dote upon
   the creature and hate the Creator. Base creatures neglect God, and
   pollute themselves with one another; and there is no help for it till
   the heart be overpowered by grace. Thus for the causes of love.

   The object of love is God himself; not merely as considered in himself,
   for so he is terrible to the creature, but as God in Christ, for so he
   will be known and respected by us in the gospel, and so we have the
   highest engagement to love him; not only upon the respects of nature,
   as our Creator, but of grace, as our God and father in Christ. Now God
   is the supreme object of love, and other things are loved for God's
   sake, because of that of God which we find in them; as his word, which
   is the copy of his holiness, his engraven image, as the coin beareth
   the image of the prince. So it is said, Ps. cxix. 47, I will delight
   myself in thy commandments which I have loved.' And then his saints,
   which are his living image, as children resemble their father; so it is
   said, Ps. xvi. 3, To the saints, and to the excellent of the earth, in
   whom is my delight.' And then other men, because of his command, 2
   Peter i. 5, Add to brotherly kindness, love.' So his creatures, because
   in them we enjoy God, the effects of his bounty. But chiefly his
   ordinances, as they exhibit more of God than the creatures can. So that
   love respects God, and other things for God's sake.

   Again, in the description I take notice of the essence or formal nature
   of it, and call it the return of a gracious and holy affection to God.
   Love is carried out to its object two ways--by desire and delight. Our
   necessity and need of God is the ground of desire; and our propriety
   and interest is the ground of delight. Desires are the feet of love, by
   which it runneth after its object; and delight is the rest and
   contentment of the soul in the enjoyment of it. Because of our
   imperfect fruition in this life, love bewrayeth itself by desires
   mostly, or pursuing after God; see Ps. lxiii. 8, My heart followeth
   hard after thee.' It noteth those sallies and earnest egressions of
   soul after the Lord, that we may have more communion and fellowship
   with him. In short, the radical (if I may so speak) and principal
   disposition of love is a desire of union; for all other effects of love
   flow from it This it is that makes the soul to prize the ordinances,
   because God is. to be enjoyed there, and these are means of communion
   with him: Ps. xxvi. 8, I have loved the place where thine honour
   dwelleth.' This maketh sin terrible, because it separateth from God,
   Isa. lix. 2. This maketh heaven amiable; the fairest part of our
   portion in heaven is a closer and nearer communion with Christ, Phil.
   i. 23. This maketh the day of judgment sweet, for then we shall meet
   with our beloved in the air,' 1 Thes. iv. 17. In short, this maketh the
   soul to take such contentment in thinking of God, and speaking of God;
   it is the feast of the soul: My meditation of him shall be sweet,' Ps.
   civ. 34. Their souls cannot have a greater solace than to think what a
   God they have in Christ.

   Having in some manner described the love of God, let me use some
   arguments to press you to it.

   First, God hath commanded it; the sum of the law is love. When the
   scribe came to Christ, Mat. xxii. 36, Master, which is the great
   commandment in the law?' Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord
   thy God with all thy heart, and all thy soul, and all thy might,' Mark,
   this is the first and great commandment,' to love God; it is not a sour
   command, but sweet and profitable. God might have burdened us with
   other manner of precepts, considering his absolute right; to offer our
   children in sacrifice, to mangle our flesh with whips and scourges; but
   these are cruelties proper to the devil's worship. The Lord is a gentle
   master, and only desireth the love of his servants; we have cause to
   thank him for such a gracious precept. If he should require us not to
   love him, this were hell itself; that is the hell of hell, that they
   which are there do not love God. It is our privilege as much as our
   duty. God loveth all his creatures, but hath commanded none to love him
   again but man and angels; so that it is the great privilege of the
   saints to love God. It had been a great favour if God had given us
   leave to love him; as it would be a great favour if a king should give
   leave to one of his meanest subjects to have the key of his privy
   chamber, to come to him and visit him, and be familiar with him when he
   pleaseth; how would this be talked of in the world! Yet this is not so
   wonderful, since the king and the peasant are both men; in their
   natural being they are equal, though in their civil distinction and
   condition of life there be a difference. But what a favour is this,
   that he who is the King of kings, and Lord of lords,' doth not only
   permit his creature made by his own hands to come to him, and love him,
   and deal with him when he pleaseth, but hath expressly commanded it!
   Nay, this is the great commandment.' Certainly God is very desirous of
   our love, when he layeth such an obligation upon us. Was there ever
   such a master, that made this to be his servants' chiefest duty, that
   they should love him? Again, I observe in God's command that the
   precept runneth thus: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
   heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.' The Lord would
   not lose one grain of the creature's love. Surely he valued it when he
   is so solicitous about it. If we should see a wise man careful to
   preserve the relics of what we counted a neglected weed, it would make
   us think there were some what in it. We lavish away our love upon
   trifles, and God prizeth every grain of it. You see he speaketh as if
   he would not lose one dust of love: All thy soul, all thy heart, and
   all thy might.' When he biddeth us love our neighbour, he sets limits
   to it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;' but when he biddeth
   us love God, he requireth all the heart. The only measure is to love
   him without measure. The next place that I shall take notice of, where
   the precept is recorded, is Deut. x. 12, And now Israel, what doth the
   Lord require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to walk in all
   his ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord with all thy heart,
   and with all thy soul.' God doth not require of us things without the
   sphere of duty; that we should go into the depths of the sea, toss
   mountains in the air, pluck the stars from heaven, &c. These things lie
   out of the power of man. He doth not require of us barbarous
   austerities--to offer our first-born, to lance ourselves, to mangle our
   flesh with whips and scourges. He doth not require of us absolutely
   such things which some men can and ought to perform; not such a measure
   of alms, what then would become of the poor? not such a degree of
   wisdom and learning, what then would become of the simple and
   unlearned? But, O Israel, what hath the Lord required of thee, but that
   thou shouldest love the Lord thy God?' A duty to be performed by poor
   and rich, learned and unlearned. Whatever their estate and condition
   be, they may all love God. There are many in heaven that never were in
   a condition to give, but to receive, that were never learned and
   skilled in sciences; but none that never loved God.

   Secondly, God hath deserved love. Let us a little take notice of God's
   love to us. He beginneth and loveth us that we may love him again, 1
   John iv. 19. If God should hate us, we were bound to love him, because
   of his excellency, and because of our duty and obligation as we are
   creatures. How much more when God hath loved us, and bestowed so many
   benefits upon us? Love is an affection which God will have repaid in
   kind. When he chideth us, he doth not expect that we should chide him
   again. When he judgeth us, we must not judge him again. In these things
   the creature is not to retaliate. It is true, we do it too often, but
   still to our loss and blame. But now when he loveth us, he willeth us
   to love him again. He loveth us for no other cause but that he may be
   loved. Love must be paid in kind. As water is cast into a pump when the
   springs lie low to bring up more water, so God sheddeth abroad his love
   into our hearts, that our love may rise up to him again by way of
   gratitude and recompense. Now in the love of God we may take notice
   of--(1.) The properties; and (2.) The effects of it.

   First, For the properties of God's love, consider:--

   1. The ancientness of it: Ps. ciii. 17, From everlasting to
   everlasting,' &c. With reverence we may speak, ever since God was God
   he was our God. You may track his love from one eternity to another.
   Before the world was he loved us, and when the world is no more he
   loveth us still. His love began in eternal purposes of grace, and it
   endeth in our eternal possession of glory. It is not a thing of yester
   day. He is our ancient friend. He loved us not only before we were
   lovely, but before we were at all. We adjourn and put off our love of
   God to old age, and thrust it into a narrow corner. When we have wasted
   and spent our strength in the world, we dream of a devout retirement.
   But the Lord thinketh he could never love us early enough. From
   everlasting to everlasting,' &c. We receive the fruits and effects of
   love in time, but all cometh out of God's ancient and eternal love.
   This grace was provided for us before we were born. Yea, look upon
   God's love in time. How merciful was God to us before we could show the
   least sign of thankfulness to him? He loved us a long time before ever
   we had a thought of him. In infancy we could not so much as know that
   he loved us. When we came to years of discretion we knew how to offend
   him before we knew how to love and serve him. How many are there of
   whom it may be said, God is not in all their thoughts;' and yet all
   this while God hath thoughts of peace' and blessing towards them.

   2. Consider the freeness of God's love. The value of all benefits
   ariseth from the necessity of him that receive th, and the good-will of
   him that giveth. God wanted not us, our love is no benefit to him; but
   we wanted him, we are undone without him. Yet he hath more delight in
   pardoning than we in salvation, and he is more ready to give than we to
   ask. [52] He often calleth upon us to call upon him; as if he were
   afraid we would not ask, or not enough, or not soon enough, or not
   often enough. A man would think that our wants should be importunate
   enough to put us upon requests, and that we needed not enforcements to
   prayer; yet you see God doth not only prevent the request, but make the
   prayer, and stirreth us up to utter it. But we are not only needy
   creatures, but guilty creatures; and that God should love us 1 When we
   were in our blood and filthiness, it was a time of loves,' Ezek. xvi.
   7. This is the great miracle of divine love, that a time of loathing is
   a time of loves. And we will wonder at it more if we consider the
   active and endless hatred of his holiness against sin, and therefore
   why not against sinners? The holiness of his nature and essence sets
   him against them; and natural antipathies and aversions can never be
   reconciled, as a man can never be brought to delight in a toad, or a
   lamb in a wolf. And consider again his infinite wisdom. We may love
   that which is not lovely, because we are often blinded by inordinate
   affection; but now God's love is not blind and overcome with the
   vehemency of any passion, as man's is. This maketh the wonder, there is
   no blindness and passion in him that loveth, and yet the thing that is
   loved is vile and uncomely.

   3. The frequency of the expressions of his love. It would weary the arm
   of an angel to write down God's repeated acts of grace: Rom. v. 16, The
   free gift is of many offences unto justification.' We carry loads of
   experiences with us to heaven. God's book of remembrance is written
   within and without. This will be our wonder and amazement at the last
   day, to see such huge sums cancelled with Christ's blood: every day
   pardoning mercy is put in: our past lives are but a constant experience
   of our sinning and God's pardoning. We are weary of everything but sin;
   we are never weary of that, because it is natural to us. The very
   refreshments of life by continuance grow burden some: meat, drink,
   music, sleep, the chiefest pleasures, within a while need to be
   refreshed with other pleasures; man is a restless creature, and loveth
   shift and change. But now we are never weary of sin; we have it from
   the womb, and we keep it to the grave; and yet all this while we
   subsist upon God. We subsist upon him every moment; we have life, and
   breath, and hourly maintenance from him, whom we thus grieve and
   offend. Dependence should beget observance, but in us it is otherwise.
   As a dunghill sendeth out vapours to obscure the sun that shineth upon
   it, so do we dishonour the God of our mercies, and grieve him day by
   day. How long hath God been multiplying pardons, and yet free grace is
   not tired and grown weary!

   4. Consider the variety of the expressions of his love. We have all
   kind of mercies; we eat mercy, we wear mercy, we are encompassed with
   mercy as with a shield.' The apostle saith, 2 Peter i. 3, He hath given
   us all things that pertain to life and godliness;' that is, as I would
   interpret, all things that are necessary to life natural, to life
   spiritual, to maintain grace here, and to bring us to glory here after.
   He that hath an interest in Christ, his portion is not straitened; be
   hath a right to all things, and a possession of as much as providence
   judgeth needful; therein we must not be our own carvers. A man of
   mortified affections thinketh he hath provision enough if he hath
   things necessary to life and godliness; and will you not love God for
   all this? Certainly we do not want obligations, but we want affections.
   Look, as too much wood puts out the fire and causeth smoke, so the
   multitude and daily experience of God's mercies lesseneth the esteem of
   them. We have but too many mercies, and that maketh us unkind and
   neglectful of God. What shall I tell you of sabbaths, ordinances, food,
   raiment? If a man would be but his own remembrancer, and now and then
   come to an account with God, he would cry out, O the multitude of thy
   thoughts to us-ward, how great is the sum of them!' Ps. cxxxix. 17. Or
   if a man would but keep a journal of his own life, what a vast volume
   would his private experiences make; how would he find mercy and himself
   still growing up together! Shall I show you a little what a multitude
   of mercies there are? I will not speak of the higher and choicer
   mercies, such as concern the soul, but of such as concern the body.
   What a deal of provision is there for the comfort and welfare of the
   body! I instance in these mercies, partly because they are so common
   that they are scarce noted; partly because carnal men prize the body
   most; they prefer it above the soul. Now the Lord would leave them
   without excuse; they that love the body shall not want arguments to
   urge them to love God, since he hath bestowed so much of his love and
   care upon the body, to gratify all the senses not only for necessity
   but delight. There is light for the eye; the poorest man hath glorious
   lamps to light him to his labours; for the taste, such variety of
   refreshments of a different sap and savour; for the smell, delicious
   infusions into the air from flowers and gums and aromatic plants; for
   the ears, music from birds and men; and all this to make our pilgrimage
   comfortable, and our hearts better. How many creatures hath the Lord
   given us to help to hear burdens? how many things for meat and
   medicine? If man had not been created last, after the world was settled
   and furnished, we should have seen the want of many things which we now
   enjoy and do not value. First God provided our house, and then
   furnished our table; and when all was ready, then man is brought in as
   the lord of all. We are not affected with these mercies. How can we sin
   against God, that can look no where but we see arguments and reasons to
   love him? As Christ said, Many good works have I done amongst you; for
   which of these do you stone me?' so may the Lord plead, I have done
   many things for you; you cannot open your eyes but you see love, you
   cannot walk abroad but you smell love and hear love, &c.; for which of
   those do you grieve me, and deal so despitefully with me?

   Secondly, Let me now come to the effects of God's love. I shall only
   instance in those three great effects--creation, preservation, and
   redemption. Certainly that must needs be a great bonfire out of which
   there flies not only sparks but brands; and so that love which can
   produce such fruits and effects must needs be exceeding great.

   1. Creation. This deserveth love from the creature. The fruit of the
   vineyard belongeth to him that planted it; and whom should we love but
   him that gave us the power to love? All that thou hast, all that thou
   canst see, that thou canst touch, is his gift, and the work of his
   hands. He gave thee the essence not of a tree, a bird, a beast, but of
   a man, capable of reason, fit for happiness. God made other creatures
   by a word of command, and man by counsel. It was not, Be thou, but, Let
   us make man, to show that the whole Trinity assisted and joined in
   consultation. He made other creatures for his glory, but not for his
   love and service. God is glorified in them passively, as they give us
   occasion to glorify God; the creatures are the harp, but man maketh the
   music: All thy works praise thee, and thy saints bless thee,' Ps. cxlv.
   10. How many steps may a Christian ascend in his praise and
   thanksgiving! We might have been stones without sense; beasts, and
   without reason; born infidels, and without faith; we might have
   continued sinners, and without grace: all these are so many steps of
   mercy. But creation is that we are now to speak of, and truly it
   deserveth a remembrance, especially in youth, Eccles. xii. 1, when the
   effects of God's creating bounty are most fresh in our sense and
   feeling: we are always to remember our Creator,' but then especially.
   The aches of old age serve to put us in mind of our ingratitude; but
   the strength, and vigour, and freshness of youth should make us
   remember the bounty of our Creator. Look upon the body or the soul, and
   you will see that we have cause to love him. In the body we find as
   many mercies as there are limbs. If a man should be born blind or lame,
   or should lose an eye or an arm, or a leg, how much would he love him
   that should restore the use of these members again! We are as much
   bound to love him that gave them to us at first, especially when we
   consider how often we have deserved to lose them. We would love him
   that should raise us from the dead: God is the author of life, and the
   continual preserver and defender of it. If we love our parents that
   begot us, we should much more love God that made them and us too out of
   nothing. Take notice of the curious frame of the body. David saith, Ps.
   cxxxix. 14, I am wonderfully made;' acu pictus sum, so the Vulgar
   rendereth it, painted as with a needle,' like a garment of needlework,
   of divers colours, richly embroidered with nerves and veins. What shall
   I speak of the eye, wherein there is such curious workmanship, that
   many upon the first sight of it have been driven to acknowledge God? Of
   the hand made to open and shut, and to serve the labours and ministries
   of nature without wasting and decay for many years? If they should be
   of marble or iron, with such constant use they would soon wear out; and
   yet now they are of flesh they last as long as life lasteth. Of the
   head? fitly placed to be the seat of the senses, to command and direct
   the rest of the members. Of the lungs? a frail piece of flesh, yet,
   though in continual motion, of a long use. It were easy to enlarge upon
   this occasion; but I am to preach a sermon, not to read an anatomy
   lecture. In short, therefore, every part is so placed and framed, as if
   God had employed his whole wisdom about it.

   But as yet we have spoken but of the casket wherein the jewel lieth.
   The soul, that divine spark and blast, how quick, nimble, various, and
   indefatigable in its motions! how comprehensive in its capacities! how
   it animateth the body, and is like God himself, all in every part! Who
   can trace the flights of reason? What a value hath God set upon the
   soul! He made it after his image, he redeemed it with Christ's blood,
   &c. Well, then, God, that made such a body, such a soul, deserveth
   love. He that made the soul hath most right to dwell in it; it is a
   curious house of his own framing. But he will not enter by force and
   violence, but by consent; he expecteth when love will give up the keys:
   Rev. iii. 20, Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any man open to
   me, I will come in and sup with him.' Why should Christ stand at the
   door and knock, and ask leave to enter into his own house? He hath
   right enough to enter, only he expecteth till we open to him.

   2. Preservation. We are not apprehensive enough of daily mercies. The
   preservation of the world is a constant miracle. The world is hanged
   upon nothing' (as it is in the book of Job). A feather will not stay in
   the air; and yet what hath the world to support it but the thin fluid
   air that is round about it? It is easy to prove that the waters are
   higher than the land; so that we are always in the case the Israelites
   were in when they passed through the Red Sea. Nos sumus etiam tanquam
   in medio rubri maris, saith Luther--the waters are round about us and
   above us, bound up in a heap as it were by God, and yet we are not
   swallowed up. It is true the danger is not so sensible and immediate as
   that of the Red Sea, because of the constant rampire of providence.
   More particularly, from the womb to the grave we have hourly
   maintenance from God. Look, as the beams in the air are no longer
   continued than the sun shineth; so we do no longer continue than God
   upholdeth our beings by the word of his power,' Heb. i. 3. Or as it is
   with a seal in the water, take away the seal and the impress vanisheth;
   so do we disappear as soon as God doth but loosen his hand and almighty
   grasp, by which all things are upheld and preserved. But let us speak
   of those acts of providence that are more sensible. Into how many
   diseases and dangers might we fall, if God did not look after us as the
   nurse after her child! How many have gone to the grave, nay, it may be
   to hell, since the last night*! How many actual dangers have we
   escaped! God hath looked after us, as if he had forgotten all the world
   besides; as if his whole employment were to do us good. He saith that
   he will no more forget us than a woman doth her sucking child;' and
   that we are written before him, and graven in the palms of his hands,'
   Isa. xlix. 15, &c., as men tie a string about their finger for a
   remembrance, or record in a book such things as they would regard. All
   these are expressions to describe the particular and express care of
   God's providence over his children. Now what shall be rendered to the
   Lord for all this? If we could do and suffer never so much for God, it
   will not answer the mercy of one day. Certainly at least God expecteth
   love for love. Love him as he is the strength of thy life and length of
   thy days,' Deut. xxx. 20. Every day's experience is new fuel to keep in
   the fire. The very beasts will respect their preservers; they are
   loving to those that are kind to them: The ass knoweth his owner, and
   the ox his master's crib.' There is a kind of gratitude in the beasts
   by which they acknowledge their benefactors that feed them and cherish
   them; but we do not acknowledge God who feedeth us and upholdeth us
   every moment. There is no creature made worse by kindness but man. He,
   that was made to be master of the creatures, may become their scholar;
   there is many a good lesson to be learned in their school.

   3. Redemption. As a man, when he weigheth a thing, casteth in weight
   after weight till the scales be counterpoised, so doth God mercy after
   mercy to poise down man's heart. Here is a mercy that is overweight in
   itself: 1 John iv. 10, Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that
   God loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins.' If
   we had had the wisdom to pitch upon such a remedy, as certainly it
   could not have entered into hearts of men or angels, Eph. iii. 10, yet
   we could not have the heart to ask it. It would have seemed a rude
   blasphemy in our prayers to desire that the Son of God should come out
   from his Father's bosom and die for us. Therefore, herein is love;'
   that is, this is the highest expression of God's love to the creature,
   not only that ever was, but can be; for in love only God acteth to the
   uttermost: he never showed so much of his power and wisdom, but he can
   show more; of his wrath, but he can show more; but he hath no greater
   thing to give than himself, than his Christ. At what a dear rate hath
   the Lord bought our hearts I He needed not; he might have made nobler
   creatures than the present race of men, and dealt with us as he did
   with the sinning angels; he would not enter into treaty with them, but
   the execution was as quick as the sin; so the Lord might utterly have
   cast us off, and made a new race of men to glorify his grace, leaving
   Adam to propagate the world to glorify his justice; or, at least, he
   might have redeemed us in another way, for I suppose it is a free
   dispensation, opus liberi consilii. But, John iii. 16, God so loved the
   world, that he gave his only-begotten Son.' He took this way, that we
   might love Christ as well as believe in him. God might have redeemed us
   so much in another way, but he could not oblige us so much in another
   way; he would not only satisfy his justice, but show his love. It was
   the Lord's design, by his love, to deserve ours, and so for ever to
   shame the creature, if they should not now love him. Oh! think much of
   this glorious instance, the love of God in giving Christ, and the love
   of Christ in giving himself. When the sea wrought and was tempestuous,'
   and Jonah saw the storm, he said, Cast me into the sea, and it shall be
   calm to you;' but the storm was raised for his own sake. Now Christ,
   when he saw the misery of mankind, he said, Let it come on me. We
   raised the storm, but Christ would be cast in to allay it. If a prince,
   passing by an execution, should take the malefactor's chains, and
   suffer in his stead, this would be a wonderful instance indeed. Why!
   Christ hath borne our sorrows and carried our griefs,' Isa. liii. 4;
   the very same griefs that we should have suffered, so far as his holy
   person was capable of them. His desertion was equivalent to our loss,
   his agonies to our curse and punishment of sense; and all this very
   willingly for the sake of sinners. It is notable, he doth with like
   indignation rebuke Peter dissuading him from sufferings, as he doth the
   devil tempting him to idolatry: Get thee behind me, Satan;' compare
   Mat. xvi. 22, with Mat. iv. 10. He is well pleased with all his sorrow
   and sufferings, so he may gain the church, and espouse her to himself
   in a firm league and covenant: Isa. liii. 11, He shall see the travail
   of his soul, and be satisfied;' as if he said, Welcome agonies, welcome
   death, welcome curse, so poor souls be saved! As Jacob counted the days
   of his labour nothing, so he might obtain Rachel; and yet there is a
   vast difference between the love of Christ and the love of Jacob.
   Rachel was lovely, but we are vile and unworthy creatures; and Christ's
   love is infinite, even beyond his sufferings and the outward
   expressions of it; as the windows of the temple were more large and
   open within than without. Well, then, every one of Christ's wounds is a
   mouth open to plead for love. He made himself so vile, that he might be
   more dear and precious to us. Certainly, if love brought Christ out of
   heaven to the cross, to the grave, should it not carry us to heaven, to
   God, to Christ, who hath been thus gracious to us? Thus God hath
   deserved our love.

   Thirdly, The third and next argument is, God hath desired it. What doth
   the Lord see in our hearts that he should desire them? If a prince
   should not only make love to a vile and abject creature, but seek all
   means to gain her affection, you would count her very froward and
   unthankful to give him the denial. Christ doth not only oblige us, but
   woo us. If man were such as he should be, he would not need
   enforcements, because of the multitude of his obligations; and if the
   Lord did deal with us as we deserve, he would slight us and scorn us,
   rather than woo us. He doth not want lovers; there are angels enough in
   heaven, whose wills and affections cleave to him perfectly; yea, God
   doth not need the love of any creature; all this wooing is for our
   sakes. Wherein can frail men be beneficial to God? What increase of
   happiness hath he if all men should love him? It is his happiness to
   love himself, and he would have us to share in this happiness;
   therefore he threateneth, and promiseth, and beseecheth. As one that
   would gladly open a door, trieth key after key, till he hath tried
   every key in the bunch; so doth God try one method after another to
   work upon man's heart.

   1. He threateneth eternal torments if we do not love him: 1 Cor. xvi.
   22, If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema
   maranatha.' The form of speech implieth the most dreadful curse that
   may be. It is not arbitrary whether you will love him or no; you are
   either to love him, or to perish eternally. Among men, if love doth not
   come kindly, we neglect it; that which is forced is nothing worth: yet
   the Lord is so earnest after the love of the creature, that he would
   have it by any means.

   2. He promiseth. We have not only mercies in hand, but mercies in hope;
   not only obligations, but promises. It is our duty to love God if there
   were no heaven; our obligations might suffice; yet what great things
   hath God provided for them that love him!' 1 Cor. ii. 9. If a man
   should sell his love, he cannot have a better chapman than God, who is
   most rich and most liberal. If an earthly potentate should promise to
   them that love him half his kingdom, he would find lovers enough. God
   hath promised glory, the kingdom of heaven, and shall we not take him
   at his word? The Lord will give a gift for a gift; because he hath
   given us to love him, therefore he will give us heaven as the reward of
   love. Who ever heard that a hungry man was hired to eat, and rewarded
   for tasting dainty food? or a thirsty man for drinking? The love of God
   is so excellent a privilege, that we should endure all torments to
   obtain it; and yet God hath promised a reward: yea, he is pleased to
   bargain with us as if he were our equal, and we were altogether free
   before the contract.

   3. Again, he beseecheth. We are cold and backward, therefore he useth
   entreaty upon entreaty, as if he were impatient of a denial. Out of
   what rock was man hewn? God himself cometh a-wooing, and we have the
   face to give him a repulse; and what doth he woo for but our hearts,
   which are his already by every kind of right and title? Prov. xxiii.
   26, My son, give me thy heart.' God is pleased to call that a gift
   which is indeed a debt. Though the heart be due, yet God will put this
   honour upon the creatures, to receive it from them in the way of a
   gift. It is but equity to give to God the things that are God's.' Look
   upon the heart; see if any could make it but God himself. Whose image
   and superscription doth it bear?' Wilt thou refuse to surrender up to
   God his right? God hath made it, bought it, and yet he beggeth it. When
   thou hast been as earnest with God, and asked anything regularly of
   him, did he deny thee? It is no benefit to him; he desireth the heart
   of the creature, not that he may be happy, but that he may be liberal;
   he would have thy heart that he may make it better. How easily do we
   give up our affections to anything but God, who hath the best title to
   them! If the world or Satan knocketh, we open presently. We are as wax
   to Satan, and as stone to God; exorable and easy to be entreated by any
   carnal motion. As some hard stones cannot be wrought upon but by their
   own dust, so men are facile only to their own corruptions, to their own
   lusts, not to the motions of God's Spirit.

   Fourthly, The nature of love showeth that it is fit for nothing but
   God. He hath given us this faculty and disposition, that we may close
   with himself. He that looketh upon an axe will say it was made to cut;
   and he that looketh on love will say it was made for God. What is the
   genius and disposition of love? Love is nothing but an earnest bent and
   strong motion of the soul to what is good for us. [53] Every man hath
   an inclination in his nature to what he conceiveth to be good, Ps. iv.
   6, and grace doth only direct and set it right. All the difference
   between nature and grace is in fixing the chiefest good and the utmost
   end. One great blessing of the covenant is a new heart;' that is, a new
   and right placing of our affections. Well, then, God is summum bonum,
   the chiefest good; even nature cannot be satisfied without him, but
   grace findeth all contentment in him. If there be any good in the
   creatures, it is originally in him; he is the fountain of living
   waters, where comforts are sweetest and freest. The heart hunteth after
   good among the creatures, which is but an image and ray of that
   perfection which is in God; and who would leave the substance to follow
   the shadow, and prize the picture to the disdain of the person whom it
   represents? It were easy to prove that God is the only proper, eternal,
   all-sufficient good of the soul; and if the heart were not perverted
   and biassed with carnal desires to other objects, it would directly
   move to God, as all things do to their centre. I say, were it not for
   sin, we should no more need be pressed to love God, than to love
   ourselves. There need no great motives to press us to love ourselves,
   nature is prone enough of its own accord; and if nature had remained in
   that purity wherein it was created, it would move to God of its own
   accord; as all things move to their centre, and there they rest. Now
   God is the centre of the soul. The soul's good is not honours,
   pleasures, profits; the soul is a spirit, and must have a spiritual
   good; it is immortal, and it must have an eternal good. By experience
   we find that our affections are never in their due posture, but are
   like members out of joint (or the arms when they hang backward) when
   they are not fixed upon God; therefore there is a restlessness and
   dissatisfaction in the soul. [54] We grope and feel about for
   happiness, and cannot find it, Acts xvii. 26, 27; like Noah's dove, we
   hover up and down, and find no place whereon the sole of our foot
   should rest. Well, then, if God be the only all-sufficient good of the
   soul, why do not we love him more? If he be the centre of the soul, why
   do not we move directly thither? It is a shame that a stone should be
   carried with greater force to its centre than we to God. By its natural
   course it falleth downward, and breaketh all things in the way, yea,
   though itself be broken in pieces. But alas! how little do we break
   through impediments to go to God! It were a miracle to see a stone
   stopped in the air by a feather. But now every vain thing keepeth us
   off, and intercepts our affections; sin hath given us another centre,
   and after grace received, we hang too much that way. Again, as love is
   for good, so it is for one object; like a pyramid, it ends in a point;
   affection is weakened by dispersion, as a river by being turned into
   many channels. In conjugal love, where friendship is to the height,
   there is but one that can share in it; that is the law of nature: Mal.
   ii. 15, Did he not make one? yet he had the residue of spirit;' the
   meaning is, that God made but one man for one woman, though he had
   spirit enough to make more; it was not out of defect of power, but wise
   choice, that their affections to one another might be the stronger,
   which otherwise would be weakened; as they are in the brutes scattered
   promiscuously to several objects. So the true object of love is one
   God; he is loved for himself, and other things for his sake. Once more,
   the force and vehemency of love showeth that it was made for God; love
   is the vigorous bent of the soul, and full of heights and excesses,
   which, if diverted to other objects, would make us guilty of idolatry;
   we should place them in the room of God. Still we find that men are
   besotted with what they love; as Samson was led about like a child by
   Delilah: all conveniences of life, pleasures, profits, are contemned
   for the enjoyment of the thing beloved. Now, these are heights proper
   to the divinity, to the infinite majesty of God. To whom else is this
   vehemency and this self-denial due? If we lavish it upon the creatures,
   we make gods of them; and therefore covetousness is called idolatry,
   Eph. v. 5, and the sensualist is said to make his belly his god, Phil.
   iii. 19. There is such an excess, such a doating in love, that if we be
   not careful in fixing it, before we are aware we run into practical
   idolatry and practical atheism. There is an atheism in the heart as
   well as in the judgment. Atheism in the judgment is when we are not
   convinced of the being of God; in the heart, when our affections are
   not set on God: this is more incurable, because the dogmatical atheist
   may be convinced by reason, but the practical atheist can only be
   reformed by grace. Thus the nature of love showeth it.

   Fifthly, The nature of the saint showeth it; the new nature hath new
   affections; it bewrayeth itself by the new heart, as well as by the
   renewed mind, Rom. xii. 2. There are not only new thoughts, but new
   desires and new delights; desires after God, and a delight in God, as
   the fountain of holiness. When we come to God at first, we love him out
   of spiritual interest, for ease and comfort, and the benefit we gain
   by. him; Christ alloweth it: Come to me and I will give you ease,' Mat.
   xi. 28. When fire is first kindled, there is as much smoke as flame;
   but afterwards it burneth brighter and brighter by degrees. A fountain,
   as soon as digged, runneth muddy at first, but afterwards the stream
   groweth more pure and clear. So doth the love of the saints; at first
   it is but a love of interest, but by acquaintance we love him out of a
   principle of the new nature, for his holiness and excellency, because
   that which is in us in part is in God by way of eminency and
   perfection. Certainly likeness must needs beget love, and the saints,
   being conformed to God, delight in him; so that then their love floweth
   not so much from profit and interest as grace; yea, at length out of a
   vehement complacency of the new nature, they love holiness above
   happiness or spiritual interest; and hell is not so bad as sin in their
   account. [55] There cannot be a worse hell to them than unkindness to
   God or grieving his Spirit; and heaven is amiable for God's sake,
   because he is loved there and enjoyed there; there are none of God's
   enemies in heaven, and there they shall serve him and cleave to him
   without weariness and wandering. Well, then, there is such a
   disposition in the saints to love God, Ps. xxxi. 23, which ariseth not
   only from hope, because of the great benefit which we expect from him,
   nor only from gratitude, or the sense of his love already showed, but
   from an inclination of the new nature, and that sympathy and likeness
   that is between us, [56] because we hate what he hateth, and love what
   he loveth, Prov. viii. 13; Rev. ii. 6, and because God is the original
   fountain and sampler of holiness.

   Use. Well, then, saints mind your work. Do you indeed love God? Christ
   puts Peter to the question thrice, John xxi. A deceitful heart is apt
   to abuse you. Ask again and again, Do I indeed love God? Evidences are
   these:--

   1. If you love God, he will be loved alone; those that do riot give all
   to God, give nothing; he will have the whole heart. If there were
   another God, we might have some excuse for our reservations; but since
   there is but one God, he must have all, for he doth not love in mates.
   When the harbingers take up a house for a prince, they turn out all;
   none must remain there, that there may be room for his greatness. So
   all must avoid, that God may have the sole possession of our hearts.
   The devil, that hath no right to anything, would have a part, for by
   that means he knoweth the whole will fall to him; conscience will not
   let him have all, and therefore he would have a part to keep
   possession: as Pharaoh stood bucking with Moses and Aaron; if not the
   Israelites, then their little ones; if not their little ones, then
   their herds; if not their herds, then their flocks: but Moses telleth
   him there was not a hoof to be left. So Satan, if he cannot have the
   outward man, yet he would have the heart; if there be not room enough
   in the heart for every lust, then he craveth indulgence in some things
   that are less odious and distasteful; if conscience will not allow
   drunkenness, yet a little worldliness is pleaded for as no great
   matter. But the love of God cannot be in that heart where the world
   reigneth. Dagon and the ark could not abide in the same temple; neither
   can the heart be divided between God and mammon. All men must have some
   religion to mask their pleasures and carnal practices, that they may be
   favourable to their lusts and interests with less remorse; and usually
   they order the matter so, that Christ shall have their consciences, and
   the world their hearts and affections. But, alas! they do not consider
   that God is jealous of a rival; when he cometh into the heart, he will
   have the room empty. It is true, we may love other things in
   subordination to God, but not in competition with God; that is, when we
   love God and other things for God's sake, in God and for God. When a
   commander hath taken a strong castle, and placed a garrison in it, he
   suffereth none to enter but those of his own side, keeping the gate
   shut to his enemies. So we must open the heart to none but God, and
   those that are of God's party and side, keeping the gate shut to
   others. We may love the creatures as they are of God's side, as they
   draw our hearts more to God, or engage us to be more cheerful in
   service, or give us greater advantages of doing good. Of what party are
   they? Bring nothing into thy heart, and allow nothing there, that is
   contrary to God. When Sarah saw Ishmael scoffing at Isaac, she thrust
   him out of doors. So when riches, and honour, and the love of the world
   upbraid you with your love to God, as if you were a fool to stand so
   nicely upon terms of conscience, &c., when they encroach and allow
   Christ no room but in the conscience, it is time to thrust them out of
   doors, that the Lord alone may have the preeminence in our souls.

   2. This love must be demonstrated by solid effects, such as are:--

   [1.] A hatred of sin: Ps. xcvii. 10, Ye that love the Lord, hate evil.'
   With love to the chief est good, there will be a hatred of the chiefest
   evil. Friends have common loves, as I said, and common aversations.
   Upon every carnal motion doth thy heart recoil upon thee, and say, How
   can I do this wickedness, and sin against God?' Gen. xxxix. 9; or else,
   Is this thy kindness to thy friend?' or after such a deliverance as
   this,' &c., Ezra ix. 13. Love to God will be interposing and crossing
   every carnal motion.

   [2.] By a delight in obedience: 1 John v. 3, This is love, that we keep
   his commandments, and his commandments are not grievous.' Nothing is
   difficult and tedious to him that hath any affection to his work. As
   the prophet cured the bitterness of the wild gourds by casting in meal,
   so mingle but a little love with your work, and the bitterness is gone.
   Shechem yielded to be circumcised for Dinah's sake, because he loved
   her; and Jacob endured his seven years' service for Rachel's sake: so
   will love make us obey God cheerfully in things contrary to our natural
   inclination. Love and labour are often coupled in scripture, 1 Thes. i.
   3; Heb. vi. 10; and those that left their first works had lost their
   first love, Rev. ii. 4, 5.

   [3.] Delight in God's presence, and grief for his absence; or a holy
   sensibleness both of his accesses and recesses, to and from the soul.
   Can a man love God, and be content without him? If you lose but a ring
   which you affect, how are you troubled till it be found again! Ye have
   taken away my gods (saith he), and do you ask, What aileth thee?'
   Judges xviii. 24. So when God is withdrawn, all visits of love and
   influences of grace are suspended, and they have no communion with him
   in their duties, should they not mourn? See Mat. ix. 15. Is spiritual
   love without all kind of passion? or are they Christians that are
   stupid and insensate, and never take notice of God's coming and going?

   These are the evidences. I shall only now suggest two helps to keep up
   and increase this love to God, and I have done with this argument.

   1. Prize nothing that cometh from God unless thou canst see his love in
   it. God giveth many gifts to wicked men, but he doth not give them his
   love. The possession of all things will do us no good unless we have
   God himself; other mercies may be salted with a curse. God's children
   are not satisfied till they can see him and enjoy him in every comfort
   and mercy. Esau was reconciled to Jacob, and therefore Jacob saith,
   Gen. xxxiii. 10, I have seen thy face as the face of God.' It was a
   token and pledge of the gracious face of God smiling on him. Hezekiah
   was delivered out of a sickness, and then he doth not say, Thou hast
   delivered me from the grave; but, Thou hast loved me from the grave,'
   Isa. xxxviii. 17.

   2. Prize nothing that thou return to God unless there be love in it. We
   accept a small gift where the party loveth, and otherwise the greatest
   is refused: If I give my body to be burned, and have not love,' &c., 1
   Cor. xiii. 3. Love is an act of grace by itself; other duties are not
   acts of grace unless they come from love; as alms, fasting, prayer,
   martyrdom, &c., they are all nothing; ou'den eimi (saith the apostle),
   I am' not only little, but nothing.' On the other side, small things
   are made great by love; as a cup of cold water, a poor woman's mite,
   they are accepted as coming from love.

   So much for the matter of the prayer. We come now to the manner or
   degree of enjoyment, be multiplied; from whence note:--

   Doct. That we should not [57] seek grace at the hands of God, but the
   increase and multiplication of it. In managing this point, I shall
   first give you reasons to press you to look after growth in grace;
   secondly, I shall give you some observations concerning it; and so,
   thirdly, come to some application.

   First, the reasons are these:--

   1. Where there is life there will be growth; and, if grace be true, it
   will surely increase. A painted flower keepeth always at the same pitch
   and stature; the artist may bestow beauty upon it, but he cannot bestow
   life. A painted child will be as little ten years hence as it is now.
   So a pretence of religion always keepeth at the same stay; yea, when
   their first heats are spent, they are fearfully blasted. But now they
   that have true grace are compared to a living plant, which increaseth
   in bulk and stature, Ps. xcii. 12, 13, and to a living child, which
   groweth by receiving kindly nourishment, 1 Peter ii. 2. Therefore it is
   not enough to get peace and love, but we must get them multiplied.

   2. If we do not grow, we go backward, Heb. vi.; compare the first with
   the fourth verse, Let us go on to perfection;' and then presently he
   treateth of apostasy. We cannot keep that which we have received, if we
   do not labour to increase it. They that row against the stream had need
   ply the oar, lest the force of the waters carry them back ward; or as
   he that goeth up a sandy hill sinketh down if he do not go forward,
   Mat. xxv. He that would not improve his talent lost it. So here we
   waste and consume what we have, if we do not improve it. It is
   dangerous to rest satisfied and never go further; there is no stay in
   religion: all the angels on Jacob's ladder were either ascending or
   descending, continually in motion. There are no stunted trees in
   Christ's garden; if they leave off to grow, they prove doated or rotten
   trees. An active nature, such as man's is, must either grow worse or
   better; therefore we should be as careful after the increase of grace
   as we would be cautious of the loss of grace.

   3. It is an ill sign to be contented with a little grace. He was never
   good that doth not desire to grow better. [58] Spiritual things do not
   cloy in the enjoyment. He that hath once tasted the sweetness of grace
   hath arguments enough to make him seek further, and desire more grace;
   every degree of holiness is as desirable as the first; therefore there
   can be no true holiness without a desire of perfect holiness. God
   giveth us a taste to this end and purpose, that we may long for a
   fuller draught; as the clusters of Canaan brought to Israel in the
   wilderness made them put on for the country. They are hypocrites, and
   sure to be apostates, that are contented with a taste, Heb. vi.

   4. Because we cannot have too much grace: there is no nimium in the
   internals of religion; you cannot have too much knowledge, too much
   love of God, too much of the fear of God. In the outward part there may
   be too much done, and then it proveth will-worship and superstition.
   The apostle saith, 2 Peter i. 11, That we must give diligence, that an
   abundant entrance may be ministered to us into the everlasting kingdom
   of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.' Some are afar off from the
   kingdom of God, Eph. ii. 13, as persons ignorant and touched with no
   care of religion: some come near, but never enter, Mark xii. 34; Acts
   xxvi. 28, as semi-converts and men of a blameless life; these cheapen,
   but do not buy, and go through with the bargain: others enter, but with
   greater difficulty, are scarcely saved,' 1 Peter iv. 18, Saved as by
   fire,' 1 Cor. iii. 15. They make a hard shift to go to heaven, and have
   only grace enough to keep body and soul together (as we say) not a jot
   to spare: others enter with full sails, or as it is said, they have an
   abundant entrance ministered to them,' and yet all is but little
   enough; spiritual things cannot exceed measure. But you will say, It is
   said, Eccles. vii. 16, Be not righteous over-much.' I answer--Either it
   is meant of an opinionative righteousness, be not too righteous in
   thine own conceit; or rather, of an indiscreet heat, or a rigid and
   sullen severity, without any temper of wisdom and moderation; otherwise
   in real holiness there can never be enough.

   5. God hath provided for them that grow in grace a more ample reward;
   according to our measures of grace, so will our measures of glory be;
   for they that have most grace are vessels of a larger capacity; others
   are filled according to their size. It is indeed a question whether
   there be degrees of glory, yea or no; [59] but I suppose it may easily
   be determined: He that soweth sparingly shall reap sparingly,' whereas
   others have their bosoms full of sheaves. If a man with a little grace
   should get to heaven, yet he hindereth his own preferment. Who would
   have a thin crop, and a lean harvest?

   6. It suiteth with our present state. Here we are in a state of
   progress and growth, not of rest and perfection: grace is not given out
   at once, but by degrees. Christ saith, John xvii. 26, I have declared
   thy name, and will declare it: and John i. 50, Believest thou? thou
   shalt see greater things than these;' there is more to come, therefore
   let us not rest in our first experiences. Paul saith, I have not
   attained,' Phil. iii. When grace is wrought, yet there is something
   lacking. He is a foolish builder that would rest in the middle of his
   work; and because the foundation is laid, is careless of the
   superstructure. The state of the saints is expressed by a growing
   light,' Prov. iv. 18. As long as there is want, there should be growth;
   see 1 Thes. iv. 1.

   7. Seeking the increase and multiplication of spiritual gifts suiteth
   best with the bounty and munificence of God. The Father, Son, and Holy
   Spirit have rich grace for us; and we are most welcome when we seek for
   most plenty. God the Father is represented as rich in mercy,' Eph. ii.
   4; Rom. x. 12. We can never exhaust the treasures of grace, and
   impoverish the exchequer of heaven. So Christ hath a rich and full
   merit, 2 Cor. viii. 9, to make us rich, &c. God the Son aimed at it in
   all his sufferings and condescensions, that he might make a large
   purchase for us, and we might not be straitened in grace. The Spirit of
   God is poured out plousi'os, richly,' Titus iii. 6. There is mercy
   enough in God the Father, merit enough in God the Son, efficacy enough
   in God the Spirit: God is not wanting, if we be not wanting to
   ourselves. If a mighty king should open his treasure, and bid men come
   and bring their bags, and take as much as they would; do you think they
   would neglect this occasion of gain? Surely no; they would run and
   fetch bag after bag, and never cease. Thus doth the Lord do in the
   covenant of grace; you will rather want vessels than treasure.

   8. It is a necessary piece of gratitude: we would have mercy to be
   multiplied, and therefore we should take care that peace and love be
   multiplied also; we would have God add to our blessings, and therefore
   we should add to our graces; see 2 Peter i. 5. When we have food we
   would have clothing; and when we have clothing we would have house and
   harbour; and when we have all these things, we would have them in
   greater proportion; the like care should we show in gracious
   enjoyments. When we have knowledge, we should add temperance, and when
   we have temperance, we should add patience, &c.

   9. We may learn of our Lord Jesus, to whom we must be conformed in all
   things: Luke ii. 52, He grew in wisdom and stature:' the meaning is,
   his human capacity was enlarged by degrees according to his progress in
   age and strength, for in all things he was like us except sin, and our
   reason is ripened and perfected together with our age.

   10. We may learn of worldly men, who join house to house, and field to
   field,' Isa. v. 8, and are never satisfied. So there is a holy
   covetousness in spiritual things, when we join faith to faith, Rom. i.
   17, and obedience to obedience, one degree to another: our blessings
   are better, and the chiefest good should not be followed with a slacker
   hand; it is our happiness to enjoy the infinite God, and therefore we
   should not set a stint and limit to our desires. With what arts and
   methods of increase doth a covetous man seek to advance himself? He
   liveth more by hope than by memory; and what he hath seemeth nothing to
   what he expecteth. So should we forget the things that are behind, and
   reach forth to the things that are before us,' Phil. iii. 14. A
   covetous man seemeth the poorer the more he hath gotten: go should we
   grow humble with every enjoyment; it is a good degree of grace to see
   how much we want grace. A covetous man maketh it the main work and
   business of his life to increase his estate: He goeth to bed late,
   riseth early, eateth the bread of sorrows,' and all for a little pelf.
   The strength of lust should shame us. Should not we make religion the
   business of our lives, and our great employment? Shall we be as
   insatiable as the grave to the world, when a little grave serveth the
   turn?

   Obs. 2. The next thing which I am to do is to give you some
   observations concerning growth in grace: they are these:--

   1. To discern growth there is required some time. A total change, which
   is far more sensible than growth, that may be in an instant; then a
   sinner, now a saint; but there must be a competent time to judge of our
   growth; we cannot discern it by single acts, so much as by the greater
   portions of our lives. We cannot so easily find out how we grow by
   every sermon as by comparing our past estate with our present: we do
   not fly to the top of Jacob's ladder, but go up step by step; [60] it
   is a work of time; and so we may judge of our not growing, if after a
   long time we are where we were, under the power of the game prejudices,
   or the same doubts, or the same lusts still; see Heb. v. 12.

   2. In the growing of saints there is much difference; all the plants in
   Christ's garden are not of a like height and stature; some that are
   more publicly useful have their five talents, others but two; some
   thrive more, and grow of a sudden: 2 Thes. i. 3, Your faith grew
   exceedingly;' others are weak and slow, and yet they are fruitful: we
   all grow according to the measure of a part, Eph. iv.; that is,
   according to the rate of that part which we sustain in the body. A
   finger groweth not to the quantity of an arm; they all grow, but the
   growth of all is not equal.

   3. Growth in grace is always accompanied with growth in knowledge: 2
   Peter iii. 18, But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and
   Saviour Jesus Christ,' &c. Plants that grow out of the sun send up a
   longer stalk, but the fruit is worse. Some Christians pitch all their
   care upon the growth of love, and take no pains to grow in knowledge;
   but this is not right; we should always follow on to know the Lord,'
   Hosea vi. 3. We read that Christ grew in knowledge;' we do not read
   that he grew in grace. God's choicest saints are always bettering their
   notions of God. Moses, his first request was, Tell me thy name,' Exod.
   iv., and afterwards, show me thy glory,' Exod. xxxiii. Our fairest
   portion in heaven is the satisfaction of the understanding with the
   knowledge of God: therefore if we would have grace multiplied, it must
   be through the knowledge of God,' 2 Peter i. 2; the more shine, the
   more warmth.

   4. Growth of knowledge in the growing and increase is less sensible
   than the growth of grace, but afterward more sensible. As a plant
   increaseth in length and stature, though we do not see the progress,
   but afterwards we know that it hath grown, growth in grace is always
   cum lucta, with many assaults, and so more sensible, whereas the work
   upon the understanding is more still and silent; draw away the curtain,
   and the light cometh in without any more stir; our ignorance vanisheth
   silently, and without such strife as goeth to the taming of carnal
   affections: but afterwards it is more sensible, for we have not always
   a spiritual feeling, but the effects of knowledge are standing and
   permanent: Eph. v. 8, Ye were darkness, but now are light in the Lord.'

   5. Progress in knowledge is rather in degrees than in parts and matters
   known: I mean, it consisteth not so much in knowing new truths, as in a
   greater proportion of light; yet I say it is rather, not altogether,
   for a man may walk in present practices which future light may disprove
   and retract; but usually the increase of a Christian is rather in the
   measure of knowledge than in knowing new things; the light shineth more
   and more,' Prov. iv. I know God more, Christ more, the vanity of the
   world more, the odiousness of sin more, that is, more practically and
   in another manner than I did before; old principles are improved and
   perfected. I speak this because of the danger to which men expose
   themselves by expecting new light, keeping the soul from an
   establishment in present principles, and looking for new truths to be
   revealed to them.

   6. Of all graces we need most to grow in faith: 1 Thes. iii. 10, I
   desire to see you, that I may perfect that which is lacking in your
   faith;' Luke xvii. 5, Lord, increase our faith;' and Mark ix. 24, Lord,
   I believe; help my unbelief.' Faith is most defective; our assent is
   tremulous; our affiance weak, and faith is most assaulted. All the
   temptations of Satan tend to weaken your faith, and all other graces
   depend upon the increase of faith.

   7. Growth in parts and gifts must needfully be distinguished from
   growth in grace. Many may grow in parts that go back in grace; you can
   only discern a mere growth in parts and gifts by pride and self ends:
   Knowledge puffeth up,' 1 Cor. viii. 1. When men grow in abilities, and
   grow more proud and carnal, it is a sad symptom.

   8. The infallible signs of growth in grace are three--when we grow more
   spiritual, more solid, more humble.

   [1.] More spiritual. The growth of wicked men in spiritual wickedness
   is less debauched, but more malicious; so will our growth in grace be
   discerned by our spirituality in our aims, when our ends are more
   elevated to God's glory, &c. In our grounds and principles; as when we
   resist sin out of love to God, and as it is contrary to our purity and
   holiness, and when we are carried out against inward corruptions: such
   as the world doth not take notice of; not only against sins, but lusts
   and thoughts, for that argueth more light and more love. So when we
   regard the spirituality of duties, serving the Lord in the spirit.' So
   when we relish the more spiritual part of the word, plain and solid
   preaching, rather than such as is garish and full of the pomp of words:
   1 Cor. ii. 6, We speak wisdom among those that are perfect;; the
   trappings of an ordinance are baits to take the more carnal sort of
   hearers. Plutarch, in his treatise of growth in moral virtue, [61]
   wherein are many notable things applicable to growth in grace, saith
   that a man that hath made some progress in virtue is like a physician,
   that, coming into a garden, he doth not consider flowers for their
   beauty, as gallants do, but for their use and virtue in medicine. So he
   doth not consider speech for its fineness, but fitness and
   seasonableness to present use. The same holdeth good also in growth in
   grace; the more we grow, the more we regard the spiritual part of the
   word, and such as is of a practical use and concernment.

   [2.] More solid and judicious: Phil. i. 9, I pray God your love may
   abound more and more in all judgment.' There is a childishness in
   religion as well as nature, 1 Cor. xiii. 11, when we are led altogether
   by fancy and affection; but afterward we grow more prudent, sober, and
   solid. Growth, then, is not to be measured by intenseness and vigour of
   affection that goeth and cometh, and in the infancy of grace our
   affections are most warm and pregnant. A young tree may have more
   leaves and blossoms, but an old tree is more deeply rooted, and young
   Christians seem altogether to be made up of will and affections, and
   fervorous motions, but have less of judgment and solidity, many times
   of sincerity. [62] As men in a deep thirst take down what is offered to
   them to drink before they discern the taste of it, so acts of will
   outstart the understanding; but in old men, nature being spent, and
   through long acquaintance with religion there are not such quick and
   lively motions; the one are sick of love, have more qualms and agonies;
   the other are more rooted in love, and grow more firm, constant, solid,
   rational, and wise, in ordering the spiritual life.

   [3.] More humble; as it is a good progress in learning to know our
   ignorance; they that have but a smattering are most conceited.
   Plutarch, in the fore-mentioned treatise, tells us of the saying of
   Menedemus, that those that went to study at Athens at first seemed to
   themselves to be wise, afterwards only lovers of wisdom, then orators
   such as could speak of wisdom, and last of all, knowing nothing, with
   the increase of learning still laying aside their pride and arrogancy.
   [63] So it is with those that grow in grace by acquaintance with God:
   light is increased and made more reflective, and they are more sensible
   of their obligations to God, and so are more tender, and by long
   experience are better acquainted with their own hearts; and that is the
   reason why we have such humble acknowledgments from them. Paul, a
   sanctified vessel, yet calleth himself chiefest of sinners,' 1 Tim, i.
   15, and less than the least of the saints,' Eph. iii. 8. And Agur,
   Prov. xxx. 2, 3, Surely I am more brutish than any man; I have not the
   understanding of a man, I have neither learned wisdom, nor have the
   knowledge of the holy.' So if you did overhear the secret confessions
   of the saints to God, you would think them the vilest persons in the
   world, for so they are in their own sense and representations to God.

   9. The lowest evidences of growth in grace are longing for food, and
   being humble for want of growth. For the first, longing for food, see 1
   Peter ii. 2. Life hath a nutritive appetite joined with it, when that
   is strong it is a sign the soul is healthy, it will grow. As we say of
   children that take the dug kindly, they will thrive and do well enough.
   For the second, humble for want of growth, see Mark ix. 24, Help my
   unbelief.' It is a sign you mind the work, and are sensible of
   spiritual defects, which is a great advantage.

   10. Growth is the special fruit of the divine grace. God giveth the
   increase, 1 Cor. iii. 6. Plants thrive better by the dew of heaven than
   when they are watered by hand. Grace, that is necessary to every
   action, is much more necessary to every degree. In the text, the
   apostle doth not exhort, but pray, mercy, peace, and love be
   multiplied.' Our endeavours are necessary, as ploughing and digging are
   necessary, but the blessing cometh from above. These are the
   observations; let us now apply all.

   Use 1. Let us be earnest with God for this increase. He hath the riches
   of glory,' Eph. iii. 16, which we cannot exhaust. You honour God when
   you go for more; you want more, and he can give more; when men are
   contented with a little, it is a sign either of hardness of heart, they
   are not sensible of their wants; or of unbelief, as if God had no
   higher and better things to give us.

   Use 2. First, It showeth us how far they are from being Christians that
   care not for the least degree of grace, that do not spend a thought
   that way; these are far from the kingdom of God.

   Secondly, That are fallen back and have lost the savouriness of their
   spirits, and their delight in communion with God. Time was when they
   could not let a day pass without a duty, nor a duty pass without some
   sensible experience of God, but now can spend whole days and weeks and
   never give God a visit; time was when there could not a carnal motion
   arise, but they were up in arms against it, but now their hearts swarm
   with vain thoughts, and they can swallow gross sins without remorse;
   improvident mis-spence of time was once a great burden, but they have
   lost their tenderness, and can spend a Sabbath unprofitably and find no
   regret; their vain thoughts were wont to trouble them, but now not
   their carnal practices; duty was once sweet, but now their greatest
   bondage. Certainly, the candle of the Lord doth not shine upon them as
   it did in the months that are past.'

   Thirdly, Those that are at a stay had need look to themselves; stunted
   trees cumber the ground, and they that go on in a dead, power less
   course do hurt rather than good; lukewarm profession is but the picture
   of religion, and painted things do not grow, but keep at the same
   pitch. If a man were a Christian in good earnest, could he be contented
   with the present weakness of his faith, imperfection of his knowledge,
   with this creeping, cold way of obedience?

   Ver. 3. Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write to you of the
   common salvation, it was needful for me to write to you, and exhort
   you, that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once
   delivered to the saints.

   The apostle, having dispatched the salutation, maketh way for the
   matter of the epistle. This verse is the preface to the whole, wherein
   he proposeth two things:--

   1. The occasion of his writing.

   2. The matter and drift of it.

   1. The occasion of writing this epistle, which was double.

   [1.] His earnestness in promoting their good, beloved, when I gave
   diligence to write to you, of the common salvation.

   [2.] The urgency of the present necessity, it was needful for me to
   write unto you, and exhort you.

   In assigning his earnestness and zeal for their good, you may take
   notice of three things, which I shall explain in their order.

   (1st.) A compellation of their persons, aga'petoi, beloved, a term
   usual in the apostles' writings: the same word is used 1 Peter ii. 11,
   and there translated dearly beloved.' It noteth not only that affection
   which by the law of nature we owe to one another, Rom. xiii. 8, nor
   that love which by the law of bounty and kindness we are bound to
   render to them that love us, Mat. v. 46, but that singular love which
   we owe to them that are one with us in Christ, which is always
   expressed by aga'pe in scripture, and we sometimes translate it
   charity, often love; the Rhemists always charity, whose tenderness in
   this point (as one observeth) is not altogether to be disallowed, lest
   it be confounded with common and impure love, expressed by e'ros; and
   charity, being a church word, is wholly free from such indifferency and
   equivocation: so here, instead of beloved, they render my dearest,
   which fitly noteth the tenderness and bowels that are in Christian
   affection.

   Doct. From this compilation observe, that Christians should be to each
   other as beloved; such dearness and entireness of affection should pass
   between them, that they may entitle one another to their bowels and
   choicer respects.

   The reasons are these:--

   1. None can have better grounds to love another. They are members of
   the same body, 1 Cor. xii. Brothers born of the same womb, living in
   the same family, have defaced all the feelings of nature, and been
   divided in interest and affection. But surely no such schism can happen
   in the same body. Who would use an arm to cut off a leg, or a hand to
   scratch out the eyes? Members care for one another.' Now this is the
   relation which Christ hath left us; he hath not only called us into a
   family, but into a body, Col. iii. 15. See the same pressed, together
   with many other uniting considerations, Eph. iv. 4-6, There is one
   body, one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;
   one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is
   above all, and through all, and in you all,' Let us a little go over
   that place. The first engagement is one body; they are wens and
   monstrous excrescences, not members, that suck all the nourishment to
   themselves. Again, one member lacking, or out of joint, is a pain and
   deformity to the whole. The next engagement is one Spirit, which in all
   other relations can only be had in fancy and imagination. Friends speak
   as if they lived by one common soul, but here it is so really; all
   believers have the same Spirit. I say in other relations, even in the
   nearest, every one is acted by his own soul; but here by one Spirit we
   are baptized into one body,' 1 Cor. xii. 13. What should divide us when
   we have the same Spirit? We have not all the same measures, and that
   occasioneth some difference; as the soul showeth itself in some members
   more than in others, though it acteth all; but the Spirit is the same.
   The next consideration is one hope. Shall not the same earth contain
   those that expect to live in the same heaven? Luther and Zuinglius,
   Cranmer and Hooper, Ridley and Saunders, shall all accord for ever in
   heaven; and certainly it is through the relics of the flesh that they
   cannot accord here. In other relations there may be divisions, because
   they have different hopes, and it may be hopes that entrench and
   encroach upon the good of each other; but here you have one heaven and
   one hope; it is all for you: there may be a difference in the degree of
   glory, but none to provoke pride or feed envy. How will bitter and keen
   spirits look upon each other when they meet in glory? It followeth one
   Lord. We are in the same family, how will you look God in the face if
   you fall a-smiting your fellow-servants?' Mat. xxiv. 45. Then one
   faith. There may be different apprehensions, and every one may abound
   in his own sense in circumstances, but the faith is the same, they
   agree in the same essentials and substantiate of religion. The enemies
   of the church, though divided in interests and opinions, yet, because
   they agree in one common hatred of the saints, can hold together.
   Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, and the men of Tyre, did all conspire
   against Israel, Ps. lxxxiii.; like Samson's foxes, though their faces
   looked several ways, yet were tied to one another by their tails, and
   ran together to burn up the corn-fields; and shall not the people of
   God agree, who all profess one and the same faith? The next
   consideration is one baptism; that is, one badge of profession: it was
   a cause of difference among Jacob's sons that one had a coat of divers
   colours,' a special badge of affection. Consider you are all brought in
   by the baptism of water and the use of ordinary means; none have a
   special and privilegiate call from heaven above the rest of their
   brethren. Lastly, it followeth, one God and Father of all. You all
   worship the same God; there is nothing divides more than different
   objects of worship. When one scorneth what another adoreth it is
   extremely provoking; [64] it was the plea used to Joseph, Gen. l. 17,
   Pardon the trespass of the servants of thy father's God.' Thus you see
   that we have better grounds of love than others have.

   2. None can have higher motives than the love of Christ: Eph. v. 2,
   Walk in love, as Christ hath also loved us.' The pagan world was never
   acquainted with such a motive. Now none are affected and melted with
   the love of Christ but those that have an interest in it. Therefore
   Christ expecteth more love from Christians than from others: Mat. v.
   46, If ye love them that love you, what reward shall ye have? do not
   even the publicans the same?.' The publicans were accounted the most
   vile and unworthy men in that age; but a publican would love those of
   his own party; therefore a Christian that is acquainted with Christ's
   love to strangers, to enemies, should manage his affections with more
   excellency and pureness. The world is not acquainted with the love of
   Christ, and therefore only loveth its own,' but we are acquainted with
   it, and therefore should love others. See John xiii. 34, See that ye
   love one another, as I have loved you.' Jesus Christ came from heaven,
   not only to repair and preserve the notions of the Godhead by the
   greatness of his sufferings, but to propound to us a more exact pattern
   of charity, and to elevate duty between man and man.

   3. None have a greater charge. Christ calleth it his new commandment:'
   John xiii. 34, A new commandment give I unto you, that ye love one
   another.' How new, since it was as old as the moral law, or law of
   nature? I answer--It is called new because excellent, as a new song,
   &c., or rather because solemnly and specially renewed by him, and
   commended to their care, as new things and new laws are much esteemed
   and prized; or enforced by a new reason and example of his own death.
   So 1 John iii. 23, aute e'stin e entole`, This is the commandment, that
   we should believe in him whom he hath sent, and love one another as he
   gave commandment.' It is made equal with faith. All the scriptures aim
   at faith and love;' it was Christ's dying charge, the great charge
   which he left at his death: John xv. 17, These things I command you,
   that ye love one another.' Speeches of dying men are received with most
   veneration and reverence, especially the charge of dying friends. The
   brethren of Joseph, fearing lest he should remember the injuries
   formerly done to him, they use this plea, Thy father did command us
   before he died, saying,' &c., Gen. 1. 16. Let us fulfil the will of the
   dead. When Christ took leave of his disciples, he left this as his last
   charge. Think of it when thou art bent to quarrel or to neglect others.
   Shall I slight his last commandment, his dying charge? It is made the
   character of Christ's disciples: Hereby shall all men know that ye are
   my disciples, if ye love one another.' It is as much as your
   discipleship,' &c.

   Use 1. It serveth to press you to this amity and love. Why should those
   that are to meet in the same heaven be of such an estranged heart to
   each other? Certainly it cometh from evil. In two cases God's people
   can agree well enough--in glory and in misery; in a prison, as Ridley
   and Hooper did; and in heaven, as all do; in heaven, where there is no
   sin, and in a prison, where lusts lie low, and are under restraint. Oh!
   then labour for love and meekness. To which end take a few
   directions:--(1.) Honour the least of Christ's wherever you find it. If
   any should despise others for their meanness, it would be more proper
   to God to do so than for any other, because they are most distant from
   his perfection; but he will not despise smoking flax,' Mat. xii. 20.
   You do not know what a spark of glory and of the divine nature may lie
   hid under smoke and a covert of darkness. Christ loved the young man
   that had but some accomplishments of nature in him,' Mark x. 21. Jesus
   loved him;' much more should you, when you find any weak appearances of
   Christ, though they do not come up to your measures. (2.) Let not
   difference in opinion divide you. It were to be wished that believers
   were of one heart and of one way--that they all thought and spoke the
   same thing; yet, if they differ, cherish them for what of God is in
   them. In a great organ the pipes are of a different size, which maketh
   the harmony and melody the sweeter: Whereunto we have attained, let us
   walk by the same rule, and mind the same thing,' Phil. iii. 16. Many
   men love to impropriate religion, as if there were nothing of God to be
   found but in their own sphere. It is natural to a man to do so. We
   would be singular, and engross all repute of piety, orthodoxy, and
   right worship to ourselves. (3.) Take heed of letting love degenerate
   into compliance. There is the bond of the Spirit,' Eph. iv. 3, and
   there is an unequal yoke,' 2 Cor. vi. 14; there are cords of love,' and
   the chain of antichristian interests, and you must be careful to make
   distinction, Isa. liv. 15. They shall gather, but not by me.' There are
   evil mixtures and confederacies that are not of God, which you must
   beware of, lest by joining with men you break with God, and turn love
   into compliance. The image was crumbled to pieces where the toes were
   mixed of iron and clay, Dan. ii. Love may forbear the profession of
   some truths--there is a having faith to ourselves'--but must not yield
   to error. (4.) There are some so vile that they will scarce come within
   the circuit of our Christian respect, such as are the open enemies of
   Christ, and hold things destructive to the foundation of religion: 2
   John 10, If any one bring not this doctrine, bid him not God speed.'
   Vile wretches must know the ill sense the church hath of their
   practices. Elisha would not have looked upon Jehoram, had it not been
   for Jehoshaphat, 2 Kings iii. 14. When men break out into desperate
   rage and enmity to the ways of Christ, or run into damnable errors, it
   is a compliance to show them any countenance. Thus for the
   compellation.

   (2d.) The next circumstance in the occasion is, a testification of the
   greatness of his love and care: pasan spou`den poioumenos, When I gave
   all diligence.' He speaketh as if it were his whole care and thought to
   be helpful to their faith, and therefore did watch every occasion: he
   addeth to write to you, that is a further testimony of his love, that
   he would think of them absent; to write, when he could not speak to
   them. So that here are two things:--(1.) The greatness of his love;
   (2.) The way of expressing it, by writing.

   Obs. 1. From the first, I gave all diligence, observe, that offices of
   love are most commendable when they are dispensed with care and
   diligence: it is not enough to do good, but we must do good with
   labour, and care, and diligence. See Titus iii. 14, Let ours also learn
   to maintain good works;' in the original, proistasthai kalon ergon,
   watch for good works, hunt out occasions. So Heb. x. 24, Consider one
   another, to provoke to love and good works:' it is not enough to
   admonish one another, but we must consider, study one another's
   tempers, that we may be most useful in a way of spiritual communion. So
   Rom. xii. 17, Providing for things honest in the sight of God and men,'
   pronoou'menoi, catering, contriving, as carnal men do for their lusts,
   Rom. xiii. 14. So for ministers; it is not enough for them to press
   that wherein they are most versed, or what cometh next to hand, but to
   study what will most conduce to the ends of their ministry with such a
   people: Study to approve thyself a good workman,' &c. Well, then, try
   your Christian respects by it. The spirit is most pure, not only when
   you do good, but when you do it with care and diligence. Wicked men may
   stumble upon good, but they do not study to do good; common spirits are
   moved to pray, but they do not watch unto prayer, Eph. vi. 18; that is,
   make ii their care to keep their hearts in order, and expressly to suit
   their prayer to their present necessities; many may do that which is
   useful to the church, but they do not watch opportunities, and make it
   their design to be serviceable.

   Again, let no care be grievous to you, so you may do good: I am willing
   to spend myself, and to be spent for you,' 2 Cor. xii. 15. We cannot be
   wasted in a better employment; so we shine, no matter though we burn
   down to the socket, or, like silk-worms, die in our work: Phil. ii. 17,
   If I be offered upon the sacrifice of your faith, I rejoice with you,'
   &c. The greatest pains and care, even to a maceration of ourselves,
   should not be unpleasing to a gracious heart. Certainly this is an
   expression will shame us: I gave all diligence; he sought all
   opportunities, when we will not take them. Love will put us upon
   searching out and devising ways of doing good.

   Obs. 2. This love he would express by writing when he could not come to
   them. Holy men take all opportunities to do good; present or absent,
   they are still mindful of the saints, and write when they cannot speak:
   as Ambrose alludeth to Zacharias, writing when he was stricken dumb.
   [65] A man would think that absence were a fair excuse, a writ of ease
   served upon us by providence; yet godly men cannot be so satisfied, but
   must use all helps to promote the common benefits: a willing mind will
   never want an opportunity, and they that have a heart will be sure to
   find an occasion; they give all diligence to promote others' welfare;
   and therefore use all means, take all occasions. Which showeth--(1.)
   How far they are from this temper that do nothing but by constraint. A
   ready mind' is a special qualification in an elder, 1 Peter v. 2, and a
   sure note of our reward, 1 Cor. ix. 17. But now when the awe of the
   magistrate prevaileth more than love of souls, everything is done
   grudgingly. It is Paul's advice, Be instant in season and out of
   season,' 2 Tim. iv. 2; not only at such seasons as are fairly offered,
   but where corruption and laziness would plead an excuse. Christ
   discoursed with the woman at the well when weary, John. iv. We have but
   a little while to live in the world, and we know not how soon we may be
   taken off from our usefulness; that was Peter's motive to write, 2
   Peter i. 12, 13. (2.) This showeth their sottishness that are not
   careful to redeem opportunities for themselves. Jude is studying which
   way to promote the salvation of others, and many do not look to the
   state and welfare of their own souls. Again observe:--

   Obs. 3. That writing is a great help to promote the common salvation.
   By this means we speak to the absent and to posterity; and by this
   means are the oracles of God preserved in public records, which other
   wise were in danger of being corrupted, if still left to the
   uncertainty of verbal tradition. By this means are errors more publicly
   confuted, and a testimony against them transmitted to future ages.
   Speech is more transient, but writing remaineth. So Christ telleth the
   apostles that they should bring forth fruit, and their fruit should
   remain,' John xv. 16. Apostolical doctrine being committed to writing,
   remaineth as a constant rule of faith and manners, and by the public
   explications of the church left upon record we come to understand the
   dispensations of God to every age, what measures of light they enjoyed,
   how the truths of God were opposed, how vindicated. Finally, by writing
   the streams of salvation are conveyed into every family, as a common
   fountain by so many pipes and conveyances, that in the defect of public
   preaching good supply may be had in this kind. Well, then, it is an
   acceptable service to the church which they do who can handle the pen
   of the writer,' Judges v. 14, when they send abroad a public testimony
   against error, a public monument of their affection to the truth. The
   goose-quill hath smote antichrist under the fifth rib. The Earl of
   Derby accused Bradford for doing more hurt by his writings than
   preaching. Hezekiah's servants are commended for copying out' the
   Proverbs of Solomon, Prov. xxv. 1. They deserve not to be censured, but
   commended and cherished, that do service in this kind. I confess there
   is no end of books. Pride and ambition may put many upon scribbling,
   and filling the world with chaff and vanity; so that there needeth a
   restraint rather than an incitement. Some merely blur paper, [66] which
   is no small discouragement to modest and able men. Surely care should
   be taken to prevent abuse: [67] writing is a more public way of
   teaching, and men should not undertake it without a call. Jerome's
   advice is good, Ne ad scribendum cito prosilias, et levi ducaris
   insania; multo tempore disce quod doceas (Hier. ad Rusticum
   Mohachium)--be not too hasty to write; that which is prepared for
   public instruction had need be prepared with great deliberation. The
   vestal virgins were ten years in learning, and ten years in practising,
   and ten years in teaching and prescribing directions to others. [68]
   When every sciolist will be obtruding his notions upon the world, it is
   a great abuse; for by this means useful men are discouraged, or if they
   publish their labours, they are not taken notice of, as two or three
   grains of good corn are hardly found out under a heap of chaff. But
   take away this abuse, writing is a great help to the church in
   practicals, that people may still be furnished with good books in every
   age, old ones written long ago being neglected, or lying hid in some
   private studies, or else not coming up to the rate of present light, or
   not answering the temper of the present age, not meeting with the sins,
   nor encouraging the graces within use and exercise. Again, in
   controversial there is great use of writing, controversies not being so
   easily determined by the judgment of the ear as the eye. In the clamour
   of disputations and violent discourse, usually there is such a dust
   raised, that we cannot so soon discern the truth as upon a calm debate
   and mature consideration of what is delivered in writing; which I
   remember was the cause why Tertullian wrote his treatise against the
   Jews, lest the tumult and noise of the dispute should be some prejudice
   to the truth. [69] But of this enough.

   (3d.) I come now to the next circumstance in the insinuation or
   profession of his readiness to do them good, and that is the object or
   subject concerning which he would write to them, the common salvation,
   a fit argument for saints.

   Obs. 1. The apostles, in their private and familiar letters, were very
   spiritual; yea, when they wrote about their ordinary occasions, as Paul
   to Philemon, still they were ready to impart some spiritual gift,
   whether by conference or writing. Those letters, then, should be most
   welcome to us that mind us of the best things.

   But what was this common salvation?' I suppose by it is meant that
   salvation wherein he and they and all the saints were concerned. This
   expression may be conceived to be an argument, either of the apostle's
   meekness; though he were an apostle, and they private believers, yet I
   and you have but one common salvation;' as captains, to endear
   themselves to their troops, will say, Fellow soldiers, as engaged in
   one common warfare; or else of his holiness, the common salvation;'
   that is, which I am to look after as well as you; or else of his love
   to their salvation, which he would look after as well as his own. The
   saints carry on a joint trade to heaven; they are all partners, and
   salvation lieth in common between them: you are to promote mine, and I
   yours. Well, then, he having their faith and salvation in like respect
   with his own, he was willing to write to establish them in the truth. I
   shall form the point in the very words of the text.

   Obs. That the salvation of the people of God is a common
   salvation,--not to good and bad; for it belongeth only to a peculiar
   people,--but common to all believers: it is common to them in divers
   regards.

   1. They all are chosen by the same grace; there is no special reason
   why Paul should obtain mercy rather than John, and Andrew, and Thomas.
   Free grace acteth upon the same terms. All God's motives are taken from
   himself, from his own bosom: For my own sake,' saith the Lord, Isa.
   xliii. 25. There may be a difference in the creature; John and Andrew
   may be otherwise tempered and disposed than Paul and Peter; but God's
   motives to choose both the one and the other are still the same.

   2. They have the same Christ: There is no other name under heaven,'
   Acts iv. 12; and Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and for
   ever,' Heb. xiii. 8. In all ages the church hath been saved by Christ;
   none of the holy ones of God had a more worthy Redeemer than we have.
   Christ gave the same ransom to purchase heaven for me, and thee, and
   others: as under the law, the rich and the poor were to give the same
   ransom: Exod. xxx. 15, The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall
   not give less than half a shekel.' The price of Christ's blood for all
   souls was equal. If they had a more worthy Christ to die for them, you
   might be discouraged.

   3. You are justified by the same righteous one as far as another: The
   righteousness of Christ is unto all, and upon all that believe, and
   there is no difference.' Rom. iii. 22. In inherent righteousness, there
   is a great deal of difference; one hath more grace, and another hath
   less. In sanctification there are degrees, but as to imputed
   righteousness, they are all equal; none of the saints hath finer linen,
   or are decked with a better vesture than you are. There is a difference
   in the degree of faith, which receiveth this righteousness, but there
   is no difference in the righteousness itself. A giant or strong man
   holdeth a precious jewel, so doth a child; the jewel is the same;
   though a man holdeth it with a stronger hand, it loseth nothing of its
   worth in the child's hand. [70] So here the righteousness is the same,
   though the faith be not the same.

   4. As we have the same privileges, so the same way; all by faith; and
   the faith of the weakest as to the essential privileges is as accept
   able to God as the faith of the strongest: 2 Peter i. 1, Simon Peter to
   them that have obtained like precious faith with us.' It is like
   precious for kind, though not degree; [71] of the same nature, worth,
   and property, though every one cannot come up to the height of an
   apostle.

   5. They are all under the same rule and direction: Gal. vi. 16, As many
   as walk by this rule, peace on them, and the whole Israel of God.' The
   way of error is manifold, but there is but one path that leadeth to
   heaven.

   6. They are in one mystical body, ministering supplies to one another:
   Col. ii. 19, Not holding the head, from which all the body, by joints
   and bands, having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth
   with the increase of God.' The head is the fountain of all vital
   influence, but the joints and bands do minister and convey the
   nourishments; the whole body is still increasing and growing up to
   perfection, and they are helping one another, as the members of the
   same body do continue the communion of the same spirit, or, by the
   continuity of the parts, make way for the animation and quickening by
   the same soul.

   What use shall we make of this? I answer:--

   1. It hinteth public care, that we should help salvation forward, both
   in ourselves and others; rejoice in others' faith as well as in your
   own: Rom. i. 12, Comforted by the mutual faith of you and me.' His
   faith was a comfort to them, and their faith a comfort to him; nay, out
   of an excess of love and charity, Paul useth an expression not
   imitable: Rom. ix. 3, I could wish that I were accursed from Christ for
   my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh.'

   2. It checketh the impropriating of grace and religion, to such an
   order or sort of Christians, such as was the ambition of former times;
   as if all religion were confined within a cloister, or wrapped up in a
   black garment; those were called religious houses, and those the
   clergy, or God's portion, all others were lay and secular. Oh! how far
   was this from the modesty of the apostles! Peter calleth the faith of
   common Christians, like precious faith;' and Jude speaketh of a common
   salvation.' So the Jews before them, they confined God's choice to
   their nation; they could not endure to hear of salvation among the
   Gentiles,' and of a righteousness that came to all, and upon all that
   believe.' We have an envious nature, and would fain impropriate common
   favours. The church of Rome would fain bring all the world to their
   lore, and confine truth and faith and salvation within the precincts of
   their synagogue; they seize upon and possess themselves of the keys of
   heaven, to open to whom they please. Now God hath broken down all pales
   and inclosures, they would fain rear up a new partition wall. Corrupt
   nature envieth that others should have a fellowship in our privileges,
   therefore the same spirit still worketh; men do so value their lesser
   differences, and that distinct way and opinion which they have taken
   up, as if none could be saved but those of their own party and
   persuasion; it is very natural to us to affix holiness to our own
   opinions, and to allow none to be good but those that jump with us in
   all things. There were factions at Corinth, and those that said, I am
   of Christ,' were counted a faction too, 1 Cor. i. 12, as arrogating
   Christ to themselves; therefore the apostle writing to them, saith, 1
   Cor. 1, 2, To the saints at Corinth, and all that call on the Lord
   Jesus Christ, theirs and ours.' We are apt to be rigid to those that
   differ from us, and to be favourable to those that think with us.
   Tertullian [72] saith of some in his time, Illic ipsum est
   promereri--it is holiness enough to be one of them. Oh! let it not be
   so among the people of God! do not nullify your brethren. Rom. xiv. 10,
   Why dost thou set at nought thy brethren? ti` exoutheneis, Tertullian
   rendereth it, Cur nullificas fratrem? When God hath made a Christian of
   him, why dost thou make nothing of him? and cry up every private
   opinion for another religion, as if none could be saints and believers
   but they that think with you? Take heed of impaling the common
   salvation; inclosures are against the law.

   3. It showeth that there are not several ways to heaven, there is but
   one common salvation' to all the elect, and one common faith,' as Paul
   saith, Titus i. 4, To Titus my own son according to the common faith.'
   There are a sort of libertines that think a man may be saved in any
   religion, so he doth not walk against his own light. Do not flatter
   yourselves; all the elect are brought to heaven the same way, whether
   Jew or Gentile, bond or free;' there is a good old way, Jer. vi. 16,
   which if we miss we are sure to perish.

   4. It informeth us who are best to deal in matters of religion; those
   that are religious, that can call it a common salvation;' that is,
   common to them with others; they have share in it, and therefore they
   can best defend it. Differences are aggravated when carnal men
   intermeddle in religious controversies, but those are likest to deal
   with most purity of zeal and love that can say your salvation is their
   salvation; so in the next verse, They turn the grace of our God into
   wantonness;' they that have an interest in grace cannot endure to see
   it abused.

   5. It forbiddeth scorn of the meanest Christian. They have as good
   hopes through grace as you have in Jesus Christ: all are one, master
   and servant, rich and poor. Onesimus, a poor runagate servant, yet
   being converted, Paul calleth him his faithful and beloved brother,'
   Philem. 10. In earthly relation there is a difference, yet in regard of
   the common faith and common salvation we are all one.

   I have now done with the first part of the occasion, his earnestness in
   promoting their good. I now come to the second part, the urgency of the
   present necessity: It was needful for me to write to you, and exhort
   you, which is said to show that this epistle was not only occasioned by
   the fervency of his own love, but the present exigence and necessity as
   affairs then stood; the school of Simon, the Gnostics, and divers other
   heretics of a like loose strain and libertine spirit, sought to
   withdraw and alienate them from the truth, for that was the necessity
   here expressed, as appeareth by the next verse. Exhortations, the more
   necessary, the more pressing; need quickens both writer and reader; and
   the less arbitrary things are, the more tho roughly we go about them.

   Obs. 1. Observe from hence, that necessity is a time for duty;
   necessity is God's season to work, and therefore it should be ours: For
   a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness,' 1 Peter i. 6. Duties are
   best done when we see they are needful and necessary; things that are
   arbitrary are done with a loose heart; the creatures' duty towards God
   begins at the sense of their own wants: James i. 5, If any man lack
   wisdom,' &c. Well, then, take this hint for prayer and other services;
   if there be a need, omit not to call upon God: as when distempers grow
   upon the spirit, the heart is unquiet, the affections unruly, a
   deadness increaseth upon you, temptations are urgent, and, too strong
   for you, cry out of violence, as the ravished virgins. So when
   conscience is incessantly clamorous, David could not find ease till he
   confessed, Ps. xxxii. 5. Silence will cause roaring, and restraint of
   prayer, disquiet. Again, if there be a need, omit not to call upon men
   by exhortation and counsel, as when you see things grow worse every
   day, and can hold no longer: the king's danger made the king's dumb son
   speak: Paul was forced in spirit when he saw the whole city given to
   idolatry,' Acts xvii. 16. When we see men by whole droves running into
   error, and ways destructive to their souls, is there not a need? is it
   not a time to speak? Men say we are bitter, but we must be faithful. So
   they say the physician is cruel, and the chirurgeon a tyrant, when
   their own distempers need so violent a remedy: can we see you perish,
   and hold our peace?

   Obs. 2. Observe again, that ministers must mainly press those doctrines
   that are most needful. It is but a cheap zeal that declaimeth against
   antiquated errors, and things now out of use and practice. We are to
   consider what the present age needeth. What use was it of in Christ's
   time to aggravate the rebellion of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram? Or now to
   handle the case of Henry the Eighth's divorce? what profit hence to our
   present auditories? There are present truths' to be pressed, 2 Peter i.
   12; upon these should we bestow our pains and care. Usually when we
   reflect upon the guilt of the times, people would have us preach
   general doctrines of faith and repentance. But we may answer, It is
   needful for us to exhort you,' &c. To what end is it to dispute the
   verity of the Christian religion against heathens, when there are many
   seducers that corrupt the purity of it amongst ourselves? In a country
   audience, what profit is it to dispute against Socinians, when there
   are drunkards, and practical atheists and libertines, that need other
   kind of doctrine? He that crieth out upon old errors not now produced
   upon the public stage, doth but fight with, ghosts and challenge the
   dead. So again, to charm with sweet strains of grace when a people need
   rousing, thundering doctrine, is but to minister cordials to a full and
   plethoric body, that rather needeth phlebotomy and evacuations. It is a
   great deal of skill, and God can only teach it us, to be seasonable to
   deliver what is needful, and as the people are able to bear.

   Obs. 3. Again, observe, the need of the primitive church was an
   occasion to complete the canon and rule of faith. We are beholden to
   the seducers of that age that the scripture is so full as it is: we
   should have wanted many epistles had not they given the occasion. Thus
   God can bring light out of darkness, and by errors make way for the
   more ample discovery of truth.

   I have done with the occasion. I come now to the matter and drift of
   this epistle, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the
   faith that was once delivered to the saints; in which there is a
   necessary duty pressed; and these two circumstances are notable--the
   act and the object. (1.) The act is to contend earnestly; it is but one
   word in the original, epagonizesthai; but it is a word of a vehement
   signification, and therefore fitly rendered to contend earnestly,' (2.)
   The object of this contention, which is, the faith once delivered to
   the saints. Faith may be taken either for the doctrine of faith or the
   grace of faith; [73] both are too good to be lost, either the word
   which we believe, or faith by which we believe; the former is intended:
   faith is taken for sound doctrine, such as is necessary to be owned and
   believed unto salvation, which he presseth them to contend for, that
   they might preserve it safe and sound to future ages. Now this faith is
   described--(1st.) By the manner of its conveyance, dothei'se, it is
   given to be kept; it is not a thing invented, but given; not found out
   by us, but delivered by God himself; and delivered as to our custody,
   that we may keep it for posterity, [74] as the oracles of God in the
   Old Testament were delivered to the Jews to be kept by them, Rom. iii.
   1. (2d.) By the time of its giving out to the world: the doctrine of
   salvation was given but once, as never to be altered and changed, once
   for all. (3d.) The persons to whom, to the saints; so he calleth the
   church according to the use of the scriptures, or else by saints is
   meant the holy apostles, given to them to be propagated by them. I
   shall first speak of the object, before I come to the duty itself; and
   because the description here used will agree both to the grace of faith
   and the doctrine of faith, though the doctrine of faith be mainly
   intended, yet give me leave a little to apply it to the grace: if it be
   a diversion, it shall be a short one.

   Obs. 1. This faith is said to be given. Observe, that faith is a gift;
   so Phil. i. 29, To you it is given to believe;' umin echari'sthe, given
   freely, Eph. ii. 8, By grace ye are saved, through faith, not of
   yourselves, it is the gift of God.' We cannot get it of ourselves; a
   mere imagination and thinking of Christ's death is easy, but to bring
   the soul and Christ together requires the power of God, Eph. i. 19. We
   cannot merit it, and therefore it is a pure gift. God bestoweth it on
   them that can give nothing for it: works before conversion cannot
   engage God, and works after conversion cannot satisfy God. Well, then,
   let us admire the mercy of God in the covenant of grace. Christ is a
   gift: John iv. 10, If thou knewest the gift,' &c. His righteousness is
   a gift: Rom. v. 16, The free gift is of many offences unto
   justification;' and faith, which receiveth this righteousness, is a
   gift: so that all is carried in a way of grace; in the covenant of
   grace nothing is required but what is best owed. Again, it teacheth us
   whither to go for faith: seek it of God, it is his gift; all the
   endeavour and labour of the creature will never procure it. But must we
   not use the means of prayer, meditation, and hearing, &c.? I
   answer--Yes; for (1.) God dispenseth it in a way of means: Mark iv. 24,
   With what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again, and unto
   you that hear more shall be given.' According unto the measure of our
   hearing, if the Lord will work, is the measure of our faith: Acts xvi.
   14, The Lord opened Lydia's heart to attend to the things spoken by
   Paul.' God stirreth up to the use of means, and whilst we are taught'
   we are drawn,' John vi. 44, 45. (2.) Though faith be God's gift, man's
   endeavours are still necessary, for supernatural grace doth not exclude
   the ordinary and natural means. Marriage is necessary for the
   propagation of mankind, though the rational soul is from God; yea, more
   care is had of women with child than of brute beasts, because the fruit
   of the womb is the immediate work and blessing of the Lord: so faith is
   of God's planting, and therefore we should be the more careful in the
   use of means.

   Obs. 2. This faith is said to be once given. This will also hold
   concerning grace; for where it is once planted it cannot be totally and
   finally destroyed; rather it is continually supplied by the care and
   faithfulness of God: see 1 Cor. i. 8, and 1 Thes. v. 24, and Phil. i.
   6. And those hypocrites that fall off after a long profession seldom
   recover themselves by repentance,' Heb. vi. 6; 2 Peter ii. 21. Well,
   then, here is comfort to the people of God, that find so many lusts and
   so many temptations. They think they shall never hold out; faith is but
   once given: where it is really given there needeth not a second gift.
   Again, here is caution. Faith is a precious jewel; if once lost
   wilfully after the knowledge of the truth, it is not easily regained.

   Obs. 3. Consider the persons to whom it is given. It is not given to
   every one;' for all men have not faith,' 2 Thes. iii. 2; and the gospel
   is hidden to those that are lost,' 2 Cor. iv. 3; but it is given to the
   saints, to those who were chosen, that they might be saints: which
   showeth--(1.) The excellency of faith; it is a privilegiate and
   peculiar mercy. (2.) That believers are saints; faith giveth an
   interest in Christ, and therefore they must needs be holy: His blood
   cleanseth,' 1 John i. 7; His Spirit sanctifieth,' 1 Cor. vi. 11. Again,
   Faith itself hath a cleansing, purifying virtue: Hearts purified by
   faith,' Acts xv. 9. Faith applieth the blood of Christ; and the hand of
   the laundress is as necessary to cleanse the clothes as the soap
   wherewith they are cleansed. Faith waiteth for the Spirit. It argueth
   from the love of God. Faith and sin are like the poison and the
   antidote, always working one upon another, till faith hath gotten the
   mastery. Well, then, is your faith sanctifying? Strong persuasions of
   an interest in grace, and a loose life, will not suit: we are not
   perfectly clean and holy, but there will be strong desires and earnest
   groans after more holiness; as Ps. li. 10, and Rom. vii. 24, Who shall
   deliver me?' &c.; that is, Oh! that I were; questions are put for
   wishes. So Ps. cxix. 5, Oh! that my ways were directed to keep thy
   statutes.' Yea, there will be not only groans under, but strugglings
   against sin. A child of God may fall into sin, but he cannot rest in it
   and lie down with ease; as mud may be cast into a pure fountain, or
   stirred up in it, but the fountain never ceaseth till it work itself
   clean again. Peter and David stepped aside, but they could find no
   peace till they were reconciled to God: I will return to my first
   husband, then it was better than it is now,' Hosea ii. Again, you may
   know it by the drift and disposition of the heart. Which way lieth the
   bent of your spirits? and what are your constant motions and
   operations? A man that is travelling another way may now and then look
   back. How is your heart inclined? Ps. cxix. 112, I have inclined my
   heart to perform thy statutes always unto the end.' Is there a constant
   inclination towards God? 1 Chron. xxii. 19, Now set your hearts to seek
   the Lord.' Is the heart set? what is your constant course and walk?
   Rom. viii. 1.

   But so much for this digression, occasioned by the suitableness of
   words to the grace of faith. Let us now come to the other acception,
   which is more proper in this place, namely, as faith is put for the
   doctrine of faith. How this was--(1.) Delivered; (2.) Once delivered;
   (3.) To the saints.

   First, Delivered, not invented; [75] it is not the fruit of fancy or
   human devising, but hath its original from God; it was delivered by him
   to holy men chosen for that purpose, and by them delivered by word of
   mouth to the men of that age wherein they lived, and by writing for the
   use of after ages: and delivered to be kept; it is a sacred depositum
   which God hath put into the hands of the church: Keep that which is
   committed to thy trust,' 1 Tim. vi. 20; and To them were committed the
   oracles of God.' Rom. iii. 2. I shall observe--(1.) The mercy of God in
   delivering this faith or rule of salvation. (2.) The duty of the church
   concerning it.

   Obs. 1. The mercy of God in delivering this faith to chosen men, that
   by their means the world might come to the knowledge of it. The
   doctrine of salvation first came out from God, and then was conveyed to
   us by the hands of holy men. We are not sensible enough of the
   privilege, Ps. cxlvii. 19, 20, He showeth his word unto Jacob, his
   statutes and judgments unto Israel, he hath not dealt so with any
   nation,' &c. It is not a common mercy, for many nations want it; nor no
   casual thing. In the primitive times not only the doctrine of the
   apostles was directed and ordered by the Holy Ghost, but also their
   journeys; the gospel came not to them by chance, but as a special gift
   from heaven. But that we may be more sensible of the privilege, I shall
   show you:--

   1. The benefit of the word. By it God's heart is opened to us, and our
   own hearts to ourselves; by it we are acquainted with the way of
   salvation, and come to understand the courses of the Lord's justice and
   mercy, and in what manner he will govern and rule the world, which are
   altogether unknown to them that have not such a revelation delivered to
   them. We should never have known the cause of our misery, our fall in
   Adam, nor the means of our recovery, redemption by Jesus Christ, if
   they had not been delivered to us in this doctrine and rule of faith;
   we should never have known how to worship God, or enjoy God. If carnal
   men should have a liberty to let nature work, and set down a divinity
   of their own, what a goodly religion should we have in the world! a
   very comely chimera no doubt! For practicals it would be large enough I
   am sure, for natural conscience hateth fetters and restraints; in
   doctrinals it would be absurd enough. Man can never take a right
   draught and image of God. Who can empty an ocean with a cockle-shell?
   And since the fall we are grown quite brutish; our conceits are not so
   monstrous in anything as in the worship of God. The pagan philosophers,
   that were most profound in the researches and inquiries of reason, they
   sat abrood, and thought of hatching an excellent religion; but what was
   the issue? Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.' Rom.
   i. 22. All that they produced was fables and high strains of folly,
   mixed with popular rites and customs. There are many things necessary
   to religion, which the angels themselves could not have known if they
   had not been revealed, therefore their knowledge increaseth by
   observing God's dispensations to the church, Eph. iii. 10. The way of
   salvation by Christ is such a mystery as could not have entered into
   the heart of any creature, no, not of an angel. If an angel had been to
   set down which way man should be redeemed, nay, if all the cherubim and
   seraphim, thrones, dominions, and powers had met together in a synod
   and council, and had taken in all the world to their assistance, it
   would have posed them all to have found out such a way as God hath
   appointed. But not to speak of mysteries. There is in the word some
   moralities suitable to the law of nature, which was once written upon
   man's heart; but alas! now there remains only some scattered fragments
   and obscure characters, so defaced that they cannot be read; and how
   blind are we in these things without the word! Witness the sottish
   idolatry of those nations that want it, worshipping stocks or stones,
   yea, a piece of red cloth, or whatever they saw first in the morning.
   And witness those brutish customs among other nations, whereby
   uncleanness and unnatural sins have been authorised by a law.
   Therefore, it is a great mercy that something is delivered, and given
   out as a rule of faith and manners.

   2. That this tradition is written, and put into a stated course in
   those books which we call scriptures. If the revelation of God's will
   had been left to the tradition of men of such a rank or order, what a
   liberty might they take of coining oracles, and obtruding their fancies
   upon the world! It is a great mercy that our faith does not depend upon
   uncertain suggestions, but some main public records, to which all may
   appeal and find satisfaction. Heretofore the Lord revealed himself by
   visions, oracles, and dreams, to persons of eminent holiness and
   sanctity, that they might instruct others; which course was sure enough
   while the people of the world were but a few families, and the persons
   entrusted with God's message had authority and credit sufficient with
   the present age, and lived long to continue the tradition with the more
   certainty to future ages. But afterwards the Lord was pleased to speak
   to his church both by word and writing. His word was necessary for
   further revealing and clearing up the doctrine of salvation; and
   writing was necessary, because when precepts were multiplied it was
   needful for men's memories that they should be written; the long life
   of God's witnesses was lessened, corruptions began to increase, Satan
   giving out lying oracles and visions, idolatrous rites and customs
   crept into the best families, Josh. xxiv. 3, Gen. xxxi. 19; the people
   of God were grown numerous enough to make a commonwealth and politic
   body; therefore, to avoid man's corruptions and Satan's deceits, the
   Lord thought fit that we should have a written rule at hand, as a
   public standard for the trial of all doctrines. God himself wrote the
   first scripture with his own finger upon tables of stone, Exod. xxiv.
   12, and he commanded Moses and the prophets to do the same, Exod. xvii.
   14, and xxxiv. 27; which dispensation of word and writing continued
   till Christ's time, who, as the great doctor of the church, perfected
   the rule of faith, and by the apostles, as so many public notaries,
   consigned it to the use of the church in all ages. When the canon began
   to be complete, the latter apostles pressed the receiving of it; and
   John, as the last, and as one who outlived all the rest, closeth up his
   prophecy thus, Rev. xxii. 18, 19, If any man add,' &c., and if any man
   take away,' &c., which doth not only seal up the book of the
   Revelation, but the whole canon and rule of faith; which indeed was a
   great mercy to the world: the Lord knew to what a liberty we inclined
   in divine things, and therefore we needed to be tied up to a rule,
   which here is given us.

   3. The mercy of God appeareth in preserving it, that it may be
   delivered from one age to another. No doctrine so ancient as the
   doctrine of the scriptures; it describeth the whole history of the
   world from the very creation, and the original of all things. Where are
   there records so ancient? and yet they have been preserved even to our
   time. We have some ancient writings of the heathens, though nothing so
   ancient as scripture; but these are not contrary to men's lusts, and
   have been cherished by them, and yet they have felt the tooth of time,
   and are in a great measure mangled; but the word of God hath been
   maligned and opposed, and yet it continueth, and holdeth up its head in
   the world: not only the main doctrine of the scriptures hath been
   continued, but no part of the word hath been falsified, corrupted,
   destroyed: the world wanted not malice nor opportunity; the powers of
   the world have been against it, and corrupt persons in the church have
   been always given to other-gospelling, Gal. i. 6, 7; 1 Tim. vi. 3; but
   still the scriptures have been wonderfully preserved, as the three
   children in the furnace, not a hair singed, not a jot and tittle of
   truth perished.

   4. That God doth continually stir up men in the church, and be stow
   gifts upon them, for the opening and application of this faith and
   doctrine of salvation. Christ, that hath given prophets and apostles to
   the church to write scripture, hath also given pastors and teachers to
   open and apply scripture, that so still it might be delivered to the
   saints, and also to vindicate the doctrine of it when opposed. Every
   age that hath yielded the poison hath also yielded the antidote, that
   the world might not be without a witness. If there hath been an Arius,
   there hath been an Athanasius; if a Pelagius, there is also an Austin:
   the church hath never wanted help in this kind. Look, as in war, as the
   arts of battery and methods of destruction do increase, so also doth
   skill in fortification; and in the church God still bestoweth gifts for
   the further explication of truth.

   5. That the light cometh to us, and shineth in this land. The gospel is
   a great national privilege: To you is this word of salvation sent,'
   Acts xiii. 26. Pray mark, it is sent; he doth not say we have brought
   it to you, but it is sent; it is a token sent from heaven in love.
   There is a mighty providence accompanieth the gospel; the journeys of
   the apostles, as I said but now, were ordered by the Spirit as well as
   their doctrine: Acts viii. 26, The angel of the Lord said to Philip,
   Arise, and go towards the south, towards the way that goeth. down to
   Jerusalem.' They went not as their own good affection carried them, but
   according to the Spirit's direction. So Acts xvi. 7-9, The Spirit
   suffered them not,' &c., as prophecy came not by the will of man,' 2
   Peter i. 21; that is, the doctrine itself, so the delivery of it; the
   doctrine they had from the Holy Ghost, and also their commission and
   passport. You would stand wondering, and think it a special benefit, if
   in a time of drought the rain should fall on your field, and none else,
   if, as Gideon's fleece, your heritage should be wet, and all is dry
   round about you; or if the sun should be shut up to others, and shine
   only in your horizon, as it did in Goshen. This is a better blessing,
   and God hath a special hand in the progress of it; it goeth from place
   to place as the Lord will. Why should it come to us? our ancestors were
   of all nations most barbarous and portentous for their idolatries. [76]
   Why to us? No cause can be assigned but the free grace and gift of God.

   6. That it is given to us in our persons in particular in the power and
   efficacy of it. It is offered to the nation, but bestowed upon us: John
   xiv. 22, How is it that thou wilt reveal thyself to us, and not unto
   the world?' Others have only truth presented to them obiter, by the by,
   for your sakes; but you are called according to purpose.' Rom. viii.
   28. Though in the general means they have a like favour with you, yet
   you may observe the particular aim of God in continuing the gospel to
   England for your sakes.

   Use. Well, then, acknowledge God in the truths that are delivered to
   you out of the scriptures. Whatever means are used, God is the author
   of the doctrine, and the disposer of the message: receive it as the
   word of God,' and then it will profit you,' 1 Thes. ii. 13. If you had
   an oracle from heaven speaking to you on this wise, you would be more
   serious. It is as certain, yea, it is bebaioteros lo'gos, a more sure
   word,' 2 Peter i. 19, more sure than the oracle spoken of in the
   context. Regard the promises and threatenings of it with more
   reverence, as if God in person had delivered them to you. If you
   receive it as the word of God, and not of men,' what will you venture
   upon the promises of it? These are bills of exchange given you, that
   you may draw your estate into another country, that you may lay up
   treasures in heaven.' Neglect of the opportunity is a sign of unbelief.
   If one should proffer you a hundred pounds for the laying out of a
   penny, and you go away and never heed it, it is a sign you do not
   believe the offer. The recompenses of the word do far exceed all
   temporal emolument; if you do not heed them, it is a sign you do not
   believe them. So what will you forbear upon the threatenings of the
   word? If there were a law made that every time we deceive or slander
   one another, we should hold one of our hands in scalding lead for half
   an hour, men would be afraid of the offence. God hath told us that the
   wages of sin is death,' that we shall be plunged for evermore in the
   lake that burneth with fire and brimstone;' and yet it doth not deter
   us from sin, and giving offence to God. If a man were told that he were
   in danger of a cruel death every moment if he did not presently get a
   pardon, he would not sleep till it were done. Natural men are in danger
   of hell every moment by the sentence of the word, and yet how backward
   are they to make their peace with God!

   Obs. 2. The word delivered, implieth a leaving things in another's hand
   by way of trust, and so doth not only note the mercy of God, but the
   duty of the church, to whom the oracles of God are committed to be
   kept. Whence observe, that God hath delivered the doctrine and rule of
   faith to the church as a public trustee, that it may be kept and
   employed to the uses of the truth. Let us a little see what is the
   church's duty towards the truth. I answer--(1.) To publish it to the
   present age. (2.) To keep it and preserve it for ages to come. So that
   to the present age we are witnesses, to the future trustees, Isa.
   xliii. 10.

   1. To publish, own, and defend the truth, by profession and martyrdom;
   and therefore the church is called the pillar and ground of truth,' 1
   Tim. iii. 15, namely, in respect of men, and as it holdeth it forth to
   the world; and therefore we ought to hearken to the church's testimony
   till we have better evidence. We do not ultimately resolve our faith
   into the church's authority, for the church's authority is not
   absolute, but ministerial; as a royal edict doth not receive credit by
   the officer and crier, he only declareth it and publisheth it; yet the
   church's testimony is not to be neglected, for faith cometh by
   hearing.' Rom. x. 14, and this publication of the church is a good
   preparative inducement, John iv. 42. If we would know the truth of a
   thing, till we have experience we go to those that have experience, and
   ordinarily the judgment of others whom we respect and reverence causeth
   us to have a good opinion of a thing till we make trial ourselves: in
   which respect Austin saith, I had never believed the scriptures unless
   I had been moved thereunto by the authority of the church; [77] as we
   should never have known the king's pleasure unless the messenger had
   brought us his letters. The church hath not power to make and unmake
   scripture at pleasure, but only to communicate and hold forth the
   truth; and till we have further assurance, is so far to be heard. We
   receive the faith per ecclesiam, by the ministry of the church, though
   not propter ecclesiam, for the authority of the church.

   2. The next office of the church is to preserve the truth, and transmit
   it pure to the next age. As the law was kept in the ark, so was truth
   delivered to the church to be kept: 1 Tim. i. 11, The glorious gospel
   committed to my trust.' There is a trust lieth upon us; upon the
   apostles first to publish the whole counsel of God, and then upon
   pastors and teachers in all ages to keep it afoot, and upon all
   believers and members of the church to see that after ages be not
   defrauded of this privilege. We are to take care that nothing be added,
   Deut. iv. 2, and xii. 32; there is enough to make the man of God
   perfect;' nothing diminished; none of the jewels which Christ hath left
   with his spouse must be embezzled; that it be not corrupted and
   sophisticated; for we are not only to transmit to the next age the
   scriptures, those faithful records of truth, but also the public
   explications of the church in summaries and confessions must be sound
   and orthodox, lest we entail a prejudice upon those that are yet
   unborn. Every one in his place is to see that these things be
   accomplished. So much for the tradition itself.

   Secondly, Now for the manner, once delivered; that is, once for all, as
   never to be altered and changed; and when the canon or rule of faith
   was closed up, there was nothing to be added further, as a part of the
   authentic and infallible rule, though the daily necessities of the
   church do call for a further explication. But you will say, You told us
   but now how the word was many times delivered, how then once? I
   answer--The apostle speaketh not of the successive manifestations of
   God's will to prophet after prophet till the Old Testament was
   perfected, but of that common doctrine which the apostles and
   evangelists by one consent had published to the world, and which was
   now to settle into a rule, and so to remain without change till the
   coming of the Lord. Observe, that the doctrine of salvation was but
   once delivered, to remain for ever without variation. Paul chideth them
   for being withdrawn to another gospel,' Gal. i. 6; and Peter telleth
   them, to prevent the reception of feigned oracles, that they had a
   surer word of prophecy,' 2 Peter i. 19, a safe rule to trust to; and
   Paul biddeth Timothy continue in the things which he had learned,' 2
   Tim. iii. 14, 15; and our Lord saith, Mat. xxiv., This word of the
   kingdom shall be preached to all nations.' Now the doctrine of
   salvation is but once delivered--(1.) Because all is done so fully and
   perfectly, that nothing can be added; there is enough to make us wise
   to salvation,' 2 Tim. iii. 15, and what should Christians desire more?
   There is enough to make the man of God perfect,' ver. 17, that is, to
   furnish him with all kind of knowledge for the discharge of his office;
   there needeth no more; there is enough to make us wise to preach, and
   you wise to practise; and it is certain enough that you need not spend
   your time in doubting and disputing; and it is full enough, you need
   nothing more to satisfy the desires of nature, or to repair the defects
   of nature: here is sufficient instruction to decide all controversies,
   and assoil all doubts, and to give us a sure conduct to everlasting
   glory. (2.) Because this rule can never be destroyed. The word hath
   often been in danger of being lost, but the miracle of its preservation
   is so much the greater. In Josiah's time there was but one copy of the
   law; in Diocletian's time there was an edict to burn their bibles, and
   copies were then scarce and chargeable; yet still they were kept, and
   so shall be to the end of the world, for the sacraments must continue
   till Christ come,' Mat. xxviii. 20, and 1 Cor. xi. 26; and the word
   must be preached till we all grow into a perfect body in Jesus Christ,'
   Eph. iv. 12, 13; not only de jure, but de facto, not only it must be
   so, but it shall be so. Well, then, expect not new revelations or
   discoveries of new truths beside the word, which is the immutable rule
   of salvation: Hold fast till I come.' Rev. ii. 25. Again, it checketh
   them that expect new apostles, endowed with a spirit of infallibility,
   to resolve all doubts and questions. We must give heed to the
   scriptures, till the day-star arise in our hearts,' that is, till we
   have full communion with Christ; for our reward in heaven is expressed
   by the morning star:' Rev. ii. 28, To him that overcometh I will give
   the morning star.' Again, it confuteth the Familists, that dream of
   some days of the Spirit, wherein we shall have a greater light than is
   in the scriptures; they fancy the time of the law to be the days of the
   Father, the time of the gospel to be the days of the Son, and the
   latter end of the world to be saeculum Spirilus Sancti (as the
   Weigelians phrase it), the age of the Holy Ghost; but foolishly, for
   these are the last times,' Acts ii. 17, and Heb. i. 1; and the Holy
   Ghost was never more gloriously poured out than at Christ's ascension,
   and greater things cannot be revealed to us than God in Christ
   reconciling the world,' Lastly, it is for the comfort of the saints
   that their salvation is put into a stated course, and God hath showed
   you what you must do if you would inherit eternal life.

   Thirdly, The next circumstance is the persons to whom it was delivered,
   to the saints. It may be understood of the apostles, to whom it was
   delivered to be propagated; or of the church, to whom it was delivered
   to be kept, and who, in the constant use of scripture, are called
   saints. Observe, that saints are most interested in the acknowledgment,
   propagation, and defence of truth. The Christian faith was delivered to
   saints, and by saints, and none receive it so willingly, and defend it
   so zealously, and keep it so charily and faithfully as they do. (1.)
   The men that the Spirit of God made use of as penmen were holy men,'
   specially purified and sanctified for this work: 2 Peter i. 21, Holy
   men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost;' and Eph. iii.
   5, Revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.' These
   men were the fittest instruments to beget an external repute to the
   word. Surely they would not do anything for their own ends, and obtrude
   their own inventions upon the world as oracles from God. A carnal man's
   testimony is liable to suspicion. Who would count that wholesome that
   cometh from a leprous hand? Yea, those that were not of eminent
   sanctity were not fit for such an employment: a novel doctrine, such as
   the gospel seemed to be in the world, needed all the advantages that
   might be, to gain a title and interest in their belief; therefore did
   the Lord make use of such holy and self-denying persons, who expected
   to gain nothing but ignominy, poverty, afflictions, bonds, death; these
   things did abide for them in every city. (2.) Holy persons are only fit
   to preach the faith; sancta sanctis, holy men for holy things; it is an
   holy faith, and therefore fit to be managed by holy persons, that their
   hearts may carry a proportion with their work: Isa. lii. 11, Be ye
   clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.' The officers that carried the
   vessels and utensils of the temple out of Babylon were to take care of
   their cleanness. God purified Isaiah when he sent him to reprove, Isa.
   vi. 7, and the priests under the law that ministered before the Lord
   were to wash in the great laver. Re generation is the best preparation
   for the ministry. Others disparage their testimony, and bring a
   reproach upon the gospel. People think we must say somewhat for our
   living, and so give us the hearing, but that is all. Oh! think of it,
   the credit of Christ lieth at stake; and since miracles are ceased, all
   the external confirmation that we can add to the word is by holiness of
   conversation. The Levites first cleansed themselves, and then cleansed
   the people, Neh. xii. 30. The life of a minister is much either to
   edification or destruction; they take the lesson rather from your lives
   than your mouths, and by your levity or vanity sin cometh to be
   authorised: in short, either your doctrine will make your life blush,
   or your life will make your doctrine blush, and be ashamed. [78] (3.)
   None are fit publicly to defend the truth but the holy; they speak with
   more power, as from the heart and inward experience, and are more
   zealous as being more nearly concerned. They that partake of God's
   nature will soonest espouse God's cause and quarrel, and their zeal is
   most pure. Carnal men pervert religious differences; they change the
   nature of them, turning them into a strife of words, or a contention
   for interests; matters are not managed so purely as when there is
   conscience on both sides. The saints contend best for the saints'
   faith: We can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth,' 2 Cor.
   xiii. 8. Zeal in carnal men is like fire in straw, quickly up and
   quickly down; but in the godly, it is like fire in wood, longer kept:
   Wisdom is justified of her children,' Mat. xi. 19; they are fittest to
   interpose. Again, false zeal is most passionate, without pity and
   meekness; but the flame is most pure and bright in a holy heart, which
   is subdued to the power of truth. (4.) None receive the truth so
   willingly as the saints do. Holy persons can best understand what was
   written by holy men, they pierce into it more deeply; as iron that is
   red hot runneth further into the board than a sharp tool that is cold.
   God unbosometh himself to his familiars, Ps. xxv. 14; John vii. 17.
   Holy hearts are not clouded with the mists of lusts and interests.
   Where there is purity there is brightness; mou ka'tharsis e'llampsis
   (Nazi. Orat. ut memini 40); the mind being separated from gross things,
   is fitted for the reception of spiritual mysteries. Paul saw most of
   God when he was blind to the world; the heart being taken off from the
   world, is erected to things supernatural and of a higher cognisance.
   (5.) None retain the truth more firmly than the saints do. Manna was
   kept in a golden vessel, and so is truth in a pure soul: 1 Tim. iii. 9,
   Holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience.' Holiness doth not
   blunt the wit, but sharpen; none have a worse spiritual sight than they
   that lack grace, 2 Peter i. 9. An unclean vessel soureth the liquor
   that is put into it; so doth a carnal heart pervert the faith and taint
   the judgment. Let a man once be given up to some great lust, and you
   shall soon find him to be given up to some roaring error also; and when
   once they come to make shipwreck of a good conscience,' they do not
   long hold the faith that was once given to the saints, for grace and
   truth always thrive together.

   I come now to the main observation that is to be drawn from these
   words.

   Doct. That it is the duty of Christians in times of error and
   seducement to contend earnestly for the faith once given to the saints.
   It is their duty at all times, but then especially--(1.) That we may
   not discredit ourselves and the truth. (2.) That we may not hazard
   ourselves and the truth.

   1. Let me first speak to the discredit, and there I shall show--(1.)
   That truth is honoured by a bold and resolute defence of it. We are not
   ashamed of it, though it be questioned and scorned in the world: Mat.
   xi. 19, Wisdom is justified of her children.' Neither John's doctrine
   nor Christ's doctrine would relish with the world, yet some had a
   reverent opinion of it for all that: Ps. cxix. 126, 127, They make void
   thy law, therefore I love it above pure gold.' In times of defection
   our love to God and the ways of God should be the greater; as fountain
   water is hottest in coldest weather. It was an honour to the Christian
   religion that the primitive professors were glad of an occasion to die
   for it, [79] and the more it was despised and persecuted, the more did
   they own it; falsehoods cannot endure the brunt of opposition. (2.)
   That we may not dishonour ourselves, and discredit our own profession.
   He is but an ill servant of Christ that will not serve him when the
   Lord hath need of him;' when God distinguisheth sides, and crieth out,
   Who is of my side, who?' Exod. xxxii. 26. Times of error and seducement
   are searching, trying times. Light chaff is carried about with every
   wind, but the solid grain lieth still upon the ground: The approved are
   made manifest,' 1 Cor. xi. 19. There is a time not only to show love,
   but valour: Jer. ix. 3, They are not valiant for the truth upon the
   earth.' To be valiant for truth is to defend it in time of opposition,
   and to sparkle so much the more in a holy zeal because they pervert the
   right ways of the Lord. A Christian must have a heart as well as a
   liver; not only love the truth, but contend for it, and the more
   earnestly the more it is opposed. The apostle saith that a bishop must
   hold fast the word of truth,' Titus i. 9, antecho'menon. The word
   signifieth a holding it fast against a contrary force; as when a man
   seeketh to wrest a staff out of another's hand, he holdeth it the
   faster.

   2. The next reason is, that we may not endanger and hazard ourselves
   and the truth. (1.) That we may not endanger ourselves. It is good to
   be able to defend religion when it is questioned; ignorant, secure, and
   careless spirits will certainly miscarry. Present truths and present
   errors have an aspect upon our interests; we must determine one way or
   another. Now how easily are they carried away with interests that have
   no principles, no i'diou ste'rigmou, 2 Peter iii. 17, no proper ballast
   in their own spirits! Therefore let us strive to know the truth, to own
   the truth in a time of trial; it is needful. All errors and heresies
   are but men's natural thoughts gotten into some valuable opinion,
   because backed with the defences of wit and parts. What are all the
   learned disputes against the truth, but the props of those vulgar
   misprisions and gross conceits that are in the heart of every natural
   and ignorant man? We have all a heretic in our bosoms, and are by
   nature prepared to drink in all kinds of errors and lies, and therefore
   we are said, Ps. lviii. 3, to speak lies from the womb,' because these
   things are in our natures. We are born Pelagians, and Libertines, and
   Papists. [80] As in the new nature there is a cognation and proportion
   between us and truth, so in the old nature there is an inclination to
   all manner of errors. Luther saith, Every man is born with a pope in
   his belly. And Mr Greenham hath a saying, that if all errors, and the
   memorials of them, were annihilated by the absolute power of God, so
   that there should not the least remembrance of them remain, yet there
   is enough in the heart of one man to revive them again the next day.
   Certainly whatever is suggested from without doth very well suit with
   the carnal thoughts that are in our own bosoms. Look upon any error or
   blasphemy that is broached in the world, and you will find it true. Is
   atheism vented? The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God,' Ps.
   xiv. 1. Gentilism, or the doctrine of many gods? So do we set up many
   gods; whatever we fear or love, that we worship: Whose god is the
   belly,' Phil. iii. 19. Every man naturally is a pagan and idolater.
   Pelagian tenets, wherein original sin is denied, are natural. Common
   people think they had ever a good heart towards God: All these have I
   kept from my youth,' Mat. xix. 20. Chance and fortune, in a
   contradiction to God's decrees, are a man's natural opinions. So the
   doctrine of works and merit is in every man's heart. What question more
   rife, when we begin to be serious, than What shall I do?' A ceremonious
   ritual religion is very pleasing to carnal sense; conjectural
   persuasions is but a more handsome word for the thoughts of ignorant
   persons; they say they cannot be assured, but they hope well. Doctrines
   of liberty are very suitable also to corrupt nature: Cast away the
   cords,' Ps. ii.; and Who is lord over us?' Ps. xii. 4. Nay, all sins
   are rooted in some error of judgment, and therefore they are called
   errors,' Ps. xix. 12. Well, then, for our own caution we had need stand
   for the truth, because error is so suitable to our thoughts; now when
   it spreadeth further, it is suitable also to our interests, and then we
   are in great danger of being overset. (2.) That we may not hazard the
   truth. When errors go away without control, it is a mighty prejudice
   both to the present and the next age: The dwellers upon earth' rejoiced
   when God's witnesses were under hatches, and there was none to contest
   with them, Rev. xi. 10. Fools must be answered, or else they will grow
   wise in their own conceit,' Prov. xxvi. 4, 5. Error is of a spreading,
   growing nature, therefore it is not good to retreat and retire into our
   own cells from the heat and burden of the day; let us stand in the gap
   and make resistance as God giveth ability. Two motives will enforce
   this reason:--(1.) The preciousness of truth: Buy the truth and sell it
   not.' It is a commodity that should be bought at any rate, but sold by
   no means, for the world cannot bid an answerable price for it. Christ
   thought it worthy his blood to purchase the gospel; by offering up
   himself he not only procured the comfort of the gospel, but the very
   publication of the gospel; therefore we should reckon it among our
   treasures and choicest privileges, and not easily let it go, lest we
   seem to have cheap thoughts of Christ's blood. (2.) The trust that is
   reposed in us for the next age, that is an obligation to faithfulness.
   We are not only to look to ourselves, but to posterity, to that
   doctrine which is transmitted to them; one generation teacheth another.
   And as we leave them laws and other national privileges, so it would be
   sad if we should not be as careful to leave them the gospel: Our
   fathers told us what thou didst in their days,' Ps. xliv. 1. Every age
   is to consider of the next, lest we entail a prejudice upon them
   against the truth. What cometh from forefathers is usually received
   with reverence: A vain conversation received by tradition from your
   fathers,' 1 Peter i. 18. If you be not careful you may sin after you
   are dead; our errors and evil practices being continued and kept afoot
   by posterity. All the world had been lost in error and profaneness, if
   God had not stirred up in every age some faithful witnesses to keep up
   the memory of truth. There is in man a natural desire to do his
   posterity good; love is descensive. Oh! consider, how shall the
   children that are yet unborn come to the knowledge of the purity of
   religion, without some public monument or care on your part to leave
   religion undefiled? Antichrist had never prevailed so much if men had
   thought of after ages; they slept, and unwarily yielded to encroachment
   after encroachment, until religion began to degenerate into a fond
   superstition, or bundle of pompous and idle ceremonies; and now we see
   how hard it is to wean men from these things, because they have flowed
   down to them in the stream of succession, and challenge the authority
   and prescription of ancient customs. Look, as sometimes the ancestor's
   guilt is measured into the bosom of posterity, because they continued
   in their practices, Mat. xxiii. 35, That upon you may come all the
   righteous blood,' &c.; so many times the miscarriages of posterity may
   justly be imputed to us, because they shipwrecked themselves upon our
   example: The fathers ate sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set
   on edge.' Well, then, let us perform the part of faithful trustees, and
   keep the doctrine of salvation, as much as in us lieth, pure and
   unmixed.

   Use. It presseth us to this earnestness of contention and zeal for the
   truths of God. We live in a frozen age and cursed indifferency hath
   done a great deal of mischief. Christians! is error grown less
   dangerous, or the truth of religion more doubtful? Is there nothing
   certain and worth contention, or are we afraid to meddle with such as
   shroud themselves under the glorious name of saints? We will not oppose
   saints, and so let the truth' go that was given to the saints, to be
   kept by them. Oh! my brethren, Paul withstood Peter to the face when
   truth was like to suffer, Gal. ii. 11. So should we with stand them to
   the face rather than make such sad work for the next age, and leave our
   poor babes to the danger of error and seduction. What is become of our
   zeal? There is none valiant for the truth upon the earth.' Prejudices
   and interests blind men so that they can not see what they see, and are
   afraid to be zealous, lest they should be accounted bitter. We have
   been jangling about discipline, and now doctrine itself is like to
   escape us. In the name of God let us look about us. Are there not
   crafty thieves abroad that would steal away our best treasure, and in
   the midst of the scuffle cheat us and our posterity of the gospel
   itself. We have been railing at one another for lesser differences, and
   now we begin to be ashamed of it. Satan hopeth that error and blasphemy
   itself shall go scot-free. Ah! my brethren, it is time to awake out of
   sleep. Whilst we have slept the enemy hath come and sown tares. What a
   tattered religion shall we transmit to ages to come; if there be not a
   timely remedy! To help you I shall show:--

   1. What we must contend for.

   2. Who must contend, and in what manner.

   1. What we must contend for. For every truth of God, according to its
   moment and weight. The dust of gold is precious; and it is dangerous to
   be careless in the lesser truths: Whosoever shall break the least of
   the commandments, and teach men so to do,' &c., Mat. v. 19. There is
   nothing superfluous in the canon. The Spirit of God is wise, and would
   not burden us with things unnecessary. Things comparatively little may
   be great in their own sphere, especially in their season, when they are
   the truths of the present age, and now brought forth by God upon the
   stage of the world, that we may study his mind in them. Better heaven
   and earth should be blended together in confusion, saith Luther, than
   one dust of God's truth should perish. [81] If the Lord call us out to
   the defence of them, what ever cometh of it we must be faithful. A man
   may make shipwreck of a good conscience in small matters. Say not, It
   is a little one, and my soul shall live.' Hearken to Satan, and this
   will be a little one, and that shall be a little one, till we have
   littled away all the principles of faith. I tell you, the world hath
   counted those small things for which the children of God have ventured
   their all. It is your duty to take the little foxes,' Cant. ii. 15. The
   first appearances of error are many times modest. There is a chain of
   truths; the devil taketh out a link here and a link there, that all may
   fall to pieces. See 2 Thes. ii. 2, Let no man deceive you with such
   doctrine as that the day of Christ is at hand.' Why? They might say
   there is no great danger in that. Peter saith, The end of all things
   draweth nigh,' 1 Peter iv. 7. The seducers said, ene'steke, it is at
   hand;' and Peter saith, e'ngike, it draweth nigh.' Here is no great
   difference. Ay! but be not shaken in mind, saith Paul, neither by
   letter nor by word nor by spirit, as if the day of the Lord were at
   hand;' that is, take heed of such suggestions, under what pretence
   soever they are brought to you, either of revelations or collections
   from my doctrine; it is all a falsehood. Why is Paul so earnest?
   Because Satan had an aim to make them look for the sudden coming of
   Christ, which not happening accordingly, to make them fall
   a-questioning all the truths of God. [82] So Gen. iii. 3, Ye shall not
   eat nor touch lest ye die.' That was Satan's repetition. Whereas God
   had said, Gen. ii. 17, Thou shalt surely die.' No great difference, but
   Satan got a great deal of advantage by it. Therefore be not ignorant of
   Satan's devices.' The Council of Nice would not gratify Arius in a
   letter, [83] and Nestorius in a letter. [84] The lesser truths are not
   to be slighted in their time and place; they deserve an earnest
   contention. The martyrs were not foolish nor prodigal of their lives;
   they knew what they did when they durst not give place for a moment.

   All this is not spoken to justify undue rigours, such as are without
   any temper of Christian moderation, or those frivolous controversies
   about trifles, such as have no foundation in the word; as about the
   observance of Easter between the eastern and western churches, which
   difference grew so high that they excommunicated each other; or about
   celebrating the Lord's Supper with leavened or unleavened bread; or the
   fierce bickerings between Chrysostom and Epiphanius about Origen's
   books, set on by Theophilus, in pursuit of which many were slain, the
   senate house pulled down, and the great church at Constantinople set on
   fire; nor to justify mere verbal strifes about words and names,'
   forbidden by the apostle, 2 Tim. ii. 14; 1 Tim. vi. 4. Vainglorious
   men, if they can get but a different method of expression, cry, No new
   light, and so there is a great deal of noise stirred up about a
   mistake. Nor to justify the breaking of church fellowship and
   communion, and making rents in the body of Christ, because of
   difference of opinion in smaller matters, when we agree in the more
   weighty things. We are to walk together as far as we are agreed,' Phil.
   iii. 16; and externals wherein we differ, lying far from the heart of
   religion, are nothing to faith and the new creature, wherein we agree,
   Gal. v. 6, and vi. 15. The most weight should be pitched upon the
   fundamentals and essentials of religion; and when there is an agreement
   there, private differences in smaller matters should not make us break
   off from one another. False zeal is unevenly carried out to these lower
   things, both in opinion and practice; and usually young professors are
   eager upon disputes, impatient of contradiction, and lay out all their
   strength this way, to excuse their care in the more weighty matters of
   Christianity; whereas the kingdom of God doth not stand in meat and
   drink, but in peace and righteousness and joy in the Holy Ghost.' Rom.
   xiv. 17. The itch of disputing and zeal for an opinion, rather than
   religion in the main, are bad characters. Again, when men, though in
   the right, think there is no religion or holiness but within the
   compass of such an opinion, this is censorious rigour, or to be
   righteous over-much,' Eccles. vii. 17; or when a lesser dissent is
   loaded with all the odious consequences that you can fancy in your
   thoughts, though disclaimed by the party dissenting; when Eloi is
   turned into Elias, and things are perverted by a misinterpretation, as
   Christ's words were, John ii. 19, compared with Mat. xxvi.
   61;--briefly, when men upon every small occasion draw all things to
   extremity, and break out into contumely, revilings, persecution, biting
   and devouring one another, [85] it is not zeal, but fierceness and
   brutish immoderation. Therefore, all this excepted, it standeth us upon
   to be zealous even to sufferings for the lesser truths, that we may
   prevent the further encroachments of Satan, and antichrist, his eldest
   son, upon the liberties and privileges of the saints.

   But now, besides the lesser things, there are fundamentals and
   essentials in religion, which challenge the choicest of our care and
   zeal, that they may be kept entire and without violation; the ignorance
   of them is damnable, and the denial heretical: to determine what they
   are is an undertaking of great concernment to the Christian world, but
   of too high a nature for the present exercise. I shall only mention a
   few points which seem to be en pro'tois, matters concerning the
   foundation; as the creation of the world by God in six days out of
   nothing, God's providence, man's misery by sin, deliverance by Christ,
   the necessity of the new creature, the resurrection of the dead, and
   the everlasting recompenses. These are points of the greatest moment,
   though I cannot but say that others also are fundamental; [86] but
   these come to mind as being of the most practical concernment.

   2. Who must strive, and in what manner. I answer--All in their place,
   and in that way that is proper to them.

   [1.] Private Christians must have a share in this holy contention;
   their duty is partly--(1.) To search out the truth, that they may not
   fight blindfold, or by an unhappy mistake lavish out their zeal upon
   fancies which they affect, or ordinances and doctrines of men. People
   are never so furious as when they have least ground and reason for what
   they assert; yea, and error never prevaileth so much as when Christians
   are all flame and affection without judgment, and do not understand the
   reasons of that religion which they do profess. See 1 Peter iii. 15, A
   reason of the hope that is in you;' and 2 Peter iii. 17, i'dion
   ste'rigmon, their own steadfastness;' that is, such a steadfastness as
   doth arise from solid grounds in their own hearts, and not merely from
   the consent of others. (2.) To own the profession of the truth,
   whatever it cost them. I say, it is their duty to own the profession of
   the truth; for the public owning of the people it is a great let and
   restraint to tyranny, and such innovations as otherwise a carnal
   magistrate would introduce into the church by force and power. See Acts
   iv. 21, they let them go because of the people; so Mat. xiv. 5, and
   xxi. 46. And again, I say they must own it whatever it cost them, for
   zealous defences are a great honour to the truth. The disputations of
   the doctors do not commend it to the world so much as the death of the
   martyrs; and therefore, though you cannot dispute for the truth, yet
   you should die for the truth: Ye have not yet resisted unto blood,'
   &c., Heb. xii. 4. We cannot be at too much cost to preserve so precious
   a treasure to posterity. And here even women may put in a share; they
   have lives to sacrifice upon the interest of the truth, and usually
   they do not fall in vain. [87] (3.) To honour the truth by their
   conversations: there are heretical manners as well as heretical
   doctrines; and-there are many that are otherwise of an orthodox belief,
   yet make others sectaries and disciples of their vices: some live
   atheism; there are Antinomians in practice; an apostate is a practical
   Arminian. Therefore Christians are called to hold forth the word of
   life' in their conversations, Phil, ii. 16; and to make the doctrine of
   God the Saviour comely,' Titus ii. 10, by glorifying God in that course
   of life to which they are disposed. To preach and write for the truth
   doth not honour it so much as to walk in the truth,' 3 John 4; and the
   life is a better witness of the reality of religion than the tongue.
   [88] (4.) To comprise all in a few words, whatever maketh for the
   truth, either with God or men, all that must the people do: We can do
   nothing against the truth, but for the truth,' saith Paul, 2 Cor. xiii.
   8. To God you must pray, that he would send forth not only labourers,
   but champions, Mat. ix. 38; not only such as can handle the trowel, but
   the sword in the battles of the church. To men, you are to quicken
   those that have gifts to look to their duty in this kind: [89] Say to
   Archippus, Take heed to thy ministry which thou hast received in the
   Lord,' Col. iv. 17. Many may be stirred up by your exhortations, that
   otherwise would lie useless in idleness and privacy: in the battle the
   trumpeter hath his use as well as the soldier. Neither are they to be
   admonished only, but assisted; and by that means you have an interest
   in the glory of the work: 3 John 8, We ought to receive such, that we
   may be fellow-helpers to the truth;' su'nergoi, co-workers; your
   helping hand is to the action, and God will not be unmindful of it:
   yea, if you bear any part of the toil, by performing any labour of love
   to them, it shall turn to a good account in the day of the Lord.
   Hezekiah's servants did but copy out the proverbs, and it is mentioned
   to their praise, Prov. xxv. 1. All this may be done by persons of a
   private gift and station.

   [2.] There is something that the magistrate may do: He is the minister
   of God for good.' Rom. xiii. 4; not only for good civil, but spiritual;
   and therefore doth the apostle bid us pray for them, that they may be
   keepers of both the tables: 1 Tim. ii. 2, That we may lead a quiet life
   under them, in all godliness and honesty.' Heathens have asserted, that
   it belongeth to the magistrates' duty chiefly to look after matters of
   religion; [90] much more is it evident by the light of Christianity.
   The kings of the Old Testament are commended for their zeal in this
   kind; and in the times of the gospel it is prophesied that kings shall
   be the church's nursing fathers, and queens her nursing mothers,' Isa.
   xlix. 23, which they cannot be if they suffer poison to be given to
   God's little ones without any let and restraint. It is a clear truth
   that if a man give up himself to Christ, he is to give up himself to
   him in every relation; his wit, wealth, parts, authority, all to be
   laid out for the use and service of Christ: he that doth not give up
   all, giveth nothing; we are to be Christ's in every capacity. Therefore
   a magistrate as a magistrate must not only countenance religion, but
   also discountenance error, and hinder the spreading of it within his
   charge. It is by Christ that kings reign,' Prov. viii. 15, from him
   they received their power, and to him must they give an account of the
   exercise of it in the great day of recompenses; therefore they are
   bidden to be wise and to kiss the Son,' Ps. ii. 10-12, which certainly
   noteth more than a negative act or not opposing: there must be
   something positive, a zealous defence of the truth in their way, or
   else God will reckon with them. Those Gallios that are indifferent to
   Christ and antichrist cannot expect a long and happy reign. I cannot
   see how they can be true to civil interest unless they be careful for
   the suppression of error; for when false doctrines are freely vented,
   it is to be supposed they will find a general reception, for the most
   are the worst; and then, when the generality of a nation are corrupted,
   national judgments will not long be kept off, the whole body is sure to
   smart for it; for, as the Jewish proverb is, two dry sticks will set a
   green one on fire. Besides that error is masterly and bloody, and
   loveth to give law; therefore, ere it be too late, they should look to
   the civil peace, for if men be quiet, God will not, when his honour and
   truth and worship is neglected. But of this more hereafter.

   [3.] Ministers are to contend for the truth, for by their office and
   station in the church they are captains of the people in this war
   against Satan and his adherents; therefore it is required of them that
   they should be able to handle the sword and the trowel; not only to
   exhort by sound doctrine,' but to convince the gainsayers,' Titus i. 9.
   These are pi'stoi a'nthropoi, 2 Tim. ii. 2, The faithful men,' the
   feoffees in trust, to whom truth is committed; they are the salt of the
   earth, Mat. v. 13, those that must season the world with gracious
   principles; therefore they must above all others labour in the defence
   of the truth, otherwise they are compared to dumb dogs that bark not'
   when the thieves come to steal away the treasure, Isa. lvi. 10, 11. Now
   ministers must contend, partly by preaching, warning the people of the
   wolves that are abroad, Acts xx. 29; partly by disputing, Acts xv. 2,
   and xviii. 28, that by the knocking of flints light may fly out, and
   that truth may beat its enemy hand to hand in the open field; and
   partly by writing, [91] for many times disputes are carried on with so
   much tumult and popular noise, that truth is lost in the crowd;
   besides, by this means we are a help to posterity, that, together with
   the poison, the antidote may be transmitted to them.

   Ver. 4. For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of
   old ordained to this condemnation; ungodly men, turning the grace of
   our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our
   Lord Jesus Christ.

   Jude having made way into their affections by a salutation, which,
   according to the wont of the apostles, breatheth out spiritual and
   heavenly wishes for their good, he doth in the third verse exhort and
   engage them to a constant defence of the truth; and now the necessity
   or occasion of such an exhortation is declared, namely, because false
   teachers were got abroad, and had slyly taken up the general name and
   profession of Christians; therefore in faithfulness he could not choose
   but warn them of the danger.

   The whole epistle is spent in the description of heretics, their sins
   and punishments. In this verse they are described by four things:--(1.)
   By their entrance into the church, certain men crept in unawares. (2.)
   By their condition before God, who were before of old ordained to this
   condemnation. (3.) By the disposition of their spirits, ungodly men.
   (4.) By the course of their doctrines and conversations; where two
   things are charged upon them:--(1st.) Abusing the gospel, turning the
   grace of our Lord into lasciviousness. (2d.) Denying Jesus Christ in
   his nature and offices, denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   First, Let us begin with the description of their entrance into the
   church, there are certain men crept in unawares. Some say they are not
   named, as not being worthy, or rather, it not being necessary, they
   being so plainly described; and indeed it is usual with apostles, who
   rather dealt against things than persons, to suppress the name, and
   describe the error or sin. But what is the meaning of this first thing
   laid to their charge, they crept in unawares'? I answer:--

   1. It may imply their entrance into the church under a colour and show
   of profession. Wicked men may creep into the best church; God
   permitteth it not only for their own hardening, but for our trouble and
   trial. Paul complaineth of false brethren privily brought in to spy out
   their liberty,' Gal. ii. 4; and the adversaries of Jerusalem, said,
   Ezra iv. 1, Let us build with you, for we seek your God as ye do;' but
   it was with an intent to hinder the work: so Simon Magus got to be
   baptized, Acts viii., as thieves seek to be entertained in the house,
   that they may have the more opportunity to work mischief whilst the
   good-man is asleep. Learn hence to be more watchful in admissions to
   the church: no perils so great as those occasioned by false brethren.
   We think to fill the church, but we do but fill the house with thieves:
   wicked men ever prove a trouble. It is an easy matter to fill the
   church by remitting the rigour and severity of discipline; but heaven
   is never the fuller, but the emptier, for wicked men are hardened and
   confirmed in their own security; and the church never fareth the
   better, [92] it loseth in strength what it gets in breadth, as a river
   doth, and zeal is lessened the more the number is increased: yea,
   wicked men usually prove a trouble, and we come to wish afterward we
   had been more strict. It is said, Acts v. 13, 14, Of the rest durst no
   man join himself unto them, but the people magnified them, and
   believers were the more added unto the Lord, multitudes both of men and
   women.' It is spoken upon the occasion of the sudden death of Ananias
   and Sapphira; it terrified the hypocrites, but brought in more sound
   believers; for of the rest durst no man join,' that is, of such as
   Ananias and Sapphira were, believers in show, but carnal in heart; they
   saw it was not dallying with God in such matters. Just so when the
   church keep a strait hand, hypocrites dare not join, but sound
   believers will the sooner, and then the church, though it be a lesser
   body, it is more sound, healthy, and active. But what rule must we go
   by? we must go by outward and general profession. I answer--This place
   will give us some direction. As far as we can discern men, so far may
   we judge of them; for the entrance of these men is here declared to be
   clancular and surreptitious: if the church had known them, or looked to
   them so warily as it should, the mischief had been prevented.
   Bellarmine [93] himself confesseth, that the intention of the church is
   only to gather believers into a body, and if it knew the wicked and
   unbelieving, it would either not admit them, or being admitted by
   chance, it would cast them out. It is good to be strict, lest by
   promiscuous admissions we bring in such a mischief to the church as we
   cannot easily get rid of.

   2. It may note their intrusion or invasion of the office of preaching;
   presuming without a warrant, or coming into the fold not by the door,
   in the regular established way, false teachers usually running unsent;
   it is often charged upon them in the scriptures: none so prone to
   errors as those that have a defect in their calling. Christ, when he
   prayeth for a blessing on the apostles' labours, he useth that as an
   argument, John xvii. 18, I have sent them into the world.' They that
   are loath to submit their gifts to public approbation draw a just
   suspicion upon themselves. How came they to you? did they creep in? or
   were they solemnly admitted? When elements are out of their place they
   breed confusion. When men are out of their place they are not a
   blessing but a mischief to the church.

   3. The two former senses may be allowed, but I rather prefer a third;
   their creeping into the people's hearts and affections by plausible
   pretences and insinuations, instilling their errors drop by drop before
   they could be observed, and pretending themselves to be friends of
   truth and piety. I do prefer this sense, partly because he saith only
   crept in, without mentioning either church or office; but chiefly
   because this epistle is but the abridgment of the second epistle of
   Peter, as will easily appear to those that do compare them. Now, there
   it is said, 2 Peter ii. 1, They shall privily bring in damnable
   heresies, denying the Lord that bought them.' From this sense
   observe--That false teachers use to varnish over and mask the face of
   error with plausible pretences, that unawares we may take it into our
   bosoms. The apostle speaketh of their sleights and cunning craftiness,'
   Eph. iv. 14. Their sleights and pretences are many; I shall touch upon
   a few. (1.) Sometimes greater strictness: Col. ii. 18, Which things
   have a show of wisdom, and neglect of the body;' rigorous observances
   and outward mortifications, as the Papists do. (2.) Special meekness:
   Ravening wolves in sheep's clothing,' Mat. vii. 15, as if they were all
   for love and kindness. [94] Absalom stole away the people's hearts by
   this artifice, 2 Sam. xv. 2. (3.) Higher gospel strains; therefore doth
   Paul speak so much against the other gospel,' Gal. i. 3, and the other
   Jesus,' 2 Cor. xi. 4, namely, such a one as they had set up. (4.)
   Self-denial; as some false teachers at Corinth would take no
   maintenance to disgrace Paul, see 2 Cor. xi. 12, &c.; this was their
   glorying, that they would preach freely; and whereas they contributed
   to the relief of Paul, to them it needed not. (5.) Greater learning,
   and notions of a newer and more sublime strain: Oppositions of science
   falsely so called,' 1 Tim. vi. 20, Platonic speculations, un grounded
   subtleties. (6.) Greater favour and liberty to nature: They promise
   liberty, and allure through the lusts of the flesh,' 2 Peter ii. 18,
   representing the faithful ministers of Christ as envying the
   contentment of your natures, and burdening you with exactions too
   rigorous; therefore the apostle saith, I am afraid lest any through
   subtlety beguile you, as the devil did Eve,' 2 Cor. xi. 3. How was
   that? I answer--By insinuating a kind of envy in God, as if he did
   begrudge them the perfection and freedom of their natures: Gen. iii. 5,
   God knoweth that your eyes shall be opened,' &c. So they think others
   are too strict, and lay too many restraints upon your carnal desires,
   and by this means allure many loose and unstable souls. (7.) Many times
   pretending the defence of that truth which they secretly impugn; as
   Pelagius talked altogether of grace, and Faustus Rhegiensis, pretending
   to oppose the Pelagians, did but more covertly own their cause. [95]

   Uses of this point are divers. (1.) For information; it showeth us the
   reason why we cannot set down the precise beginning of errors, because
   they are privily brought in. Mystery is written in the whore's
   forehead, Rev. xvii. 5; the leak is not espied many times, though the
   ship be ready to sink. The originals of heresy are like the fountain of
   Nile, obscure and hidden; a man may lose himself in the labyrinth of
   antiquity before he can find them out. The Roman apostasy is a mystery
   of iniquity, that stole into the church disguised and by degrees, [96]
   so that the beginning of it is not so easily stated as of other
   heresies that are full grown at their first appearance. (2.) It
   informeth us of the odiousness of error; it dareth not appear in its
   own colours, nor be seen in its own face; therefore Satan, when he
   would set any error on foot, he maketh choice of the most subtle
   instruments, that they may put a varnish upon it; as when he tempted
   Eve, he made use of the serpent, the most subtle of all the beasts of
   the field,' Gen. iii. 1, whereas the Lord chooseth the plainest
   instruments, and hath commanded them to use all simplicity and godly
   sincerity,' 2 Cor. i. 12, for truth is so lovely in itself, that it
   needeth no borrowed colours. (3.) It informeth us what reason those
   that are over you in the Lord have to press you to caution; excuse
   their holy jealousy,' 2 Cor. xi. 2, all is but need. We must bark when
   we see a wolf, though in a sheep's garment; our silence and negligence
   doth but give them an advantage: Whilst the husbandman slept, the enemy
   came and sowed tares,' Mat. xiii. 25. (4.) It presseth you to skill and
   watchfulness; you had need be sound in the faith, that you may discern
   between good and evil, yea, to have your senses exercised,' Heb. v. 15.
   A soft credulity is soon abused: Prov. xiv. 15, The simple believeth
   every word.' There is no reason but knowledge should cost us pains as
   well as gracious conversation. It is a matter of great skill to be a
   thorough Christian; there is a great deal of sophistry and cunning
   about. If you follow the cry, you are in danger of engaging in a
   confederacy against God; if you stick to received customs, there may be
   error there too. If you run after every novelist on the other hand, you
   will soon be led into the bogs of error and profaneness; therefore go
   to him for direction that hath the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
   But you need not only skill, but care and watchfulness. It is not good
   to drink too freely of suspected fountains; let not your affections
   surprise your judgment; we admire the persons, the gifts, and so easily
   swallow the doctrine: Try the spirits,' 1 John iv. 1; 1 Thes. v. 21.
   When there is counterfeit gold abroad, we use the touchstone. Truth
   loseth nothing by being tried, and you lose nothing, for then your
   affections are better grounded: Prove all things.' No man is
   infallible; an implicit faith begets but a fond affection.

   Secondly, These seducers are described by their condition before God,
   who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, palai, of old,
   that is, from all eternity, for so the matter here spoken of imports;
   progegrammenoi, we translate it before ordained, but the word
   signifieth written as in a book; it is usual in scripture to compare
   God's decrees to a book; as Christ, alleging God's decree for his
   mission into the world, saith, Ps. xl. 8, In the volume of thy book it
   is written of me.' The meaning of the metaphor is to show that these
   decrees are as certain and determinate as if he had a book wherein to
   write them. Now, these are said to be written before of old,' to show,
   that though they crept in unawares as to the church, yet not as to God;
   they fell under the notice of his decrees before ever they acted in
   this evil way. It is further added, that they were ordained or written
   down in God's book, eis krima, for judgment' or condemnation;' the word
   is in different to either sense, for krima is often put for katakrima;
   thus it is to be taken here for condemnation, appeareth by that place
   of Peter, haireseis tes apoleias, damnable heresies,' 2 Peter ii. 1,
   and ver. 3, Whose damnation of a long time slumbereth not;' as he saith
   here, of old ordained to this judgment.' The meaning of the whole is,
   that they were such as were left to themselves, to bring upon
   themselves by their own sins and errors a just condemnation.

   Obs. 1. That the object of the divine decrees are not only men's ways,
   but men's persons. He doth not only say that their condemnation was
   pre-ordained, but they also were ordained of old to this condemnation.
   I observe this, because many say that God's decrees do only respect
   actions and the events; we see they respect persons also; we have no
   cause to mince matters when the scriptures speak up to the point so
   fully and roundly.

   Obs. 2. Again, from that ordained, or forewritten, observe, God hath
   his books and registers, wherein the persons, behaviours, and eternal
   estates of all men are recorded. At the day of judgment these books
   shall be opened, Rev. xx. 12. Therefore it should be our care to be
   able to read that our names are written in the book of life,' than
   which there cannot be a greater privilege, Luke x. 20. And it presseth
   caution; all that we do standeth upon record: our speeches, Mal. iii.
   16, 17; our thoughts, 1 Cor. iv. 5; our actions, Jer. xvii. 1.

   Obs. 3. Again observe, that in all those things which appertain to the
   judgment of sinners, God doth nothing rashly, but proceedeth by
   foresight and pre-ordination.

   Obs. 4. Again, no man ever perverted the truths of God but to his own
   loss. They were ordained to this judgment, that is, that by their sins
   they should come to such a ruin. We play with opinions, but do not
   consider that damnation is the end of them; the way of truth is the way
   of life, but error tendeth to death.

   These things might be observed, but I shall rather pitch upon two
   points: one particular, and restrained to the scope of the context; the
   other general, as being taken from the consideration of the expressions
   in their full latitude. The first is:--

   Obs. 5. That heresies and errors do not fall out by chance, but
   according to the certain pre-ordination and foreknowledge of God. There
   are two reasons for it:--Nothing can come to pass without his will, and
   nothing can come to pass against his will. (1.) Not without his will.
   If a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without our heavenly Father,
   Mat. x. 29, that is, cannot be taken and slain without the will of God,
   then certainly nothing can be imagined which God did not foresee, or
   which he could not have hindered. There is nothing so small but the
   Lord taketh cognisance of it; nothing so evil but he turneth it to
   good. Exempt anything from providence, and you weaken that respect
   which is due from the creatures to God. If Satan may do what he will,
   and God only be a looker-on, then the devil-worship of the heathens
   would seem more rational; it was their custom first to appease the
   angry gods, lest they should hurt them, and then to invoke the
   propitious. Upon this doctrine we might fear the devil and carnal men,
   though God be propitious; for many things are done whether he will or
   no. (2.) Not against his will; for then God should make a creature too
   hard for himself. Things may be against his revealed will, for that is
   a rule to try the creatures; but not against his secret will, for that
   would make God impotent and weak. Things that are most against his
   revealed will yet fall under the ordination of his secret will; and
   whilst men break commandments they fulfil decrees. His revealed will
   showeth what should be done, his secret will what will be done.
   Briefly, the concurrence of God in and about the errors of men may be
   conceived in these things:--(1st.) He denieth grace and light, which
   might direct and sanctify; he is debtor to no man, and may do with his
   own according to his good pleasure, Mat. xx. 15. He is not bound to
   give grace to all, and therefore it is no prejudice to his goodness to
   pass by some. (2d.) He leaveth difficulty enough in the word, that men
   who will not be satisfied may be hardened: Mark iv. 11, 12, All these
   things are spoken in parables, that seeing they might see and not
   perceive;' that is, for a punishment of their wilful blindness and
   hardness. Corrupt nature stumbles in God's plainest ways; the word is
   clear enough to them that have a mind to understand it, and yet
   difficult enough to them that have a mind to harden themselves into a
   prejudice. Non periclitor dicere (saith Tertullian), ipsas scripturas
   ita dispositas esse, ut materiam subministrarent hereticis. So the Lord
   himself saith, Jer. vi. 21, Behold I will lay stumbling-blocks before
   this people;' that is, suffer them to stumble at their own prejudices.
   (3d.) God leaveth them to follow the course of their own hearts; he
   doth not incline and compel their wills, or infuse evil to them, only
   suffereth them to follow the carnal bent and corrupt ambition of their
   own hearts: Hosea iv. 17, Let him alone;' 1 Kings xxii. 22, Go forth
   and do so;' Ps. lxxxi. 12, I gave them up to their own counsels;' he
   hindereth not their wickedness; yea, permitteth it, that so his wise
   counsels may take place. (4th.) God ordereth it for good, thereby
   bringing great advantage to his own name: Exod. ix. 16, For this cause
   have I raised thee up, to show in thee my power;' great shakings and
   tumults discover much of God to the world; the devil picketh out the
   most polished shafts in all the quiver of mankind; and yet still the
   Lord maintaineth the lot of his inheritance. Yea, God doth not only
   advance his name, and discover the glory of his providence, in
   protecting the church, notwithstanding Satan's factors, and the
   abettors of his cause and kingdom, but also causes the truths that are
   questioned to shine the more brightly, as being more strongly
   vindicated and asserted, as a torch shineth the brighter when it is
   waved with the wind. Such times put men the more upon the study and
   love of truth, doctrines not being taken up upon trust, but sound
   conviction; besides error being permitted manifests the approved,' 1
   Cor. xi. 19, as a quick smart wind separateth the solid grain from the
   chaff; and it is a means to engage our dependence upon God for
   knowledge and instruction. Christ's prophetical office would lie idle
   and useless were not the chains of consent sometimes broken, and the
   language divided, some saying one thing, some another, as the
   difference between the Jews and the Samaritans about the place of
   worship maketh the woman to go to Christ for satisfaction, John iv. 20.
   Once more, God's permission of error conduceth to the just ruin of his
   enemies: Offences must be, but woe be to that man by whom they come,'
   Mat. xviii. 6, 7. So 1 Sam. ii. 25, Eli's sons would not hearken to the
   voice of their father, because the Lord had a mind to slay them.' By
   their own voluntary sins God bringeth them to their just ruin and
   condemnation. God lets them alone to wanton and play away their own
   salvation; if they will turn seekers, familists, ranters, atheists, let
   them alone.

   Uses. The point may be applied many ways. (1.) Here is comfort to those
   that regard the affairs of Sion; all the confusion and troubles that
   are in the church are ordered by a wise God; he will bring some good
   issue out of them, some glory to his name, wherein the saints rejoice
   as much as in their own welfare; some good to the church. Observe, hast
   not thou been more confirmed in the truth? engaged to a more frequent
   recourse to Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and
   knowledge? Hast thou not seen more of God's providence displayed by
   these tumults? &c. (2.) It checketh fear; it is all in the hands of a
   good God; as God trieth you to see what you will do, so you must wait
   upon God to see what he will do: let him alone; in and by all he will
   bring forth his work in due time. (3.) It showeth their wickedness that
   take occasion to turn atheists from the multitude of errors. When the
   church is rent into so many factions, men fool it, as if there were no
   God, and the whole gospel were but an imposture and well-devised fable;
   that is the reason why Christ prayeth, John xvii. 21, Let them be
   perfect in one, that the world may know that thou hast sent me,' i.e.,
   that they might not suspect me for an impostor. Usually we find that
   thoughts of atheism are wont to haunt us upon these occasions; but
   there is little reason for it, for all these things are foreknown by
   God, foretold by God: they must be,' 1 Cor. xi. 19; Mat. xxiv. 6. And
   never is there so much of God and of the beauty of truth discovered as
   when errors abound; so that if there were not errors there would be
   more cause of suspicion; where all things run with a smooth and full
   consent, and were never questioned, then the strength and worth of them
   is not tried. But the words of the Lord are pure words, as silver tried
   in a furnace of earth, purified seven times: thou shalt keep them, O
   Lord, thou shalt preserve them from this generation,' Ps. xii. 6, 7.
   (4.) It is a ground of prayer in times of delusion: Lord, this was
   ordained by thee in wisdom, let us discern thy glory in it and by it
   more and more. The church argueth that there was not only Pilate's
   malice and Herod's malice, but God's hand and counsel,' in the
   crucifixion of Christ: Acts iv. 28, To do whatsoever thy hand and
   counsel determined be fore to be done: Lord, we know there is thy
   counsel in it, and thy counsel still tendeth to good, &c. God loveth to
   be owned in every providence, and to be entreated to fulfil his own
   decrees. (5.) It informeth us what a foolish madness it is to think
   that God seeth not the sin which we secretly commit: surely he seeth
   it, for he foresaw it before it was committed; yea, from all eternity.

   Obs. 6. So much for the first point, the next is, That from all
   eternity some were decreed by their sins to come unto judgment or
   condemnation. Because this is one of the texts which divines bring to
   prove the general doctrine of reprobation, I shall here take
   occasion--(1.) To open this doctrine; (2.) To prove it; (3.) To
   vindicate it; (4.) To apply it. In the first, you will understand the
   nature; in the second, the reasons; in the third, the righteousness; in
   the fourth, the profit, of this decree.

   1. I shall open the nature of it in several propositions. (1.) It is an
   eternal decree. God's internal acts are the same with his essence, and
   therefore before all time, as believers are elected before all worlds,'
   Eph. i. 4. So are sinners reprobated; they are both in time and order
   before ever the creature was: Rom. ix. 11, Before the children had done
   either good or evil, it was said, Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I
   hated.' Election and reprobation are not a thing of yesterday, and
   subsequent to the acts of the creature, but from all eternity. (2.)
   There is a decree and pre-ordination, not only a naked foresight of
   those that perish. Some Lutherans say that predestination is proper
   only to the elect; but as to the reprobate, there is only a prescience
   or naked foreknowledge: no pre-ordination, lest they should make God
   the author of the creatures' sin and ruin. But these men fear where no
   fear is; the scriptures show that the greatest evil that ever was did
   not only fall under the foreknowledge, but determinate counsel of God,'
   Acts ii. 23; it was not only foreknown, but unchangeably ordained and
   determined. (3.) This decree of God is founded in his own good-will and
   pleasure; for there being nothing higher and greater than God, it is a
   great error to suppose a cause of his will, either be fore it, above
   it, or without it. God's actions do all begin in himself, and his will
   is the supreme reason: Mat. xi. 26, Even so, Father; because it seemed
   good in thy sight.' Jesus Christ would give no other reason why the
   gospel was hidden from the wise and prudent, and revealed unto babes.'
   We are often disputing why, of two men that are equal in misery, the
   one should be taken, the other left; why the Lord will show mercy to
   some that are no less unworthy than others; but when we have all done,
   we must merely rest in the will and good pleasure of God: Even so,
   Father,' &c.; see Rom. ix. 18, He hath mercy on whom he will have
   mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth;' it is not from the foresight of
   our wills receiving or rejecting grace proposed, for then man's will
   would be made a superior cause to an act in God. (4.) In this matter of
   reprobation, preterition and pre-damnation must be carefully
   distinguished. Look, as in election, God hath decreed to bestow first
   grace and then glory; to to the decree of giving grace preterition is
   opposed, to the decree of giving glory, ordination unto judgment. Now
   God's preterition or passing by is merely and barely from the good
   pleasure of God. But pre-damnation presupposeth consideration of the
   creatures' sin; both these parts of the decree are clearly set down in
   the word--preterition, or passing by: Rev. xvii. 8, Whose names were
   not written in the book of life, from the foundation of the world;' so
   again Rev. xiii. 8. In other places you have pre-damnation expressed,
   as 1 Thes. v. 9, appointed unto wrath,' and here, ordained to this
   judgment,' (5.) Those who are passed by, or not written in God's book,
   never attain to saving grace; it is not given to them: Mat. xiii. 11,
   To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom, but to them it
   is not given.' Yea, it is said to be hidden from them:' Mat. xi. 25;
   they may have common gifts, or be under such a common work of the
   Spirit as leaveth them without excuse; but because the Lord hath passed
   them by, effectual grace is not given to them, without which they
   cannot believe and be saved: John x. 26, Ye believe not, because ye are
   not of my sheep;' that is, not elected of my Father. Saving grace
   runneth in the channel of election; so Acts xiii. 48, As many as were
   ordained to eternal life believed.' God's special gifts are dispensed
   according to his decrees. (6.) Men being left of God, and destitute of
   saving grace, freely and of their own accord fall into such sins as
   render them obnoxious to the just wrath and vengeance of God: Rom. xi.
   7 The election hath obtained, and the rest were hardened;' freely and
   of their own accord they turned all things to their own judgment and
   ruin: so Rev. xiii. 8, The dwellers on earth did worship the whore,
   whose names were not written in the book of life;' that is, they turned
   aside to antichristian defilements and pollutions. (7.) God's decree
   concerning such persons is immutable; it is not rescinded and
   disannulled, but is fully executed and accomplished in the damnation of
   the sinner. The Lord's counsels are all unchangeable, both as to
   election, 2 Tim. ii. 19; Heb. vi. 17, and as to reprobation; no
   reprobate can be an elect person, nor an elect person a reprobate: Job
   xii. 14, He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening;' and Job
   xxiii. 13, He is in one mind, who can turn him?' In God's books there
   is no putting in and crossing out of names; but as the number of the
   elect is definite and certain, they cannot be more, and they cannot be
   less; so also of the reprobate. (8.) This eternal, irrevocable purpose
   of God of leaving sinners to themselves, that by their sins they may
   come to judgment, is for God's glory: Rom. ix. 22, What if God, willing
   to show his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much
   long-suffering the vessels fitted to destruction?' All God's decrees,
   works, providences, tend to the further discovery of himself in the eye
   of the creatures.

   2. Let me prove that there is such a decree by scripture, for reason
   here hath no place. Take here three that are most full: the first is 1
   Thes. v. 9, God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation
   by Jesus Christ,' which plainly implieth that some are appointed unto
   wrath. The second is 1 Peter ii. 8, where the apostle speaketh of some
   that were disobedient and refused Christ, whereunto also they were
   appointed.' The third place is Prov. xvi. 4, God made all things for
   himself, and the wicked for the day of evil.' The drift of that place
   is to show that both creation and predestination were for God's glory,
   and he instanceth in that part of predestination which concerneth the
   wicked, because it is hardest to be digested and believed.

   But now for the reasons why God hath chosen some, and appointed others
   by sin to come unto judgment. I can only tell you that God's judgments
   are past finding out.' Rom. xi. 33. We must admire, we cannot search
   them to the bottom. So far as God hath revealed his will we may clearly
   judge that it is for the discovery of his justice and mercy, neither of
   which could have been discovered to the world with that advantage, had
   it not been for this double decree of God, to save some and leave
   others to their own ruin. If grace were given to all, how should the
   world know that God were free? Again, if all were pardoned, how should
   the world know that God were just? In election, God discovereth the
   freeness of his grace, Eph. i. 6. It is love that we enjoy grace,
   elective love that we enjoy it alone. In reprobation God discovereth
   his sovereignty, and by it the severity of his justice and power of his
   wrath, Rom. ix. 22. In choosing one and leaving another, there God
   discovereth his liberty, and that he doth not act out of servile
   necessity; and his severity in the eternal pains of them that perish in
   their sins.

   3. Let me vindicate this doctrine, which in the eyes of some seemeth to
   blemish the justice of God, to infringe the comfort of man, yea, to
   abolish the duty of man; therefore it needeth a little clearing. Reason
   cannot easily digest this strong meat, partly because we are apt to
   reprehend what we cannot comprehend; partly because this doctrine
   checketh carnal ease and security, which is usually fed with a general
   hope and presumption that the God that made us will save us, that he
   will not damn his creatures, but is merciful to all, &c.; now this
   awakeneth us, when we hear that grace floweth in a narrower channel;
   partly because aspiring man is loath to submit to this absolute lord
   ship and sovereignty of God, that he should dispose of his creatures
   according to his own pleasure: our ambition is to be autexou'sioi,
   lords of ourselves. Man, that would be as God, taketh it ill to be as a
   beast made to be taken and destroyed.' Upon all these prejudices man is
   loath to receive this doctrine, therefore it needeth to be cleared.

   [1.] In regard of God, that you may not pollute and stain his
   excellency with impure and prejudicial thoughts. You will say, Is God
   just, that only upon his will and pleasure ordaineth his creatures to
   condemnation? Have not the reprobate cause to complain, if he hath
   passed a decree upon which their condemnation doth infallibly follow? I
   answer--(1.) Our understandings are not the measure of God's justice,
   but his own will. Things may be just, though the reasons of them do not
   appear to us: human reason groweth giddy by peeping into the deep of
   God's decrees; our work is not to dispute, but wonder. God's freedom is
   a riddle to reason, because though we will not be bound to laws, yet we
   are willing God should be bound. God's actions must not be measured by
   any external rule; things are good because God willeth them, for his
   will is justice itself. (2.) The electing of some and passing by of
   others is not an act of justice, but dominion; for he doth not act here
   as a judge, but as a lord; it is a matter of favour, not of right and
   wrong. Condemnation of a man for sin, or punishing a man for sin, is an
   act of justice; but to have mercy, or not to have mercy, that dependeth
   merely upon God's will, otherwise it would follow that God were a
   debtor unto man. Justice supposeth debt, or something due; no wrong is
   done them in not giving grace: the elect can speak of undeserved grace,
   and the reprobate of deserved punishment. When we are not bound to do
   good, if we act according to pleasure there is no injury, as in
   invitations, preferments, and all acts of favour. We cannot endure that
   a right should be challenged. The good-man in the parable pleaded, I
   may do with mine own as it pleaseth me,' Mat. xx. 15. The Lord may
   justly challenge grace as his own, and therefore leave him to his
   pleasure in the distribution, for he is bound to none. (3.) God's not
   giving grace to the reprobate is not their sin, but their misery;
   preterition made them miserable, but not sinful: it doth not infer a
   coaction and compulsion to sin; sin followeth upon it not as an effect,
   but a consequent; as upon the absence of the sun darkness doth
   necessarily follow, and yet the sun is not the cause of darkness. In
   grace God purposeth, God worketh; in sin God ordereth the sin, and
   maketh use of it to the glory of his justice. But man sinneth freely:
   the water, while it runneth its own course, serveth the end of the lord
   of the soil, in driving mills, and bringing fish into his ponds, and
   overflowing his meadows, &c. So God causeth not sin in any, only
   permitteth it and endureth it, and serveth his righteous ends of it:
   Rom. ix. 22, He endureth with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath
   fitted for destruction.' He prepareth the vessels of mercy, as the
   apostle there expresseth, but endureth the vessels of wrath while they
   fit themselves for ruin. (4.) Sin is the cause of punishment, though
   God's will is the cause why they are passed by. They are not punished
   because not elected, but because not obedient: Wherefore doth a living
   man complain but for his sins?' Lam. iii. 39. It is here as it was in
   that case. David gave order to Solomon that Joab and Shimei should not
   die in peace,' 1 Kings ii. 6-9. Yet David's order was no cause of
   Joab's death, but his own treason, nor of Shimei's death, but his own
   flight. God never damneth the creature, or decreeth to damn it, without
   respect of sin. God's will is the cause of preterition, his justice is
   the cause of pre-damnation, for damnation is an act of punitive
   justice. God is so just that he doth not condemn any but for sin; so
   gracious, that he doth not condemn every man that doth sin. (5.) The
   formal and proper end of God in reprobation is not the eternal
   destruction of the creature, but the discovery of his own justice or
   glory, promoted or shining forth in and by that destruction. In
   election God desireth and effecteth the salvation of a sinner in a
   subordination to his own glory; but in preterition, God endureth a
   sinner with much long-suffering, till, by his own destruction, he
   bringeth to him the glory of his justice: Ezek. xxiii. 11, As I live,
   saith the Lord, I desire not the death of a sinner;' so Ezek. xviii.
   32, Have I any pleasure at all, that the wicked should die;' the
   meaning is, God doth not will these things with such a will as is
   terminated in the destruction of the creature, but only ordereth them
   in a subordination to his own glory; or, in plainer terms, God
   delighteth not in the destruction of a sinner, as it is the destruction
   of the creature, but as it is the execution of justice. In the
   execution of a malefactor there is a difference between punishment and
   destruction; his punishment is of the judge, his destruction is of
   himself; so in this case, Thy destruction is of thyself, O Israel,'
   Hosea xiii. 9.

   [2.] Concerning the second objection, whether it doth not infringe our
   comfort, and discourage men from looking after their salvation? If I am
   elected, I shall be saved, if I am not elected, I shall be damned: thus
   many men plead. They say, And how will you stir up the negligent and
   encourage the distressed, supposing that doctrine which you have laid
   down?

   I answer--(1.) This scruple is but affected, not offered, and therefore
   should be chidden, and not answered: a questioning God's secret will,
   when we know his revealed. God's secret will hath relation to his own
   actions, his revealed will to ours. We must not look to God's will in
   the depths of his counsel, but his precepts: not what God will do
   himself, but what he will have us do. God saith, Believe in Christ, and
   thou shalt be saved;' that is our rule. A physician offereth cure to
   all that will come; it were a madness to dispute away the opportunity,
   and say, I do not know whether he intendeth it to me. If men were ready
   to perish in the deep waters, and a boat should be offered to carry to
   land as many as would come in it, to be making scruples when we are
   ready to be drowned, whether this help be intended to us, yea or no,
   were a very fond thing: in such cases we would not wrangle, but
   thankfully take hold of what is offered. (2.) This doctrine can be no
   ground of despair to any, because reprobation is a sealed book; no man
   for the present can know his reprobation, nor is to believe himself to
   be a reprobate, but is called upon to use the means that he may be
   saved. He is no reprobate that falleth into sin, but he that
   persevereth in sin unto the end. Therefore it is no good conclusion, I
   am a sinner, therefore I am a reprobate; it is midnight, therefore it
   will never be day. This is a book sealed with seven seals; none but the
   Lamb can open it. (3.) The opposite opinion is encumbered with more
   difficulties and scruples. What comfort can a man have in universal
   redemption? A man can not have solid comfort in that which is common to
   good and bad, to those that shall be damned, and those which shall be
   saved; all comfort ariseth from a practical syllogism. Now make the
   practical syllogism according to the principles of universal grace:
   Christ died for all men; I am a man, therefore for me; where humanity,
   or being a man, is made the ground of claim and interest; and then,
   unless with Puccius and Huberus, we hold universal salvation, as well
   as universal redemption, the argument will yield no comfort. How can I,
   according to that opinion, comfort myself in the death of Christ, when
   men may be damned that have an interest in it? (4.) As to the other
   part of this objection, concerning the profit of this doctrine, and
   whether it doth not take off men from industry: so some have thought.
   But I answer--No; for (1st.) God hath enjoined the end and the means
   together: Except ye [97] abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved,' saith
   Paul to them that sailed with him: a decree was passed for their
   safety, that not a man of them should perish; yet they must abide in
   the ship. God doth infallibly stir up the elect to the use of means, as
   well as bring to such an end. (2d.) The right use of the doctrine of
   reprobation is to put us upon examination or diligence; upon
   examination whether we believe in Christ, or have truly repented, that
   we may make our calling and election sure,' 2 Peter i. 10, for by this
   means is the sealed fountain broken open. Or upon diligence; in case
   you find no fruits of elective love, pray, read, hear, meditate, wait,
   work out your salvation, &c. (3d.) The doctrine of election is of great
   use in the spiritual life; without it we cannot understand the freeness
   of God's love, which is the great means to quicken us to praise God,
   and to beget love to God again; for as fire kindleth fire, so doth love
   beget love. It is God's glory to be served out of love and free
   consent; the devil ruleth his slaves by a servile awe. Well, then, if
   love set love awork, and the best sight of God's love be in God's
   decree, let them say, if they dare, that the doctrine of God's decree
   is an unprofitable doctrine. Again, nothing taketh off carnal
   confidence and glorying in ourselves more than God's choice, according
   to his own pleasure; nothing is a greater support in afflictions,
   especially in distresses of conscience. In short, nothing is such a
   firm bond of love between believers as the consideration that they are
   all predestinated from all eternity to the everlasting enjoyment of the
   same inheritance; those obligations which last only for this world
   cannot be so firm a tie.

   [3.] The next objection is, How can God call upon them to believe whom
   he hath passed by in the counsels of his will, and intendeth never to
   give them grace, without which they cannot believe? I answer--God may
   require men to believe, though he never intended to give them faith;
   for there is a great deal of difference between his decree and his law:
   his law showeth what must be, his decree what shall be. God never said
   all shall believe, but he hath said the contrary, 2 Thes. iii. 2; but
   all must believe; that he hath said again and again. The gospel doth
   not signify this or that man shall be saved; but whosoever believeth
   shall be saved.' As truly as it can be said to John or Thomas, or any
   elect person, If you do not believe you shall be damned, so surely may
   it be said to a reprobate, to Judas, or any other, If you believe you
   shall be saved. If the reprobate have a like favour with the elect in
   the general offer of grace, they are left without excuse, the tender
   being so great, and so far the same unto both; though the elect's
   receiving be the effect of special grace, yet the reprobate's rejecting
   is without excuse, he voluntarily turning back upon his own mercies.

   So much briefly for the vindication of this doctrine.

   4. Let me now apply it.

   [1.] Let the elect so much the more admire God's love to them, because
   that some are passed by; your mercies are not every one's mercies.
   God's aim herein was to commend his mercy to the vessels of mercy.'
   Rom. ix. 23. If he had passed us by, we could not have blamed his love;
   if he had punished us eternally, we could not have blamed his justice.
   Consider God hath as much interest in them as in you: All souls are
   mine, saith the Lord,' Ezek. xviii. 4; he was their creator as well as
   yours, and we are all in our blood, involved in the same condemnation;'
   he saw as much of original sin in you as in them; we lay in the same
   polluted mass. Oh! that free grace should make such a difference. He
   had as much reason to choose Judas and Simon Magus as you: Was not Esau
   Jacob's brother?' Mal. i. 2, in all points alike, but only in God's
   choice. When men choose it is for worth. Who would choose crooked
   timber to make vessels of honour? Yet thus doth the Lord single out the
   worst and most depraved natures, to form them into a people for
   himself. How sensibly many times did God make a distinction between you
   and others in the same ordinance: One is taken and another left,' and
   one is taken to grace, and another left to perish in His own ways;
   others, it may be, were hardened by the same sermon by which you were
   converted. Oh! how ravishing is the sight of God's love in election,
   and the distinct courses of his providence.

   [2.] To press us to diligence to make our election sure, that we may be
   out of the fear of being in the number of reprobates. The great
   question that concerneth the comfort of thy soul is whether thou be
   ordained to eternal life or no? Now, if thou beest negligent and
   careless, and refusest to use the means of salvation, the case is
   decided, though little to thy comfort: Thou judgest thyself to be un
   worthy of eternal life,' Acts xiii. 46. A lazy, carnal, careless man
   doth but provide matter of despair for himself. There are some steps to
   the accomplishment of the decree of reprobation; as sottish obstinacy
   against the counsels of the word, a being given up to the spirit of
   error, a constant neglect of means, a hardening of ourselves in the
   abuse of grace, &c.; all these are black marks. A man may recover, but
   your soul is nigh to death; therefore beware lest thou be found one of
   them who by sin are ordained to come to judgment. Eli's sons hearkened
   not to the counsel of their father, because the Lord had a mind to slay
   them.

   Thirdly, We are now come to that part of the description, ungodly men,
   asebeis. The word signifieth without worship, and is sometimes applied
   to heathens and men that live without the knowledge and worship of the
   true God; at other times to wicked men, that acknowledge the true God,
   but walk unsuitably to their knowledge and profession. That we may find
   out who are these men, let us see what is ungodliness, a sin much
   spoken of, but little known. The word, as I said, signifieth without
   worship. Worship is the chiefest and most solemn respect of the
   creature to God, and therefore it is put for the whole subjection and
   obedience that we owe to him, and when any part of that service,
   respect, or honour is denied or withheld, we are guilty of ungodliness.

   That pagans and men out of the church are signified by the term
   ungodly, appeareth by 1 Peter iv. 18, If judgment begin at the house of
   God, where shall the wicked and ungodly appear?' where the ungodly are
   plainly opposed to the house of God. Again, the unjustified estate is
   expressed by ungodliness; as the apostle, when he speaketh of the
   justifying of Abraham and David, he gave the Lord this title, Rom. iv.
   5, God that justifieth the ungodly;' and so Christ is said to die for
   the ungodly.' Rom. v. 6. The reason of which expression is, because the
   people of the Jews were divided into three ranks or sorts: there were
   of oi' asebeis, the ungodly; of oi' di'kaioi, the just; and oi'
   a'gathoi, the good; or, to keep their own terms, there were reshagnim,
   the wicked or violent; and tsidikim, the just; and chasidim the good,
   or the bountiful. Now, saith the apostle, scarcely for a righteous man
   would one die;' that is, for a man of a rigid innocency; but for the
   good man,' that is, the bountiful, the useful, a man would even dare to
   die;' but Christ died for us when we were reshagnim, sinners, enemies,
   &c. Again, more especially, ungodliness implieth the transgression of
   the first table; as Rom. i. 18, where all sin is distinguished into
   ase'beian, ungodliness, and adiki'an, unrighteousness, ungodliness in
   respect of duty to God, and unrighteousness in respect of the duty to
   men; and also where sin is distinguished into ungodliness and worldly
   lusts,' Titus ii. 12. So that it chiefly signifieth that part of sin
   whereby we rob God of his honour, respect, and service, established by
   the first table, and it may be described to be a not giving God his
   right or due honour.

   To clear it further, let me tell you that there are four notions, which
   are the ground of all religion. (1.) That God is, and is one. (2.) That
   God is. none of those things that are seen, but something more
   excellent. (3.) That God hath a care of human affairs, and judgeth with
   equity. (4.) That the same God is maker of all things without himself.
   And to these four notions or principles are suited the four precepts of
   the first table. In the first we have God's unity; in the second, God's
   invisible nature, and therefore images are forbidden upon that ground,
   Deut. iv. 12; in the third, the knowledge of human affairs, even of
   men's thoughts, and that is the foundation of an oath; for the third
   commandment doth principally forbid perjury, and in an oath God is
   invoked as a witness, chiefly of the heart, in which his omnisciency is
   acknowledged, and appealed to as a judge and avenger, in which his
   justice and power is acknowledged. The next principle, that God is
   creator and governor of all things, is established by the fourth
   commandment; for the Sabbath at first was instituted for that purpose,
   to keep up the memorial of the creation in the world. Now, out of these
   speculative notions practical flow of their own accord, &c., that God
   is alone to be worshipped, obeyed, honoured, trusted; and as far as we
   set up other confidences, or are ignorant of his excellency, or deny
   God his worship and service, or serve him after an unworthy manner,
   superstitiously, carelessly, hypocritically, or have gross opinions of
   his essence, or exclude the dominion of his providence, or cease to
   invocate his name, so far we are guilty of ungodliness.

   More distinctly and closely yet, let me note that God is to be
   acknowledged as--(1.) The first cause; (2.) The chiefest good; (3.) As
   the supreme truth and authority; (4.) As the last end. God is to be
   honoured as the first cause, that giveth being to all things, and hath
   his being from none; and so if we do not trust in him, or can trust any
   creature rather than God, our estates rather than God, or do not
   observe him in his providence, the effects of his mercy, justice, and
   power, or do not acknowledge his dominion in all events, and sanctify
   the things which we use by asking his leave and blessing in prayer, we
   are guilty of ungodliness. Again, God is to be acknowledged as the
   chiefest good; and therefore, if we do not know him, often think of
   him, delight in communion with him, fear to offend him, care to please
   him, this neglect and contempt of God is ungodliness. Again, God is to
   be acknowledged as the supreme truth and authority; and therefore, if
   we are not moved with his promises, threats, counsels, as the Gentiles
   were moved with the oracles of their gods, as God's people of old, when
   that dispensation was in use, with a voice from heaven, and do not
   submit to him, reverence him in worship, subject our hearts and lives
   to his laws, it is ungodliness. Once more, God is the last end; and
   therefore, if in all acts, spiritual, moral, natural, even those of the
   lightest consequence, we do not aim at God's glory, still it is
   ungodliness.

   In this method I shall endeavour to open this argument. And first, Let
   us consider God as the first cause, and under that consideration:--

   1. Ignorance is a branch of ungodliness. I name it first, because it is
   the cause of all disorder in worship or conversation. [98] The apostle
   saith, 3 John 11, He that doth evil hath not seen God,' Right thoughts
   of God are the fuel which maintaineth the fire of religion, which
   otherwise would soon decay and be extinguished. Now generally people
   are ignorant of God; they know him as men born blind do fire; they can
   tell there is such a thing as fire, because it warmeth them, but what
   it is they cannot tell. So the whole world and conscience proclaimeth
   there is a God. The blindest man may see that, but they know little or
   nothing of his essence, as he hath revealed himself in his word. The
   Athenians had an altar, and the inscription was To the unknown God; and
   so do most Christians go on in a track of customary worship, and so
   worship an idol rather than God. So Christ telleth the Samaritans, John
   iv. 22, Ye worship ye know not what.' It is usual with men in a dark
   and blind superstition to conform to the worship of their place, not
   considering why, or whom it is they worship. Gross ignorance is a sign
   of no grace, for God hath no child so little but he knoweth his father:
   Jer. xxxi. 34, They shall all know me, from the least to the greatest.'
   Some have better education than others, greater helps and advantages of
   parts and instruction, but they all have a necessary knowledge of God.
   Again, gross ignorance is a pledge of future judgment: 2 Thes. i. 7,
   God will come in flaming fire, to render vengeance on them that know
   not God, and obey not the gospel.' Many poor ignorant creatures are
   harmless, they do no wrong. Oh! but they know not God, and that is
   wrong enough; God will avenge it. To be ignorant of God that made them,
   is a matter of sadder consequence than you are aware. By those that
   know not God in this place is meant pagans, for it is contradistinct to
   those that obey not the gospel. But if there be vengeance for pagans,
   who have no other apostles sent to them but those natural apostles of
   sun, moon, and stars, and have no other books wherein to study God but
   showers of rain and fruitful seasons, if there be vengeance for them
   because they did not see and own a first cause, what is there for those
   that shut their eyes against the light of the gospel? Surely to be
   ignorant now is a greater sin than we think of.

   2. When we do not depend upon him it is ungodliness. Trust and
   dependence is the ground of all commerce between us and God, and the
   greatest homage and respect which we yield to the Creator and first
   cause. Now when men trust any creature rather than God, their estates
   rather than God, they rob him of his peculiar honour. That there is
   such a sin appeareth by that, Job xxxi. 24;' if I had made gold my
   hope, or said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence. If I rejoiced
   because my wealth is great, and my hand had gotten much,' &c. Job, to
   vindicate himself from hypocrisy, reckoneth up the usual sins of
   hypocrites; amongst the rest this is one, to make gold our confidence.
   Men are apt to think it the staff of their lives, and the stay of their
   posterity, and so their trust being intercepted, their hearts are
   diverted from God. It is a usual sin, though little thought of. The
   great danger of riches is by trusting in them, Mark x. 23, 24. When men
   are intrenched within an estate, they think they are safe, secured
   against whatever shall happen, and so God is laid aside. Let a man be
   intrenched within a promise, and yet he is full of fears and doubts;
   but wealth breedeth security, therefore covetousness' is called
   idolatry,' Col. iii. 5, and the covetous man an idolater, Eph. v. 5,
   not so much because of his love of money as his trust in money. The
   glutton loveth his belly, and the gratifications of the appetite, Phil.
   iii. 19, yet he doth not trust in his belly cheer he thinketh not to be
   protected by it; and, therefore, though he rob God of his love, yet he
   doth not, as the covetous, rob God of his trust: we are all apt to make
   such an idol of the creature. Poor men, if they had wealth, this were
   enough to make them happy, and therefore they trust in those which have
   it, which is idolatry upon idolatry. Whence it is said, Ps. lxii. 9,
   Men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree a lie.' To
   appearance men of low degree are nothing; but men of high degree are
   wont to be trusted in, and therefore a lie, because by a righteous
   judgment of God they disappoint our trust. But chiefly is this secret
   idolatry incident to the rich; though they do not pray to their wealth,
   or offer sacrifice, but use it as familiarly as any other thing, yet if
   it intercept their trust they are guilty of idolatry. Many that smile
   at the vanity of Gentiles, that worshipped stocks and stones, and idols
   of gold and silver, do worse themselves, though more spiritually,
   whilst they build their happiness and security upon their estates. It
   may be they do not say to their riches, Ye shall deliver me, or to
   their gold, Thou art my confidence. They do not use such gross
   language; for covetous men may speak as basely of wealth as another
   man. They may say, I know it is but refined earth, &c., but their
   hearts make it their only refuge and stay, and their inward thoughts
   are that they and their children can not be happy without it, which is
   a great sin, a setting up another God, for by this means is their heart
   withdrawn from the true God to the world, and kept from good works,
   lest they part with that which is the staff and stay of their lives.

   3. When we do not observe his providence. The blind world sets up an
   idol called chance, and doth not acknowledge God at the other end of
   causes, as swaying all things by his wisdom and power. (1.) In
   afflictions. They think they come by chance and ill-luck, 1 Sam. vi. 9,
   and Isa. xxvi. 11; as if instruments and second causes did all, and the
   Lord were an idle spectator and looker-on, and had no hand in all that
   befalleth us. Job better, The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh.' He doth
   not look only to the Chaldean, the Sabean, the thief, but the Lord. In
   all afflictions we should look beyond the creature, and not complain of
   ill fortune and chance, or stars, or constellations, or anything on
   this side God. (2.) In mercies. It is ungodliness when we do not see
   God in all our mercies. Wicked men receive blessings, and never look
   up. They live upon God every moment. They have life and breath and
   motion,' and hourly maintenance from him, and yet God is not in all
   their thoughts.' As swine raven upon the acorns, and never look up to
   the oak from whence they fall, so they look no higher than the next
   hand; but God's children may be compared to chickens, that sip and look
   upwards. The Lord complaineth of Israel, Hosea ii. 8, She did not know
   that I gave her corn and wine and oil, and silver and gold.' There
   cannot be a greater sign of an ungodly spirit than this unthankful
   profaneness. This is that which God expecteth from reasonable
   creatures, by way of homage, that we should own him as author of all
   the good which we enjoy. Other creatures live upon God, but they are
   not capable of knowing the first cause as we are. Idolatry and atheism
   had never crept into the world if men had considered who it was that
   gave them fruitful seasons and showers of rain, and filled their hearts
   with food and gladness,' Acts xiv. 16, 17. And surely nothing feedeth
   piety, and maintaineth a constant awe of God, so much as thinking of
   God every time we eat and drink and enjoy any new mercy from him. But
   alas! usually we forget God when he remembereth us most. He is never so
   much dishonoured as in eating and drinking, and in the plentiful
   enjoyment of outward comforts.

   4. Another part of ungodliness is when we do not acknowledge his
   dominion over all events, sanctifying the things we use and under take
   by asking his leave and blessing. It is robbery, to use goods without
   the owner's leave, so to use any creature, food, or physic without
   sanctifying it by the word and prayer,' 1 Tim. iv. 3-5; that is,
   knowing our liberty and right from the word of promise, and asking
   God's leave and blessing in prayer; or to go about any business or
   journey, or fixing our abode without inquiring at the oracle; all this
   is ungodliness. It is our duty still to consult with God: Ye ought to
   say, If the Lord will,' &c., James iv. 15. It is a piece of religious
   manners. We forget to bid ourselves good speed when we do not
   acknowledge the dominion of God in all these cases: Prov. iii. 6, In
   all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.' God's
   children dare not resolve upon any course till they have first
   consulted with God.

   Secondly, God will be acknowledged as the chiefest good, and so we are
   guilty of ungodliness:--

   1. If we do not often think of him. If we did not want hearts, we
   cannot want objects to put us in mind of God. ou makra`n, he is not far
   from every one of us,' Acts xvii. 27. But though God be not far from
   us, yet we are far from God. He that is everywhere is seldom found in
   our hearts. We are not so near to ourselves as God is near to us. Who
   can keep his breath in his body for a minute if God were not there? He
   is within us and round about us in the effects of his power and
   goodness, but we are at too great a distance from him in our mind and
   affections. How many trifles occupy our minds! But the Lord can seldom
   find any room there: God is not in all their thoughts,' Ps. x. 4. Yea,
   when thoughts of God rush into our minds, they are like unwelcome
   guests--we wish to be rid of them. Wicked men abhor their own thoughts
   of God, because the more they think of God the more they tremble, as
   the devils do. Therefore the apostle saith, They like not to retain God
   in their knowledge.' Rom. i. This is far from the temper of God's
   children. David saith, Ps. civ. 34, My meditation of him shall be
   sweet.' It is the spiritual feast and entertainment of a gracious soul
   to think of God. None deserveth our thoughts more than he, and we
   cannot put them to better use. He thought of us before the world was,
   and still great is the multitude of his thoughts to us-ward.' Therefore
   it is vile ingratitude not to think of him again. When we hate a person
   we cannot endure to look upon him, and the hatred of the mind is showed
   by the aversation and turning away of the thoughts.

   2. If we do not delight in communion with him, we do not honour him as
   the chiefest good. Friends love to be often in one another's company,
   and certainly it is good to draw nigh to God,' to preserve an
   acquaintance between him and us. He hath appointed his ordinances, the
   word and prayer, which are as it were a dialogue and interchangeable
   discourse between God and the creature. In the word he speaketh to us,
   and in prayer we speak unto him. He conveyeth his mind in the word, and
   we ask his grace in prayer. In prayer we make the request, and in the
   word we have God's answer. Well, then, when men neglect public or
   private prayer, or opportunities of hearing, they are guilty of
   ungodliness. So far they break off communion with God, especially if
   they neglect prayer, which is a duty to be done at all times--a sweet
   diversion which the soul enjoyeth with God in private, a duty which
   answereth to the daily sacrifice. Therefore the neglect of prayer is
   made to be a branch of atheism, Ps. xiv. 3, 4. When men are loath to
   come into God's presence, out of a love to ease and carnal pleasures,
   and care not if God and they grow strange, or seldom hear from one
   another, it is a great evil. Our comfort and peace dependeth much upon
   frequent access to God. So when family worship, when that is neglected,
   God is not honoured as the chiefest good: the heathens are described to
   be the families that call not on God's name,' Jer. x. 25. In many
   places from one end of the week to the other there is no prayer and
   worship in the family, and so the house, which should be a church, is
   made a stye. Not a swine about their houses but is attended morning and
   evening, and yet they can find no time for the solemn invocation of the
   name of God. What. are they better than heathens?

   3. If we do not fear to offend him. God will be served with every
   affection. Love is of use in the spiritual life, and so is fear: 2 Cor.
   vii. 1, Perfecting holiness in the fear of God,' Love sweeteneth
   duties, and fear maketh us watchful against sin: love is the doing
   grace, Gal. v. 6, and fear is the conserving grace, Jer. xxxii. 40. We
   have cause to walk in God's ways, because we are always under his eye.
   Love is necessary, that we may keep God always in our hearts; and fear,
   that we may keep him always in our eye: both of them are of great use;
   but fear we now speak of, which is the true internal root of all
   obedience and worship, Eccles. xii. 13. When there is such a settled
   disposition of heart as that we dare not grieve him nor affront him to
   his face--as Ahasuerus said, Will he force the queen before my
   face?'--God is much honoured. But now when we are secure and careless,
   and forget God, and can sin freely in thought and foully in act without
   remorse, it is ungodliness. Fear is a grace of continual use: we cannot
   be always praising God, worshipping God, and employed in acts of
   special communion with him, yet we must be always fearing God: Be thou
   in the fear of God all the day long,' Prov. xxiii. 17; and elsewhere,
   Blessed is he that feareth always,' Prov. xxviii. 14. A man hath done
   with his devotion in the morning, but he hath not done with God; we
   should think of him, and remember that his eye is upon us, all the day
   long: we must rise in the fear of God, walk in the fear of God, trade,
   eat, drink in the fear of God, Jude 12. Some graces are as the lungs,
   never out of use and exercise. More especially must fear be active when
   temptations and corruptions arise; we must argue as Joseph, Gen. xxxix.
   9.

   4. If we do not care to please him. An ungodly man thinketh of nothing
   less than pleasing God; he neither careth to know his ways, nor to walk
   in them; they are willingly ignorant,' 2 Peter iii, 5. They do not
   search, that they may not practise, and so err not in mind, but heart:
   We desire not the knowledge of thy ways,' Job xxi. 14. They have not a
   mind to know that which they have not a mind to do, [99] as those that
   would sleep shut the curtains to keep out the light. A godly man is
   always approving what is the will of God, Rom. xii. 2, and Eph. v.
   10-17; he practiseth what he knoweth, and is still searching that he
   may know more, as willing always to be more useful for God. What have I
   to do more?

   Thirdly, God will be acknowledged as the supreme truth and authority,
   and then, if we are not moved with promises, threats, counsels, as with
   the the words of the great God, if we do not yield him reverence in his
   worship, and subject our hearts and lives to his laws, it is
   ungodliness.

   1. We must receive the counsels of his word with all regard and
   reverence, for that is to receive it as the word of God,' 1 Thes. ii.
   13. Heathens received the oracles of their gods, and were much moved;
   we can drowsily hear of the great things of salvation, of heaven, and
   the death of Christ, and the covenant of grace, &c., and are not moved,
   no more moved than with a fable or dream. If a man should make another
   an offer of a thousand pounds for a trifle, and he should not accept
   it. you would not say it was because he prized the trifle more--that is
   improbable, but because he did not believe the offer; so when God
   offereth heaven upon such terms as he doth, we do not honour him as the
   eternal truth, but count him a liar, 1 John v. 10, or else we would not
   neglect the offer.

   2. We must yield him reverence in his worship. God is said, Ps. lxviii.
   35, to be terrible in the holy places:' he is not only terrible in the
   high places of the field, where he executeth his dreadful judgments, or
   in the depths of the sea, where the wonders of the Lord are seen, but
   terrible in the holy places, where his ordinances are dispensed,
   because there his holiness, which is the astonishing attribute, is most
   seen and remembered. We do not come to him as the supreme Majesty when
   we do not come with awful apprehensions: God is dreadful there where he
   is most comfortable: Deut. xxviii. 58, That thou mayest fear this
   glorious and fearful name, the Lord thy God.' To have God for our God
   is the ground of all our comfort and hope, and yet it is a glorious and
   fearful name. In Mal. i. 14, the Lord urgeth two arguments why we
   should worship him with reverence; one is, I am a great king, saith the
   Lord of hosts;' the other is, My name is dreadful among the heathen;'
   implying in the first, that care less and rude addresses to him are a
   kind of a lessening his majesty; they do not come to him as a great
   king, and do as much as in them lieth go about to persuade the world
   that he is not the God that he is taken to be, so great, so terrible,
   and glorious. The next argument is taken from his respect among the
   heathens, that know him by common providence; they that have but a
   glimpse of his glory, that know least of his glory, yet know enough to
   fear him and reverence him. Therefore take heed of serving him in a
   loose and perfunctory manner; you dishonour God exceedingly else, even
   then when you come to give honour to him.

   3. There must be a willing subjection of our hearts and lives to his
   laws. It must be a subjection of the heart; God's authority is never
   more undermined than by a mere form of godliness,' 2 Tim. iii. 5. It is
   the greatest ungodliness that can be, for you rob the Lord of his
   dominion over the conscience. Hypocrisy is a practical blasphemy: I
   know the blasphemy of them,' &c., Rev. ii. 9. The life also must be
   subject to God, by a conformity to his laws. Men hate God as a
   lawgiver, they love him as a giver of blessings. It is the disposition
   of all that they would live at large, and have no God to call them to
   an account. Thoughts that strike at the being of God, and doctrines of
   liberty, are welcome to a carnal heart; it is pleasing to think if
   there were no God, to hear that there is no law; no suggestions are
   more catching. The life must be conformed to God's laws, for he will be
   honoured in our conversations, as well as have his throne set up in our
   consciences. It is the glory of a commander to be obeyed: I say to one,
   Go, and he goeth, and to another, Come, and he cometh.' God looketh for
   glory from you in this kind; he will have all the world know that his
   servants are at his beck, that he hath called you to his foot,' Isa.
   xli. 2, the righteous from the east, he called him to his foot;' that
   is, to go to and fro at his command: if he say Go, they go; if he saith
   Come, they come; these are the people framed for his praise.' He can
   bid them do nothing but they are ready to do it with the loss of all.

   Fourthly, God will be honoured as the utmost end; and so if in all
   acts, natural, moral, spiritual, we do not aim at his glory, we are
   guilty of ungodliness. In acts natural, and matters of the least
   consequence, we must have a supernatural aim: 1 Cor. x. 31, Whether ye
   eat or drink, or whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of God.' If I
   take a meal, I must have an aim at God's glory in it; in civil acts,
   and duties of mutual commerce, [100] all must be done as in and to the
   Lord, Eph. v. 22; vi. 1, 5-7. We are to walk in our relations so as God
   may have honour. In spiritual acts of prayer, praise, and worship, yea,
   the whole ordination of the spiritual life must be unto God: I live
   unto God,' Gal. ii. 20. All the motions and tendencies of the soul look
   that way. This is the difference between holiness and godliness;
   holiness more properly implieth a conformity to the law, and godliness
   an aim of the soul to exalt God; and so they are propounded as
   distinct, 2 Peter iii. 11, What manner of persons ought we to be in all
   holiness and godliness of conversation?' Well, then, look to your aims;
   and in eating and drinking you set up Moloch, it is a meat-offering and
   drink-offering to appetite, if you do not aim at God's glory. So in
   traffic; if you merely regard wealth, you are a consecrated priest to
   mammon. In these ordinary actions of eating, drinking, trading, you may
   be guilty of idolatry before you are aware, and may set up the belly,
   Phil. iii. 19, or mammon, Mat. vi. 24, in God's stead; nay, in your
   very desires of grace your ultimate aim must not be self. We are
   accepted in the beloved, to the praise of his glorious grace,' Eph. i.
   6. And in actions most sacred it is dangerous to look a-squint; it is
   to put dung in God's own cup, when we make worship a stale to our own
   ends. In short, the Lord hath given many things to the creature, that
   only which he hath reserved to himself is his glory; therefore he
   taketh it ill to be robbed of that.

   Thus I have showed you the several kinds of ungodliness. Some are more
   refined, some more gross, but all naught. The worst sort is, when we do
   contemptuously slight his providence, and disobey his laws, hardening
   ourselves yet more and more,' as Ahaz did, though the Lord had
   exercised him with sharp afflictions, and living in open irreligion and
   despite of God, casting off yoke after yoke, till at length we have
   outgrown the heart of a man, fearing neither God nor men.

   Use. Well, then, if we would not be counted ungodly, let us take heed
   of all these sins.

   1. How else will ye look God in the face at the day of judgment? The
   ungodly shall not stand in judgment,' Ps. i. 5; that is, so as to be
   able to plead their cause, and lift up the head, though they shall rise
   again and receive their sentence; therefore ill rendered by the Vulgar,
   non resurgunt; yet they shall have no boldness, but hang their guilty
   heads for shame in that day; the day of judgment is appointed on
   purpose to take vengeance of ungodly persons,' see Jude 15. It is the
   day wherein God, that is now withdrawn within the curtain of the
   heavens, cometh forth to manifest himself to the terror of all ungodly
   ones.

   2. There were great judgments inflicted upon them in this world. The
   flood swept away the world of the ungodly,' 2 Peter ii. 5, and 1 Peter
   iv. 18, Where shall the sinner and the ungodly appear?' The Lord's
   jealousy for his honour is very great, and therefore none shall smart
   so sorely as the ungodly person. It is said, Isa, lix. 17, He putteth
   on jealousy as a cloak;' the cloak is man's upper garment, which is
   most visible; there is nothing so visible in God's providence as his
   jealousy for his honour; there is no sin robs God of his honour so much
   as ungodliness; so it is said, Exod. xxxiv. 14, that jealousy is his
   name.' The name of a thing is the note of distinction by which it is
   known and differenced from all other things either of the same or
   another kind; so God's jealousy against those that rob him of his
   honour differenceth him from all the gods of the world. The gods of the
   heathens were good-fellow gods, and could endure rivals and
   co-partners; but this the Lord doth severely punish; none have fallen
   under the weight of his vengeance so much as they that deny their
   respects to him, and go on whoring after another God.'

   3. It is the great aim of the gospel to prevent ungodliness, by
   discovering more of God than was known before, and by finding out a way
   how the notions of God might be kept inviolable, and how we might come
   to the enjoyment of God, and yet God suffer no loss of honour;
   therefore the gospel is called the mystery of godliness,' 1 Tim. iii.
   16, and a doctrine according to godliness,' 1 Tim. vi. 3. Men might be
   ungodly at a cheaper rate than now they can in these days of the
   gospel: now we have more means to know God, and more obligations to
   respect God, more clear and certain notions of his excellency and
   glory.

   4. Ungodliness is the root of all irregular courses. Abraham was afraid
   of himself in Gerar. Why? The fear of God is not in this place,' Gen.
   xx. 11. Godliness is the great bulwark of laws and all honest
   discipline; subjects are not afraid of princes, nor princes of
   subjects, where the fear of God prevaileth: there can be no true
   honesty without piety. The first part of the law provideth for respects
   to God, as being the proper foundation of the second, which containeth
   respects to our neighbour. Often it cometh to pass by God's just
   judgment that spiritual wickedness is punished with civil; see Hosea
   iv. 12, 13; and where men are not tender of God's interests they do
   also encroach upon civil rights and freedoms.

   Means and directions are these:--(1.) Purge the heart from principles
   of ungodliness. There are many gross maxims ingrafted in man's heart;
   as that it is folly to be precise; that it was better when there was
   less knowledge; that it is in vain to serve God; that thoughts are
   free; if we carry it fair before men we need trouble ourselves no
   further; when men do their best, petty sins are not to be stood upon;
   that religion is but a notion and fancy, the gospel a golden dream, &c.
   That such principles are within us appeareth by the sottishness of our
   practices and course of living; for actions are the best image of our
   thoughts, and these are purged away by waiting upon the word, which
   discovereth' them, Heb. iv. 12, and layeth in good principles, Ps.
   cxix. 9, by which means they are destroyed. (2.) Suppress all ungodly
   thoughts as soon as they do arise, as that there is no God,' Ps. xiv.
   1. Shame may lay a restraint upon the tongue, but the heart is ever
   casting up such a thought as this is: so that God is not so harsh but
   we may take a little liberty in sinning, see Ps. 1. 21; or that he
   taketh no notice of what we speak or do; he cannot see through the dark
   clouds,' Job xxii. 12, 13. When any such thoughts rush into your mind,
   check them and actually rebuke them, lest they settle into a rooted
   atheism. (3.) Mortify vile affections: the judgment is tainted by the
   contagion of lusts, as a foul stomach sendeth up fumes and gross
   vapours into the head; and so the principles of godliness do quickly
   suffer an eclipse: The pure in heart see most of God,' Mat. v. 8. In
   fenny countries the air is seldom clear; so in hearts that lie under
   the power of brutish lusts, there are seldom clear and distinct
   thoughts of God. (4.) Keep close to God's institutions; these keep up
   his presence and memorial in the world, and so are the best
   preservative of godliness; false worships are full of ceremonies which
   darken the nature of God. Images beget a gross opinion of God: no
   wonder if people grow blockish that worship God in a senseless stock or
   stone. Varro in Austin observed, that those that first invented images
   did but increase error, and take away all fear of religion. God knoweth
   what is best for himself, and how by his own institutions to keep up
   the repute of his nature and essence: when man presumeth to be wiser
   than God, and leaveth the certainty of God's institutions for additions
   and innovations of Our own, that please us better, because they have
   lo'gon sophi'as, A show of wisdom,' Col. ii. 22, 23, all religion goeth
   to wrack. (5.) Let us often exercise ourselves unto godliness,' 1 Tim.
   iv. 7. Delight to give to God the honour due to him, love, delight,
   fear; to worship him often, to do all things as aiming at his glory.

   Fourthly, The next clause in the description of these seducers is that,
   turning the grace of our God into wantonness. Where you may take
   notice--(1.) Of their filthiness and brutish course of life, implied in
   the word wantonness, in the original ase'lgeia, a word proper to luxury
   and the impurities of lust; it is derived from alpha, an augmentative
   particle, and Selga, the name of a town in Pisidia, saith Suidas, whose
   inhabitants were infamous for sodomy, and weakening nature by such
   prodigious filthiness as is not fit to be named among saints; and the
   persons here noted the school of Simon. The Nicolaitans, the Gnostics,
   and other impure heretics of that age were for promiscuous commixtures,
   and the free use of their fellow creatures (as some carnal wretches in
   our own age have learned to speak), without any respect to conjugal
   relation, and those restraints which God and nature and all civil
   nations have laid upon the lusts of man, as if men should use no more
   distinction and confinement than the beasts; yea, gave up themselves to
   all manner of unnatural lust, as in the process of this epistle we
   shall more fully discover. (2.) The occasion and encouragement of this
   wantonness, which doubleth the iniquity of it, is the grace of God, by
   which is meant the gospel, which is called the grace of God,' as Titus
   ii. 11, The grace of God hath appeared unto us, teaching us,' &c.; and
   in the gospel chiefly they abused the doctrine of Christian liberty and
   free justification by Christ; this is primarily intended. You may, by
   analogy, enlarge the expression to comprise all those other doctrines
   which libertines are apt to abuse; yea, those gracious providences
   which wicked men do convert into fuel and nourishment for their sins.
   (3.) The manner how so excellent a thing as the grace of God was made
   pliable to so vile a purpose, for a man would wonder that things at so
   great and infinite a distance as the grace of God and filthy lusts
   should ever be brought to cast an aspect upon one another. That is
   showed in the word turning, in the original metatithe'ntes, wresting,
   transferring from its proper use. They offered violence to the doctrine
   of grace, that it might be conscious to such a monstrous birth and
   production as filthy lusts and carnal pleasures. (4.) You have a hint
   of the reason why the apostle writeth against them with such a zealous
   indignation in that word our; as if he said, That grace, whose
   sweetness we have tasted, whose power we have felt; of that God who
   hath been so kind to us in Christ, whose glory we are bound to promote.
   Shall we see our God, and that grace upon which all our hopes stand, to
   be abused to such an unclean use?

   From the words thus opened I observe:--

   Obs. 1. That the gospel and grace of God in itself is not pliable to
   carnal purposes, yieldeth no carnal conclusions. They turn it, saith
   the apostle; there is no such thing gotten out of the gospel without
   wresting, and till the art of a deceiver hath passed upon it. I shall
   prove the point by three arguments.

   1. From the constitution of the gospel. It yieldeth no leave to sin,
   but liberty to serve God: this is the great design of it. Christ came
   not to reconcile God and our sins together, but God and our persons; to
   reconcile our persons and destroy our sins; not to free us from the
   law, but sin; to free us from the service of the devil, 1 John iii. 8,
   not from the service of God; in short, he came not to make the law less
   strict, or sin less odious, or us less holy; for perfection of the law
   was never so clearly known as since the coming of Christ, see Mat. v.,
   and sin was never so odious as since the abundance of grace. They under
   the law sinned at a cheaper rate than we can, because they did not sin
   against so much love and kindness, see Heb. ii. 2, 3; neither could
   Christ come to make us less holy, or to dispense with our care of
   holiness, for then he should come to deface the image of God, and make
   us more unlike God, which would not be a privilege but a burden to the
   new creature. Freedom from wrath and hell is a privilege, but freedom
   from duty and obedience is no privilege. In the gospel there is pardon
   for failings, but not to encourage us in our failings, but our duties.
   We were never so much obliged to duty as since the gospel, because now
   we have more help and more advantages, stronger motives and greater
   encouragements. If we look backward, we are bound in point of gratitude
   to serve the Lord, being redeemed hereunto by the blood of Jesus; if we
   look forward, we are encouraged by the hopes of eternal life. The law
   could not persuade by such arguments as the gospel doth; there is more
   of the rule known, more of the Spirit poured out to give us help to
   observe it. So that from this short abridgment of larger discourses, it
   appeareth that the great design of the gospel is to make us more like
   God, and to free us from the slavery of the devil, that we may be
   better servants and subjects to God.

   2. There are frequent and constant dissuasives from this perverting our
   liberty in Christ to the service of any fleshly design. The Spirit of
   God foresaw how corrupt nature in us would tempt us to abuse our
   privileges to an evil purpose; yea, many had already attempted it in
   the apostles' days, as the sect of the Nicolaitans, the school of
   Simon, and, after them, the Gnostics and Basilicans, who, under colour
   of evangelical liberty, gave up themselves to lawless and brutish
   practices (as before was hinted); therefore, by way of prevention,
   dissuasives are very frequent everywhere; as Rom. vi. 1, What shall we
   say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid.'
   As if he had said, You will not want such corrupt teachers, nay, your
   hearts will be marvellous apt to frame such kind of consequences and
   conclusions; but reject them with indignation. So Gal. v. 13, You are
   called to liberty; only use not your liberty as an occasion to the
   flesh.' Christ hath done his part, purchased glorious privileges for
   you; only take you heed that you do not abuse them; your base hearts
   are apt enough. So 1 Peter ii. 16, As free, but not using your liberty
   as a cloak of maliciousness.' Freedom by Christ will be an unfit cover
   and pretence for so vile a practice.

   3. Because in the gospel itself there are quite contrary inferences and
   conclusions from those which flesh and blood would draw from the
   gospel. As to instance, in anything wherein the gospel hath been
   abused, to three ends hath it been abused--to looseness, laziness,
   licentiousness. Now, you shall see the word carrieth things in a quite
   contrary way to what carnal men do. To looseness: men have been the
   more loose and careless, because grace hath abounded in the discoveries
   of the gospel; but the apostle disdaineth it, as a most abhor rent and
   strange conclusion from gospel principles: Rom. vi. 1, Shall we
   continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid.' Me` ge'noito, do
   not cherish such a vile and unworthy thought; the gospel teacheth quite
   contrary; see Titus ii. 11, 12; not wantonness, but weanedness, 4 to
   deny ungodliness and worldly lusts.' So see Rom. vi. 16, and 2 Cor.
   vii. 1. A bee gathereth honey thence from whence a spider sucketh
   poison. Again, to laziness: men are apt to lie down upon the bed of
   ease, and say Christ must do all, and so exclude all use of means and
   the endeavour of the creature. This is a foul abuse; for the scripture
   inferreth thence the care and work of the creature, be cause God doth
   all, Phil. ii. 12, 13, Work out your salvation with fear and trembling,
   for it is God worketh in you both to will and to do.' We must the more
   humbly wait upon God in the use of ordinances, because all dependeth
   upon his assistance. Again, to licen tiousness: men have interpreted
   freedom by Christ in such a perverse sense as to cast off obedience to
   civil powers, either to masters in the family, or to magistrates in the
   commonwealth; whereas the word calleth for these duties upon this very
   ground, because we are made free by Christ, that is, more ready and apt
   to discharge the duty we owe to God and man: in this sense it is said,
   1 Cor. vii. 22, that a servant is the Lord's freeman;' and 1 Peter ii.
   16, Obey governors as free, but as servants of the Lord.' Christianity
   giveth us a greater aptness, layeth on us a greater engagement, the
   bond of conscience; so that there is, as Salvian speaketh, in maxima
   libertate minima licentia, a great deal of liberty by Christ, and yet
   the strongest engagement to service that may be.

   Let us now apply the point.

   Use 1. It serveth to inform us, in the first place, that carnal men are
   ill skilled in consequences; from the very gospel would they draw a
   liberty to sin, than which from such premises no conclusion can be more
   strange; it is well worth the observing to note the different arguings
   in scripture from the same principles, as see some instances; compare 1
   Cor. vii. 29 with 1 Cor. xv. 32: the principle in both places is, The
   time is short.' Now, the apostle in the former place draweth from it
   conclusions of strictness, temperance, and mortification: Let us use
   the world as if we used it not,' &c. But in the latter the dissolute
   epicure argueth quite otherwise, Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we
   shall die;' a quite different conclusion from the same principle. So
   here, grace aboundeth; let us be much in duty, saith the spiritual man;
   let sin abound, saith the carnal. Again, compare 2 Sam. vii. 2 with
   Hag. i. 2: I dwell within a house of cedar,' saith David, but the ark
   of God dwelleth within curtains.' Surely I should have had more care of
   the ark of God, now God hath built me such a stately palace. But they
   in Haggai, we dwell in ceiled houses,' therefore the time to build the
   Lord's house is not come;' so they might live in pomp and ease, they
   little cared how matters went with God's house. Once more, 1 Sam.' iii.
   18, It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good:' he argueth from
   thence to meekness and a submissive patience. But now compare 2 Kings
   vi. 33, This evil is from the Lord; why should I wait upon him any
   longer?' From the same principle he argueth himself into a murmuring
   and fit of impatience. Thus carnal men are always out in their
   reasonings: A parable in a fool's mouth,' saith Solomon, is like a
   thorn in the hand of a drunkard,' Prov. xxvi. 9. When the spirits are
   disturbed by excess of drink, men have not an even touch, and so when
   they would use a thorn, or any sharp thing, they wound and gore
   themselves; so do wicked men, being besotted with lusts, argue falsely
   from the grace and the holy principles of the word to their own
   destruction.

   Use 2. Again, it serveth for caution; when you meet with such base
   inferences from evangelical principles, do not blame the gospel, or the
   ministry and dispensation of the gospel.

   1. Not the gospel, as if it were not clear enough, or faithful enough,
   or wary enough. Such thoughts are wont to haunt us when we see gross
   errors creeping under a shelter and pretence of scripture: foolish men
   would give laws to heaven; we think God should speak more plainly, as
   if the Lord should make a sun for them to see that shut their eyes:
   vain man will stumble in God's plainest ways; should things be never so
   clearly carried, a perverse apprehension would make them obscure.
   Parables (which are the liveliest and most sensible representations of
   things) hardened the Pharisees, Mark iv. 11, 12. If men ruin themselves
   by their own false logic, we should not therefore accuse God. They that
   have a mind to fall shall not want a stone of stumbling; they that will
   only be feasted with comforts, no wonder if they contract a spiritual
   sickness, and undo their souls by a misunderstood and misapplied
   gospel.

   2. Do not blame the ministry and dispensation of the gospel, because
   some abuse free grace, others cannot endure to hear it preached; but
   children must not be kept from their bread because dogs catch at it.
   Because some are drunk with wine,' and others eat to excess, shall the
   hungry man want his food? Shall hungry consciences lose their portion
   for others' abuse? No, no; if carnal men serve their lusts of these
   truths, we cannot help it; we are not in the place of God: we can only
   deliver the doctrine; we cannot give them gracious hearts to improve
   it. The Papists will not let the people have the scriptures upon this
   reason, for fear of abuses; and Gardiner would not have this gap of
   free grace opened to the people, &c: The devil hath ever maligned a
   gospel dispensation. Let not us withhold the truth for fear of
   inconvenience. Let us look to our commission, preach the gospel to
   every creature;' if men abuse it, we are clear, their destruction is
   just,' as the apostle speaketh to this very case: Rom. iii. 8, Some
   slanderously report that we say, Let us do evil that good may come
   thereof, whose damnation is just.' Some gave out that Paul taught that
   they might sin freely, that God might have the more glory in
   pardoning;' their damnation is just'; if they went away with such a
   vile conceit, saith he, they learned it not from me. Musculus
   complaineth in one of his books that no place was so profane and
   irreligious as those where the gospel had been preached; and Contzen,
   [101] a Jesuit, citing this passage, crieth out; See the fruit of
   Protestantism and their gospel preaching. Many are of his spirit; do
   even hate the publication of the doctrine of grace, as if these were
   the cause of men's miscarriage. If men abuse the truth, we cannot help
   it; however, visible mistakes must be prevented, lest men go away with
   a scorpion instead of fish, and a stone instead of bread.

   Obs. 2. The next point, that though grace itself be not pliable to such
   conclusions, yet wicked men are very apt to abuse it to the
   countenancing and cherishing of their sins and lusts. You see here the
   abuse of the doctrine of the gospel was very ancient; this spirit of
   error wrought betimes; the former days were no better than these,
   Eccles. vii. 10. In the apostles' days, vile hearts did abuse good
   doctrine; men were the same then which they are now, when such kind of
   errors have a second spring and revolution. Indeed, of all errors these
   seem to be very natural; we greedily drink in the poison of carnal
   liberty. But let me give you the reasons why ungodly men take liberty
   and occasion from the grace of God to serve their sinful lusts and
   pleasures.

   1. Because carnal hearts do assimilate all that they meet with, and
   turn it into the nourishment of their carnal lusts: as the salt sea
   turneth the fresh rivers and the sweet showers of heaven into salt
   waters, so do carnal men pervert the holy principles of the gospel; or
   as sweet liquors are soon soured in an unclean vessel, so do truths
   lose their use and efficacy when laid up in a carnal heart, and are
   quite turned to another purpose.

   2. Because they would fain sin securely, et cum privilegio, with a free
   dispensation from God, and therefore seek by all means to entitle God
   to the sin, and the sin to God. They would find a great deal of ease
   from gripes of conscience if they could make God the author, or at
   least the countenancer, of their evil practices; and therefore when
   they can rub their guilt upon the gospel, and pretend a liberty by
   Christ, the design is accomplished. Augustine often taketh notice that
   the heathens took the most liberty to sin, because their gods were
   represented as approvers and countenancers of such kind of actions. If
   men could once make God an approver of sin, and giving leave to satisfy
   our desires, the design of carnal nature were at an end, and they would
   be freed of that awe of a divine power which is only left in nature as
   the check and restraint of sin; and therefore because God hath revealed
   so much of his indulgence to the fallen creature in the gospel, they
   strive to draw all the passages of it that way, as if God had given
   leave to sin freely.

   3. Because man is obedient naturally no longer than when under
   impressions of awe and fear; the cords of a man,' Hosea xi. 4, work
   little with us; like beasts, we only put forward when we feel the goad.
   Violent means do more than gentle persuasions and the sweet strains of
   grace. Usually where we are dealt with in that kind, we wax wanton and
   kick with the heels,' Deut. xxxii. 15, as an ass-colt, being suckled
   and full, kicks her dam in the forehead.

   4. Because we all naturally desire liberty, carnal liberty, to be left
   to our own sway and bent, and therefore we catch at anything that
   tendeth that way. We would be as gods, lords of our own actions, and so
   are very apt to dream of an exemption from all kind of law but our own
   lusts: the seducer's bait was a promise of liberty,' 2 Peter ii. 19. We
   would all be above check and control, and have scope and room for our
   lusts: Ps. xii. 4, Our lips are our own, who is lord over us?' We would
   fain bring it to that, to be at our own dispose, to be answerable to
   none that should call us to an account. The tumult of the nations
   against Christ was about bonds and yokes, Ps. ii. 3. The pale or the
   yoke is grievous to us, see Job xi. 12; Jer. xxxi. 18. Now being so
   resolved to be free, we are willing to hear of liberty, and apt to
   abuse whatever sounds to that purpose.

   But now let us see how many ways the grace of God may be turned into
   wantonness; a right knowledge of the evil may be a means to prevent it.

   There is a grace dispensed in the way of God's providence, which may be
   called the grace of God, and is very liable to abuse: a word of that
   before I come to the main thing here intended. Thus we find the
   patience of God often abused; when the Lord keepeth silence in heaven,
   and doth not presently thunder down vengeance on the heads of sinners,
   Ps. xxxvi. 2; Zeph. i. 12, we wallow in ease and fleshly delights, and
   dream of a perpetual happiness, and think we shall do as well as the
   precisest of them all: Eccles. viii. 11, Because vengeance is not
   executed speedily, therefore the heart is set in them to do evil.' Thus
   doth man's venomous nature suck poison out of so sweet an attribute as
   God's patience. And as God's patience is abused, so is also his
   goodness and bounty. When we are full and enjoy plenty we grow wanton,
   and either despise our mercies, Mal. i. 2, Wherein hast thou loved us?'
   or, which is worse, despise God himself, turn back upon the mercy-seat,
   grow very negligent, cold, and careless in the worship of God; nay,
   many times the mind is efferated, and grown brutish and insolent both
   towards God and man: Hosea xiii. 6, According to their pasture so were
   they filled; they were filled and their heart was exalted, they have
   forgotten me.' Men have large pastures and strong lusts, and then God
   is forgotten; there is not that care of God, that sense of duty, that
   meekness of spirit; this is growing wanton with God's goodness. Once
   more, there is another grace of providence which is apt to be abused,
   and that is the vouchsafement of ordinances, or the means of grace, in
   great plenty; a mercy prized when it first cometh among a people, but
   within a little while they grow wanton: 1 Sam. iii. 1, The word of God
   was precious in those days, for there was no open vision.' Whilst
   visions are scarce they are highly prized, but when they are open and
   public, men begin to grow giddy, cannot be contented with the
   simplicity of God's ordinances, but must be fed with ungrounded
   subtleties and quintessential extracts; when spiritual appetite groweth
   wanton it is an ill sign, when plain truths will not down, and all
   things must be carried in an airy, subtle, and notional way; God will
   have a scourge for such a wanton people.

   But let us come closer to the matter in hand. This text speaketh of
   doctrinal discoveries of grace, of the abuse of the gospel, and the
   principles thereof. Now it were a hard task to give you an account of
   all the paralogisms and corrupt inferences which men draw from the
   gospel; there is no doctrine but, one way or another, a carnal heart is
   apt to abuse it. The most usual abuses are these:--

   1. The doctrine of election is abused; men say they may live as they
   list; if God hath elected them they shall be saved, and so allow
   themselves in their careless neglect of the means of salvation. Be not
   deceived; God, that decreeth the end, decreeth the means: God hath
   predestinated us to be conformed to the image of his Son.' Rom. viii.
   29; in grace here as well as in glory hereafter.

   2. The doctrine of the attributes of God's mercy and long-suffering.
   Men will say they are sinners, and so are others; but God is merciful,
   and so poor, ignorant drunkards, adulterers, and swearers, as they are,
   they die with this principle in their mouths, God is merciful. But be
   not deceived; neither fornicators nor adulterers, &c., shall enter into
   the kingdom of God,' 1 Cor. vi. 9; so Eph. v. 6, Let no man deceive you
   with vain words, for because of these things cometh the wrath of God.'
   Both these places show there were divers which had such deceitful
   thoughts, as if living and dying drunkards, adulterers, &c., they
   should go to heaven. Others abuse the long-suffering of God to their
   delaying and putting off their repentance, as if, after a long vicious
   life, provided they could be devote at the last gasp, they should at
   length be saved, and of a sudden from swine become saints. As many
   delayed their baptism heretofore, because they would have longer time
   to sin in, and to walk after their own lusts, and when they were warned
   of their licentious course, their answer was, Tunc demum a peccatis
   desistam cum baptizatus ero--when I am baptized I will live otherwise.
   Thou fool! besides the uncertainty of thy having time or grace to
   repent, this is a manifest abuse of God's patience, and will turn to
   thy greater ruin, Rom. ii. 4, 5.

   3. The doctrine of gospel grace is abused many ways. Sometimes to
   exclude the fear and reverence of God, as if fear were an antiquated
   grace, suiting only with a legal dispensation: whereas the children of
   God think the more grace the more fear: Ps. cxxx. 4, There is mercy
   with thee, therefore thou shouldst be feared;' and Hosea iii. 5, They
   shall fear the Lord and his goodness.' The goodness of God doth not
   make them presumptuous, but is the greater matter of reverence and holy
   trembling: fear is so far from being abolished in the gospel that it
   continueth in heaven, it being an essential and necessary respect from
   the creature to the creator. Again, it is abused to deny all
   humiliation and sorrow for sins, yea, all confession of sins, as if to
   be humbled for sins were legal; whereas repentance and all the acts of
   it is a mere gospel duty; the law knew no such thing, and the truest
   and most genuine sorrow ariseth from a sense of pardon: Zech. xii. 10,
   They shall look upon him whom they have pierced, and mourn;' so Luke
   vii. 47, that Christian Niobe loved much and wept much, and all be
   cause much was forgiven. John speaketh to believers, to them that
   walked in the light, to confess their sins, 1 John i. 9; we cannot have
   pardon in God's way till this be done: If we confess,' &c. It is a
   condition not for which, but without which, pardon is not obtained; it
   doth not show the cause, but the order of graces working. Again,
   sometimes it is abused to the neglecting of circumspection and heed in
   us. We are preserved in Christ, say they, and therefore we may be
   careless, and though we cast ourselves upon snares, temptations, and
   occasions to sin, be confident that God will keep us. The devil sets
   upon Christ with such a temptation: Mat. iv. 6, Cast thyself down, and
   he shall give his angels charge over thee,' Libertines scoff at the
   niceness and scrupulousness of former professors, that were willing to
   keep at such a distance from a temptation, as if their strict and exact
   walking were a fruit of their darkness and legal spiritedness; whereas
   the apostle maketh it a main property of children of light' thus to do,
   Eph. v. 15. So God's doing all in the covenant of grace is abused to
   exclude all care of duty, and to keep men in a lazy oscitancy, and
   gaping for grace without all care or endeavour on our part; whereas God
   loveth to be met with in his own way, and cometh in with supplies of
   grace according to our diligence in the use of means; see Mark iv. 34;
   and as it is abused, to shut out all endeavours after grace, so all
   actings and operations under grace; as if we were mere logs rather than
   rational agents, and God so did all that the act of our own faculties
   were quite abolished or suspended; whereas though the grace be from
   God, yet the act is ours, for otherwise the faintness and defectiveness
   of the operation would be chargeable upon him, and the Lord doth so
   draw us that we have a motion of our own: Draw me and we will run after
   thee,' Cant. i. 4. It is he that treads down Satan,' but under our
   feet.' Rom. xvi. 20. The doctrine of Christian liberty, which is one
   part of the gospel, is abused to exclude the moral law, as a rule of
   duties to God and man; whereas the apostle saith, I am not a'nomos, but
   e'nnomos, not without the law to God, but under the law to Christ,' 1
   Cor. ix. 21. Sometimes it is abused to a living to the height of the
   creature (as some carnal wretches phrase it), or an immoderate use of
   carnal comforts; whereas to restrain us in this kind, the scripture
   forbiddeth licentiousness in the use of the creatures under such terms
   as do imply the lawful use. See Luke xvii. 27, and Isa. xxii. 13. The
   things mentioned there are necessary for the supportation of life; but
   the immoderate use is intended, because they did nothing else but mind
   these things. He that will do all that he may, will soon do more than
   he should. The doctrine of spiritual worship, and abolishing the
   shadows of the law, which is another part of the gospel, is abused to
   the neglect and contempt of ordinances and acts of solemn worship, as
   if all were but forms, not suiting with that spirituality unto which
   they think they are called in these days of the gospel; and so constant
   prayer is laid aside as a form, whereas God calleth for daily worship
   in this kind, Mat. vi. 11, and making conscience of hearing the word: a
   form too low for them that pretend to live immediately upon the Spirit;
   whereas the scripture joineth word and Spirit together, as inseparable
   in the dispensation, Isa. lix. 21; and the apostle in one verse saith,
   Despise not prophesying,' 1 Thes. v. 19; and presently, ver. 20, Quench
   not the Spirit,' [102] implying whosoever doth the one will certainly
   do the other. So the use of the seals, baptism and the supper, as forms
   fit for novices; but they are of a more elevated strain, and above
   these lower helps, enjoying so much in the inward and hidden man;
   whereas Christ hath enjoined these ordinances for the use of all sorts
   of Christians till he come again to judge the world. See Mat. xxviii.
   20, and 1 Cor. xi. 26. So instructing children a form, though we have
   express command for it in scripture, Eph. vi. 4. It were easy to rake
   in this puddle, but this taste may suffice.

   Use 1. The use of all is to make us more cautious and wary, that we may
   not be guilty of this great sin.

   1. It is the error of the wicked, 2 Peter iii. 16. It is a black mark
   to grow the more wanton for mercies, secure for patience, sensual,
   vain, negligent, careless, because of the free tenders of grace in the
   gospel; there cannot be a more evident mark of a man in a carnal
   condition. It is sad when our table is made a snare;' but it is worse
   when the very gospel is made a snare, for the better things are, the
   worse is the abuse, and more dangerous. Look, as it is a mark of the
   love of God to have all things work together for good to us.' Rom.
   viii. 28, so it is an argument of the hatred of God when all things
   prove a snare, and the very gospel itself, the blessed gospel of the
   glorious God, is cursed to us. Oh! how sad is their condition.

   2. It is a sin against mercy, and those of all others are most
   dangerous. When you abuse grace, you make grace your enemy; and it is
   ill for creatures when grace is their enemy, and there is nothing left
   for them but justice and wrath; justice will take up the quarrel of
   abused mercy, and, as grace is despised, so wrath taketh place: They
   treasure up wrath,' &c., Rom. ii. 4, 5.

   3. It is foul ingratitude to turn our mercies into a provocation, to
   make a calf of our ear-rings, and to serve our lusts of God's
   providence; as he said of Adam, that what he received, me'los, a rib,
   he returned. .'3eXo?, a dart, alluding to his fall by Eve. So to fight
   against God with his own weapons, what vile ingratitude is that! See
   Jer. v. 7; Ezek. vii. 20. To make plenty the fuel of our lusts, what is
   it but to make God serve with our sins,' Isa. xliii. 24, and to grow
   worse for the gospel, black and tawny because the sun of righteousness
   hath looked upon us? It is as it were to give it out to the world as if
   he did serve with our sins by his own consent, and we had a license
   from heaven to do what we do.

   4. It is a great grief to the Spirit of God when you abuse grace. You
   do as it were put your miscarriages upon him, when you call licentious
   walking Christian liberty, and neglect of duty gospel freedom, and
   godly sorrow legalism, and strict walking superstitious niceness; you
   do as it were father your bastards upon the Spirit, and entitle the
   monstrous conceptions and births of your own carnal hearts to his
   incubation and overshadowing; you think God warranteth you in all this,
   and that is a high wrong to him which he will avenge in due time; see
   Ps. 1. 21, 22. I remember the prophet saith, Jer. iv. 10, O Lord! thou
   hast greatly deceived this people,' because the false prophets had done
   it in his name; false doctrines make God to be the deceiver, and these
   ill consequences drawn from the gospel are in effect charged upon the
   Spirit, who is the author of it.

   Well, then, learn the truth as it is in Jesus, Eph. iv. 21.

   [1.] First, make him your teacher; flesh and blood will stumble in
   God's plainest ways. We cannot learn any gospel truth of ourselves, but
   we are apt to pervert it to an ill use.

   [2.] Take the whole doctrine together; for it is the truth as it is in
   Jesus, otherwise it is the truth as it is in the mouth of a false
   teacher. Half-truth hath filled the world with looseness; when men
   divide between Christ's comforts and Christ's graces, his priesthood
   and his regality, his benefits and his laws, these partial
   apprehensions spoil all.

   [3.] As to your manner of learning, let it be saving, and such as tends
   to practice. It is not enough to make Christ our teacher by using his
   word, and looking for the direction of his Spirit, and to make the
   whole counsel of God our lesson; but also we must learn to a saving
   purpose, to put off the old man, to put on the new, and not to store
   the brain with knowledge so much as the heart with grace; for to this
   end is the gospel given to us, not for science so much as practice, to
   make us better rather than wiser and more knowing.

   Use 2. Another use is examination, to put us upon trial whether we do
   not, yea or no, turn the grace of God into wantonness.' A man may be
   right in doctrine, and yet the constitution of his spirit may be
   naught. Again, there may be a fond dotage on the name of Christ, and
   yet no real respect to him; therefore it behoves us to search how the
   gospel works with us.

   [1.] Are you not the better for the knowledge of it? If you are not the
   better you are the worse. If you know Christ, and come short of the
   hour [103] of his grace, you know him in vain; you make Christ and the
   gospel a useless thing. Compare 2 Cor. vi. 1 with Col. i. 6: there is a
   receiving the grace of God in vain,' and a knowing the grace of God in
   truth.' We receive it in vain when we are nothing the better for it;
   and we receive it in truth when we feel the sweetness and power of it
   upon our hearts and consciences. Those that know the grace in truth are
   the more vigilant, more humble, more holy. They are more diligent, for
   the grace of God hath a mighty constraint to urge us to duty, 2 Cor. v.
   14, 15: more humble, nothing so melting as grace, Zech. xii. 10;
   unkindness after so much grace as we have received in Christ is the
   great reason and cause of godly sorrow: more holy, nothing kindles such
   a rage and indignation against sin as grace doth: Ezra ix. 14, Should
   we again after such a deliverance,' &c.; nothing persuadeth by such
   powerful arguments to the practice of holiness as grace doth; see Titus
   ii. 11-14. Therefore what are you the better? If it worketh not thus,
   it is sad.

   2. Are you the worse sensibly for the knowledge of the gospel?

   First, Do you grow more careless and neglectful of duties, as if now
   there were not so much required of you? The gospel never taught you
   that, but your own corrupt hearts. It is true, the more Christ is
   preached, the more evangelical a man is in his duties; his heart is
   taken off more from resting in them, he doth not pitch his hopes upon
   the tale or number of his duties, and he doth not perform them out of
   bondage, but more clearly, knowingly, comfortably, as upon gospel
   grounds; but still he will be performing, as knowing that duties can
   never have too much of our care, and too little of our trust: in the
   gospel we have more help, therefore, in all reason, we should perform
   more work. Well, then, to grow more lazy and less frequent in the
   worship of God, and the use of the means of grace, the more we are
   acquainted with God's grace in Christ, is to abuse grace, which was
   given us to make us more cheerful, not more slack and negligent.

   Secondly, Less circumspect and wary in your conversations; loose
   walking is an ill sign. Christ himself taught us to enter in at the
   strait gate, and to walk in the narrow way,' Mat. vii. 13, 14. When men
   seek more room and breadth for their lusts, they pervert the end of the
   gospel, for the gospel only showeth that the greatest sin is
   pardonable, but the least is not allowable. The world is much for a
   shorter cut to heaven; but when you have done all, you will find that
   the good, old, long way is the nearest way home. Still we must make
   straight steps to our feet;' mortify lusts, bridle vile affections, and
   keep close to rule. Sin is the same that ever it was; and the law is
   the same; and God is as holy, and as much delights in holiness, as ever
   he did; we therefore must be as strict as ever. It is but a carnal
   liberty to have leave to be wanton, to be free to sin. Nature is very
   apt to hear in that ear, see 2 Peter ii. 18, 19, but grace counts it no
   privilege.

   Thirdly, If less humble, still you are guilty. A man committeth sin and
   findeth no remorse, upon the pretence of God's free grace in pardoning;
   this is still the wantonness which ariseth from the abuse of the gospel
   God's children never loathe themselves more than upon the remembrance
   of mercy, Ezek. xxxvi. 31, never melted for sin more than when the warm
   beams of God's love thaw their hearts, that they should sin against a
   pardoning God, a gracious Father, a good Master, &c. Every mercy is a
   new stab at heart. Christ's look made Peter weep bitterly; nothing
   affects them so much as grace.

   Obs. 3. The third point is taken from that particle our, te`n tou theou
   emon. He mentioneth their interest in God to provoke them so much the
   more to zeal against errors that were so scandalous to his grace. Note
   that sense of interest in God begets the best zeal for the truths and
   glory of God. The point consists of two branches:--

   1. That interest in God will beget a zeal for God. It troubleth a good
   man to see any one wronged, much more to see his own relations wronged,
   most of all to see his God wronged. Can a man profess love to God, and
   not espouse his quarrel? Friends have all things common, common love
   and common hatred, wrong the one and the other is not well at ease; so
   it is in the spiritual friendship between us and God: Ps. lxix. 9, The
   reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.' Injuries
   done to God and religion will as nearly affect us as those done to our
   persons. Certainly they that can be silent in the cause of God have
   little affection to him, and they who are so tender of worldly
   interests do little value an interest in God: Wisdom is justified of
   her children,' Mat. xi. 19. They are bastards and not children that are
   afraid or ashamed to own their mother's defence, or can hug those in
   their bosoms that are enemies to God and his grace: Ps. cxxxix. 21, Do
   not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? am not I grieved with them
   that rise up against thee?' It is an argument of his sincerity that God
   and he had the same enemies, that he could find no room in his heart
   for affection to them that had no affection to God. When we came into
   covenant with God, we made a league with him offensive and defensive,
   to count his friends ours and his enemies ours, to hate what he hateth
   and to love what he loveth; therefore, without breach of covenant we
   cannot be silent in God's cause, and friends to the enemies and abusers
   of his grace.

   2. The next branch is, that their zeal who have an interest in God is
   the best zeal. Now it is the best, partly because it is hottest. They
   that contest merely for an opinion are not so earnest as they that
   contend out of affection; as a stranger, seeing a man oppressed, may
   chide him that did the wrong, but a near relation he will interpose and
   venture himself in the quarrel; so will one that loveth God sacrifice
   all his interests for God's sake. Partly because it is purest. Carnal
   men may engage in religious controversies, out of passion they may
   stickle for their own opinion, but this fire is taken from a common
   hearth, not from the altar; it doth not arise from any love to God,
   from any inward relish and taste of the sweetness of grace, but only
   from humour and obstinacy and worldly interest; we may as well be
   afraid of some men's zeal against error as of others' proneness to it.
   Carnal persons keep a great coil, and fill the world with clamour and
   rage; but their hearts do not flame with zeal upon a proper interest,
   and do not carry on things in God's way.

   The use is to inform us of the reason why the spirits of godly men are
   so keen against such errors as intrench upon the grace of God; why
   errors about Christ are horrible to them, a very abomination to their
   thoughts; because thereupon are built all their hopes; and in such
   matters they have most experiences; therefore their hearts sparkle
   within them; others feel a cold indifferency, but they a mighty
   pressure upon their spirits.

   I now come to the last part of their description, and denying the only
   Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ. Observe their sin, denying. The
   object, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is here described three ways:--(1.)
   By his absolute rule and supremacy, despoten monon, the only Lord. (2.)
   By his essence, theo`n, God. (3.) By his headship over the church,
   kurion hemon, our Lord Jesus Christ.

   I shall first vindicate, and then open the words. Divers take the words
   disjunctively, applying the first clause to the Father, the second to
   the Son. So Erasmus translateth it, God, who is that only Lord,' and
   our Lord Jesus Christ.' But, as Beza observeth, this is not the first
   time that he is taken tripping in those places which seem manifestly to
   assert the Godhead of Christ. Briefly, then, that the whole clause is
   to be understood of Christ may be proved by these arguments:--(1.)
   Because the parallel place in Peter, from whence this seemeth to be
   taken, maketh mention only of Jesus Christ, where despo'tes, the word
   of absolute sovereignty, is ascribed to him, denying to`n despo'ten,
   the master that bought them,' 2 Peter ii. 1. (2.) Because to me it
   seemeth that Jude would lay down all the prerogatives of Christ in his
   natures, as God, as man; in his relation to the world, so a master; to
   the church, so a Lord. (3.) By the tenor of the words in the original,
   where there is no new article to divide them, and therefore all these
   titles belong to the same person, ton monon despoten, to`n theo`n
   kurion hemon, arnou'menoi. (4.) Many old copies, as Calvin saith, read
   thus, Denying Christ, who is only God and only Lord,' (5.) Because the
   heresy of these times struck at Christ more than God the Father, and
   only at the Father for Christ's sake; and therefore John, in his
   epistles, speaketh often of those that denied Christ. See 1 John ii.
   22, and 1 John iv. 3. It is true the school of Simon and some other
   sects held forth many fabulous things of God, and introduced multitudes
   of rulers by whom the world was governed; but this was to exclude
   Christ, and to make void that sovereignty which the scriptures assert
   to be committed into his hands. The most ancient heresies were those of
   the Simonians, Menandrians, Saturninians, who denied the person of
   Christ, affirming Simon Magus to be Christ; and the Valentinians, who
   denied his human nature, affirming that he brought his substance from
   heaven, and only passed through the Virgin Mary like water through a
   conduit. There is but one objection against this exposition, and that
   is, if it be meant of Christ, then the Father will be excluded from
   being God, for Christ, according to the sense alleged, is said to be
   only master, only God, and only Lord. I answer--The expression doth not
   exclude either of the persons of the Godhead, the Father or the Son,
   but only the creatures and feigned gods, especially those feigned
   rulers and governors of the world which the school of Simon and the
   Nicolaitans introduced under the horrid names of Barbel, Abrakan, and
   Kavlakan, &c. And indeed such kind of expressions are frequent in
   scripture, as Isa. xliv. 8, Is there a God beside me? Yea, there is no
   God, I know not any.' So Isa. xlv. 5, I am the Lord, there is none
   else, there is none besides me.' All which expressions are meant of
   Christ, as appeareth not only by the titles of Saviour and Redeemer,
   given to the God that there speaketh, but also by divers passages
   therein proper to him, yea, by a quotation of the apostle's. Compare
   Isa. xlv. 22, 23, with Rom. xiv, 11, and Phil. ii. 10. Again, you shall
   find like pas sages of God the Father, where he is said to be only true
   God: John xvii. 3, This is life eternal, to know thee the only true
   God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent;' which is not exclusive of
   other persons, but of other gods; and the scriptures speak thus because
   of the unity of the divine essence, which all the persons communicate
   one with another.

   The exposition of the words, now they are vindicated, will be easy. And
   denying. This is done either openly or covertly: openly when Christ is
   clearly renounced and opposed; covertly, Christ is denied either by the
   filthy conversation of Christians, or else by heretical insinuations
   striking at his person and natures at a distance. Both are intended for
   these seducers. Though they denied Christ, yet they had their pretences
   and illusions. This Christ whom they denied is described by his
   relation in the world, the only master or ruler. This word is opposed
   to their doting conceit of many rulers, between whom the regimen of the
   world was divided. The next title is theo`n, Gods. So Christ is called
   because of his divine nature; and then our Lord. He saith our partly to
   show that this was the title that he bore in relation to the church,
   they being his peculiar people by his father's gift and his own
   purchase; partly to awaken their zeal by a consideration of the
   interest which they had in this Lord thus denied; and then the other
   word, Lord, is proper to Christ's mediatorship. See 1 Cor. viii. 5.
   There remaineth but Christ's name, Jesus Christ. The word Jesus is
   opened, Mat. i. 21: Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save
   his people from their sins;' and it implieth here that Christ's
   Lordship shall be administered for the salvation of the church. The
   other word, Christ, signifieth anointed, which noteth his designation
   from God to be king, priest, and prophet. I do thus particularly open
   the terms, because I suppose the apostle's scope is to give us a sum of
   the Christian doctrine concerning the person, natures, and offices of
   Jesus Christ, all which were one way or other impugned by the seducers
   of that age.

   The points that might be drawn hence are many; for a taste take
   these:--

   Obs. 1. That Jesus Christ is master and Lord, despo'tes kai` ku'rios,
   king of nations,' Jer. x. 7; and king of saints,' Rev. xv. 3; or, as
   the apostle in one place, Head over all things to the church,' Eph. i.
   22. He is over all things, supreme and absolute; but the Church's head,
   from whom they receive all manner of influence. He hath a rod of iron
   to rule the nations, and a golden sceptre to guide the church. In the
   world he ruleth by his providences, in the church by his testimonies,
   Ps. xciii., per totum. In the world, the attribute manifested is power;
   in the church, grace. Well, then, here is comfort to God's people, your
   Lord is the world's master: Let the waves roar, the Lord reigneth,' Ps.
   xciii. You need not fear, he is not only Lord to protect you, but
   master of them that rise up against you. Again, who would not choose
   him to be a Lord, when, whether we will or no, he is our master, and
   bow the knee to him that will else break the back, and touch his golden
   sceptre lest we be broken with his rod of iron, and take hold of his
   strength by faith lest we feel it in displeasure? Lord, let me feel the
   efficacy of thy grace, rather than the power of thine anger!

   Obs. 2. Observe again, that Christ is Lord and Jesus; he came to rule,
   and he came to save. I shall handle these two titles--(1.) Conjunctly;
   and then, (2.) Singly and apart.

   1. Conjunctly: Let all Israel know that God hath made this Jesus, whom
   ye have crucified, Lord and Christ,' Acts ii. 36. It is usual to
   observe in Christ's style and title a mixture of words of power and
   words of goodness and mercy: see Isa. ix. 6, et alibi passim. Now for
   what end? Partly to show that he is a desirable friend, and a dreadful
   adversary: partly to set forth the mystery of his person, in whom the
   two natures did meet: partly to show that he is not good out of
   impotency and weakness; if we pardon and do good it is out of need. God
   is strong enough to revenge, but gracious enough to save and pardon.
   Power maketh us cruel: Who findeth his enemy and slayeth him not?' If
   we forbear, it is out of policy, not out of pity. The sons of Zeruiah'
   may be too hard for us,' but Christ, who is the great Lord, he also is
   Jesus; he hath the greatest power, and the greatest mercy; mighty, but
   yet a Saviour. Partly to show how we should receive him; we should not
   only come to him for ease, but take his yoke, Mat. xi. 28, 29. Give him
   your hearts as well as your consciences; if Christ save, let not sin
   lord it. What a pitiful thing it is when men would have Christ to
   redeem them, and Satan to rule and govern them! Ou the'lomen touton
   basileusai, We will not have this man to reign over us,' Luke xix. 14.
   There the business sticks: The carnal mind is enmity to the law.' Rom.
   viii. Lusts cannot endure to hear of a restraint, and therefore we
   oppose most Christ's nomothetic power; like angry dogs we gnaw the
   chain. The language of every carnal heart is, Our lips are our own; who
   is lord over us?' Ps. xii. 4. To be controlled for every word, every
   thought, every action, we cannot endure it. Oh! consider Christ hath
   many enemies, but they are his chief enemies that do withstand his
   reigning: Luke xix. 27, Those mine enemies, that would not that I
   should reign over them,' &c.

   2. Let us handle these two titles singly and apart.

   [1.] He is Lord: Acts x. 36, Jesus Christ, he is Lord of all.' As he is
   God he hath the same glory with the Father; as mediator there is a
   dominion that results from his office; for so he is the heir of all
   things,' the head of all creatures, and king of the church, and at the
   last day the judge of all men. But he is chiefly a Lord because of his
   heritage in the church; a Lord over his own people, who are given to
   him for a possession' by God the Father, Ps. ii. 8, and bought with his
   own blood,' Acts xx. 28; and taken into a marriage covenant with him,
   Eph. v. 25-27. And as Sarah called her husband lord, so must the church
   own Christ for Lord and husband. Well, then, let us acknowledge the
   dominion of Christ; let him be Lord alone in his own house; let us
   yield subjection and obedience to him; let us beware of depriving him
   of that honour to which he hath so good a right. You will say, Who are
   those that deny Christ his Lordship? I answer:--

   (1.) They that will not hear his voice, that slight his calls. He
   inviteth them and prayeth them that they will look into their hearts,
   consider their eternal condition, but they quench the Spirit, smother
   light, resist all these motions; these will not hear Christ's voice. He
   entreateth, prayeth, that we will come and put our souls under his
   government; and we in effect say, We are lords, and will not come at
   thee,' Jer. ii. 31. We are well enough, and shall do well enough
   without any such care and strictness.

   (2.) They that cannot endure his restraints: Jer. xxxi. 18, Thou art as
   a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke.' They cannot endure to hear of
   denying their fashions, their lusts, their pleasures, their vain
   thoughts, when every thought and every desire must be under a law; so
   much time spent in duties, such gravity in the conversation, such awe
   in their speeches; they break off like a wanton heifer. Vain and
   licentious spirits will not be yoked and clogged thus: Mal. i. 14, What
   a weariness is it!' Sacrifice upon sacrifice! such waiting upon God!
   they cannot endure it. Man is compared to a wild ass's colt,' not only
   for grossness of conceit, but for untamedness and wildness, Job xi. 12.
   We would roam abroad without restraint.

   (3.) They are given up to strong and inordinate desires of liberty;
   when men quarrel at duties rather than practise them, think it a kind
   of happiness to be free, and that there is no freedom but in sinning,
   and following the bent and sway of their own hearts, are all for
   breaking bands, and dissolving cords, Ps. ii. 4.

   (4.) These are bewrayed by a proud contempt and obstinacy against
   instruction and reproof: Jer. v. 5, I will go to the great men and
   speak to them; but these have altogether burst the yoke, and broken the
   bands.' They had cast off all respect and obedience to God: Jer. xiii.
   15, Hear, give ear, be not proud,' &c.; so Heb. xiii. 22, Suffer the
   words of exhortation,' &c. Some spirits are impatient, and recoil with
   the more violence upon a reproof, and storm and vex, which argueth much
   unsubjection of heart to Christ.

   [2.] He is Jesus, which signifieth a Saviour. Now Christ is a Saviour
   positively as well as privately; he giveth us spiritual blessings, as
   well as freedom from misery; John iii. 17, that they should not perish,
   but have everlasting life.' Again he is a Saviour not only by way of
   deliverance, but by way of prevention; he doth not only break the
   snare, but keep our feet from falling; he is as a shepherd to lead the
   flock, as well as a physician to heal the diseased. We do not take
   notice of preventive mercies, and yet prevention is better than escape.
   Again, he is a Saviour by merit and by power; for he hath not only to
   do with God, but with Satan. God is to be satisfied, and Satan
   overcome; and therefore he rescueth us out of the hands of Satan, and
   redeemeth us out of the hands of God's justice. To rescue a condemned
   malefactor, and take him by force out of the executioner's hands, is
   not enough; the judge also must be satisfied, and pass a pardon, or the
   man is not safe: Christ hath pulled us out of the power of darkness,'
   Col. i. 13, and in him the Father is well pleased,' Mat. iii. 17. There
   needeth also power to work upon our hearts, as well as merit to satisfy
   God. Before his exaltation he redeemed us, then he deserved it; and
   therefore it is said, We have salvation by his death,' 1 Thes. v. 9.
   After his exaltation he worketh it, and so we are saved by his life,'
   Rom. v. 10. So that living and dying he is ours, that living and dying
   we may be his: we have the power of his exaltation as well as the merit
   of his humiliation. Once more, he saveth us not only for awhile, but
   for ever; and therefore it is called an eternal salvation,' Heb. v. 9;
   not only from temporal misery, but from hell and damnation; not only
   the body is saved, but the soul; and the soul not only from hell, but
   the fear of hell, Heb. ii. 14, from the fear as well as the hurt, from
   despair and want of hope as well as from the misery itself. Yet, again,
   he saveth us not only from the evils after sin, but the evil of sin:
   Mat. i. 21, He shall save his people from their sins;' there is the
   chiefest part of his salvation. He doth not only save us in part, but
   saves us to the uttermost,' Heb. vii. 25. He giveth us life, and all
   things necessary to life. Well, then:--

   First, Bless God for Jesus Christ, that he took the cure of our
   salvation into his own hands; he would not trust an angel, none was fit
   for it: Isa. lix., I looked and there was no Saviour, therefore mine
   own arm wrought out salvation.' There are poor creatures like to perish
   for want of a Saviour; I will go down and help them; as Jonah, when he
   saw the tempest, Cast me into the sea.' So when we had raised a
   tempest, Cast me in, saith Christ, Lo, I am come to do thy will.'

   Secondly, Get an interest in Christ: Luke i. 47, My spirit hath
   rejoiced in God my Saviour,' Interest is the true ground of comfort and
   rejoicing. What must we do to get this interest? I answer:--

   1. Reject all other Saviours: Acts iv. 12, There is salvation in no
   other.' Nothing could save Noah and his family but the ark; if they had
   devised ships, they would not hold out against the deluge. Especially
   take heed of making Christ of self, setting up thy own merit, or thy
   own power; the one in effect renounceth his humiliation, the other his
   exaltation. Christ came to save that which was lost;' the sinking
   disciples cried out, Master, save us, we perish.' It is long ere God
   bringeth us to this: till you are lost, why should you make choice of a
   Saviour? Swimming is not a thing that can be practised ashore or on
   firm land: till we are brought into distress we will never look for a
   Saviour.

   2. Be earnest with God for an interest, and for the manifestation of
   it: Ps. xxxv. 3, Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.' When the soul
   hath chosen God, Lam. iii. 24, The Lord is my portion, saith my soul;'
   I will have no other Saviour, but I will desire the Lord to ratify it
   by his consent: I am thy salvation. 5 Those that would make use of
   Christ's salvation in a temporal way pressed on him, untiled the house
   to come at him; so should we force ourselves upon him by a holy
   boldness.

   Obs. 3. Again, from the words observe, the Son of God was Christ, that
   he might be Lord and Jesus; anointed of the Father that he might
   accomplish our salvations. This anointing signifieth two things:--

   1. The quality and kind of his office.

   2. The authority upon which it was founded.

   First, It noteth the nature of his offices. Under the Old Testament
   three sort of persons were anointed--kings, priests, and prophets, and
   all these relations doth Christ sustain to the church. Men that were to
   be saved lay under a threefold necessity--ignorance, distance from God,
   and inability to return to him. Suitably Christ a prophet to show us
   our misery, a priest to provide a remedy, a king to instate us in that
   remedy; therefore according to these three offices doth the scripture
   use words in describing the benefits we have by Christ: John xiv. 6, I
   am the way, the truth, and the life.' Christ is the way as a priest,
   for by his oblation and intercession we have the boldness to come to
   God; the truth as a prophet, the life as a king: take life either for
   the royal donatives of grace or glory. So 1 Cor. i. 30, He is made to
   use wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.' We are
   ignorant foolish creatures, therefore Christ is made to us wisdom as a
   prophet; we are guilty creatures, and therefore righteousness as a
   priest; sinful creatures, therefore sanctification; miserable
   creatures, liable to death and hell, therefore redemption, and both
   these as a king. It was necessary that the way of our salvation should
   be opened, effected, and applied; therefore did Christ first come from
   heaven as a prophet to preach the gospel; and then offer up himself
   through the eternal Spirit as a priest; and, last of all, seize upon
   the mediatorial throne as king of the church. Well, then, if our
   blindness and ignorance troubleth us, let us make use of Christ's
   prophetical office, that he may teach us the whole counsel of God; if
   we are haunted by troubles, and the accusations of our own conscience,
   let us sprinkle our hearts with the blood of our high priest, that they
   may be pacified; if we have any desire to be granted, let us make use
   of his intercession; if we be discouraged by our own weakness, and the
   power of our spiritual enemies, let us run for protection to our king,
   through whom the saints are more than conquerors.

   Secondly, It noteth the authority upon which his office is founded; he
   was anointed thereto by God the Father, who in the work of redemption
   is represented as the offended party and supreme judge; and so it is a
   great comfort to us that Christ is a mediator of God's choosing. When
   Moses interposed of his own accord, he was refused: Blot me out of thy
   book;' No, saith the Lord, the soul that sinneth, him will I blot out
   of my book.' But now Jesus Christ took not this honour upon him, but
   was called of God thereunto; it was the will of the Father: so that
   when we come to God, though we cannot say, He is mine, yet we can say,
   Lord, he is thine; a Saviour of thy setting up, thou hast authorised
   him, and wilt own thine own way, &c.

   Obs. 4. Once more, observe, which indeed is a point that lieth full in
   the eye of the text, that Jesus Christ, the master of the world and
   Lord of the church, is true God. For it is said here, denying the only
   Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ. It would seem a strange thing that
   I should go about to prove the Godhead of Christ, were not blasphemy
   grown so common, and appearing abroad with so bold a forehead.
   Heretofore it was a grievous abomination to the children of God when
   such a thought rushed into their minds; but now some promote it as a
   settled opinion. It is Satan's policy to loosen a corner stone, though
   he cannot wholly pull it out; he striveth all that he can to make the
   main articles of religion seem at least questionable. But Christians,
   be not shaken in mind; the foundation of the Lord standeth sure. I
   confess I should wholly omit such disputes; in fundamental articles, we
   should not allow a scruple: Thou shalt not inquire after their gods,'
   Deut. xii. 30. But when such conceits are not only satanical
   injections, but men's settled opinions, it is good to establish the
   heart in such principles as this is. That Christ is God appeareth by
   express scripture, where he is called the true God,' 1 John v. 20; the
   great God,' Titus ii, 13, to show that he is not a God inferior to the
   Father, but equal in power and glory, and that not by courtesy and
   grant, but by nature. So he is called the mighty God, the everlasting
   Father,' Isa. ix. 6, and God over all.' Rom. ix. 5; proofs so evident
   and pregnant that they need no illustration. And that he is a God equal
   to the Father appeareth also by express texts of scripture: Phil. ii.
   6, He was in the form of God, and thought it no robbery to be equal
   with God;' and Col. ii. 9, In him dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead
   bodily.' The saints are made partakers of the divine nature,' 2 Peter
   i. 4, but in him the whole Godhead dwelt personally, and all this was
   no usurpation of another's right. The Jews would have stoned him
   because he said God was his father, making himself equal with God;'
   therefore he meant it not in an ordinary sense, and indeed if he be a
   God, he is a God by nature, for God will not give his glory to
   another.' Again, God he must needs be, if you consider the work he
   ought to do. The work of the mediator could be dispatched by no
   inferior agent. As prophet, he was to be greater than all other
   prophets and apostles; for the great doctor of the church ought to be
   authentic, a lawgiver from whose sentence there is no ap peal: A lord
   in his own house,' Heb. iii. 6; one to whom Moses was but a servant,
   for to him he gave the law, Heb. xii. 26. One that is to be a fountain
   of wisdom to all the elect, 1 Cor. i. 30; one that must not only teach,
   but give eyes to see, and ears to hear, and a heart to learn. Consider
   him as a king; a finite power cannot break the force of enemies, pour
   out the Spirit, raise the dead, bestow grace and glory, and become an
   original fountain of life to all the elect. All these things are proper
   to God, the glory which he will not give to another. Consider him as a
   priest; and there are two acts, oblation and intercession, and still
   you will find that he must be God. For his oblation, he must be one
   that could offer up himself, Heb. ix. 14, and therefore must have
   power' over his own life, John x. 28, to lay it down and take it up;'
   which no creature hath. And he must offer himself one for all,' 2 Cor.
   v. 15; the person that suffered was to be infinite, as good and better
   than all theirs that should have suffered; as they said to David, thou
   art better than a thousand of us;' and this suffering was to be but
   once. Now, the wages of sin are eternal death; some thing there must be
   to compensate the eternity of the punishment, and nothing could
   counterpoise eternity but the infiniteness and excellency of Christ's
   person, as a payment in gold taketh up less room than a payment in
   silver, but the value is as much. It was necessary that he should
   overcome the punishment, for if we were always suffering, we could have
   no assurance that God were satisfied. And the end was to expiate sin;
   nothing but an infinite good could remedy so great an evil. The person
   wronged is infinite, so is the person suffering. And then his death was
   not only to be a ransom, but a price; not only anti'lutron, but
   anta'llagma. A surety to an ordinary creditor payeth the debt, and
   freeth the debtor from bonds. Christ was to bring us into grace and
   favour with God, and to merit heaven for us. Now for the other act of
   his priesthood, his intercession: so he was to know our persons and our
   wants and necessities, as the high priest had the names of the twelve
   tribes on his breast and shoulders, Exod. xxviii. 12, 29. And then he
   is to negotiate with God in the behalf of all believers, and to
   dispatch blessings suitable to their state: and who can do this but
   God, who knoweth the heart and trieth the reins? In short, to be a fit
   intercessor for all the elect, he is to know our needs, thoughts, sins,
   prayers, desires, purposes, and to wait on our business day and night,
   that wrath may not break out upon us; so that his work as mediator
   showeth him to be God.

   Uses. Well, then, we learn hence:--

   1. That Christ is a proper object for faith. Faith is built on God, 1
   Peter i. 21, and Christ is God; and therefore his merit was sufficient
   to redeem the church, which is therefore said to be purchased by the
   blood of God,' Acts xx. 28. This maketh him able to sanctify us, and
   purge us, for his blood was offered through the eternal Spirit,' Heb.
   ix. 14. As God he knoweth our wants; for as to his divine nature he
   knoweth all things; and then he hath a human nature that hath had
   experience of them. He is able, as God, to give in the supplies of the
   Spirit, to save to the uttermost, Heb. vii. 25. God manifested in our
   flesh is a firm basis for faith and comfort.

   2. Since he was God by nature, let us observe the love of Christ in
   becoming man. Men show their love to one another when they hang their
   picture about their neck. What did Christ when he took our nature? To
   see the great God in the form of a servant, or hanging upon the cross,
   how wonderful! God manifested in our flesh' is a mystery fit for the
   speculation of angels, 1 Tim. iii. 16, with 1 Peter, i. 11; it would
   have seemed a blasphemy for us to have thought it, to have desired it.
   Among the friars, they count it a mighty honour done to their order if
   a great prince, when he is weary of the world, cometh among them, and
   taketh their habit, and dieth in their habit. Certainly it is a mighty
   honour to mankind that Christ took our nature, and died in our nature,
   and that he was made sin,' made man,' made a curse.' Let us desire to
   be made partakers of his nature, as he was of ours. This is our
   preferment, to be partakers of the divine nature,' 2 Peter i. 4, as
   this was his abasement. The sun of righteousness went backward, there
   was the miracle; and let us use ourselves more honourably for the time
   to come, that we may not defile that nature which the Son of God
   assumed.

   3. It is an invitation to press us to come to Christ, and by Christ to
   God. The great work of the ministers is like that of Eliezer, Abraham's
   servant, to seek a match for our master's son. Our way to win you is to
   tell you what he is; he is God-man in one person; he is man, that you
   may not be afraid of him; God, that he may be sufficient to do you
   good;' the Lord of lords,' King of kings,' the heir of all things,' the
   Saviour of the world;' this is your beloved, ye daughters of
   Jerusalem.' He knoweth your wants, is able to supply them, though you
   are unworthy. Come, he needeth no portion with you; we can bring
   nothing to him, he hath enough in himself; as Esther, the poor virgin,
   had garments out of the king's wardrobe, Esther ii. 12, and the
   perfumes and odours given her on the king's cost. Therefore come to
   him; it is danger to neglect him: See that ye refuse not him that
   speaketh from heaven,' Heb. xii. 25. It is God wooeth you; he will take
   you with nothing, he is all-sufficient; you bringing him nothing but
   all-necessity, he will protect you, maintain you, give you a dowry as
   large as heart can wish. Therefore leave not till you come to I am my
   beloved's, and he is mine.'

   Obs. 5. I come now to the word implying their guilt, arnou'menoi,
   denying. Observe, that it is a horrible impiety to deny the Lord Jesus;
   when he would make these seducers odious, he giveth them, this
   character. Now Christ is many ways denied. I shall refer them to two
   heads--in opinion and practice.

   1. In opinion: so Christ is denied when men deny his natures or
   offices. (1.) His natures, his deity or humanity,--as those ancient and
   wicked heretics, Ebion and Cerinthus; and that is the reason why John
   beginneth his Gospel (which was last written) with a description of his
   Godhead, and is so zealous against them in his epistles; as also Jude
   and Peter. Ebion, Cerinthus, and Carpocrates, and others, held he was
   begotten as others are, by the help of a man. Manes held the Son of God
   to be a part of his Father's substance. Saturnius, Basilides, Cordion,
   with others, denied the humanity of Christ, saying he only appeared in
   the shape of a man. Samosatanus held God was not otherwise in Christ
   than in the prophets. Eutyches held there was in Christ but one nature,
   which was made up of the commixture of his flesh with his divinity, as
   water is mixed with wine. Nestorius would give him two personalities,
   because he had two natures. The Marcionites affirmed Christ suffered
   not really, but in show. Thus you see how busy the devil hath been, and
   always is, about this main article. (2.) His offices of king, priest,
   and prophet have been denied by none, as I remember, but yet often made
   void and of none effect. Antichristianism is perfectly the evacuating
   of Christ's offices. The Papists set up head against head, which is the
   spirit of antichristianism. They make void his priestly office by
   indulgences, purgatory, doctrine of merit; his prophetical office by
   doctrines of men and unwritten traditions. So Socinians make void his
   priesthood by denying his satisfaction; and Papists make void the other
   act of his priesthood by setting up mediators of intercession, &c.

   2. Christ is denied in practice; and so--(1.) By apostasy and total
   revolt from him: Mat. x. 33, Whosoever shall deny me before men,' &c.
   None sin as apostates do; for they do as it were, after trial, and upon
   deliberate judgment, acknowledge the devil the better master; they
   first forsook Satan, and then came to Christ, and then they go back
   again from Christ to Satan; and so do, as it were, tell the world, that
   with him is the best service; and therefore it were better they had
   never known the way of righteousness,' &c., 2 Peter ii. 21. (2.) By not
   professing Christ in evil times, for not to profess is to deny: see
   Mat. x. 32, 33, and Mark viii. 38, in an age when men prove disloyal in
   the duty of the covenant, called there an adulterous generation.' Some
   are ashamed for fear of disgrace, as well as afraid for fear of danger
   to own Christ, and the ways best pleasing to him; this is to deny him.
   (3.) Men deny Christ when they profess him, and walk unworthily and
   dishonourably to their profession. Actions are the best image of men's
   thoughts. Now their actions give their profession the lie: Titus, i.
   16, They profess they know God, and in works they deny him.' So 1 Tim.
   v. 8, If any provide not for his own house, he hath denied the faith;'
   that is, done an act incompatible with the Christian faith, of which he
   maketh profession; which is interpretativè--a denying the faith. For
   the more clear opening of this, consider these propositions:--

   [1.] An empty profession of Christ is not enough; now Christ is
   everywhere received, it is easy to profess his name. To be a Christian
   in heart and conscience was far more easy to them in the primitive
   times than to be so in name and profession, the powers of the world
   being against that way; whereas the difficulty on our part lieth in
   being Christians in heart: it is no disgrace now to be a Christian
   outwardly; that opposition and scorn which was then cast upon
   Christianity would now be cast upon Judaism, or Turcism, or Paganism.
   The winds blow out of another corner, and that which was their
   discouragement may be our motive, to wit, the countenance of civil
   powers; all advantages lie this way. If in Christ's time they followed
   him for the loaves, John vi. 26, now they may much more. Quandoquidem
   panis Christi jam pinguis factus est, saith Gilbert; [104] tractatur in
   conciliis, disceptatur in judiciis, disputatur in scholis, cantatur in
   ecclesiis, quaestuosa res est nomen Christi--the world is well altered
   since the first flight of Christianity abroad; the kings and princes
   and wise men of the world were then against it, everywhere was it
   hooted at as a novel and improbable doctrine; but since, by long
   prescription of time, it hath gotten esteem in the world, and is made
   the public profession of nations, and kings and princes have brought
   their glory into the church, now Christ is handled in councils,
   disputed of in the schools, and preached of in the assemblies, so that
   the general profession of Christianity is a matter of no thanks. It is
   easy to be good where there is nothing to draw us to the contrary; and
   therefore, when Christ cometh to judgment, paganism and loose
   profession of Christianity shall fare alike; for loose Christians are
   but pagans under a Christian name; see Jer. ix. 25, 26, The days shall
   come that I will punish all them that are uncircumcised with them that
   are circumcised; Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon
   and Moab; for these nations are uncircumcised in flesh, and the house
   of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.' It is no advantage to bear God's
   mark in our bodies, and to have no fruit of it in our souls; this is
   but to clothe ourselves with the leaves of the vine without partaking
   the sap. What difference is there between those who, in a loose
   Christian profession, are addicted to luxury, wantonness, quarrel ling,
   prodigious lusts, and the votaries or worshippers of Mars, Venus,
   Bacchus, and Priapus? Only the one appear in their own colours, and
   show what they are, and the other, though they are as low and brutish
   in their practices, pretend to a higher name, even to the sacred and
   excellent name of Christians. Alas! your circumcision shall be reckoned
   uncircumcision.' Rom. ii. 25, when you have not the fruit of it.

   [2.] Profession of Christianity without answerable practice maketh us
   in worse case than a heathen that is ignorant of Christ and salvation
   by him; see 1 Tim. v. 8, He is worse than an infidel,' Poor pagans are
   not so well enlightened, instructed, and acquainted with such rich and
   glorious mercy, with the great things of eternity,' with the
   assistances of God the Spirit; they have not such rules as we have, nor
   such advantages as we have, nor such obligations as we have, nor such
   encouragements as we have. If a man on horseback cometh slower than a
   man on foot, we blame him the more, because he had more help. So are
   carnal Christians in worse case than the heathen, because God may
   justly expect more from them. To be brought up in a prince's court, and
   to be still of rude and servile conditions, is worse in them than in
   those that follow the plough all days of their lives. So to be trained
   up in the courts of Christ, and to come short of the heathens in
   morality and strictness of conversation, it will be worse taken of us
   than of those that never heard of Christ. The more we profess the truth
   the more we condemn ourselves in our evil practices, and therefore must
   needs be worse than heathens; for we practise that by voluntary choice
   and perverse inclination which they practise by education, they know
   little better; so that the more excellent the religion is which we
   profess, the more vile and base is our disobedience; for our profession
   will be a sore witness against us, that we knew better and had
   encouragements to do better; we justify the heathen, but we condemn
   ourselves, as Israel justified Sodom, Ezek. xvi. 51, but by her
   profession so much the more disproved her own carriage, see ver. 63.
   Time will come when you will wish you had never known the way of
   righteousness;' and as Job cursed the day of his birth, so will you the
   memory of that day wherein you were added to the church.

   [3.] Profession accompanied with some rash and fond affection to Christ
   is not enough to acquit us from denying him. Many in a heat and humour
   will be ready to die for their God, and yet deny him ordinarily in
   their lives. As a quarrelling ruffian will stand up for the honour of
   his father, who yet, by his debauched courses, is the very grief of his
   heart; it may be he wisheth his death to enjoy the inheritance, yet if
   any other should speak a disgraceful word of him, he is up in arms
   presently, and ready to fight with him. So some men pretend much
   affection to their religion, and are ready to stab him that shall
   question it, or to venture their own lives in the quarrel, and yet none
   do this religion so great a despite and dishonour as they do themselves
   by their ungodly conversations. The apostle supposeth that some may
   give their bodies to be burned that have not charity, 1 Cor. xiii. 3,
   for all this ado is not for their religion, but their humour. If their
   religion were rightly understood they would not endure it, because it
   altogether disproveth such practices as they delight in; and all that
   they do is no more than they would do for an idol, if they were born
   there where idols are worshipped. The blasphemies of a pagan or an open
   enemy to religion do not touch Christ so near in point of honour as the
   scandalous behaviour of a Christian; when Pagans declaim against him,
   it is but the malice of an enemy. Dogs will bark, it is their kind; but
   your disobedience to his laws and unsuitable carriages doth far more
   dishonour, and represent him as an ulcerous Christ to the world;
   because you pretend so much affection to him, and can live in such a
   fashion, you would be taken for his greatest friends, and so in effect
   you make the world believe that he doth approve your doings.

   [4.] Christ may be denied, though there be a stricter profession of his
   name, and some faint love and relish of his sweetness. Besides the
   loose national profession of Christianity which God, in a wise
   providence, ordaineth for the greater safety and preservation of his
   church, there may be a strict personal profession, taken up from inward
   conviction, and some taste and feeling, and yet Christ may be denied
   for all this, as some that had tasted the good word,' turned aside to
   the world, and so are said to crucify him' rather than to profess him,
   Heb. vi. 4-6. The apostle intendeth some Hebrews that did mix Moses
   with Christ and Judaism to save their goods. So elsewhere he speaketh
   of some that had a form of godliness, but denied the power thereof,' 2
   Tim. iii. 5; by the form, meaning the strictest garb of religion then
   in fashion. This is to deny Christ, when we deny the virtue and power
   of that religion which he hath established, and will not suffer it to
   enter upon our hearts.

   [5.] The means to discover false profession is to observe how we take
   it up, and how we carry it on; whether we embrace it upon undue
   grounds, or match it with unconsonant practices.

   (1.) We embrace it upon undue grounds if we take it up merely upon
   tradition, without a sight of that distinct worth and excellency which
   is in our religion, for then our religion is but a happy mistake, the
   stumbling of blind zeal upon a good object; and all the difference
   between you and pagans is but the advantage of your birth and
   education. Standing upon a higher ground doth not make a man taller
   than another of the same growth and stature that standeth lower; their
   stature is the same, though their standing be not the same. So you are
   no better than pagans, only you have the advantage of being born within
   the pale, and in such a country where the Christian religion is
   professed. You do according to the trade of Israel, 2 Chron. xvii. 4,
   and live kat' aiona, as the fashion of your country will carry it, Eph.
   ii. 2; and as beasts follow the track, so you take up that religion
   which is entailed upon you.

   (2.) If we match it with unsuitable practices. These may be known, if
   we do consider what is most excellent in the Christian religion.
   Elsewhere [105] I have showed that the glory of the Christian religion
   lieth in three things--in excellency of rewards, purity of precepts,
   and sureness of principles of trust.

   First, In the fulness of the reward, which is the eternal enjoyment of
   God in Christ; therefore they that do not make it their first and chief
   care to seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness,' Mat. vi. 33,
   that are like swine, in preferring the swill of carnal pleasures before
   communion with God, or, in the scripture expression, Love pleasures
   more than God,' or prefer the profits of the world before everlasting
   happiness, they whose lives are full of epicurism, atheism,
   worldliness, it is not a pin to those whether they be pagans or
   Christians; for, acting thus heathenishly, thus brutishly, they do but
   pollute that sacred and worthy name.

   Secondly, The perfection of the precepts, which require a full
   conformity of the whole man to the will of God. More particularly,
   Christian precepts are remarkable for purity and charity: for purity,
   and therefore revellings and banquetings and chambering' are made to be
   customs of the Gentiles, 1 Peter iv. 3, things abhorrent from the
   Christian religion; they that are yokeless, and live according to the
   swing of their own lusts, or else that only fashion the outward man,
   make no conscience of thoughts, lusts, &c.; they do not live as
   Christians. For charity: nothing is more pressed than giving; [106] it
   was Christ's maxim It is better to give than to receive,' Acts xx. 35.
   And also forgiving: one great strain of his sermon is love to enemies,
   Mat. v. 43-48. Christ, when he brought from heaven the discovery of
   such a strange love from God to man, would settle a wonderful love on
   earth between man and man.

   Thirdly, For sureness of principles of trust; the whole scripture
   aimeth at this, to settle a trust in God, and therefore it discovereth
   so much of God's mercy, of his particular providence, of the
   contrivance of salvation in and by Christ; so that to be without hope,'
   is to be like a Gentile, for they are described to be men without
   hope,' 1 Thes. iv. 13; and carking and distrustful care is made the sin
   of the Gentiles, Mat. vi. 31, 32: this kind of solicitude is for them
   that know not God, or deny his providence over particular things.

   Well, then, take heed of denying Christ; it is a heavy sin, it cost
   Peter bitter sorrow, Mat. xxvi. 75. Will you deny Christ that bought
   you'? 2 Peter ii. 1. Now they deny Christ, whose hopes and comforts are
   only in this world; Christ is not their God, but their belly, Phil.
   iii. 19. Libertines are not disciples of Christ, but votaries of
   Priapus. Merciless and revengeful men do condemn that religion which
   they do profess. In short, they do not only deny Christ that question
   his natures or make void his offices, but they that despise his laws,
   when they do not walk answerably, or walk contrary.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Ver. 5. I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew
   this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of
   Egypt, afterwards destroyed them that believed not.

   We have done with the preface. I come now to the examples by which the
   apostle proveth the danger of defection from the faith. The first is
   taken from the murmuring Israelites; the second from the apostate
   angels; the third from the beastly Sodomites. That you may see how
   apposite and apt for the apostle's purpose these instances are, I shall
   first insist upon some general observations.

   Obs. 1. First observe that God's ancient judgments were ordained to be
   our warnings and examples. The Bible is nothing but a book of
   precedents, wherein the Lord would give the world a document or copy of
   his providence: All these things are happened to them for examples,' 1
   Cor. x. 11. When we blow off the dust from these old experiences, we
   may read much of the counsel of God in them; their destruction should
   be our caution. His justice is the same that ever it was, and his power
   is the same, his vigour is not abated with years: God is but one,' Gal.
   iii. 20; that is, always the same, without change and variation, as
   ready to take vengeance of the transgressors of the law as of old; for
   that is the point there discussed. So 2 Tim. ii. 13, He abideth
   faithful; he cannot deny himself.' In all the changes of the world, God
   is not changed, but is where he was at first. Surely we should tremble
   more when we consider the examples of those that have felt his justice;
   for God keepeth a proportion in all his dispensations. If he were
   strict, and holy, and just, then he is strict, and holy, and just now.
   He that struck Ananias and Sapphira dead in the place for a lie, that
   made Zacharias dumb for unbelief, that kept Moses out of the land of
   promise for a few unadvised words, that turned Lot's wife into a pillar
   of salt for looking back, is the same God still, not a jot altered: his
   judgments may be more spiritual, but then more terrible.

   Again, answerable practices make us partakers of their guilt, and
   therefore involve us in their punishment. Imitation is an evidence of
   approbation. A man may have more sins charged upon him than those
   committed in his own person; you are partakers of their evil deeds that
   lived before you, if you do as they did. It may be the memory of those
   that formerly fell under the weight of God's displeasure is execrable
   to you, yet your walking in the same course is a sign that you like
   their practices, and therefore you must expect their judgments with
   advantage and usury: Mat. xxiii. 35, That upon you may come all the
   righteous blood that was shed upon the earth, from the blood of
   righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, whom ye
   slew between the temple and the altar.' Why upon them? and how did they
   slay him? No doubt the memory of Cain was accursed among the Jews, but
   they walked in the way of Cain,' and so were to receive Cain's judgment
   with advantage. No doubt the memory of the murderers of Zechariah the
   prophet was hateful to them, but they continued prophet-killing and
   prophet-hating, and therefore did implicitly approve his murder, and so
   are said to slay him. Jude 11, it is said, These perished in the
   gainsaying of Korah.' How can that be, when they were not as yet born?
   These seducers lived long after, but following them in their sin, in
   their ruin they had a sure pledge of their own destruction. When we see
   others fall into a deep pit, and yet will adventure the same way, as we
   sin the worse, so our judgment will be the greater.

   Uses. Well, then, let us make every instance of the word a warning, and
   apply it for our use; it is excellent when we read the scriptures with
   a spirit of application. In the miscarriage of others we have
   experience at a cheap rate; and in their misery we have as sure a proof
   of the evil of sin, though not as costly, as if we had felt it
   ourselves.

   Again, when wicked men flourish, be not dismayed. How hath God judged
   sinners of like kind? What say your scripture precedents? I went into
   the sanctuary; there I understood their end,' Ps. lxxiii. 17.

   Again, it showeth how vain their conceit is, that God will not deal so
   severely with us if we continue in our sins as he hath done with others
   in former times when the scriptures were written. God's judgments, I
   confess, are more spiritual, but every way as severe to them that
   continue in their sins; heretofore they were smitten with death, now
   with deadness. Nadab and Abihu were quickly dispatched for their
   unhallowed approaches to God in worship, Lev. x. 3, &c.; many come now
   that do not sanctify God in their hearts: their judgment is more
   spiritual, the ordinances which should quicken, harden them. Bears
   devoured the children that mocked the prophet, 2 Kings ii. 23-25: many
   sit taunting by the walls that are not torn in pieces by bears, but
   they are posting to hell apace; tarry but a little while, and God will
   tear them in pieces, and there shall be none to deliver,' Ps. 1. Korah,
   Dathan, and Abiram were swallowed up quick, Num. xvi.; the earth
   cleaves to receive them that made a cleft in the congregation: many act
   as tumultuously as they, and no doubt their day is coming. Lot's wife,
   whose heart hankered after her possessions, was turned into a pillar of
   salt for looking back, Gen. xix. They that revert, and, after they are
   embarked with Christ, run ashore again as soon as they see a storm
   a-coming, shall have their reward in due time.

   Obs. 2. The next thing which I observe in these instances is, the
   impartiality of divine justice; for in all the examples brought, there
   are some circumstances upon which others would expect an exemption from
   wrath; as the interest of the Israelites, they were God's own people;
   the dignity of the angels, they were as it were fellows of God and
   courtiers of heaven; the beauty and excellency of the country of Sodom:
   and in all the instances ye may observe the judgments fell on
   multitudes and societies, or collective bodies. All the murmuring
   Israelites, all the apostate angels, all the inhabitants of the four
   cities. Observe then--(1.) That no outward privilege can avail us in
   the day of wrath, and so God's justice knoweth no relations. He spared
   not Christ.' Rom. viii. 32; he spared not the angels,' 2 Peter ii. 4;
   he spared not his people of Israel, &c. (2.) None have a privilege to
   sin, and therefore none are exempted from punishment; the law includeth
   all, the son, the servant, them that sit on the throne, and those that
   grind at the mill, none have a license from heaven and a privilege to
   sin above others. (3.) Wicked men do not spare God, and therefore God
   doth not spare them. They abuse his justice, his mercy; they spare not
   his glory, his laws; and as they are impartial in sinning, no
   restraints withhold them, so God is impartial in punishing.

   Uses. Lean not then upon these reeds. When wrath maketh inquisition for
   sinners, outward privileges are of no use; it is happy for them alone
   that are found in Christ,' Phil. iii. The avenger of blood had nothing
   to do with the manslayer in the city of refuge; when God is about to
   strike, none but Christ can hold the blow. See the vanity of other
   things. (1.) Outward profession is nothing, your circumcision becometh
   uncircumcision.' God disclaimeth interest in a sinful people: Thy
   people which thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt,' saith God to
   Moses, when they had corrupted themselves, in scorn and disdain, Exod.
   xxxii. 7. Thy people; he will not own them for his sheep, Deut. xxxii.
   5. (2.) No dignity can exempt us; the angels were cast down to places
   of darkness. Dignity doth not lessen but aggravate sin; where much is
   given, much is owed, and much will be required: Tophet is prepared for
   kings, for princes is it prepared.' (3.) Not outward excellency, as the
   pleasant land of Sodom. The disciples thought the goodly buildings of
   the temple would move Christ to pity, Luke xxi. 5, 6, but Christ
   telleth them, not one stone should be left upon another.' Saul was
   checked for sparing the best. Justice is not dazzled with outward
   splendour. The Lord threateneth to punish the dainty daughters of Zion
   with a scab,' Isa. iii. 17, &c. (4.) Not any society or multitudes of
   men. He spared not the old world,' 2 Peter ii. 5. No leagues and
   combinations can maintain your cause against God: Though the wicked go
   hand in hand, they shall not escape unpunished,' Prov. xi. 21. Briars
   and thorns may be intricated, and enfolded one within another, but when
   a devouring flame cometh amongst them, they do not hinder but increase
   the burning. Universal evils are above man's punishment, but not God's.
   There is no safety in following a multitude to do evil.' So that
   nothing will serve as a fit screen to interpose between wrath and you,
   but only Christ.

   Obs. 3. I observe that, in all these instances there was some preceding
   mercy more or less. The angels had the dignity of their nature; the
   Israelites had the testimony of God's presence, and were delivered out
   of Egypt; the Sodomites had eternal [107] blessings, and the preaching
   of Lot, Gen. xix. 9. It is God's usual course to give a people a taste
   of his mercy ere he discover the power of his anger. Judgment is his
   last work: there is some mercy abused before it cometh, which doth
   abundantly clear God in the judgments that come upon the sons of men.
   Their ruin may be sad, but never undeserved. God hath not left himself
   without a witness,' but we are left without excuse.'

   Obs. 4. Once more I observe, that in all these instances God had still
   a care to put a distinction between the just and the unjust; the race
   of Israel was not destroyed, but only them that believed not.' The good
   angels were preserved, the bad only fell from their first estate. Sodom
   perished in the flames, but Lot escaped. When the multitude is so
   corrupt, that we know not how they shall be punished and the rest
   preserved, let us think of these instances, let us refer it to God: He
   knoweth,' &c., 2 Peter ii. 9.

   I come now to the words; in which you have a preface, and the first
   instance of God's judgment, which was on the unbelieving Israelites. In
   the preface you may take notice of his purpose, I will put you in
   remembrance; his insinuation, though ye once know this.

   I begin with the first part, his purpose, I will put you in
   remembrance. From thence observe:--

   Obs. 1, That it is a great part of a minister's duty to be a
   remembrancer. We are remembrancers in a double sense:--(1.) From the
   people to God, to put God in mind of his people's wants; so it is said,
   Isa. lxii. 6, Ye that are the Lord's remembrancers.' Christ is the
   church's advocate, but we are the church's solicitors, to represent the
   sad condition of the church to God. (2.) From God to the people; and so
   we are to put them in mind of the being of God, the riches of his
   grace, the necessity of obedience, the preciousness of their souls, the
   many dangers that lie in their way to heaven, &c. These are standing
   dishes at Christ's table. That this is a great part of our office
   appeareth by those places:--1 Tim. iv. 6, If thou put the brethren in
   remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus
   Christ.' And Paul, speaking of his apostleship, saith, Rom. xv. 15, As
   one that putteth you in remembrance, through the grace given to me;'
   see 2 Tim. ii. 14; Titus iii. 1; 2 Peter i. 12-14; iii. 1. So there are
   two psalms that bear that title, A Psalm of David to bring to
   remembrance, Ps. xxxviii. and lxx. The great use of sacraments is to
   put us in remembrance of Christ, 1 Cor. xi. 24. Yea, one great
   employment of the Spirit is to bring things to our remembrance,' John
   xiv. 26; all which intimateth (1st.) Our forgetfulness and incogitancy.
   Truths formerly understood are soon forgotten, or not duly considered
   and kept in the view of conscience. (2d.) The benefit of a good memory.
   A bad memory is the cause of all mischief, but a lively remembrance of
   truth keepeth the mind in a good frame. (3d.) That however it be with
   natural, yet spiritual knowledge is a reminiscence, or reviving the
   seeds infused in the new creation, 1 Cor. xv. 2; Heb. xii. 5. (4th.)
   That a minister dischargeth his duty when he teacheth his people things
   vulgar and already known, as well as those which are rare and less
   known: if he be but a remembrancer it is enough; we are to bring forth
   things both new and old.' We count him a wanton prodigal that only
   furnisheth his table with rarities, neglecting wholesome meats because
   they are usual. (5th.) The necessity of a standing ministry, if not to
   instruct, yet to keep things in remembrance. Because the most necessary
   truths are few and soon learned, men presently begin to think they know
   as much as can be taught them, and so neglect ordinances; whereas one
   great use of the ministry is to keep truths fresh and savoury in the
   thoughts and memory. The heathen soon lost the knowledge of God,
   because they were without a public monitor that might keep this
   knowledge still on foot. The sound of the trumpet infuseth a new
   courage, so doth every sermon beget new affections, though we knew the
   truths delivered before. Coals will die without continual blowing; so
   will graces languish without often warnings and admonitions.

   The next thing in the preface is the insinuation, though ye once knew
   this. That word once needeth to be explained. His meaning is not that
   formerly they had known, but now forgotten it; neither is once to be
   referred to upomnesai, as if the sense were, I will once put you in
   remembrance; but by once is meant once for all; that is, ye have
   certainly and irrecoverably received this as a truth. This clause will
   yield us these notes.

   Obs. 2. That it is the duty of every Christian to be acquainted with
   the scriptures; the apostle presumeth it of these Christians to whom he
   wrote. Now this is necessary in regard of ourselves, that we may know
   the solid grounds of our own comfort; every man would look over his
   charter: Search the scriptures, for in them ye think to have eternal
   life,' John v. 39. Particular and distinct scriptures are a great
   advantage in temptations. Sic scriptum est is Christ's own argument
   against Satan, Mat. iv. No Christians so unsettled in point of comfort
   or opinion as those that are unskilful in the word,' Heb. v. 13. In
   regard of others, it is necessary that we may discharge our duty to
   them; Let the word dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one
   another,' &c., Col. iii. 16. None but full vessels will run over, Job
   xxxii. 18. Ignorant Christians are barren and sapless in discourse;
   private Christians must be full of knowledge;' not only to have
   knowledge enough to bring themselves to heaven, but to admonish
   others,' see Rom. xv. 14. Well, then, do not put off this care to
   others, as if it were proper only to scholars and men of a public
   calling; this is every man's work that hath a soul to be saved. It is
   Popish ignorance to be contented with an implicit belief; you may best
   trust your own eyes. When the sun shineth, every man openeth his
   windows to let it in. We busy ourselves in other books, why not in the
   word? Austin was pleased with Tully's Hortensius, but he cast it away
   because he could not find the name of Christ there. It is the
   description of a godly man, His delight is in the law of God, and in
   his law doth he exercise himself day and night,' Ps. i. 2. These are
   the chaste delights of a child of God, not in playbooks and idle son
   nets; how many sacrilegious hours do most spend in these trifles! Good
   books should not keep us from the scriptures; water is sweetest in the
   fountain. Luther professeth that he could wish all his books forgotten
   and utterly laid aside, rather than that they should keep men from
   reading the scriptures themselves. [108] Christians, study the word
   more, that you may have promises, doctrines, examples ready and more
   familiar with you; to be ignorant in a knowing age is an argument of
   much negligence, Heb. v. 14. Now religion is made every one's
   discourse, will you alone be a stranger in Israel? As the many helps
   call upon us to study the word more, so the many errors which are
   abroad: all error cometh from unskilfulness in the scriptures: Mat.
   xxii. 29, Ye err, not knowing the scriptures;' in the dark a man may
   soon lose his way.

   To cure this mischief, let me press you:--

   1. To read the scriptures in your families; set up this ordinance among
   other parts of worship there--it is a family exercise--that your
   children may be trained up in them, 2 Tim. iii. 15. It is a good closet
   exercise for your own private instruction, none of you are in too high
   a form; the prophets searched them diligently,' 1 Peter i. 11, 12.

   2. Read them with profit, so as you may understand them, and apply the
   doctrines and examples you meet with there. Ask thy soul, Understandest
   thou what thou readest?' Acts viii. 30, or as Paul, Rom. viii. 31, What
   shall we say to these things?' The scriptures are not to be read for
   delight, but for spiritual profit and use.

   3. In cases of difficulty use all holy means; pray to God, the Spirit
   is the best interpreter; pray before, pray after, as you do for food.
   If God answer not at first, Cry for knowledge, lift up thy voice for
   understanding.' Call in the helps which God hath given, many private
   helps of commentaries; but above all, despise not prophesying.' Consult
   with the officers and guides of the church, Eph. iv. 14, Mal. ii. 7.

   Obs. 3. Observe again, that those truths which we understand already,
   they had need be pressed again, and revived upon us; see 1 John ii. 21.
   Our knowledge is but weak, the eye of the mind is opened by degrees;
   our memories are weak, and commands must be repeated to a forgetful
   servant; our affections are slow, not easily wrought up to the love of
   good things. When the wedge will not enter with one blow, we follow it
   home with blow upon blow. Well, then, we say--(1.) Repetitions are
   lawful for you; it is a sure thing, Phil. iii. 1. Christ in the
   Gospels, and Paul in the Epistles, do often repeat the same passages.
   Till you be affected with them we must inculcate necessary principles
   again and again: God speaketh once, yea, twice, when men regard it
   not,' Job xxxiii. 14. Consider men are dull to conceive, slow of heart
   to believe.' The way to pierce the hard stone is by often dropping: apt
   to forget heavenly truths: leaky vessels must be filled again, Heb. ii.
   1. We must repeat, to make shame more stirring: Peter was troubled when
   Christ said the third time, Lovest thou me?' John xxi. 17. Let this
   which hath been said prevent censure; look upon it as a providence when
   the same truth or sermon is presented again: Surely I have not
   meditated enough of this truth, I am not enough affected with it,
   therefore the Lord hath again brought it to my thoughts, or there is
   some new temptation that I shall meet with, that I may find the need of
   this old truth, &c. (2.) That it is a spiritual disease, a surfeit of
   manna, when men must still be fed with new things; no truths are too
   plain for our mouths, or too stale for your ears; the itch of novelty
   puts men upon ungrounded subtleties, and that maketh way for error or
   hardness of heart. Though you hear nothing but what you are acquainted
   with, be content; they were carnal people that complained they had
   nothing but the old burden,' Jer. xxiii. 33, 34. Take heed of the
   Athenian itch, many times it argueth guilt: we cannot endure to have an
   old sore rubbed again; as Peter was troubled when Christ spake to him
   the third time, as I noted before, that his apostasy should once more
   be revived. (3.) It may justify two duties of great use--meditation and
   repetition in our families. (1st.) Meditation, for it is good to
   remember truths that we do already know. Once hath God spoken, and
   twice have I heard it,' Ps. lxii. 11. We should go over and over it
   again in our thoughts. First we learn, and then we meditate; study
   findeth out a truth, and meditation improveth it; as first the meat is
   taken in, and then the digestion is afterwards. Conscience preacheth
   over the sermon again to the heart; while the thing is new it doth more
   exercise study than meditation; but when we have once learned it, then
   our thoughts should work upon it; for meditation is the improvement of
   a known truth. (2d.) Repetition in our families; let them hear it again
   and again, the third blow may make the nail go. If people were humble
   and sober, they would have new and fresh thoughts every time a truth is
   revived upon them. At first hearing many are lost through the wandering
   and distraction of our thoughts, things which upon the review may be
   brought to hand again; at least youth and children must have line upon
   line,' as when they learn to write, the same letters and the same copy
   are written over again and again, till the figure of them be formed in
   their fancies.

   I have done with the preface; I come now to the first instance
   produced, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of
   Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.--to`n laon. The term
   is of an honourable use in this place--the people--for the peculiar
   people of God; the holy and elect nation, that had the law and the
   covenants of promise. This people, after they were delivered,' and that
   by so great and solemn a deliverance as that out of the land of Egypt,'
   were afterwards destroyed;' so that it is ill standing upon privileges.
   Though many of them to whom the apostle wrote had renounced Gentilism,
   and were (as it were) come out of Egypt, and made God's people by
   visible profession; yet, after all this, they might be destroyed in
   case of disproportionate practice or disobedience to God in that
   profession. Of Israel's destruction, see Num. xiv. 37; 1 Cor. x. 10.
   Libertine Christians shall share as bad as obstinate Jews, that is the
   drift of his argument.

   Obs. 1. From this clause observe, that after great mercies, there do
   usually follow great judgments, if great sins come between: as after
   their deliverance out of Egypt they were destroyed for unbelief. This
   may be proved from Christ's advice to the man cured on the Sabbath-day:
   John v. 14, Thou art made whole, sin no more, lest a worse thing come
   unto thee.' There is the mercy, the duty thence inferred, and the
   judgment that doth avenge the quarrel of the abused mercy. Often it
   cometh to pass that many men's preservation is but a reservation to a
   worse thing, to a greater judgment. So see Josh. xxiv. 20, He will turn
   again, and do you hurt, after he hath done you good.' So Isa. lxiii.
   10, He bore them (in the arms of his providence), but they rebelled and
   vexed his spirit, and he was turned to be their enemy.' None usually
   have greater judgments than such as formerly have had sweet experience
   of mercy. Why? There is no hatred so great as that which ariseth out of
   the corruption of love. Disappointed love, abused love groweth
   outrageous. When Amnon hated Tamar, it is said, The hatred wherewith he
   hated her was greater than the love wherewith he loved her.' As it is
   thus with men, such a proportionable severity we may observe in the
   dispensations of God after a taste of his mercies: Josh, xxiii. 15, It
   shall come to pass, as all good things are come upon you, which the
   Lord your God promised you, so the Lord shall bring all evil things
   upon you, until he hath destroyed you, when ye have transgressed the
   covenant of the Lord your God.' No evils like those evils which come
   after mercy. No sins are so great as those sins which are committed
   against mercies; there is not only filthiness in them, but unkindness:
   Ps. cvi. 7, They provoked him at the sea, even at the Red Sea.' Mark,
   it is ingeminated for the more vehemency, that at the sea, even at the
   Red Sea, where they had seen the miracles of the Lord, and had
   experience of his glorious deliverance, that there they durst break out
   against God. See the contrary in Judges ii. 7. Certainly the more
   restraints, the greater the offence, when we sin not only against the
   laws of God, but the loves of God, &c.

   Well, then--(1.) It informeth us that there may be danger after
   deliverance; there are strange changes in providence: Man in his best
   estate is altogether vanity,' Ps. xxxix. 5. When you are at your best,
   as the sun at the highest, there may be a declension.

   (2.) It is a warning to those that enjoy mercies: Sin no more, lest a
   worse thing come unto you.' The next judgment will be more violent.
   There are some special sins which you should beware of, even those
   which testify our unthankfulness after the receipt of mercies. As
   (1st.) forgetting the vows of our misery. Jacob voweth, Gen. xxviii.
   22, but he forgets his vow, and what followed? Horrible disorders and
   confusions in his family: Dinah deflowered, Reuben goeth into his
   father's bed, a murder committed upon the Shechemites under a pretence
   of religion, and then Jacob remembereth his vow. We promise much when
   we want deliverance, and when we have it, God is neglected; but he will
   not put it up so; by sad and disastrous accidents he puts us in mind of
   our old promises. (2d.) When you kiss your own hand, bless your drag,'
   ascribe it to your merit and power, Hab. i. 16, Deut. ix. 4, for these
   things are our mercies blasted. (3d.) When we grow proud,
   self-confident: if you were never so high, God will bring you low
   enough; it is a great skill to know how to abound.' She remembered not
   her last end, therefore she came down wonderfully,' Lam. i. 9. When we
   forget the changes and mutations to which all outward things are
   obnoxious, God will give us an experience of them. (4th.) When you
   continue in your sins, the judgment is but gone cum ammo revertendi, to
   come again in a worse manner. See Ps. cvi. 43.

   Obs. 2. The next observation is taken from the cause of their
   destruction, intimated in those words, that believed not. Many were the
   people's sins in the wilderness, murmuring, fornication, rebellion, &c.
   But the apostle comprehendeth all under this, they believed not.
   Unbelief is charged upon them as the root of all their miscarriages
   elsewhere, as Num. xiv. 11, and Deut. i. 32. Whence observe, that
   unbelief bringeth destruction, or is the cause of all the evil which we
   do or suffer.

   In handling this point, I shall open--(1.) The heinousness of unbelief;
   (2.) The nature of it; (3.) The cure of it.

   1. The heinousness of the sin. That we will consider in general, or
   more particularly. The general considerations are these:--

   [1.] No sin doth dishonour God so much as unbelief doth. It is an
   interpretative blasphemy, a calling into question of his mercy, power,
   justice, but especially of his truth: 1 John v. 10, He that believeth
   not God, hath made him a liar.' You judge him a person not fit to be
   credited. The giving of the lie is accounted the greatest injury and
   disgrace amongst men; for truth is the ground of commerce and human
   society. So that to say a man is a liar is as much as to say a man is
   unfit to keep company with men. But especially is this a great injury
   to God, because he standeth more upon his word than upon any other part
   of his name: Ps. cxxxviii. 2, He hath magnified his word above all his
   name.' We have more experience of God in making good his word than in
   any other thing. As faith honoureth God, so doth unbelief dishonour
   him. What God doth to the creature, that doth faith to God. God
   justifieth, sanctifieth, glorifieth the creature, and faith is said to
   justify God,' Luke vii. 29. To justify is to acquit from accusation. So
   doth faith acquit God's truth in the word from all the jealousies which
   the carnal world and our carnal hearts do cast upon him. Faith is said
   to sanctify God,' Num. xx. 12. To sanctify is to set apart from common
   use; and God is sanctified when we set God aloof, above all ordinary
   and common causes, and can believe that he will make good his word,
   when the course of all things seems to contradict it. Faith is said to
   glorify God.' Rom. iv. 20. We glorify him declaratively when we give
   him all that excellency which the word giveth him. Now, because
   unbelief accuseth God, limiteth him to the course of second causes, and
   denieth him his glory, therefore is it so heinous and hateful to God.

   [2.] It is a sin against which God hath declared most of his
   displeasure. Search the annals, survey all the monuments of time, see
   if ever God spared an unbeliever. Hence in the wilderness the apostle
   saith they were destroyed for unbelief. Many were their sins in the
   wilderness, murmurings, lustings, idolatry; but the main reason of
   their punishment was, they believed not,' Look to their final excision
   and cutting off. Why was it? Di apisti'as for unbelief were they broken
   off.' Rom. xi. 20; not so much for crucifying the Lord of life.' The
   gospel was tendered to them after Christ was slain. It was for not
   believing or refusing the gospel. If you will know what company there
   is in hell, that catalogue will inform you, Fearful, and unbelievers,'
   &c., Rev. xxi. 8. If you look to temporal judgments, that nobleman was
   trodden to death for distrusting God's power, 2 Kings viii. 2, and
   could only see the plenty, but not taste of it. Nay, it is such a sin
   as God hath not spared in his own children. Moses and Aaron could not
   enter into the land of promise because of their unbelief, Num. xx. 12.
   So Luke i. 20, Zacharias was struck dumb for not believing what God had
   revealed. Christ did never chide his disciples so much for anything as
   for their unbelief: Luke xxiv. 25, O ye fools, and slow of heart to
   believe;' and why doubt ye, O ye of little faith?' Mat. viii. 26. He
   chideth them before he chideth the wind. The storm first began in their
   own hearts.

   [3.] It is the mother of all sin. [109] The first sin was the fruit of
   unbelief. We may plainly observe a faltering of assent, Gen. iii. 3-5;
   and still it is the ground of all miscarriages, of hardness of heart,
   and apostasy, Heb. iii. 12, 13. He that believeth not the judgments and
   threatenings of the word will not stick to do any evil; and he that
   doth not believe the promises will not be forward to any good. All our
   neglect and coldness in holy duties cometh from the weakness of our
   faith. There is a decay at the root. Did we believe heaven and things
   to come, we should be more earnest and zealous. Many are ashamed of
   adultery, theft, murder, but not of unbelief, which is the mother of
   all these.

   [4.] Final unbelief is an undoubted evidence of reprobation. See John
   x. 26, Ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep;' and Acts xiii.
   48. Unbelief is God's prison, wherein he keepeth the reprobate world:
   Rom. xi. 32, He hath shut them up under unbelief,' &c. And shall I
   continue such a black note upon myself? I know not how soon God may cut
   me off; and if I die in this estate, I am miserable for ever: Lord, I
   desire to believe; help my unbelief.'

   [5.] It is a sin that depriveth us of much good, of the comforts of
   providence. Nothing doth ponere obicem, bar and shut out God's
   operation in order to our relief, so much as this sin: Mark vi. 5, He
   could do no mighty work,' &c. So John xi. 40, Said I not unto thee, if
   thou wouldst believe, thou shouldst see the glory of God?' So also of
   the comfort of ordinances: Heb. iv. 2, The word profited not, be cause
   it was not mixed with faith in them that heard it.' So for prayer,
   James i. 7-9. Nay, it barreth heaven's gates. It excluded Adam out of
   paradise, the Israelites out of Canaan, and us out of the kingdom of
   heaven, Heb. iii. 17, 18.

   Well, then, let us see if we be guilty of this sin: Take heed,' saith
   the apostle, Heb. iii. 12, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of
   unbelief.' Many have an unbelieving heart when they least think of it.
   It is easy to declaim against it, but hard to convince men of it,
   either of the sin or of lying in a state of unbelief; it is the
   Spirit's work, The Spirit shall convince of sin, because they believe
   not in me,' John xvi. 9. There are many pretences by which men excuse
   themselves, some more gross, others more subtle. Many think that all
   infidels are without the pale, among Turks and heathens. Alas! many,
   too many, are to be found in the very bosom of the church. The
   Israelites were God's own people, and yet destroyed because they
   believed not.' Others think none are unbelievers but those that are
   given up to the violences and horrors of despair, and do grossly reject
   or refuse the comforts of the gospel; but they are mistaken; the whole
   word is the object of faith, the commandments and threatenings as well
   as the promises; and carelessness and neglect of the comforts of the
   gospel is un belief, as well as doubts and despairing fears: Mat. xxii.
   5, But they made light of it.' He is the worst unbeliever that scorns
   and slighteth the tenders of God's grace in Christ as things wherein he
   is not concerned. Briefly, then, men may make a general profession of
   the name of Christ, as the Turks do of Mahomet, because it is the
   religion professed there where they are born; a man may take up the
   opinions of a Christian country, and not be a whit better than Turks,
   Jews, or infidels; as he is not the taller of stature that walketh in a
   higher walk than others do. They may understand their religion, and be
   able to give a reason of the hope that is in them,' and yet lie under
   the power of unbelief for all that, as many may see countries in a map
   which they never enter into. The devil hath knowledge, Jesus I know,
   and Paul I know,' &c. And those that pretend to knowledge without
   answer able practice, do but give themselves the lie, 1 John ii. 29.
   Besides knowledge there may be assent, and yet unbelief still. The
   devils assent as well as know; they believe there is one God,' James
   ii., and it is not a naked and inefficacious assent, but such as
   causeth horrors and tremblings. They believe and tremble;' and they do
   not only believe that one article, that there is one God, but other
   articles also: Jesus, thou Son of God, art thou come to torment me
   before my time?' was the devil's speech; where there is an
   acknowledging of Christ, and him as the Son of God and judge of the
   world, and increase of their torment at the last day upon his sentence.
   Assent is necessary, but not sufficient; laws are not sufficiently
   owned when they are believed to be the king's laws; there is something
   to be done as well as believed. In the primitive times, assent was more
   than it is now, and yet then an inactive assent was never allowed to
   pass for faith. Confident resting on Christ for salvation, if it be not
   a resting according to the word, will not serve the turn; there were
   some that leaned upon the Lord,' Micah iii. 11, whom he disclaimeth. It
   is a mistaken Christ they rest upon, and upon him by a mistaken faith.
   It is a mistaken Christ, for the true Christ is the eternal Son of God,
   that was born of a virgin, and died at Jerusalem, Bearing our sins in
   his body upon a tree, that we, being dead unto sin, might be alive unto
   righteousness,' 1 Peter ii. 24. The true Christ is one that gave
   himself for us, that he might purify us to be a peculiar people,
   zealous of good works,' and is now gone into heaven, there to make
   intercession for us, and will come again from heaven in a glorious
   manner to take an account of our works, Titus ii. 13, 14. But now when
   men lie under the power and reign of their sins, and yet pretend to
   rest upon Christ for salvation, they set up another Christ than the
   word holdeth forth. And as the Christ is mistaken, so is the faith. It
   is not an idle trust, but such as is effectual to purge the heart, for
   the true faith purifieth the heart,' Acts xv. 9. If, besides
   profession, knowledge, assent, and a loose trust, they should pretend
   to assurance, or to a strong conceit that Christ died for them, and
   they shall certainly go to heaven, this will not excuse them from
   unbelief; this is proton pseudos, the grand mistake, that the strength
   of faith lieth in a strong persuasion of the goodness of our condition,
   and the stronger the persuasion the better the faith. If this were
   true, hardness of heart would make the best faith, and he that could
   presume most, and be most secure and free from doubts, would be the
   truest believer, and the goodness of our condition would lie in the
   strength of our imagination and conceit. Alas! many make full account
   they shall go to heaven that shall never come there. The foolish
   virgins were very confident, and the foolish builder goeth on with the
   building, never suspecting the foundation. Nay, let me tell you,
   assurance of a good condition, as long as we lie under the power and
   reign of sin, is the greatest unbelief in the world, for it is to
   believe the flat contrary to that which God hath revealed in the word;
   therefore none abuse the Lord and question his truth so much as these
   do. Where hath God said that men that live in their sins shall be
   saved? Nay, he hath expressly said the contrary, Be not deceived;
   neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor idolaters,' &c., 1 Cor. vi. 9;
   so that you give God the lie, or conceit that he will break his word
   for your sakes; nay, in a sense, you even dare him to make good his
   truth. He hath said, Be not deceived; you shall never enter,' &c., and
   you say, Though I am an adulterer, a drunkard, a worldling, I shall go
   to heaven for all that. Now in a little while you shall see whose word
   shall stand, God's or yours, Jer. xliv. 28.

   Once more, the word is not supposed to be without all kind of power.
   Men may have some relish of good things,' and some experience of the
   powers of the world to come,' and yet be in an un believing state: see
   Heb. vi. 5, where the apostle speaketh of a common work, opposed to ta`
   echo'mena tes soteri'as, to things that do accompany salvation,' ver 9,
   or have salvation necessarily annexed to them. They may have some
   feeling of the power of the truth, and yet afterwards make defection,
   out of a love to the world and worldly things; they may have many
   spiritual gifts, change their outward conversation, make a glorious
   profession, and be thereupon enrolled among the saints; yea, be of
   great use and service in the church, though for their own ends and
   interests, remaining all this while unrenewed, and having their worldly
   inclinations to honour, esteem, pleasure, profit, unbroken and
   unmortified; for there is no such enemy to faith as a carnal, worldly
   heart. Therefore let men pretend what they will, when they are as eager
   upon the world as if they had no other matters to mind, and the love of
   outward greatness doth sway with them more than the love of heaven, and
   the praise of men more than the approbation of God, and carnal ease and
   pleasure more than delight in God, how can they be said to believe?
   John v. 44; for such kind of lusts and earthly affections are
   inconsistent with the power and vigour of saving faith; therefore till
   the bent of the heart be towards heavenly things, and carnal affections
   be soundly mortified, unbelief reigneth. I pitch it upon this evidence,
   partly because the great drift of conversion is to draw off the soul,
   as from self to Christ, and from sin to holiness, so from the world to
   heaven. See 1 Peter i. 3, Begotten to a lively hope;' and 1 John v. 4,
   He that is born of God overcometh the world;' as soon as we are
   converted, the heart is drawn and set towards heavenly things; partly
   because the main thing to be believed, next to God's being, is his
   bounty, Heb. xi. 6, that we may make God our rewarder; and partly
   because the main work of faith is to draw off the soul from sensible
   things to things unseen,' and to come, Heb. xi. 1; so that whatsoever
   glorious profession men make, or whatsoever service they perform in the
   church, or whatsoever experience they have in the enlargement of gifts,
   yet if they be careless of things to come, and eager after the things
   of the world, faith is not thoroughly planted; for a main thing wanting
   in these temporaries was a resolution to serve God for God's sake, or
   to make him their paymaster, which can never be till carnal
   inclinations to the honours, pleasures, and profits of the world be
   subdued, and we are willing to lay down all these things at Christ's
   feet, taking only so much as he shall fairly allow us for our use.

   Thus much for the heinousness of unbelief in the general.

   Secondly, Let me tell you that all unbelief is not alike heinous, as
   will appear by these considerations.

   [1.] Total reigning unbelief is a black mark; such as lie under it are
   in the high way to hell: John iii. 18, He that believeth not is
   condemned already;' the law hath condemned him, and whilst he remaineth
   in that estate, the gospel yieldeth him no hope: John iii. 36, The
   wrath of God abideth on him;' and if he die in it, he is miserable for
   ever. Rev. xxi. 8, Fearful and unbelievers are reckoned among the
   inhabitants of hell. First he is condemned by that ancient sentence,
   that whosoever sinneth shall die;' which is not reversed, but standeth
   in full force till faith in Christ: John viii. 24, If ye believe not
   that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.' And if we continue refusing
   the counsels of the gospel, to the condemnation that is already, to the
   condemnation of the law, there is added a new condemnation for
   despising the gospel. But now partial unbelief, where faith prevaileth,
   though there be many doubts and fears, leaveth a man obnoxious to
   temporal judgments, but not to eternal ruin.

   [2.] All unbelief is the more heinous the more means you have to the
   contrary, as counsels, warnings, promises clearly held forth: see John
   xv. 22, If I had not spoken to them,' &c., and John iii. 19, Light is
   come into the world,' &c. The word is preached eis martu'rion, for a
   witness, Mat. xxiv. 14, with Mark xiii. 9; first to them, and if not
   received, then against them. Did not I warn you?' saith Reuben to his
   brethren. Every offer and warning will be as so many swords in your
   consciences. One observeth well, [110] that twice Christ marvelled,
   once at the unbelief of his countrymen the Galileans, that had so much
   means, Mark vi. 8, and another time at the faith of the centurion, a
   stranger, Mat. viii. 10, who had so little means. It is a thing to be
   marvelled at, that a people should have so much means and profit but
   little. Wonder is a thing that proceedeth from ignorance, and Christ,
   though not ignorant, yet would express all human affections; and the
   rather that we might look upon it as a strange and uncomely thing not
   to believe after so many helps vouchsafed to us.

   [3.] The more experiences, comforts, evidences, and manifestations of
   God's power and presence we have had, the greater the unbelief. This
   was that which provoked the Lord against Israel to destroy them in the
   wilderness: Num. xiv. 11, How long will it be ere ye believe in me, for
   all the signs that I have showed?' God traineth up his people by
   experience, that they may know what he can or will do for them; and
   therefore by every experience we should grow up into a greater courage
   and strength of faith, and as David, draw inferences of hope against
   the present danger from the lion and the bear, 1 Sam. xvii. 36, or as
   Paul, he hath, and doth, and therefore will, 2 Cor. i. 10, other wise
   these experiences are given in vain. Christ was angry with his
   disciples for not remembering the miracle of the loaves, Mat. xvi. 9,
   when they were in a like strait again. When we show a child a letter
   here, and the same letter again in another word, and the same again in
   a third, if he should be to seek when we show him again the same letter
   in the next word, we are angry, and think our teaching lost. So when
   God giveth an evidence of his power and care in this strait, and, in a
   condescension to our weakness, giveth us a like evidence again, and in
   a third strait he teacheth us how to read and apply a promise, and yet
   upon the next difficulty we are to seek again, God is angry with us,
   because his condescensions are lost. And in this sense God is more
   angry with the unbelief of his children than of others, because they
   have more experiences, and are so ready to distrust him that never
   failed them.

   [4.] The more deliberate our unbelief is, the worse. In times of
   inconsiderate passion, and in a fit of temptation, it may break out
   from God's children. David, when he spake in haste, was fain to eat his
   words: Ps. cxvi. 11, I said in my haste all men are liars;' Samuel, and
   all who had told him of the kingdom; I shall never live to see the
   promise fulfilled: so Ps. xxxi. 22, I said in my haste, I am cut off;
   nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications,' In a fit,
   discontent may break out, but it is presently opposed and checked; but
   when it groweth into a settled distemper, then it is worse: as that in
   Ps. lxxiii. was a more lasting temptation; therefore David calleth
   himself beast, ver. 22, for his foolish and brutish thoughts of
   providence.

   [5.] Where unbelief is expressed and put into words, there it is more
   heinous. Unbelieving thoughts are a great evil, but when they break out
   into murmurings and bold expostulations, with or against God, then they
   are worse. It is better to keep the temptation within doors, that, if
   the fire be kindled, the sparks may not fly abroad to enkindle others;
   you grieve God by your thoughts, but you dishonour and disparage him
   when they break out into words: Mal. iii. 13, Your words have been
   stout against me, saith the Lord.' It is a greater daring to avow
   openly and publish our suspicions of God, and discontents against him:
   Deut. i. 34, The Lord heard the voice of your words, and was wroth,
   saying, Not one of these shall enter my rest.' Others may be perverted,
   and make ill use of our infirmities.

   [6.] Where there are professions to the contrary, there the unbelief is
   the worse: After these things do the Gentiles seek,' Mat. vi. 32.
   Christians are not only instructed to do better, but profess to do
   other wise. Distrust is a pagan sin; you are acquainted with a
   particular providence, with a heavenly Father, with the happiness of
   another world, and for you to be worldly, distrustful, to make it your
   business what you shall eat and drink, that is a most unworthy thing:
   for a professed infidel that believeth not eternity, that never heard
   of God's fatherly care, nor of heaven or hell, to be altogether in the
   world, this were no such marvel; but for you, that profess to believe
   the gospel, to have your hearts fail and sink upon every occasion, and
   to be under the tyranny of distracting cares, how sad is it!

   Thus much for the heinousness of unbelief, which I was willing to
   represent thus at large, that you might see what just reason there was
   that God should destroy those in the wilderness that believed not.

   2. The next thing is to open the nature of it. I shall here give--(1.)
   The kinds; (2.) The notes whereby this sin may be discovered.

   For the kinds of it, unbelief is twofold--negative and positive.

   1. Negative unbelief is found in those to whom the sound of the gospel
   never came, or to whom God hath denied the means whereby faith might be
   wrought in them. The want of means is not their sin, but their
   punishment, or misery at least; and therefore they are not condemned so
   much for want of faith in Christ, as for not obeying the law of nature,
   for sinning against that knowledge which they received in Adam. Now
   they never received the light of the gospel in Adam, neither had Adam
   the knowledge thereof revealed to him, but by special grace after the
   fall when he stood in the quality of a private person, then was the
   promise of the woman's seed revealed to him. Therefore they that never
   heard of Christ are not condemned simply for not believing in him; for
   their sins against the law they are condemned, not for their unbelief
   against the gospel. [111] That is the reason why Christ, when he had
   said, John iii. 18, Every one that believeth not is condemned already,'
   presently addeth by way of explication, This is the condemnation, that
   light is come into the world,' &c., as restraining it to positive
   infidelity. Though without Christ they can never be saved, yet God will
   not damn them for this reason, for not believing in Christ, for he
   never gave them the means of the knowledge of Christ.

   2. Positive unbelief, which is found in them that have means to believe
   in Christ, and yet neglect and refuse him, and the offers of grace and
   life in him, and so continue in the state of nature. This is
   twofold--(1.) Total; (2.) Partial.

   [1.] Total unbelief in those that continue professed infidels after the
   tenders of the gospel; as the word where it came found different
   success, as at Antioch, Acts xiii. 48; at Iconium, Acts xiv. 1, 2; at
   Athens, Acts xvii. 34, many refused to make any profession.

   [2.] Partial, when men are lustred with some general profession, and
   gained to some owning of Christ, but do not fully believe in him, not
   cordially embrace him; either through the weakness of their assent,
   looking upon the gospel only as probable, or out of the strength of
   their worldly and carnal affections they relish not and esteem not the
   counsels and comforts of the gospel, not the comforts and hopes of the
   gospel, because they are matters of another world, and lie out of sight
   and reach; but worldly comforts act more forcibly upon them, as being
   more suited to their hearts, and at hand, and ready to be enjoyed. Thus
   Israel out of unbelief despised the pleasant land,' Ps. cvi. 24,
   counted it not worth the looking after; and the counsels of the gospel
   they refuse out of an indulgence to fleshly lusts. As there is in the
   gospel the history and doctrine of salvation, so there are counsels of
   salvation which must be obeyed, and therefore we hear of obeying the
   gospel,' 2 Thes. i. 8, and the obedience of faith' elsewhere.

   This unbelief is again twofold--(1.) Reigning; (2.) In part broken,
   though not wholly subdued.

   [1st.] Reigning unbelief is in all natural men, who are not only guilty
   of unbelief, but described by the term unbelievers, as being persons
   never thoroughly gained to the obedience of the gospel, or the
   acceptance of Christ, and life and peace in him. It bewrayeth
   itself--(1.) By hardness of heart; they are not moved nor affected with
   their own misery, nor with redemption by Christ, and the great things
   of eternity depending thereupon; nor the invitations of grace, calling
   them to the enjoyment of them: Acts xix. 9, And divers were hardened,
   and believed not,' &c. A hard heart is one of the devil's impregnable
   forts, not easily attacked by the force and power of the word: men are
   born with a hard heart; we bring the stone with us into the world, and
   by positive unbelief, or by slighting offers of grace made to us, it
   increaseth upon us. Hardness of heart is known by the foolishness of
   it, when Seeing we see not, and hearing we hear not,' Acts xxviii. 26,
   27, when we have a grammatical knowledge of things, but no spiritual
   discerning. It is also known by the insensibleness of it, when men have
   no feelings of terrors by the law, of peace, joy, and hope by the
   gospel; no taste of the good word at all, but are as stones unmoved
   with all that is spoken. (2.) By a neglect of spiritual and heavenly
   things; they do not make it their business and work to look after those
   things, Mat. xxii. 5, But they made light of it, [112] and went one to
   his farm, another to his merchandise.' Your callings are not your
   e'rgon, your work and main business; that is to look after an interest
   in Christ; therefore when this is the least thought of, and the farm
   and the merchandise engrosseth all our time and care, men believe not.
   Could they slight Christ and holy things if they did soundly and
   thoroughly believe the word of God? Would they not find some time to
   mend their souls? Looking after the inward man, that is the main care;
   and men would first regard it if they did believe that the soul were so
   concerned both in point of danger and hope. Surely when men take no
   heed to the great offers of the gospel, they do not look upon it as a
   certain truth. (3.) By secret suspicions in their own souls against the
   truth of the gospel. That profane wretch said Haec fabula Cliristi.
   They look upon it as a golden dream to make fools fond with it; and
   that all opinions in religion are but a logomachy, a mere strife of
   words, or a doctrine to set the world together by the ears, as Gallic,
   Acts xviii. 15, or a fancy and fond superstition, Acts xxv. 19, and
   that we need not trouble our heads about it. These are the natural
   thoughts which men have of the gospel. Such thoughts may rush into the
   heart of a godly man, but they are abominated and cast out with
   indignation; but in wicked men they reign and dwell; they live by these
   kind of principles. I remember Christ saith of his disciples, aleuos
   e'gnosan, John xvii. 8, They have known surely that I came out from
   thee.' The light of faith is an undoubted certain light; but in wicked
   men, their assent is mingled with doubting, ignorance, error, and
   sottish prejudices against the doctrine and worship of God, Mat. iii.
   14; natural atheism in them is not cured, and that faith which they
   pretend to and profess is but a loose wavering opinion, not a grounded
   and settled persuasion of the truth of the gospel. The assurance of
   understanding,' as the apostle calleth it, Col. ii. 2, dependeth upon
   experience and an inward sense of the truth, and is wrought by the Holy
   Ghost, 1 Cor. ii. 4, and therefore, I suppose, proper to the godly.
   (4.) By rejecting the counsels of salvation; see Acts xiii. 46; Luke
   vii. 31. All natural men are children of disobedience,' Eph. ii. 2, out
   of pride scorning either the messages of God--Folly to him,' 1 Cor. ii.
   14, or the messengers--Is not this the carpenter's son?' Mark vi. 3,
   foining and fencing with the word, and defeating the methods of grace
   used to gain them, Rom. x. 21, guilty of an obstinate frowardness: It
   is a people that do err in their hearts,' Ps. xcv. 11; not in their
   minds only, but their hearts;' as if they did say, We desire not the
   knowledge of thy ways,' Job xxi. 14. (5.) By the unholiness of their
   lives. The apostle saith, 2 Peter iii. 11, We that look for such
   things, what manner of persons ought we to be in all holiness and
   godliness of conversation?' from whence we may plainly infer that they
   which are not such manner of persons do not look for such things as
   faith inferreth--obedience; where the prince is there his train will
   be; so is unbelief known by disobedience; when men live as carnally and
   carelessly as an infidel, there is not a pin to choose between them.
   (6.) When men hear the word and never make application, or convert it
   to their own use, it is a sign they are under the power of reigning
   unbelief. In faith there is assent or believing the word to be the word
   of God, or that it is a faithful saying,' 1 Tim. i. 15; and then
   consent or approbation of the word as a good word or worthy saying, and
   then application, or converting the word to our own use. So in unbelief
   many doubt of the truth of the word, others acknowledge not the worth
   of it, they do not glorify the word,' Acts xiii. 48; most that speak
   well of the word, and approve it in their consciences, do not urge
   their own hearts with it: What do we say to these things?' Rom. viii.
   31, and know it for thy good,' Job v. 27. The word is far sooner
   approved than applied, and yet till it be applied it worketh not. When
   we see ourselves involved and included in the general promise and
   precept, and are accordingly affected, then are we said to believe. In
   Ps. xxvii. 8, the injunction is plural, Seek ye my face;' but the
   answer is singular, Thy face, Lord, will I seek.' Thus must all truths
   be applied, and that in their method and order, for there is an analogy
   and proportion between them; as the doctrine of man's misery, that I
   may consider this is my case, and, having a feeling of it, may groan
   for deliverance; the doctrine of redemption by Christ, that we may put
   in for a share, and assure our own interest; the doctrine of the
   thankful life, that we may deny ourselves, take up our cross, and
   follow Christ in the obedience of all his precepts. The first doctrine
   must be made the ground of complaint, the second of comfort and hope,
   the third of resolution and practice. But when we suffer these truths
   to hover in the brain without application, or hear them only as
   children learn them by rote, never thus reflecting, What am I? what
   have I done? what will become of me? &c., unbelief remaineth
   undisturbed. (7.) By apostasy or falling off from God. The great
   business of faith is, by patient continuance in well-doing, to look for
   glory, honour, and immortality,' Rom. ii. 8; but now to tire and grow
   weary, or to fall off from God as not worthy the waiting upon, argueth
   the height and reign of unbelief, whatever faith we pretended unto for
   a flash and pang. (8.) Desperation when conviction groweth to a height,
   and legal bondage gets the victory of carnal pleasure: Gen. iv. 13, My
   sin is greater,' &c., and Jer. xviii. 12, There is no hope,' &c. When
   men think it is in vain to trouble themselves, their damnation is
   fixed, and therefore resolve to go to hell as fast as they can; such
   desperate wickedness may there be in the heart of a man.

   [2d.] Unbelief in part broken; and so it implieth the remainders of
   this natural evil in the godly, in whom, though faith be begun, yet it
   is mixed with much weakness: Mark ix. 24, Lord, I believe; help my
   unbelief.' This unbelief is manifested--(1.) By a loathness to apply
   the comforts of the gospel; it is the hardest matter in the world to
   bring God and the soul together, or to be at rest in Christ. When we
   are truly sensible we draw back. Depart from me,' saith Peter, for I am
   a sinful man,' Luke v. 8; and he should rather say, Draw nigh to me.
   The poor trembling sinner thinketh so much of the judge that he for
   gets the father. Though the soul longeth for Christ above all things,
   yet it is loath to take him for comfort and reconciliation, but
   floateth up and down in a suspensive hesitancy. (2.) By calling God's
   love into question upon every affliction, and in an hour of temptation
   unravelling all our hopes: see Ps. lxxvii. 7-10, Isa. xlix. 14, and
   Judges vi. 13; as if the Lord were the God of the mountains and not of
   the valleys.' We are wont to say, If God did love us why is this
   befallen us? Those are fits of the old distemper. Christ when crucified
   would not let go his interest, but crieth out, My God! my God!' (3.) By
   fears in a time of danger, carnal fears, such as do perplex us when we
   are employed in Christ's work and service; as the disciples that were
   embarked with him were afraid to perish in his company: Why are ye so
   fearful, O ye of little faith?' Mat. viii. 26. Filial fear or reverence
   of God is the daughter of faith, as distrustful fear is the enemy of
   it. Trouble is the touchstone of faith; if we cannot commit ourselves
   to God in quietness of heart, it argueth weakness. God hath undertaken
   to bring his people out of every strait, in a way most conducing to his
   glory and their welfare, Rom. viii. 28; and therefore when the word
   yieldeth us no support, Ps. cxix. 50, and the promises of God cannot
   keep us from sinking and despondency of heart, we bewray our unbelief.
   (4.) By murmurings in case of carnal disappointment. Discontent argueth
   unbelief; they quarrel with God's providences, because they believe not
   his promises: Ps. cvi. 24, They believed not his word, but murmured in
   their tents;' it is ill, and they cannot see how it can be better. So
   Deut. i. 32 with 34, In this you believed not the Lord your God.' (5.)
   By carking in case of straits; bodily wants are more pressing than
   spiritual. Here faith is put to a present trial, and therefore here we
   bewray ourselves: Mat. vi. 30, Shall he not much more clothe you, O ye
   of little faith?' He doth not say of no faith, for the temptation is
   incident to a godly man; they do not oftener bewray their unbelief in
   distrusting God about outward supplies than about eternal life, which
   yet I confess is very irrational; for if a man cannot trust God with
   his estate, how shall he trust him with his soul? And to a considerate
   person there are far more prejudices against eternal life than against
   temporal supplies. Look, as it was a folly in Martha to believe that
   Lazarus should rise at the general resurrection, and to distrust his
   being raised from the dead after four days' lying in the grave, John
   xi. 24, so it is a great folly to pretend to expect eternal life, and
   not to be able to depend upon God for the supplies of life temporal.
   (6.) By coldness and carelessness in the spiritual life. If men did
   believe that heaven were such an excellent place, they would not so
   easily turn aside to the contentments of the flesh and the profits of
   the world. Men have but a conjectural apprehension of things to come,
   of the comforts of another world. As things at a distance; sometimes we
   see them, and sometimes we lose their sight, so that we are not certain
   whether we see them, yea or no; so it falleth out in heavenly matters;
   we are poor short-sighted' creatures, 2 Peter i. 9. Sometimes we have a
   glimpse of the glory of the world to come, some flashes, and again the
   mind is beclouded; and that is the reason why we mind these things so
   little, and seek after them so little. A steady view and sound belief
   would engage us to more earnestness: they that believe the high prize
   of our calling,' will press on to the mark,' Phil. iii. 14. Surely men
   do not believe that heaven is worth the looking after, otherwise they
   would seek it more diligently, Heb. vi. 14. A poor beast that is going
   homeward goeth cheerfully. (7.) Indirect courses to get a living and
   subsistence in the world, as if God were not all-sufficient,' Gen.
   xvii. 1. To break through where God hath made up the hedge, argueth
   that we do not depend upon him; as by temporising or by unjust gain.
   This, for a fit and in some distemper, may be incident to God's
   children.

   3. The last thing in the method proposed is the cure of unbelief. God
   by his mighty power can only cure it, Eph. i. 19; but the means which
   we must use may be reduced to two heads--1. Cautions; 2. Directions.

   [1.] Cautions. (1.) Take heed of setting God a task: Ps. lxxviii. 19,
   20, Can the Lord prepare a table in the wilderness?' &c. So Mat. xxvii.
   40, If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.' This is to go
   beyond the promise, and to indent with God upon conditions of our own
   making. So Mat. iv., If thou be the Son of God, turn these stones into
   bread.' So when we prescribe to God, in matter of allowance; we would
   have God maintain us at such a rate; be so fed, so clothed, have so
   much by the year, such portions for our children: He that will be
   rich,' &c., 1 Tim. vi. 9. God never undertook to give us meat for our
   lusts. When we subject his providence to our direction, and prescribe
   what he shall do for our satisfaction, we do but make a snare for
   ourselves. (2.) Take heed of betraying faith by distrusting present
   means; it is a usual thing: Luke xvi. 30, If one came from the dead
   they would believe.' If we had oracles or miracles, or God did speak to
   us from heaven as heretofore, then we should not falter in our trust as
   we now do; but by this excuse you impeach the scriptures. Moses and the
   prophets are a sufficient ground for faith, and extraordinary means
   will not work on them upon whom ordinary do not prevail. There were
   weaknesses then, and so there will be; whatsoever dispensation God may
   use, man is man still: They believed not though he opened the clouds,
   and commanded manna from heaven,' Ps. lxxviii. 23. (3.) Take heed of
   ifs in principles of faith. Foundation-stones if laid loose endanger
   the whole building; take notice of the first hesitancy: Gen. iii., Yea,
   hath God said?' So Mat. iv. 3, If thou be the Son of God,' &c. There
   was a plain oracle from heaven determining it a little before, Thou art
   my beloved Son,' but the devil would fain draw it to an if. (4.) Beware
   of sin. Doubts are the fumes of sin, like the vapours that come from a
   foul stomach: uprightness begetteth serenity and clearness. As in
   nature there is often a kukloge'nnesis, a circular generation, vapours
   beget showers, and showers beget vapours; so in moral and spiritual
   things there is such a circular generation; unbelief maketh way for
   sin, and sin for unbelief. Sin will weaken trust, it cannot be
   otherwise; shame, and horror, and doubt, these are the consequences of
   sin. God never undertook to bear us out in the devil's work.

   [2.] Directions. (1.) Strengthen your assent to the word of God. Fire
   if well kindled will of itself burst out into a flame; so assurance and
   comfort would more easily follow if there were a thorough and un
   doubted assent to the truths of the word. We take them up hand over
   head, and then when a temptation cometh, no wonder that the building
   tottereth when the foundation is so weak. There are several degrees of
   assent: conjecture, which is but a lighter inclination of the mind to
   that which is probable; opinion, which is a stronger inclination to
   think that which is represented is true. But there is formido oppositi;
   it is mixed with hesitancy and doubts, oligopisti'a, weak faith, or
   firm adherence upon sufficient conviction; yet doubts may arise, and in
   time of temptation this degree of assent may be over borne. But above
   this there is a thorough certainty or assurance of understanding,' Col.
   ii. 2. We should never cease till we come to this. It is a great
   mistake to think that we need not look after the settling of our assent
   to the truths of the word, but take these for supposed; but in an hour
   of temptation we are made sensible of our folly herein; and if I am not
   mistaken, much of our carelessness and unsettledness of life doth
   proceed from thence. (2.) In settling assent, begin with natural
   principles, and then go on to those which are spiritual and
   mystical,--as God's being, and God's bounty in the everlasting rewards,
   Heb. xi. 6; the necessity of purity and holiness, Heb. xii. 14; the
   fall and misery of the creature; and then our redemption by Christ, &c.
   1 observe the apostles, when they came to gain men to faith, began with
   truths suited to their capacity and present understanding. With the
   vulgar they evince creation and providence, by arguments taken from
   showers of rain and the courses of nature, Acts xiv. 16, 17. With the
   philosophers they urge the notions of a first cause and a first mover,
   and those inclinations in nature towards an eternal good, Acts xvii.
   (3.) Urge your hearts with the truths you assent to, and work them upon
   your affections, Rom. viii. 31; Heb. ii. 3; and Job v. 27. (4.) Observe
   the disproportion of your respects to things present and things to
   come. If the judgment-seat were fixed and the books opened, how would
   natural men tremble? Now faith should make it as present, Heb. xi. 1.
   The apostle saith, I saw the dead, small and great, stand before the
   Lord,' &c., Rev. xx. 12. Faith, which is the evidence of things not
   seen,' should see it as if it were in being. The light of faith
   differeth not from the light of prophecy in regard of the certainty of
   the thing which is to come, or the assured expectation of it. The light
   of prophecy requireth a special revelation, and differeth in degree
   from the light or sight of faith, as it causeth rapture and ecstatic
   motions; but as to the seeing of things to come with certainty, there
   they agree. Well, then, if you would discern the strength or weakness
   of your faith, observe how differently you are affected with what is
   present and what is future; so also how differently you are affected
   with things visible and things invisible, with things temporal and
   eternal. If upon easy terms you might have a good bargain for lands and
   riches, how readily would men embrace the offer? For temporal profit
   what pains will they take? But now in things of soul concernment we are
   not alike affected, which is an argument we do not believe them. In all
   cases it is good to put spiritual things in a parallel with temporal
   instances. We are taught that wisdom: Mal. i. 8, Offer it now to the
   governor,' &c. Would we do thus to an earthly potentate as we do to
   God? If an able potent friend promise help in troubles, how are we
   cheered with it? If God promise the same things we are little
   comforted. If every offence that we commit were liable to the notice of
   man, and our punishment should be to hold our hand in scalding lead for
   half an hour, men would be more afraid to offend than now they are in
   the sight of God, who knoweth all their thoughts, and hath threatened
   eternal torment. If the tasting of such a meat would bring present
   death, who would be so foolhardy as to meddle with it? Nay, when a
   thing is but likely to do us hurt, as some meats in case of the cholic,
   gout, or stone, how cautious are we? To conclude all, let me give you
   Chrysostom's supposition; for besides unbelief, there is somewhat in
   the strength of evil inclination. Suppose a man mightily desirous of
   rest and sleep, so that he can hardly hold open his eyes, and there
   were an offer made him of free and undisturbed rest for one night, but
   in case he gave way to it, to be held under a hundred years' torment,
   would he venture, and, with so great a hazard, gratify his drowsy
   humour? Yet such is our fearlessness and security, that we can run the
   hazard of eternal torment for a little carnal satisfaction. If a man
   were sentenced to death, and in danger of execution every moment, would
   not he bestir himself and improve all his interest for a pardon? We are
   all condemned already;' but how few are solicitous to get a copy of
   their discharge! (5.) Bewail the relics of unbelief, Mark ix. 24. (6.)
   Chide your hearts for your dejection and distrust of God's providence;
   as Ps. xlii. 5, Why art thou so disquieted, O my soul,' &c., and Ps.
   lxxvii. 10, This is my infirmity.' It is the duty of a gracious man to
   rebuke his fears, to chide himself for admitting mistakes of God's
   love, suggestions of unbelief, and disputes against the promises. (7.)
   Consider how willing Christ is to help you. He carrieth home the stray
   lamb upon his own. shoulders rejoicing, Luke xv. 5. How he prizeth the
   weak beginnings of faith! Smoking flax will he not quench,' Mat. xii.
   20; taketh notice of the green figs, Cant. ii.; with a mild
   condescension indulgeth our infirmities: Reach hither thy fingers,
   Thomas,' John xx. This for the cure of unbelief.

   Ver. 6. And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left
   their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains, under
   darkness, unto the judgment of the great day.

   In this verse you have the second instance, from the apostate angels,
   who, notwithstanding the dignity and height of their nature, upon their
   rebellion were left to a dreadful punishment. In this instance there is
   an argument not a pari (as in the former verse), but a majore ad minus,
   not from a like case, but from the greater to the lesser; for if God
   spared not such creatures as by the grace of creation were advanced to
   such an excellency of being, certainly he will not spare us, whatever
   gospel privileges we have, if we walk unsuitably.

   In these words observe:--(1.) The sin of the angels, they kept not
   their first estate. (2.) Their punishment, which is twofold:--

   1. Present and felt.

   2. Future and decreed.

   1. Present, which is also double:--(1.) Poena damni, their loss, they
   left their own habitation. (2.) Poena sensûs, their punishment of pain
   or sense, he hath reserved in everlasting chains, under darkness.

   2. Future and decreed, unto the judgment of the great day.

   Because I will not perplex the discourse by grasping at too much at one
   time, I shall discuss each circumstance apart, and in distinct
   explication. I begin with the phrases implying their sin and fall. And
   the angels: the expression is plural, to note the great number of those
   which fell. Their first estate, te'n arche`n: the word may be
   translated either their principality or their beginning, and, which is
   all one, first estate. If you translate it principality, it will well
   enough suit with the scope of the apostle; and the angels are often
   called principalities' in scripture, because of their great power and
   excellent nature: so Col. i. 16, Thrones, dominions, principalities,
   and powers;' all which terms imply the dignity of the angelical nature;
   nay, the devils themselves, because of that power and cunning which
   they still retain, are called principalities:' Eph. vi. 12, We wrestle
   not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers,
   against the rulers of the darkness of this world.' If you translate it
   beginning or first estate, it will more fully express the misery and
   fall of the apostate angels, they being not only departed from the
   excellency and power, but from the integrity and righteousness wherein
   they were first created. So that the point is, that the angels are
   fallen from the condition of their original excellency and integrity.

   So Peter, 2 Peter ii. 4, ange'lon amartesa'nton, God spared not the
   angels that sinned,' &c.; and John viii. 44, The devil abode not in the
   truth, because there is no truth in him.' That purity and integrity
   wherein they were created is there called truth,' because truth is the
   perfection of any rational creature, and that holiness which they had
   was only to be kept up by the truth or right notions of God. In opening
   this point I shall inquire:--

   1. What was this arche', or first estate.

   2. What was their sin, or how they departed from it

   3. How they came to sin.

   4. The number of them that fell.

   5. The time.

   1. I do confess the scriptures do speak somewhat sparingly of the
   nature or fall of angels, it being calculated chiefly for the use of
   man; but some hints there are which we shall take notice of and
   improve, not to satisfy curiosity, but to serve profit. What then is
   this first estate from which they are departed? I answer--Their
   original condition of holiness and happiness. Every creature which the
   Lord made, he saw it to be good; much more the angels, whom God created
   for his own train and company; they are called the sons of God,' Job
   xxxviii. 7, because they bore his image, and that in a more eminent
   degree than man, as being wholly spiritual substances, just, holy,
   pure, in all qualities representing God their father. It is said of
   man, thou hast made him a little lower than the angels,' Ps. viii. 5.
   When man was at his best there was an inferiority, the image of God was
   given to us in a less degree; although we were placed above all visible
   creatures, yet than the angels we were a little lower. That they were
   excellent appeareth in that the angelical obedience is made the pattern
   of ours, Mat. vi. 10; and our happiness in heaven is expressed by the
   condition of their nature: Mat. xxii. 30, They are as the angels of God
   in heaven;' yea, it is notable that when the scriptures would express
   any excellency, they use to say it is fit for angels Thus manna is
   called angels' food,' Ps. lxxviii. 25, not as if they needed food,
   spirits are not capable of corporal refreshments; but if so high a
   creature should need food, he could have no better. So the tongue of
   angels,' 1 Cor. xiii. 1; that is, with a tongue becoming creatures of
   so perfect an understanding. But you will say, These expressions are
   meant of the good angels. I answer--That at their first creation they
   had the same common nature and excellency, as appeareth by the name of
   thrones, dominions, and powers,' which they yet retain in common with
   the good angels; yea, and by that power, wisdom, and knowledge which is
   yet left. In their innocency they were alike good and alike happy, and
   could contemplate and behold God, and embrace him with delight as
   others did; all that is supernatural in the good angel is the grace of
   confirmation, by which they abide in the knowledge and love of God,
   whereas others left te'n arche`n, their first estate,' and it is
   probable this grace was given to the good angels in the very moment of
   their creation, before any merit of theirs or use of their natural
   abilities, as appeareth by the others' sudden fall, and because they
   are chosen in Christ, who is the head of men and angels, Col. i. 16.

   2. What was their sin? There is a great deal of difference among
   divines about it; for herein they proceed by guess and conjecture
   rather than any certain proof. Howbeit, there is enough to vindicate
   God's justice against them. Quaevis peccata, saith Aquinas, sunt in
   malis angelis. According to his opinion, they have the guilt of all sin
   upon them, as tempting man to every sin; but what was the special
   formal sin is not so easily determined. Some say, affectation of the
   divinity; others say, flat rebellion against the law of their creation,
   or rash attempts against the empire and sovereignty of God; others
   envy, be cause of the human nature exalted above the angelical in
   Christ, he took not the nature of angels,' Heb. ii. 16. But whether
   that mystery were made known to them is uncertain; rather there are
   probabilities to the contrary; for the good angels know it now by God's
   dispensations to the church, Eph. iii. 10. Others think rebellion
   against a particular law given to them, as that concerning eating the
   forbidden fruit was to man. Whether it were affecting a higher degree
   above their creation, or refusing their office and ministration about
   man, or confidence in their own gifts and received excellency, in a
   matter of so great uncertainty it is hard to determine. To state their
   sin, take these propositions:--(1.) The law which made their act to be
   sin was the moral law, as being the copy of God's holiness, his
   revealed will to all rational creatures; and they are said to sin, 2
   Peter ii. 4, and amarti'a, sin, is anomi'a, a transgression of a law,'
   1 John iii. 4; and of no other law do we read but of the moral law,
   which (as is probable) was given to the angels, excepting only such
   things as are not suitable to a spiritual nature, the commandment
   concerning adultery or unlawful propagation, for they neither marry nor
   give in marriage,' Mat. xxii. 30, a thing proper to the bodily life.
   (2.) The most likely thing in their sin was pride; there is pride in
   every sin, namely, a despising and contempt of the commandment; and
   this is a sin agreeable enough to a spiritual nature, as adultery,
   drunkenness, and such sins are proper to a corporeal and sensitive
   nature: uperephani'a (saith Chrysostom) du'nameis asomatous kate'stase
   kai` kate'balen a'nothen. To prove it, the fathers [113] usually quote
   that place, Isa. xiv. 12, 13, How art thou fallen from heaven, Lucifer,
   son of the morning I for thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend
   above the heights of the clouds, I will exalt my throne above the stars
   of God, I will be like the Most High.' But these are but metaphorical
   passages concerning the king of Babylon, and the ground of the mistake
   was because the angels are often in scripture set forth by stars, as
   Job xxxviii. 7. That testimony which is most cogent is in 1 Tim. iii.
   6, Ordain not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride, he fall into
   the condemnation of the devil;' this is, lest he make himself guilty of
   that sin for which the devil was condemned and rejected of God, namely
   of pride; and James iii. 15, [114] pride is called devilish wisdom; the
   sin is often to be read in the judgment that followeth it. God's
   throwing them down from the dignity of their estates was a sign that
   they aspired above it, and it may be collected from the first
   temptation, Ye shall be as gods,' as himself said, in the sense of the
   fathers, Ero sicut altissimus, so to our first parents he said, Eritis
   tanquam dii. (3.) They do best that make it a compound sin,
   accommodating all opinions; for, look, as there are many sins in that
   one act by which Adam fell, unbelief, pride, ingratitude, disobedience,
   &c., so in this act of the angels there might be many sins, for though
   pride be a chief sin in it, yet what kind of pride it was, or how
   discovered, it cannot be determined. Every opinion is asserted with
   equal probability. It might be envy at man, as we see the good angels
   rejoiced at their happiness, Job xxxviii. 7; Luke ii. 14, 15, and Luke
   xv. 7; or affectation of worship, as we see now they delight in it, or
   any other rebellion against God's empire and majesty.

   3. How they came to sin. The angels being created pure, they had no
   lust within to incline them; being in heaven, they had no object
   without to draw and allure them; there was no evil tracture, no
   tempter; how could they sin? I answer--(1.) It is probable that many of
   the angels sinned by temptation and seducement, and that one great
   angel, now called Beelzebub, first fell, and drew the rest after him:
   Mat. xxv. 41, The devil and his angels,' and Mat. x. 25, Beelzebub the
   prince of devils;' it was the name of the idol of the Ekronites, 2
   Kings i. 2, and signified the god or lord of flies. Now, because the
   Jews knew that they were devils that were worshipped in the idols of
   the Gentiles, they gave the names of the idols to the devils or evil
   angels, and the chief of the devils they called by the name of
   Beelzebub, so Mat. xii. 24, implying one that was the prince of the
   unclean spirits, called devil, Satan, the great dragon, and the god of
   this world; from all which we may probably collect that there was a
   prince or chief of the apostate angels, who was the ringleader in this
   faction and rebellion against God. (2.) Because the question returneth,
   How came the first angel then to fall? I answer--It is hard to conceive
   how sin came into the angels first; all that we can say is this, that
   the angels were created good, yet mutable and free, and they
   voluntarily chose not to abide in their own estates. All the answer
   Austin would give to this question was, Deus non sunt--they are not
   God; it is God's prerogative alone to be immutable; they might sin
   because they were creatures. And Aquinas giveth this reason: God cannot
   sin, because his act is his rule; but all creatures, though never so
   pure, if not assisted by grace, may sin: Job iv. 18, He chargeth his
   angels with folly;' there is mutability in the angelical nature, there
   called folly. Certainly God was not the cause of their fall, by
   infusing evil to them; it was the error of the Manichees to say they
   were created evil; nor by his prescience, for that enforceth not; nor
   his voluntary permission, for they were left to their own sway; nor his
   decree, for that is within himself, and doth not compel the creature;
   neither is God to be looked upon as consenting to the action, in that
   he did not hinder them from it, or in that he did not sustain them by
   his own grace, for he oweth this grace to none, and giveth it when and
   to whom he pleaseth; and in the angelical nature, as well as the human,
   he would discover his justice and mercy, and the freedom of his
   dispensations.

   4. The number, how many fell? The schoolmen are too rash. Some say,
   just as many fell as stood; others, that a third part fell, abusing
   that place, Rev. xii. 4, That the dragon drew a third part of the stars
   of heaven after him.' Whereas that is meant of defection in the church.
   Certain we are many fell, and therefore it is said angels in the text.
   That the number is great appeareth in that the world is full of these
   evil spirits, and a whole legion, which containeth some thousands, is
   said to possess one man, Luke viii. 30.

   5. For the time. In the general, very soon. Therefore it is said, John
   viii. 44, that Satan was a murderer from the beginning;' and 1 John
   iii. 8, The devil sinneth from the beginning;' that is, presently after
   his creation; created these angels were. It was the error of Valentius
   and Basilides, in the age next the apostles, that they were not
   created, but begotten of God. These primitive monsters broached it to
   the disgrace of Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God. But that
   they were created, see Col. i. 16, and Ps. cxlviii. 2, and created they
   were in time. Some of the Greek writers supposed the angels to be made
   before the world; but there is no ground for that, there being but one
   beginning of all created beings. And it is said, Before the beginning
   nothing was made,' John i. 3; therefore created they were the second
   day, with the heavens, as being of the same matter; as man was made
   when his seat and dwelling-place was perfected; so the angels, when
   their seat and place of residence was prepared. Moses mentioneth them
   not, because he treateth of the visible world and corporeal beings.
   Now, it is certain that, being created, they sinned ere man fell, for
   the devil, in and by the serpent, seduced Eve,' 2 Cor. xi. 3; therefore
   probably they fell a little after their creation; not in the very
   instant, that it might appear they were not naturally evil. It is
   probable that some time interceded between their creation and
   defection, but a very little time, to show the mutability of the
   creature.

   Use. Let me now apply what hath been spoken, and press you to consider
   it in your thoughts, and to consider it with observation and
   application to yourselves.

   1. Consider it with observation, and there is scarce a matter that can
   be more profitably amplified in your thoughts; we have the most
   impartial view of things in another person. Oh! think of this dreadful
   instance, the fall of the angels. (1.) Observe that such excellent
   creatures fell. Angels themselves were created excellent but mutable.
   Certainly we that dwell in houses of clay, and whose foundation is in
   the dust,' Job iv. 19, had need to be more cautious; if they be
   mutable, we are weaker and more mutable. To see such glorious stars
   leave their station, and fall from heaven like lightning, it should
   make us poor creatures tremble and look to our own standing, lest we
   also fall,' 1 Cor. x. 12. Self-confidence is the next way to ruin. God
   only cannot sin, because his act is his rule. There may be great
   height, strong abilities, rare accomplishments of nature and grace, and
   yet you see these cannot exempt us from shameful falls without the
   divine concurrence. The angels were the courtiers of heaven, the glory
   of the creation, in the first rank of the created beings, and yet they
   fell. Who can presume to stand when angels fall? (2.) They fell soon, a
   little after their creation. There is no created excellency but, if
   left to itself, will quickly undo itself; how soon do creature
   perfections fade! Surely there is no stability but in Christ. As the
   angels, so Adam fell a little after his creation: Ps. xlix. 12, Adam,
   being in honour, abideth not;' in the original, abideth not for a
   night;' and if it be applied to the first Adam, it implieth that he
   left the honour of his innocency the first day; in the morning
   innocent, and at night a sinner. Our new state in this regard is better
   than innocency, and the grace of regeneration exceedeth that of
   creation. The Lord would still keep the creature depending; our estate
   in Christ only is sure, because there our strength lieth in another.
   [115] Let us then work out our salvation with fear and trembling.' If
   angels fell, and Adam fell, when they had no such mixed nature and
   divided principles as we have, what will become of us? Neither man nor
   angel can be kept without a surety; and unless Christ be continually
   present with his own gifts, there is no standing. (3.) They fell
   dreadfully, and from angels became devils, exercising theft, lying,
   envy, murder towards men. The best things corrupted become worst; as no
   vinegar so tart as that which is made of the sweetest wine. When men
   sin against light and grace they become cruel: The revolters are
   profound to make slaughter,' saith the prophet, Hosea v. 2. After
   profession the fall is most desperate: Their latter end is worse than
   their beginning,' 2 Peter ii. 20. What a malice have these evil angels
   now against God and man! they go about seeking whom they may devour.
   None so bad as apostates. (4.) Their fall made way for ours. By this
   means there came to be a tempter in the world. The fall of angels
   occasioned the fall of man, and the fall of man the coming of Christ.
   Do but go home with reverence, and observe how, by the bare permission
   of God, the divine decrees were accomplished, and wonder at the purity
   of that unspotted providence that is conversant about sin and evil, but
   not conscious to it. The angels led the way, and man followed, and so
   occasion was given for the discovery of the manifold wisdom of God' to
   men and angels, Eph. iii. 10. (5.) So many fell as were not elected by
   God. There was election and reprobation among the angels. Among the
   most glorious creatures God would show the liberty of his counsels; not
   only amongst men, the lower sort of rational creatures, but among
   angels. Therefore the apostle speaketh of elect angels,' 1 Tim. v. 21.
   Why should clay murmur when gold is refused? If some of the angels were
   appointed to be vessels of dishonour,' who art thou that repliest upon
   God,' antapokrino'menos? Rom. ix. 20, that will be disputing the
   sovereignty of God, and ask the reason why he giveth grace to some and
   not to others? Wonder at it till thou canst understand it. Disputare
   vis mecum? mirare mecum, et clama, O altitudo! [116] God's decrees are
   hard meat, not easily digested by carnal reason. A proud creature
   cannot endure to hear of God's sovereignty; it awakeneth our security
   to hear of a distinction in the counsels of God, and that grace runneth
   in a narrower channel than whole mankind. Do but consider; amongst the
   angels some are passed by and others confirmed. And who art thou, O
   man, that repliest? (6.) In the election of angels, pardoning mercy is
   not so much glorified as in the election and calling of men; [117] then
   was grace shown but not mercy; none of the fallen angels were saved,
   but fallen man is called to grace in Christ. We were all in our blood'
   when God said live;' the whole lump and mass of mankind was fallen.
   Probably, next to the free counsels of God, that was the reason the
   whole human nature fell; but not the whole angelical nature, but only a
   part of it, so that the kind itself needed not to be repaired. Their
   sins argued more malice because of the height of their understanding;
   they sinned without a tempter. But the reason of reasons is, the will
   and gracious good pleasure of God, who was willing to show pardoning
   mercy to us, and not to them; the good angels had confirmation, but we
   redemption; we are reconciled, they continued: love after a breach made
   is more remarkable. (7.) From the sin in general by which they fell. It
   was by pride. See the danger of this sin; it always goeth before
   falling. The angels lost their holiness out of a desire of greatness;
   they would be over all and under none; it is dangerous when men mind
   rather to be great than good. In scripture we have two notable
   instances of the fall by pride, and our restoration by humility. The
   angels fell by pride and aspiring, and Christ restored mankind by being
   humble, lowly, and submitting himself even to the death of the cross.
   Adam would be as God, and so ruined us; and Christ, that was God,
   became as man, and so saved us. To counter work Satan, he layeth aside
   the glory of his Godhead; he layeth aside the glory of his Godhead and
   puts on a humble garb, saving us not by power, but by suffering. Well,
   then, look upon pride as the sure fore runner of a fall. (8.) Observe,
   the particular fact is uncertain, though the general sin may be known;
   as how this pride was discovered, whether in a thought, or by some bold
   attempt, is not known; it doth not so much pertain to edification and
   salvation to know their sin, as to know our own. The scriptures direct
   us to look inward; it is more for our profit to keep out Satan's power
   than to know the circumstances of his fall; let us not fall with him.
   Peter would know John's end, but Christ rebuketh him, What is that to
   thee? follow thou me,' John xxi. 20-22. We betray our duties by our
   curiosity; surely we should be more at home, and look to our beam, that
   we may not ascite others before the chair of censure, but ourselves
   before the tribunal of conscience. (9.) Observe, that the first sin
   that ever was, was a punishment to itself: They kept not their first
   estate.' The sin is expressed in such a phrase as doth imply their
   loss. Duty hath its reward in its mouth, as the sacks of the patriarchs
   their moneys; so sin its punishment. Never think that you shall get
   anything by offending God; you do but defile, and debase, and degrade
   yourselves from your own excellency when you sin. It is hell enough to
   turn away from God, and misery enough to pollute and stain his image in
   our souls. The fall of the angels is described to be a departure from
   their own happiness.

   2. Consider it with application to yourselves. First, apply it for
   humiliation. We left te`n arche`n, our first estate,' as well as the
   angels: God made man upright, but they sought out many inventions,'
   Eccles. vii. 29. Read your own guilt and apostasy in the sin of the
   angels; usually the page is whipped to show the prince's fault, but
   here the princes and noblest part of the world are set out to us for
   examples, that in their ruin and dreadful fall we might understand our
   own. Do but observe the parable; they had arche`n, an original estate
   of happiness and holiness, and so we; they fell soon, so we; they fell
   by pride, so we: the angelical fall is our glass; we are a kind of
   devils, and apostates from God. They were driven out of heaven, so we
   out of paradise; they are punished with darkness, and so we. Secondly,
   Apply it for caution; there is a new beginning in Christ. The apostle
   saith, Heb. iii. 14, We are made partakers of Christ, if we hold te`n
   arche`n, the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end.' If we
   should break with God again upon this new stock, there will be no more
   sacrifice for sin. Faith, which is the gift of God's grace, is the
   beginning and root of a new life in Christ. If we should forfeit this,
   we cannot expect God will deal with us any more.

   We are now come to the phrases that imply their punishment, and that we
   made to be twofold--present and future. The first part of the present
   punishment is poena damni, their loss, implied in that clause, leaving
   their own habitation, in which their guilt is further intimated; for
   the apostle here maketh it to be their act, but Peter in the parallel
   place maketh it God's act: 2 Peter ii. 4, God spared not his angels
   that sinned, but cast them down to hell.' Without further diversion we
   may take up the point thus:--

   Obs. That the apostate angels, upon their sin and fall, departed from
   that place of happiness and glory which before they enjoyed. So Rev.
   xii. 8, Their place was found no more in heaven, and the great dragon
   was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil and Satan, which
   deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his
   angels were cast out with him.' That scripture, I confess, is mystical,
   and speaketh of the overcoming of Satan in this present world, and
   casting him out of the church, which is there expressed by heaven, as
   the world by earth. For I observe in that book the church is some times
   expressed by terms suitable to the Judaical state. So in Rev. xi. 2,
   the church is called the temple, and the world the court; and sometimes
   by the celestial state, and so the church is called heaven, and the
   world earth. But, however, there is a plain allusion to Satan's first
   fall from heaven as the ground of these expressions, and therefore I
   may use that place as a proof in this matter. That you may understand
   the loss of the angels, give me leave to lay down these
   propositions:--(1.) The place of their innocency was heaven, round
   about the throne of God, where the good angels do continually behold
   his face,' and stand before him,' Dan. vii. 10. In such a blessed place
   and in such blessed company was their oikete'rion, their abode or
   habitation. When God disposed the several creatures into proper
   mansions and places of abode, he took the angels into his own train and
   glorious attendants, that they might still be with him; other creatures
   were his servants, these his courtiers, that is, his household and
   ordinary servants, that were to attend as in his chamber of presence.
   (2.) In this place they were to enjoy God and glorify God; their
   happiness was to enjoy God, their duty to glorify him; there they
   behold his face, Mat. xviii. 10, for vision and sight of God is the
   happiness of rational creatures, and therefore our happy estate is
   expressed by beholding him face to face,' 1 Cor. xiii. 14, and David
   saith, Ps. xvi. 11, In thy presence,' or in thy face is fulness of
   joy.' In heaven, then, did God manifest himself to them; there they
   were to applaud his counsels, receive his commands, to love God with
   the most perfect embraces of their will, and to fulfil his
   commandments, hearkening to the voice of his word,' (3.) From this
   place they are now driven into the lower parts of the world,' as being
   a place more fit for sin and misery. That the place into which they are
   driven is the bottom and centre of the earth cannot be shown out of
   scripture; rather the contrary, for sometimes they are said to fly up
   and down in the air, and therefore is Satan called the prince of the
   power of the air,' Eph. ii. 3, and the other devils, principalities and
   spiritual wickednesses in high places,' Eph. vi. 12. They aspire to get
   as high as they can, but they can get no further than the regions of
   the air; and sometimes they are said to compass the earth to and fro,'
   Job i. 7. The earth is Satan's walk and circuit, where he seeks to do
   mischief, and sometimes they are in the sea, Mat. viii. 32, for as yet
   they are not in that prison and place of torments where they shall
   abide for ever under the wrath of the Lord. Therefore when Christ
   checketh their power in the world, they expostulate with him, Jesus,
   thou Son of God, art thou come to torment us before our time?' Mat.
   viii. 29, and besought him that he would not cast them into the great
   deep;' by which some understand the final place of their residence and
   torments, even the lowest place of the world, most remote from the
   highest heavens, which place as yet they have not entered. But how is
   it said that they are already cast down into hell,' 2 Peter ii. 4,
   tartarosas? I answer--That expression doth only note the dreadfulness
   of their fall, from so glorious a mansion to such a place of misery;
   and because wherever they are, they carry their own hell with them,
   though by God's permission they are as yet suffered to remain in the
   air or earth. (4 ) Departing from heaven, they departed from all the
   happiness and glory which they enjoyed there, namely, that light which
   they had in their understandings to behold God, that power in their
   wills to love and serve him; instead of which they are filled with
   darkness and malice, and become the irreconcileable enemies of God and
   man. As to their light, their gracious knowledge is quite extinct,
   their natural knowledge much eclipsed, and their experimental knowledge
   not enough to engage their hearts to God. As to their integrity and
   holiness, instead of a will to love and serve God, there are nothing
   but obstinate purposes to do evil, and endeavours to hinder the glory
   of God and the good of man, 1 Peter v. 8, lest we should enjoy that
   happiness which he hath left. Hence those titles given them in
   scripture, as devil, Rev. xii. 9, which signifieth a slanderer; Satan,
   which signifieth an enemy; the tempter, Mat. iv. 1, because he daily
   soliciteth us to evil; o po'neros, the evil one, Mat. v., being full of
   wickedness himself, he maketh it his study and care to propagate it in
   others; Belial, 2 Cor. vi. 15, unprofitable, as good for nothing;
   apollu'on the destroyer, because he worketh mischief; the old serpent,
   Rev. xii. 6, because under the shape of the serpent he poisoned Eve. As
   to their power, it is much broken and limited; they are held in the
   chains of providence; they could not do hurt to the herd of swine
   without permission, Luke viii. 26. (5.) Though they have lost much of
   the glory and power annexed to their habitation, yet many tokens of the
   divine image do as yet remain in them. Holiness is, as we said, utterly
   lost--he sinneth from the beginning,' 1 John iii. 8, that is, doth
   nothing else but sin; and Aquinas saith well, Hoc est angelis casus,
   quod hominibus mors--their fall into sin to them is as death to us; but
   now in other things they have much left; as man after his fall is like
   a drifted picture, and had only enough left to show what he once was,
   so the angels, though they are much fallen from the excellency of their
   nature, yet there is enough left to show that once they were glorious
   creatures. That which remaineth may be referred to two heads--their
   great cunning and active power. (1.) Their knowledge and cunning is
   great; they have much natural and experimental knowledge, so as they
   can discern hidden causes and virtues which escape the flight of man's
   reason and understanding; they know how to apply active to passive
   things, can guess notably at future events; but as for a certain
   knowledge of them, unless of such things as depend upon necessary
   causes, that is proper to God, and accordingly he challengeth it: Isa.
   xii. 23, Show the things that are to come, that we may know that ye are
   gods,' &c. Therefore the devil's oracles were either false or doubtful,
   as 1 Kings xxii. 16. Great skill in arts and tongues they have, as
   appeareth by their teaching those things with wonderful facility to
   those that have familiarity with them. In divine things they know
   enough of God and his justice to feel a horror impressed upon
   themselves, [118] James ii. 19; Luke iv. 34; Acts xix. 15. Besides they
   are of wonderful sagacity to judge of men's hearts by the gestures, the
   motion of the blood and spirits, and other such external signs, for
   directly they do not know the thoughts; that is the privilege of God.
   (2.) Their power is great still, though limited, so that it cannot be
   exercised but when and where and as God will. They are able to raise
   tempests, to bring fire from heaven, as they did to ruin Job's house
   and children, Job i.; they can deceive with lying miracles, but true
   miracles can only be wrought by a divine power. Being of much sagacity
   and skill in the secrets of nature, they may poison the air, destroy
   the bodies of men, infest and trouble beasts and cattle; in short, do
   all that lieth within the compass of a natural cause where God
   permitteth. Again, they may possess the bodies of men, hinder the godly
   in the execution of their duty; overrule the spirits of wicked men, and
   act and stir them up to wrath, lust, filthiness, Eph. ii. 3, besot them
   with error, &c.: it would require a distinct discourse to open this
   power to you. They cannot create new beings, nor raise dead bodies, nor
   compel the will of man; they can do mira, but not miracula, &c. Let me
   now come to observe somewhat of practical concernment from what hath
   been spoken.

   1. That God hath proper places where the creatures shall perform their
   duty and enjoy their happiness. As the angels had heaven, which was
   i'dion oikete'rion, their proper place, so Adam had paradise, and the
   saints the church. It is misery enough to be thrown out of that place
   where God manifesteth himself; he that was cast out of the church was
   given up to Satan,' 1 Cor. v. 5. In the church Christ ruleth; in the
   world, Satan: it is good to keep to the shepherd's tents, Cant. i. 8.
   The angels left their first estate' at the same time that they lost
   their own habitation.' It is dangerous to leave our own place, to be
   cast out of the congregations of the faithful, where God dwelleth and
   is glorified: He inhabiteth the praises of Israel,' Ps. xxii. 3; that
   is, in the church, where he hath praise and we have benefit: the church
   is the gate of heaven,' Gen. xxviii. 17; where God is, there heaven is.
   Cain himself could bewail his misery in being turned out from the
   church; he had the whole earth before him, but, saith he, I shall be
   hid from thy face,' Gen. iv. 14; that is, I am turned out from the
   place of thy worship, and where thy name is called upon. It is sad to
   be banished from the Lord's gracious presence.

   2. Sin depriveth us of God's presence; this is the wall of separation
   between us and God: Isa. lix. 2, Your sins have separated,' &c. It not
   only provoketh God to stand at a distance from us, but worketh a
   strangeness in us, and maketh us shy of his presence; it cast the
   angels out of heaven, Adam out of Paradise, Cain out of the church.
   Well, then, when you are tempted to folly, bethink with yourselves: God
   could not endure the sight of angels when once they were defiled with
   sin; if I should yield to this temptation, I should never endure God,
   nor he me; this will either cause the Spirit to leave me, or me to
   leave the throne of grace; guilty souls cannot sustain the presence of
   God, and God doth not own the presence of guilty sinners. Peter said,
   Luke v. 8, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man;' and God saith,
   Depart from me into everlasting torments,' Mat. xxv.

   3. Observe again, Jude maketh it their act, and Peter God's act. Jude
   saith, they left their own habitation,' and Peter, God cast them down:'
   and punishments are voluntarily contracted, founded upon some act of
   ours. God may pass by a creature out of his mere will, but he damneth
   not till we provoke him. First there is a voluntary aversion from God,
   and then God turneth away from us: Hosea xiii. 9, O Israel! thou hast
   destroyed thyself.' Our ruin is caused by the free motion of our own
   wills. God punisheth not willingly, and as delighting in our
   destruction: we sin, and so freely depart from our own happiness; we
   leave and then he casteth down.

   4. God casteth Satan out of heaven. Do you imitate your heavenly
   Father; cast Satan out of your hearts. Who would entertain him whom
   heaven hath spewed out? It is said, Rev. xii. 8, That Satan and his
   angels found no more place in heaven.' Oh! then, give him not place to
   dwell in your hearts, Eph. iv. 17; do not entertain wrathful or lustful
   motions. God decreed that the evil angels should be cast out of heaven,
   and Christ died that they might be cast out of our hearts: John xii.
   31, Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.' Oh! let him not
   erect a new heaven and empire in your souls! His great aim is, now he
   cannot get into heaven, to dwell in the hearts of men.

   5. Angels, creatures of the highest excellency, are not spared when
   they sin: 2 Peter ii. 4, God spared not the angels,' &c. Wonder at the
   patience of the great God to us sinners. If a king be angry with his
   offending nobles, should not the scullions tremble? How come we to be
   of this side of hell? Go home and adore that grace that hath kept you
   out of the chains of darkness: Lam. iii. 22, It is of the Lord's mercy
   that we are not consumed,' not swallowed up quick, not cast down to
   hell. If the angels in the very infancy of their creation were so soon
   punished for the first offence, Lord, what didst thou see in us, that,
   after so many offences, we should be yet alive? It is mercy, pardoning
   mercy, that giveth us our beings; we fail not because compassions fail
   not.

   6. Angels were forced to leave their habitation; when they changed
   their nature, they changed their estate. Let all sinners tremble.
   Consider the instance, and you will see that no dignity and worth of
   the creature is of any avail, nothing can keep off the strokes of
   vengeance but the blood of Jesus Christ. They were angels, glorious
   creatures, their sin but one, and probably that in thought; yet how
   dreadful is their punishment! Cast out of heaven, kept in chains of
   darkness for a severer vengeance! Oh! then, how should we tremble that
   have drunk in iniquity like water!' Surely God is the same, he doth no
   less hate pride, obstinacy, and contempt of his grace now, than he did
   in times past: God is but one,' Gal. iii. 20; he acteth according to
   the same tenor of justice now as heretofore, &c.

   7. From the word oikete'rion, their own place,' observe the true
   dwelling-place and rest is heaven; it was the habitation of the angels,
   and the rest of the saints. Oh! long for your home, let your hearts and
   your hopes be there; enter upon your eternal inheritance by degrees.
   The angels left their habitations, do you be always travel ling
   thither; let your hearts be in heaven, Col. iii. 1, your conversations
   be in heaven ere your persons, Phil. iii. 20. There are good angels
   still, blessed companions: Heb. xii. 22, 23, An innumerable company of
   angels and spirits of just men perfected.' A heathen could see out of a
   glimpse of the soul's immortality, O praeclarum illum diem, cum ad
   illud animarum concilium coetumque proficiscar. There you shall see the
   vacant rooms of the apostate angels occupied by the saints. Say, Woe is
   me, that my pilgrimage is prolonged, Ps. cxx. 5.

   8. They were cast from heaven into this world. Do but look upon the
   world in a right notion. Satan, that was not fit for heaven, is cast
   out into the earth, as a meet place for misery and torment: he is
   called The ruler of the darkness of this world,' Eph. vi. 12, and The
   god of this world,' 2 Cor. iv. 4. It is punishment enough to the
   apostate angels to be cast out into the world: the world is the devil's
   workhouse and prison; one calleth it Satan's diocese. Who would be in
   love with a place of bondage and punishment?

   9. The devil and his angels are in the world; let us be the more
   cautious; he compasseth the earth to and fro,' no place can secure you
   from his temptation; he is everywhere ravening for the prey with an
   indefatigable and unwearied diligence, 1 Peter v. 8. Let us look about
   us: Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea, for the devil is
   come down to you,' Rev. xii. 12. Wherever you are, Satan is near you;
   the world is full of devils. When you are in the shop, the devil is
   there to fill your hearts with lying and deceit, as he did the heart of
   Ananias, Acts v.; when you are in your closets, and when you have shut
   the door upon you, you do not shut out Satan, he can taint a secret
   duty; when you are in the house of God, ministering before the Lord,
   Satan is at your right hand ready to resist you,' Zech. iii. 1. He is
   ready either to pervert your aims, or to divert your thoughts. We had
   need keep the heart in a humble, watchful, praying frame. God hath cast
   out the angels out of heaven, and now they are here upon earth,
   tempting the sons of men to folly and inconvenience. Be watchful, the
   world is the devil's chessboard; you can hardly move back or forth, but
   he is ready to attack you by some temptation.

   10. When grace is abused, our dejection is usually according to the
   degree of our exaltation; the angels from heaven are cast down to hell,
   the highest in the rank of creatures are now made lowest; corruptions
   of the best things are most noisome: Thou Capernaum, which art exalted
   to heaven, art now brought down to hell,' Mat. xi. 23. It was one of
   the chief cities of Galilee, and where our Saviour usually conversed.
   It is a kind of heaven to enjoy Christ in the ordinances, but now to
   slight this mercy will bring such confusions and miseries as are a kind
   of hell to you; slighting of grace, of all sins weigheth heaviest in
   God's balance.

   11. Spiritual judgments are most severe, and to be given up to
   obstinacy in sin is the sorest of judgment: it is diabolical to
   continue in sin; the angels left their habitation, and what followed?
   they lost their holiness.

   12. Loss of happiness is a great judgment, it is hell enough to want
   God. The first part of the sentence, depart from me,' Mat. xxv. 41, is
   most dreadful; loss of heaven is the first part of the angels'
   punishment. We in effect say now, Depart from us,' Job. xxi. 14, but
   God will then say, Depart from me;' ye shall see my face no more, &c.

   Thus we have dispatched the first part of the angels' punishment, their
   loss; we now come to the other part, their poena sensûs, their
   punishment of sense or pain, he hath reserved in everlasting chains
   under darkness; where there is an allusion to the state of malefactors
   or condemned men, who are kept in prison till execution. Now the evils
   of a prison are two:--(1.) The darkness of the place; (2.) The hard
   usage of the evil-doer; suitably to which the apostle used a double
   notion:--(1.) They are reserved in everlasting chains; (2.) Under
   darkness.

   I begin with the first part, in everlasting chains; whence two
   notes:--(1.) That the angels are kept in chains; (2.) That those chains
   are everlasting.

   1. They are kept in chains. But what chains can hold angels? can
   spirits be bound with irons? I answer--They are spiritual chains,
   suitable to the spiritual nature of angels; such as these:--

   [1.] Guilt of conscience, which bindeth them over to judgment; the
   consciences of wicked angels know that they are adjudged to dam nation
   for their sin. This is a sure chain, for it fasteneth the judgment so
   as you cannot shake it off; it is bound and tied upon us by the hand of
   God's justice. The condition of a guilty sinner is frequently compared
   to a prisoner, Isa. xlii. 7; Isa. xlix. 9; Isa lxi. 1; and sin to a
   prison wherein we are shut up, Rom. xi. 32; Gal. iii. 22; and guilt to
   chains or bonds laid upon us by God the judge, Prov. v. 22; Lam. i. 14.

   [2.] Their obstinacy in sinning. They are fallen so as they cannot rise
   again, they are called wickednesses,' Eph. vi. 12, as sinning with much
   malice and obstinacy; as if you should say wickedness itself. The
   devil's sin is as the sin against the Holy Ghost;' a malicious,
   obstinate, spiteful opposition against the kingdom of Christ, such a
   hatred against God and Christ that they will not repent and be saved;
   their despair begetteth despite, and being hopeless of relief, are
   without purpose of repentance. They do, foolish creatures, add sin to
   sin, and harden themselves in an evil way, which is as a chain to hold
   them in God's prison, till their final damnation; see 2 Thes. ii. 11,
   12, where error and wilful persisting in disobedience is made to be
   God's prison, wherein reprobate creatures are held till their
   punishment be consummate.

   [3.] Utter despair of deliverance; they are held under their torment by
   their own thoughts, as a distressed conscience is said to be bound up,
   Isa. lxi. 1; to them there remaineth nothing but a certain fearful
   looking for judgment and fiery indignation,' Heb. x. 27; release they
   cannot look for, more judgment they do expect: Mat. viii. 29, Art thou
   come to torment us before our time?' Their prison door is locked with
   God's own key, and as long as God sitteth upon the throne they cannot
   wrest the key out of his hands.

   [4.] God's power and providence, by which the angelical strength is
   bridled and overmastered, so as they cannot do what they would. Thus
   Rev. xx. 2, Satan is said to be bound up for a thousand years,' that
   is, in the chains of God's power, which are sometimes straiter and
   sometimes looser. The devil was fain to ask leave to enter into the
   herd of swine, Mat. viii.

   [5.] The chains of God's eternal decree. As there is a golden chain,
   the chain of salvation, which is carried on from link to link, till the
   purposes of eternal grace do end in the possession of eternal glory, so
   there is an iron chain of reprobation, which begins in God's own
   voluntary preterition, and is carried on in the creature's voluntary
   apostasy, and endeth in their just damnation; and when once we are shut
   up under these bars, there is no opening,' Job xii. 14.

   2. These chains are eternal chains, because the wicked angels stand
   guilty for ever, without hope of recovery or redemption. Every natural
   man is in chains, but there is hope to many of the prisoners. Christ
   saith, Go forth;' but those chains upon the evil angels are for ever
   and ever: now ad custodiam, to keep them and hold them in their lost
   estate; hereafter ad poenam, they are continued upon them as a part of
   their final punishment, when much of the liberty which now they have
   shall be abridged.

   From hence observe these practical inferences:--

   1. That sins are as it were bonds and chains. A wicked man is in
   bondage here and hereafter; [119] now in snares and then in chains,
   here taken captive by Satan in his snares, 2 Tim. ii. 26, and hereafter
   bound up with him in chains. Sin itself is a bondage, and hell a
   prison. Were there nothing in sin but the present slavery, it is enough
   to dissuade us; but alas! this is not all, there are not only snares
   but chains. In the fall of the angels, how many notions are there
   offered to us to discover the evil of sin! They left their beginning,'
   and lost their habitation,' and then chains of darkness.' He that hath
   a mind to be a beast or a devil let him be a sinner. If you mean to
   quench your reason, to eclipse the glory of your creation, to disturb
   the quiet of your spirits, and instead of calmness and serenity of
   conscience, to bring in horror and confusion; if you mean to enthral
   and captivate your souls to every base affection, and to be at the
   command of every corrupt desire, then go on freely, as you do, in
   sinning against God. But alas! the present thraldom is nothing to what
   is future; all the sins that you commit will be as so many chains,
   binding you over to an eternal and just damnation. The good angels are
   at liberty to serve God, when the evil angels are shut up in the prison
   of their own obstinacy and wickedness. Remember this when you are
   convinced of a sin which you cannot leave, and fear lest it prove a
   chain of everlasting darkness.

   2. Those chains and bonds can never be broken by us. The angels cannot
   break them themselves, and Christ will not, for their day of grace is
   past. Every one's chains would be eternal if Christ did not loose them,
   and open the prison-door to poor captives,' Isa. lxi. 1. This is our
   advantage above the angels, that a year of liberty is proclaimed to us,
   and an opening of the prison to them that are bound.' Christ himself
   was bound with our chains. The prophet saith, Isa. liii. 8, He was
   taken from prison and from judgment.' He was in prison that we might go
   free.' If the judge had given us up to the officer, and the officer had
   cast us into prison,' how long would it have been ere we had payed the
   utmost farthing'? Luke xii. 58. Others that reject the mercy offered in
   Christ can never wrest themselves out of the hands of justice, but do
   for ever remain under the power and wrath of the living God, Heb. x.
   31.

   3. The devil is in chains, a cruel spirit, but under bonds. His power
   is less than his will and malice; he is wrathful that we may not be
   secure; he is chained that we may not despair; he hath no power but
   what is given him from above; and when God putteth any of his servants
   into Satan's hands he keepeth Satan in his own hands. If you be in
   Satan's hands for your exercise, remember Satan is in God's hands for
   your comfort and safety. He had not power over the herd of swine
   without leave: Mat. viii. 31, Suffer me,' &c.; so Luke xxii. 31, he
   could not sift Peter till he had a commission: Satan hath desired,'
   &c., Job i. 2; ii. 7. Satan could not so much as touch Job's estate or
   skin till leave obtained. Nay, he could not deceive Ahab, a wicked man,
   till God said Go, I Kings xxii. 21, 22; he is but God's executioner: He
   sent his evil angels among them,' Ps. lxxviii. 49. God gave commission
   for the plagues of Egypt, and then the evil angels had power to execute
   them. The godly need not fear Satan as a disobedient angel; he is cast
   into the chains of God's justice and power; and as head of the kingdom
   of darkness, his power is more restrained by the death of Christ, John
   xii. 31.

   4. Observe how weak the creatures are when God marcheth in judgment
   against them. Guilt of conscience is one of the fallen angels' chains.
   If God will but arm our own thoughts against us, he needeth not bring
   forces from without, there is enough in that to sink us into hell. The
   law needeth not bring brimstone from heaven to burn sinners, nor open
   the mouth of the great deep to drown them, nor shatter the frame of
   nature about our heads. Alas! we cannot bear up under the burden of our
   own consciences, or the weight of our own grief; when he layeth his
   finger upon the conscience, who can bear it? The angels excel in
   strength, and yet the impressions of honour [120] laid upon them are
   too hard for them to grapple withal: Prov. xviii. 14, A wounded spirit
   who can bear?' as if he had said, I challenge all the world to bring me
   a man that is able to deal with his own conscience, when God armeth it
   against him.

   5. That spiritual judgments of all others are most secure. To have sin
   punished with obstinacy and hardness in sinning this, is nothing but to
   have the devil's chains laid upon us, a sad intimation that we are
   given up to chains of darkness. Frogs and lice and hailstones were but
   soft judgments to Pharaoh's hard heart; unless God should send us quick
   into hell, there cannot heavier judgment befall us; nay, certainly it
   were better to be given up to hell torments, if there could be any
   expectation of deliverance, than to be given up to a spirit of sinning,
   for there is no end of that. Say then, Lord, whatever judgment thou
   bringest upon me, bring not thy heavy judgment of a hard heart; it is
   better by far that you should live miserably than sin freely without
   remorse. Bat what sins bring on this spiritual judgment? I answer--(1.)
   An unthankful abuse of God's gifts; the devils had a glorious and
   excellent nature, but they were not thankful. Observe it when you will,
   you will find it true that no man was ever punished with hardness of
   heart, but some former merciful dispensation was abused. The heathens
   were not thankful for the light of nature, and therefore God gave them
   up to vile affections.' Rom. i. 22, 24; others received not the love of
   the truth,' and therefore God gave them up to believe a lie, that they
   might be damned,' 2 Thes. ii. 11, 12. The very sin against the Holy
   Ghost' is so called because it is a despiting grace received, or a
   devilish opposing of the grace and supernatural work of the Spirit, by
   which the mind is convinced of the truth. (2.) Sinning against the
   light; that was Satan's sin, who was full of light, and sinned in the
   very face of God; and it is his sin still, malice having only put out
   the light of prudence, but not of his understanding, so that he
   knowingly sinneth; so wicked men imprison the truth in
   unrighteousness.' Rom. i. 18, and then God giveth them up to the sway
   of their own lusts and passions. There is more of malice in sins
   against light; you laugh at Christ before his face, outdare heaven and
   conscience: Esther vii. 8, Will he force the queen before my face?' &c.
   (3.) Sinning with the light; when malice sets wit a-work (as it doth in
   the devils) against God and the church; it is satanical to be wise to
   do evil, to make no other use of our parts than to plot wickedness,
   pervert the truth, and undermine religion: Jer. iv. 22, They are wise
   to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.' When you make
   religion yield to policy, or bend policy to ruin religion, then your
   wisdom hath undone you,' Isa. xlvii. 10. (4.) Malice against God and
   goodness; this is Satan's direct sin. When men will not only be wicked
   themselves, but adversaries and malicious opposers of all that is good,
   this is not only to be sinners but Satans: Acts xiii. 10, O thou child
   of the devil, and enemy of all goodness.' Cain, that hated his brother
   because his works were righteous, was the devil's patriarch. (5.) A
   sottish obstinacy and wilfulness, when will and humour is lifted up
   against conviction, Jer. ii. 25, xliv. 18; they will not, because they
   will not. Foolish wilfulness meeteth with penal hardness; he that will
   wink shall not see the sun, shine it never so brightly; such men do but
   lay Satan's chains on their own will and understanding, (6.) A
   senseless security, notwithstanding the growth and increase of sin,
   when men lose all feeling and restraint, and grow more wicked but less
   tender, Eph. iv. 19; and so men sin freely, foully, wax worse and
   worse, and add new links to the chains of darkness.

   6. There is little reason that we should adore him whom God holdeth in
   chains of darkness, that we should exalt him whom the Lord hath cast
   down, and make a god of him who hath made himself a devil. All sins do,
   as it were, set the crown upon Satan's head; these especially--(1.)
   False worship: Satan is the head of idolaters; if the sacrifice was
   offered in an unbecoming manner, God saith it was a sacrifice offered
   unto devils, Lev. xvii. 7. In all false worships the devil is served
   either directly or obliquely, either by consequence or in the intention
   of the worshippers; thence those expressions, table of devils,' 1 Cor.
   x. 21; They sacrificed to devils and not to God,' Deut. xxxii. 17. You
   gratify Satan if you be not right in worship; those among Christians
   that worshipped towards an idol of gold and silver are said to worship
   devils,' Rev. ix. 20. Satan is, saith Synesius, eidolochare`s, a lover
   of images, and a patron of false worship. (2.) Worldly conversation: he
   is called the god of this world,' 2 Cor. iv. 4. Sensual, covetous,
   proud men are Satan's votaries, at his beck and pleasure; and will you
   be one of the number? When Christ came to dissolve Satan's works,' 1
   John iii. 8, will you uphold them? (3.) Base fear of wicked men: you do
   but fear the devil in them: Rev. ii. 10, Fear not; behold, the devil
   shall cast some of you into prison.' He that will deny the truth for
   fear of men, preferreth the devil before God. (4.) Being of the faction
   of the wicked: there is a corrupt party in the world, over whom Satan
   usurpeth empire and domination: Rulers of the darkness of this world,'
   Eph. vi. 12; Col. i. 13. Cry not up a confederacy with these; take heed
   how your soul entereth into that secret. I confess it is ingeniousness,
   a matter of Christian skill and art, to find out the snare that we may
   escape it. Generally they are the antichristian dark part of the world,
   such as are led with a blind zeal and rage to oppose the interest of
   righteousness, such as oppose the gospel with rage and lies: John viii.
   44, Ye are of your father the devil, and his lusts will ye do.' Many
   that deny Satan yet may be of his faction and party.

   We are now come to the second part of the punishment of pain, taken
   from the other inconvenience of a prison, hupo zophon, under darkness,
   in allusion to malefactors who are cast into dungeons, where, be sides
   the load of irons, the very darkness of the place concurreth to their
   misery. Light is pleasant, as giving us the sight of what is grateful
   in the world, of which when we are deprived, the mind, like a mill,
   falleth and worketh upon itself. Peter saith in chains of darkness,' as
   implying that God did bind them fast with their darkness and horror as
   with a chain; but our apostle here seemeth to make them two distinct
   parts of their torment, as certainly it is a more full description of
   it. Well, then, the proposition will be, that the apostate angels are
   kept under darkness.

   Obs. Darkness in scripture represented three things:--First, ignorance;
   secondly, sin; thirdly, misery; as light, the contrary quality,
   implieth knowledge, holiness, and happiness. Because light discovereth
   all things, it is put for knowledge; because of all bodily qualities it
   is most pure and unmixed, therefore it is put for holiness; because it
   is wonderfully pleasing and delightful to sense, therefore it is put
   for glory. So contrariwise darkness, which is nothing else but the
   absence and privation of light, signifieth ignorance, John iii. 19;
   sin, 1 Peter ii. 9; misery, Ps. cvii. 10. Now all these three make way
   for one another; ignorance for sin, and sin for misery; the
   understanding being the great wheel of the soul, if it be not right
   nothing can be right, Mat. vi. 22. Ignorance maketh us stumble upon
   sin, and by sin we fall into the pit of everlasting darkness.

   If you ask what kind of darkness is intended here? I answer--Though all
   may be implied, yet chiefly the darkness of misery is here intended,
   they being cast down from the light and glory of the highest heavens
   into dark and obscure habitations, where they want the sight of God and
   the light of his countenance. As when the sun is gone there is nothing
   but darkness in the world, so being banished out of the presence of
   God, they are fitly said to be held under darkness; for as the sun is
   to the corporeal world, so is God to the world of spirits, Ps. iv, 6.
   Now their sun is eclipsed, and by the interposition of the dark cloud
   of their sin and obstinacy, they cannot have the least comfortable
   glimpse and fruition of God; to which also may be added the horrible
   apprehension of their loss, and that terror and discomfort that lieth
   upon them, for they have only so much light left as serveth to increase
   their torment. I confess it is disputed by divines whether the devils
   can grieve for the loss of the light of God's countenance, or the want
   of the beatifical vision; and the ground of doubting is, be cause there
   is in the devils an extreme averseness, enmity, and hatred of God and
   his glory; but certainly, as they are rational creatures, they cannot
   but be sensible of their loss, as also the damned spirits are, and so
   great a loss of happiness (for that is the consideration under which
   they are sensible of it) must needs breed horror and torment. They do
   not mourn for the absence of God as the saints do, out of a principle
   of holiness, and because God is lovely in himself, but as profitable to
   them; and this sense, as it is accompanied with despair, so with
   blasphemy and hatred of God. Surely every part of the sentence that is
   pronounced upon wicked men is fitted to beget terror in them; and
   therefore depart from me' is apprehended as a misery, as well as go
   into everlasting torments.' Add further to their darkness that despair
   that is upon them, and fearful looking for of the fiery indignation of
   the Lord, which desperate sorrow is expressed by utter darkness and
   gnashing of teeth,' Mat. xxii. 13.

   Let me now come to some observations.

   Obs. 1. Darkness is the devils' punishment, the highest misery of the
   highest rank of reasonable creatures. Oh! why should we love that which
   is the misery of the fallen angels? as our Saviour speaketh of some
   that love darkness rather than light,' John iii. 19; that is, error
   rather than truth, lusts rather than Christ, ignorance rather than
   knowledge. It is one of the saddest arguments of man's dreadful fall,
   that he is in love with his own misery. We should hate sin, and we hate
   the light that reproveth it: ignorant people love a foolish ministry,
   God's faithful witnesses are their torment, Rev. xi. 10. The carnal
   world would fain lie down upon the bed of ease and sleep; light is
   troublesome: those that let them alone are their idols and darlings;
   the blind lead the blind, and both fall into the ditch.' It is evil not
   to know the will of God; it is doubly evil when we desire not to know;
   the one sort err in their minds, the other in their hearts. Spiritual
   darkness is far worse than bodily. When Elymas was stricken blind he
   desired somebody to lead him by the hand,' Acts xiii. 11. In such a
   case we count our happiness to light upon fit guides. In spiritual
   darkness it is quite otherwise; we cannot endure a faithful guide: The
   prophets prophesy lies, and the people love to have it so;' a blind
   people are all for blind guides.

   Obs. 2. Light that yieldeth us no comfort is but darkness. Satan hath
   knowledge left, but no comfort: James ii. 19, They believe and
   tremble.' The more sense they have of God's being and glory, the
   greater horror have they upon their spirits. It is very miserable when
   we have only light enough to awaken conscience, and knowledge enough to
   be self-condemned. To know God but not to enjoy him, that is the
   devils' punishment. Oh! then, never leave till your thoughts of God are
   sweet and comfortable, Ps. civ. 34. Satan cannot but abominate his own
   thoughts of God, for he cannot think of him without torment; but it is
   otherwise with gracious hearts; that meditation which is the devil's
   terror is their solace and support. God's name to them is as an
   ointment poured out,' Cant. i. 3, full of fragrancy and reviving. Best
   not, then, till you can see God with such a light as giveth you
   fruition and comfortable enjoyment of him: In thy light shall we see
   light,' Ps. xxxvi. 9; there is light in thy light, but all other light
   is but darkness.

   Obs. 3. Do but observe the difference between God and Satan. God is
   light, 1 John i. 5, and Satan darkness; God dwelleth in light, and
   Satan is reserved in chains under darkness. The first creature that God
   made in the world was light, and the first gift of the Spirit is
   illumination; but now all Satan's aim and work is to bring in darkness,
   to blind the mind, 2 Cor. iv. 4; ignorance is the very foundation of
   his kingdom, Eph. vi. 12. Well, then, the more dark, the more like
   Satan. A child of God is a child of light, and what have we to do with
   works of darkness'? Eph. v. 11. There should be such a contrariety
   between you and sin as there is between God and Satan; say then, These
   actions would only become my night of ignorance and folly; night-work
   is unseemly for the day: Rom. xiii. 12, The day is at hand, let us cast
   off the works of darkness;' leave these things to the bats and the
   owls. If there be a difference and contrariety between Christ and
   Belial, who are the chiefs of either state, so between the persons that
   herd under them: What communion is there between Christ and Belial,
   between light and darkness?' 2 Cor. vi. 14.

   Obs. 4. So much darkness as remaineth in you, so much advantage hath
   Satan against you. The dark part of the world is the seat of his
   empire: Rulers of the darkness of this world,' Eph. vi. 12. His
   subjects are the children of darkness,' and all the advantage that he
   hath over the children of light is because of the darkness that is in
   them: whosoever, therefore, lieth under a state of darkness is under
   the power of Satan. The great work of the ministry is to recover them,
   to turn them from darkness to light,' Acts xxvi. 18, and so from Satan
   to God.' Oh! the sad condition of such persons that are bound together
   with Satan in chains of darkness! Poor creatures, how are they hurried
   to and fro! from wrath to pride, from pride to lust, from lust to
   filthiness, from filthiness to worldliness! Oh, then, awake you that
   sleep, and the Lord shall give you light,' Eph. v. 14. What a blessing
   is it when it can be said of us, what the apostle said of the
   Ephesians, Ye were darkness, but now are light in the Lord,' Eph. v. 8.
   As soon as you have received light and grace, you are translated out of
   Satan's power and kingdom, and put into the Lord's.

   Obs. 5. The darkness of sin is punished with the darkness of misery The
   light whereby w r e are directed and perfected is the same; the state
   of grace is a marvellous light,' 1 Peter ii. 9, and the state of glory
   the inheritance of the saints in light,' Col. i. 12. So sin is but
   darkness begun. Hell is called utter darkness,' Mat. viii. 12, to`
   sko'tos to` exo'teron, a darkness beyond a darkness; as Augustine
   glosseth in his homilies, In tenebras ex tenebris infeliciter
   exclusi--the damned are but thrust out of one darkness into another,
   from ignorance to sin, from sin to torment. It is very observable when
   Solomon compareth the way of the just and the way of the wicked, he
   compareth the one to light, the other to darkness: Prov. iv. 18, 19,
   The way of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more
   unto the perfect day; and the way of the wicked is as darkness.' By the
   rule of contraries, as one is a growing light, so the other is an
   increasing darkness; from twilight to starlight, from starlight to
   thick darkness; they quench the light of nature, choose worldly
   happiness, grow regardless of eternity, are hardened in their way, and
   at length given up to everlasting horror and confusion of faces, to
   whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever,' 2 Peter ii. 17. Mists
   of error are justly punished with mists of darkness. The men there
   spoken of were clouds and mists in the church; and therefore the mists
   of eternal darkness are kept for them, as a fit and proper portion.

   Obs. 6. The danger of refusing and abusing light. Those that were
   angels of light are now held in the chains of darkness: see it every
   where made good; the blackest evening hath been sent usually after a
   glorious day; those that once enjoyed Noah's preaching were afterwards
   the spirits in prison,' 1 Peter iii. 18, 19; he that had not a wedding
   garment on for the feast was cast into utter darkness,' Mat. xxii. 13.
   Abuse of light and means and privileges will surely make our condition
   gloomy and uncomfortable.

   Obs. 7. When we are cast out from God, nothing but darkness ensueth,
   utter darkness and weeping and gnashing of teeth. It is our utmost
   happiness to enjoy God, and it is our utmost misery to want him; the
   devils know it, and we shall one day know it. Pray for the light of
   God's countenance more than for corn, and wine, and oil, Ps. iv. 6. One
   glimpse of the favour of God would turn hell into heaven, and give us
   such a strong and sweet joy as would swallow up all kind of sorrows. It
   is the absence of the sun maketh night; certainly they have hard hearts
   that do not mourn when they have lost the sight of God: When the
   bridegroom is gone, then shall they mourn,' Mat. ix. 15. Alas! how the
   drooping hearts and withered face of nature seem to mourn for the
   absence of the sun; and how are all things cleared and revived at
   spring again! And shall not we mourn for God, the sun of the
   intellectual world? Pharaoh was most affrighted with the plague of
   darkness, Exod. x. 4. Yea, the devils themselves are sensible of the
   loss of the light of God's countenance: when God shutteth himself up in
   a cloud, let our bowels be troubled for him. Lam. iii. 44.

   Obs. 8. The world in comparison of heaven is but a dark place. It is
   the place where the devils are cast, and they are held under darkness.
   It is an obscure corner of the creation, a place fit for our trial, but
   not for our reward. In a spiritual consideration it is but a great and
   vast dungeon, where we cannot have so dear [121] sight of God as else
   where. It is Satan's walk, a place of danger and defilement. It is much
   if we can keep ourselves unspotted in such a nasty hole, James i. 27; 2
   Peter ii. 20. The inheritance which is given to the saints is given to
   them in light,' Col. i. 12. Let us look for that, and long for that;
   and God dwelleth in light,' 1 Tim. vi. 16; he dwelleth there where he
   discovereth most of his glory, and that is in heaven.

   We have done with the present punishment of the angels; we come now to
   that which is future, implied in these words, unto the judgment of the
   great day. By judgment is meant the sentence of condemnation which
   shall pass upon them before the eyes of the whole world, and then the
   consequences, which are eternal misery and torment.

   Obs. 1. That at the day of judgment the punishment of the devils will
   be greater than it is now.

   The devils' punishment is for the present great, as you have heard, but
   they are in expectation of greater: Mat. viii. 29, Art thou come to
   torment us before our time?' There is a time coming when the wrath of
   God shall be increased upon them, and this time is the day of judgment,
   the great day of the Lord, when they shall be brought forth before the
   tribunal of Christ and his saints. The good angels shall come as
   Christ's companions, and the evil angels as his prisoners. See Mat.
   xxv. 31; 2 Thes. i. 7, and 1 Cor. vi. 3. This is a day that will work
   upon their envy, thwart their pride, to see the glory of Christ, and of
   the good angels and the saints. After this they shall be adjudged to
   horrible torments. Hell is their freehold and portion, prepared for the
   devil and his angels,' Mat. xxv. 41. The quality and nature of their
   torment we cannot so easily determine, nor what that fire is that shall
   burn spirits; only the scripture showeth they are cast into the lake
   that burneth with fire and brimstone,' Rev. xxi. 8, where they shall
   suffer torments without end and without ease. When heaven's joys are
   full, then are hell's torments full also; and therefore, though for the
   present they are under God's wrath, yet they do not taste the dregs of
   it; he exerciseth some patience towards them. They have an empire and a
   ministry in the world, but when all former things are done away, and
   Christ's glory is fully shown to the world, then will he take full
   vengeance of his enemies. Well, then, from hence learn:--

   1. That the wicked's judgment is not as yet full. At the great day then
   shall it be more increased upon the union of soul and body; they shall
   drink the dregs of the cup of wrath unmixed,' In this life we are
   adding sin to sin, and in the next God will be adding torment to
   torment. Oh! what a sad train of judgments followeth a sinner! For the
   present he hath hell in his own conscience; they sip of the cup of
   wrath in the bondage and horrors now upon them, and at death these are
   more revived, and made more lively and active. But consider, after all
   this there is worse behind, torments insufferable, presently upon the
   separation, for then they are in prison, 1 Peter iii. 9, detained in a
   fearful expectation of further judgment: Luke xvi. 24. I am horribly
   tormented in this flame.' But after this, at Christ's coming to
   judgment, these torments are increased, and therefore the apostle
   speaketh as if he did not take vengeance before: 2 Thes. i. 7, He shall
   come in flaming fire to render vengeance,' &c; because then it is fully
   executed. Do not add drunkenness to thirst, lest God add to your
   plagues.

   2. The most miserable creatures are suffered to enjoy some degree of
   God's patience. For the present God is patient. As to the fallen
   angels, sure I am to sinning man, in the day that thou eatest thereof
   thou shalt die.' The full execution of that sentence is put off to the
   day of judgment; reprobates are endured with much long-suffering.' Rom.
   ix. 22. Intermissions God gives in this life, respite to bodies till
   the last day. Adore his goodness, do not abuse it.

   3. Origen's charity was too large, who dreamed of katha'rsion pur, a
   flaming river, through which all creatures were to pass, and so to be
   purged, and then at length to be saved, even the devils themselves;
   whereas they are kept for a severer judgment.

   4. When you see wicked men endured, and not presently cast into hell,
   be not astonished; God hath a ministry for them as for the evil angels.
   Some are reserved to the day of judgment,' 2 Peter ii. 9; that is,
   their punishment is respited for the greater triumph of that day.

   5. One judgment may make way for another, the chains of darkness for
   the judgment of the great day. Let no man please himself in that he
   suffereth afflictions in this world; these may be but the beginnings of
   sorrow. God is terrible to poor sinners as well as rich. You may be
   miserable here, and yet not escape in the world to come. Do not think
   the worst is past. Some have a double hell, such miseries here as are
   pledges of everlasting torments hereafter.

   6. Devils fear the great day. An atheistical loose Christian is worse
   than Satan. He scoffeth at that at which the devil trembleth. There are
   atheists in the church, but there are none in hell.

   7. Angels are brought to judgment. None are exempted. At the great day
   you shall see those glorious creatures bound with chains of darkness.
   The kings and captains are brought in trembling before the Lamb's
   throne, Rev. vi. 15, and great as well as small appear be fore that
   great tribunal, Rev. xx. 12.

   8. The angels are plunged into the depths of hell, when saints enter
   into their master's joy. God loveth a returning sinner before an
   apostate angel.

   Obs. 2. There is one point yet behind, with which I shall conclude this
   verse, and that is, that the day of judgment is a great day. It is so
   in many regards.

   First, Because it is the consummate act of Christ's regal office. Of
   all offices, Christ's kingly office is the most eminent. Now the kingly
   office was never discovered with so much lustre and glory to the world
   as then. The eminent act of other offices do more belong to his
   abasement. As his oblation, an eminent act of his priestly office, was
   to be performed upon earth, so his prophetical office was much
   discharged in delivering the doctrine of the gospel whilst he was here;
   but of his kingly office we had but a very little glimpse during his
   abode upon earth, in his whipping the buyers and sellers out of the
   temple, and his entrance into Jerusalem, when they cried Hosanna in the
   streets, Mat. xxi. And now in heaven Christ is supreme; but his
   sovereignty lieth under a cloud and veil: All things are put under
   him.' But carnal sense objects, We see not as yet all things put under
   him,' Heb. ii. 8. But at the last day Christ will show himself to be
   king indeed, both in rewarding his friends, and in an absolute conquest
   over his enemies, which are the two great parts of his regal office.
   Therefore the day of judgment is called eme'ra kuri'ou, the day of the
   Lord,' 2 Peter iii. 10, as being the day wherein Christ shall manifest
   himself to be a Lord indeed: (1.) In rewarding his friends. When David
   was crowned at Hebron, then all that followed him in the wilderness
   were rewarded according to the merit of their place and service. Before
   they had hard service and little wages, but then were made captains of
   thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties. So they
   that are true to the interest of Christ may meet with many a frown and
   hard entertainment in the world, but you will not repent of it in the
   day of Christ's royalty: Mat. xxv. 34, Then shall the king say,' &c. He
   is called the Son of man' before; but then you will find a king'
   rewarding all his subjects. Peter was troubled about his petty losses;
   Master,' saith he, we have forsaken all and followed thee.' What had
   Peter to forsake? A net, a cottage, a fishing-boat. A great all! We are
   apt to think much of what we part with upon Christ's score. If we
   suffer but a disgraceful word, a small inconvenience, a frown, we
   presently say, What shall we have therefor?' But we need not seek
   another paymaster than Christ. He will not be behindhand with us when
   the day of payment cometh. See Mat. xix. 27, 28, en palingenesi'a, In
   the regeneration ye shall sit with me on thrones of glory,' &c.; that
   is, at the day of judgment, which is the great regeneration. When
   heavens are new, earth new, bodies new, souls new, all is new, then we
   shall be no losers by Christ. (2.) In an absolute conquest over his
   enemies. The stoutest faces shall then gather blackness, and the
   stiffest knees bow to him. There is an expression, Isa. xlv. 23, I have
   sworn by myself, and the words shall not return, that to me every knee
   shall bow, and every mouth shall swear.' Now this expression cloth
   concern Christ's sovereignty and full victory over his enemies; for
   this scripture is twice alluded unto in the New Testament, and in both
   places applied to Christ. The first place that I shall take notice of
   is Phil. ii. 10, where the apostle saith, that to Christ every knee
   shall bow, and every tongue shall call him Lord,' which is the same
   with that which is spoken in the prophet, and is there made to be the
   first [122] of Christ's ascension, when he was solemnly inaugurated
   into the kingly office; but the prophecy receiveth not its full and
   final accomplishment till the day of judgment. To which purpose the
   same scripture is cited by the apostle, Rom. xiv. 11, We shall all
   stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, for it is written, As I live,
   saith the Lord, to me every knee shall bow, and mouth shall confess.'
   So that the bowing of knees or stooping of enemies is not fully
   accomplished till then. Christ doth now often overrule the counsels and
   projects of his enemies, and smite them with a sore destruction; but
   there is no such crouching and trembling so sensibly now to be
   discerned as there will be at that day.

   Secondly, The day of judgment is a great day, because great things are
   then done, which will appear if you consider--(1.) The preparations for
   that day; (2.) The day itself; (3.) The consequence of it.

   1. The preparations for Christ's approach: the scripture mentioneth
   two--(1.) The archangel's trumpet; (2.) The sign of the Son of man.

   [1.] There is that great noise and terror of the voice of the Lord,
   which is to be managed by some special angels, by which all the world
   shall be, as it were, summoned to appear before Christ's tribunal. See
   1 Thes. iv. 16, and Mat. xxiv. 31. Some expound this trumpet
   analogically, some literally. They that expound it analogically think
   it signifieth the power and virtue of Christ forcing all the world to
   appear before his judgment-seat, which is therefore called a trumpet,
   because the solemn assemblies among the Jews were summoned by sound of
   trumpet. But why may we not take it literally, and in propriety of
   speech, for the audible sound of a trumpet? Sure I am at the giving of
   the law the voice of the trumpet was exceeding loud;' and the like may
   be when he cometh to take an account of our keeping the law, a sound of
   a trumpet, as a terrible summons to all the world, and a near sign of
   Christ's approach; as John Baptist was the forerunner of his first
   coming, who was the voice of one crying in the wilderness;' so is the
   arch angel at his second coming; a terrible blast there shall be, such
   as shall be heard all the world over, startling the dead out of their
   graves. Men do not hear the voice of God now, for now he speaketh by
   his angels or messengers, in a still voice; but then all the dead shall
   hear and live.

   [2.] The sign of the Son of man,' spoken of Mat. xxiv. 30. What it is
   we certainly cannot tell, till experience manifest it. Some think a
   strange star, as, at his first coming, the wise men were conducted to
   him by a star; others the sign of the cross, as being Christ's badge by
   which he is known in the world; for the great subject of the gospel is
   Christ crucified, called therefore the word of the cross,' and this
   they think shall appear in the heavens, as it did to Constantine when
   he went to fight against Maxentius, with this word, en touto
   nike'seis--by this shalt thou overcome; though, by the way, Eusebius
   describeth that vision as in the figure of X, the first critical
   letters of Christ's name. This way go many of the ancients, making the
   cross to be Christ's ensign and royal banner, which he will, display in
   the heavens; as kings, when they make their triumphant approach, have
   their banners carried before them. But I dare not thus dogmatise.
   Others, more probably, interpret it of some forerunning beams of
   majesty and glory, like those streaks of light before the sun be risen,
   which shall darken the great luminaries of the world, and strike a
   terror into the hearts of men, as Paul was stricken with such a terror
   at the sight of Christ: Acts xxvi. 13, he saw light from heaven, above
   the brightness of the sun, shining round about him.' Notable it is,
   that these forerunning beams of Christ's majesty and glory are
   sometimes expressed by light and sometimes by fire; by light to express
   the comfortableness of it to the godly, as the light of the sun doth
   not scorch but revive and refresh; by fire, 2 Thes. i. 8, en pu'ri
   phlo'gos, to show the dreadfulness of it to the wicked; to them it is
   as flames and devouring burnings.

   2. Let us consider the day itself, and the great things done therein.
   It is a day of congregation of all mankind; there Adam may see all his
   posterity at once; but especially is it a day of congregation in
   respect of the saints, who are now scattered in divers countries,
   towns, houses, where God hath any work and service for them, but then
   shall meet together in one assembly and rendezvous, called, Ps. i. 6,
   the great congregation of the just,' as the wicked shall be herded
   together like straws and sticks bound in a bundle to set one another on
   fire, drunkards together, and adulterers together: They shall be bound
   in bundles,' &c., Mat. xiii. 41, and so increase one another's torment.
   So shall the godly meet in a congregation, and never separate more.
   Here the godly are dispersed as the stars are scattered throughout the
   firmament; here they live intermingled with wicked men--Jacob's cattle
   and Laban's cattle together; but then the sheep shall be separated from
   the goats, and be all drawn into a body by themselves. Again, it is a
   day of manifestation; the Lord's decrees and counsels are manifested.
   Creation and providence are but subservient means in order to the
   triumphs of this day, that the glory of his grace may be advanced in
   the salvation of the elect, and the glory of his justice in the
   punishment of the wicked, who, upon this account, are said to be made
   for the day of evil,' Prov. xvi. 4, where the Holy Ghost pitcheth upon
   that part of the decree which is hardest to be digested, the making of
   the wicked for the glory of the Lord's justice in that day. The wisdom
   of God in the courses of his providence is then manifested, for the
   story of the world is brought before the saints. We see providence now
   by pieces, but then the whole contexture of it; the secrets of men are
   then manifested, and upon what principles and ends they have acted, 1
   Cor. iv. 5. The truth of the promises and threatenings is then
   manifested; in the day of God's patience there is a darkness and veil
   upon the scriptures, we cannot see how they are made good; but in the
   day of God's recompense we shall, what promises, threatenings,
   prophecies mean; but chiefly is it a day of manifestation' in regard of
   the sons of God.' Rom. viii. 19. All is now hidden, Christ is hidden,
   and the saints are hidden; their life is hidden, Gal. iii. 3; their
   glory is hidden, 1 John iii. 2; but then Christ shall appear, and we
   shall appear with him in glory.' As Moses told the rebels, Num. xvi.,
   To-morrow the Lord will show who are his.' The first-born and
   only-begotten Son of God then is manifested, Christ will appear in all
   his royalty and glory, as the great God and Saviour and judge of the
   world, as the great God; therefore it is said he will appear in the
   glory of the Father,' Mat. xxiv. 13; xvi. 27. The mystery of his person
   will now be discovered to the uttermost, and therefore he will appear
   in such a glory as never creature was capable of, nor can he guess at
   it. We may by the glory discovered at the giving of the law, when Moses
   shook for fear, Heb. xii. 19; by the light that shone at his
   incarnation, Luke ii.; at his transfiguration, Mat. xvii.; by those
   beams of majesty which broke out from him when the soldiers came to
   take him, John xviii. 6; by his appearance to Paul--it struck him blind
   for three days, Acts ix; by Isaiah's terror when he saw God in a
   vision, Isa. vi. And as he will manifest himself to be the great God,
   so the true Saviour of the world. The manner of his appearance shall
   make a full recompense for his abasement. At his first coming, John was
   his forerunner, as we have said, now an arch angel; then he came with a
   few fishermen, now with a multitude of angels; then riding on the colt
   of an ass, now upon the clouds; then as the Son of man, now as the Son
   of God; then in the form of a servant, now in the glory of the Father;
   then crowned with thorns, now glory and honour; then to teach
   righteousness, now to reward righteousness; then in the similitude of
   sinful flesh.' Rom. viii. 3, now, the second time, without sin,' Heb.
   ix. 28. At his first coming he was not a sinner, but he came in the
   garb of a sinner, afflicted, miserable--we judged him as one forsaken
   of God;' but now he cometh as one discharged of that debt and burden,
   and as one highly honoured by God the Father. Once more, he cometh in
   all things befitting the world's judge, accompanied with angels as his
   attendants, sitting upon a visible throne that he may be seen of all,
   heard of all. In earthly judicatories, when great malefactors are to be
   tried, the whole majesty and glory of a nation is brought forth; the
   judge in gorgeous apparel, accompanied with the flower of the country,
   nobles and gentry, and a great conflux of people. So here, Christ
   cometh forth as the judge, accompanied with angels and saints,
   powerfully executing the work of that day. And the only-begotten Son of
   God is manifested; but this is a day of manifestation, not only of the
   Son,' but of the sons of God,' namely, the saints, who are then set
   forth in their best robes. In winter the tree appeareth not what it is,
   the sap and life is hidden in the root, but when summer cometh all is
   discovered: so now it doth not appear who are God's, nor what they
   shall be, but at this day all is manifest. When Christ shall appear, we
   shall appear with him in glory;' they shall attain to that fulness of
   glory as their hearts could never conceive. It is said, 2 Thes. i. 10,
   Christ will be admired in them.' The angels shall stand wondering what
   Christ is about to do with creatures but newly crept out of dust and
   rottenness. Every one of them shall shine as the sun; and what a great
   and glorious day must that be, when there is a constellation of so many
   suns! They shall share with Christ in the glory of his kingdom, as
   being associated with him in judging the world. The upright shall have
   dominion over them in the morning,' Ps. xlix. 14; those that are now
   scorned, persecuted, opposed everywhere, in the morning of the
   resurrection, when they awake to meet Christ, then shall they have
   dominion over the carnal world; therefore, sentence beginneth with the
   godly, as execution doth with the wicked. The elect are first acquitted
   before the ungodly are condemned, that they may join afterwards with
   Christ in judging the world, 1 Cor. vi. 2.

   Again, it is great in regard of the manner of process, but of that see
   ver. 15.

   3. The consequences of this day; they are three:--(1.) The sending of
   the persons judged in to their everlasting state; (2.) The resigning up
   of the kingdom to the Father; (3.) The burning of the world.

   [1.] The sending of the persons judged into their everlasting estate,
   the elect into glory, and the wicked into torments: Mat. xxv. 34, Come,
   ye blessed of my Father,' &c. You have been too long absent from me;
   come receive the fruit of your faith and hope; but ver. 41, Go, ye
   cursed,' &c: they are banished out of Christ's presence with such a
   terrible ban and proscription as shall never be reversed. As Hainan's
   face was covered, and so led away to execution, so are they chased out
   of Christ's presence with horror, yelling and howling with the voice of
   dragons, and begging for mercy, but find none. Now from this sentence
   there is no appeal; it is pronounced by Christ as God-man. On earth
   many times God's sentence is repealed if the nation will repent, &c.,
   Jer. xviii. 8; and so though God doth never change his decree, he doth
   often change his sentence; but the day of patience is now past, and
   therefore this sentence can never be recalled. Again, the execution is
   speedy. Here many times the sentence is passed, but sentence is not
   speedily executed' upon an evil-doer, Eccles. viii. 11. Once more, this
   execution beginning with the wicked in the sight of the just, proton
   ziza'nia: Gather ye first the tares,' &c., Mat. xiii. 30; which worketh
   the more upon the envy and grief of the wicked, that they are thrust
   out whilst the godly remain with Christ seeing execution done; and the
   godly have the deeper sense of their condition, antikei'mena
   parellagme'na, &c. Contraries put together do more heighten one
   another; in the execution of the wicked they may see from what they are
   delivered by grace. Again the sentence is executed upon the whole man,
   and that for ever; body and soul are partakers, as in the work, so in
   the punishment and reward; and it is eternal, for the reward is built
   on an infinite merit; and the punishment is eternal, because an
   infinite majesty is offended; and in the next world men are in their
   final estate, without possibility of change; therefore God is never
   weary blessing the good and cursing the wicked.

   [2.] The next consequent is the resigning and giving up the kingdom to
   the Father, spoken of 1 Cor. xv. from 24 to 28. Kingdom may be put for
   royal authority, or subjects governed, as the people we call sometimes
   the kingdom of England or kingdom of France. Christ is ever head of the
   earth, and in heaven we subsist not only by virtue of his everlasting
   merit, but everlasting influence, for he is the life,' John xiv. 6. And
   therefore I take kingdom here in the latter sense for the subjects or
   the church, who are resigned or presented to God, Eph. v. 27, as the
   fruits of Christ's purchase, as a prey snatched out of the teeth of
   lions. The form of presentation you have, Heb. ii. 13, Behold I and all
   the little ones which thou hast given me.' Oh! what a great and
   glorious day will this be, when we shall see Christ and all his little
   ones following him, and the great Shepherd of the sheep going into his
   everlasting folds, and all the elect in his company, with their crowns
   on their heads, singing, O grave! where is thy victory? O death! where
   is thy sting?' When all enemies shall be broken, and the church lodged
   in those blessed mansions, what applause and acclamations will there be
   between them and Christ, between them and the angels, them and their
   fellow saints! How should we strive to be some of this number!

   [3.] The next consequence is the burning of the world, which is set
   forth at large in 2 Peter iii., per totum. The passages there are
   literally to be taken, for the fire there spoken of is compared with
   the waters of Noah,' which was a judgment really executed; and by this
   fire, it is probable, the world will not be consumed, but renewed and
   purged, for it is compared to a melting fire, 2 Peter iii. 10. And the
   apostle saith elsewhere, The creature shall be delivered from the
   bondage of corruption.' Rom. viii. 21. And in the everlasting estate
   God will have all things now, even the world itself. The use of this
   renewed world is either for a habitation to the just, or that it may
   remain as a standing monument of God's wisdom and power. (1.) This
   burning doth not go before the day of judgment, but follow after it;
   for it seemeth to be an instrument of vengeance on the wicked, 2 Peter
   iii. 7. I will riot be so bold, with the schoolmen, as to say that the
   feculent and drossy parts of this fire are reserved for the torment of
   the wicked in hell for ever; but in the general way we may safely say
   that it is an instrument of God's vengeance on them. Well, now, that
   day which hath such an end and close, must needs be a great day.
   Sodom's fire was dreadful, but nothing to this burning; that was of one
   particular place, but this of the whole world; that was a preparative
   warning, but this the last expression of his wrath against the ungodly
   world. Many give divers witty reasons for this burning; a taste may not
   be unwelcome. Under the law the vessel that held the sin-offering was
   to be purged with fire; so the world, where sin hath been committed.
   The object of our adulteries is burnt and defaced, that we may know the
   anger of the Lord's jealousy. The old world was destroyed by water,
   [123] propter ardorem libidinis, because of the heat of lust; and the
   present world burnt with fire, propter teporem caritatis, because of
   the coldness of love in the latter days. But of such kind of allusions
   more than enough.

   You see then by all this, that the day of judgment is a great day. Let
   us now apply it.

   If it be a great day, let us regard it more seriously, for all things
   should be regarded according to their weight. This is the greatest day
   that ever we shall see, and therefore we shall be more affected with
   this day than with anything else. We have slight thoughts of things to
   come, and therefore they do not work with us. Can we expect such a day,
   and not spend a thought upon it? O Christians! look for it more, long
   for it more, provide for it more.

   1. Look for it, Phil. iii. 21; Titus ii. 13. Every time you look up to
   the clouds, remember you have a Saviour that in time will come from
   thence, and call the world to an account. Faith should always stand
   ready to meet him, as if he were upon his way; as Rebecca spied Isaac
   afar off, so doth faith, which is the evidence of things not seen,'
   Look within the curtain of the heavens, and spy out Christ as preparing
   for his coming. If he tarrieth longer than we expect, he is not slack,'
   2 Peter iii. 9; but we are hasty. He wants no affection to us; his
   delights were with the sons of men' before they were created, Prov.
   viii. 31; and certainly, now he is so deeply interested in us, as
   having bought us with his blood, he desireth to enjoy what he hath
   purchased. It is not want of love keepeth him away, nor want of truth;
   God is punctual in his promises, even to a day: Exod. xii. 41, Even the
   self same day,' &c. If all things were ready he would come presently;
   therefore wait and look still: they were not deceived that expected his
   first coming in the flesh. It was said, a virgin shall conceive.' Was
   it not done? That God would bring his son out of Egypt.' Was it not
   done? That he should ride to Jerusalem upon the foal of an ass;' and
   was it not done? Surely the God that hath been faithful all along
   hitherto will not fail at last.

   2. Long for it. The faithful love his appearing,' 2 Tim. iv. 8. This is
   the great day which they long to see, that they may meet with their
   beloved, and see him in all his glory and royalty. They have heard much
   of Christ, and tasted much of Christ, and they love him much, but yet
   they have not seen him; they know him by hearsay, and by spiritual
   experience, but never saw his person: Whom having not seen you love,'
   &c. They have seen his picture; crucified before their eyes,' Gal. iii.
   1;' Beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,' 2 Cor. iii. 18;
   therefore they cannot be satisfied till this day cometh about. Oh! when
   shall it once be? The Spirit in the bride saith, Come,' Rev. xxii. 17.
   Nature saith not Come, but Tarry still. If it might go by voices
   whether Christ should come, yea or no, carnal men would never give
   their voice this way. The language of corrupt nature is, Depart,' Job
   xxi. 14. Carnal men are of the devil's mind: Art thou come to torment
   us before our time?' Mat. viii.; they cannot endure to hear of it; but
   Come, O come!' saith grace. This day we have cause to long for, not
   only upon Christ's account, but our own: it is the day of our
   perfection as well as Christ's royalty. Now everything tendeth to its
   perfect state, so doth a Christian; then there is perfect holiness and
   perfect freedom. We never find Christ a Saviour to the uttermost till
   then; to the glorified spirits he is but a Saviour in part, some fruit
   of sin is continued upon the body; but then body and soul are united
   and perfectly glorified to enjoy God in heaven. Christ then cometh to
   make an end of what he had begun. He first came to redeem our souls,
   and then our bodies from corruption; the body is a captive in the grave
   when the soul is set at liberty; it is held under the power of death
   till that day. The butler was not afraid to go before Pharaoh, because
   Joseph told him he should be set at liberty. Lift up your heads,' it is
   a day of redemption, Luke xxi. 28. Christ cometh to loosen the bands
   and shackles of death; to think and speak of that day with horror doth
   ill become him that looketh for such great privileges.

   3. Provide for that day. It is called the great and notable day of the
   Lord,' Acts ii. 20. It should be the whole employment of our lives to
   prepare for it; but how shall we provide for that day? I answer--By
   making peace with God in and by Jesus Christ. When Jacob heard that
   Esau was coming with a great power and force, he sendeth to make peace
   with him. We hear of a great day coming, when the Lord shall descend
   from heaven with a shout, and all his holy angels with him,' (1.) Let
   us compromise all differences between us and him. We are advised so to
   do: Luke xiv. 32, While he is yet a great way off, he sendeth an
   embassage, and desireth conditions of peace.' We need not send to the
   Lord; God maketh the offer to us: let us lay down the weapons of our
   defiance, and accept of the terms proposed. (2.) If you would provide
   for this day, clear up your union with Jesus Christ; he is the judge,
   and there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ.' Rom. viii. 1.
   Will the head condemn his own members? If we abide in him,' we shall be
   able to look him in the face; we shall have boldness in that day,' 1
   John ii. 28. Then, though it be a great day, it will not be a terrible
   day to us. (3.) Frequent communion with him at the throne of grace.
   When familiar friends meet together after a long absence, what a sweet
   interview is there! what mutual embraces and endearments pass between
   them! So acquaint yourselves with Christ aforehand, Job xxii. Common
   acquaintance with him in external worship will not serve the turn: Luke
   xiii. 26, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and heard thee in
   our streets;' and yet Christ saith, I know you not.' There must be a
   holy intimacy and sweet experience of him; you must know him in the
   Spirit. (4.) By holy conversation, both as to the matter and end of it;
   for the great end of this day is that grace may be glorious. Other
   things are honoured in the world, as power, and strength, and cunning,
   and civil endowments, but then eminence in grace cometh to be crowned:
   2 Peter iii. 11, We that look for such things, what manner of persons
   ought we to be in all holiness and godliness of conversation?' There
   are two words there used, holiness and godliness: the one relateth to
   the matter of our actions, that we should do things good, and just, and
   pure; the other, to our end and aim. We must do all this as in and to
   the Lord, making him the supreme end of all that we do. (5.) We may
   press you to heavenliness in your choice. Where lieth your treasure? If
   the enjoyment of the world be your chief est good, that will be of no
   use to you in that day; in a disdain to our choice, all worldly things
   are burnt before our eyes; but if your happiness lieth in heaven,
   thither you are going to take full possession of it. At the last day
   wicked men cannot murmur; God's judgments are but their own choice. If
   the goats be placed on the left hand and the sheep on the right, it is
   but according to their preposterous affections here in the world: Prov.
   iii. 16, Length of days are in her right hand, and in her left hand
   riches and honour.' Eternity is the right-hand blessing. Now, if you
   despise a blessed eternity in comparison of those left-hand blessings,
   riches and honour, no wonder that your own measure is recompensed into
   your bosoms. (6.) Love the brethren. This is the great day when all the
   saints meet together, and how can we expect to meet them with comfort
   if we should not love them? 1 John iv. 16, 17, That we shall have
   boldness,' &c. It will be a joyful meeting when those whom we have
   loved, prayed for, fasted with, and (if necessity did require)
   relieved, shall then be found in such esteem and honour. (7.)
   Mercifulness to the poor; see Mat. xxv. 35, 36, with 42 and 43. Christ
   hath told us aforehand what questions he will ask when he cometh--Have
   you fed? Have you visited? Have you clothed? &c. It is good that we
   should be prepared with an answer. (8.) Faithfulness in God's
   ordinances, and the matters of his house. Our Lord is gone, but he will
   come again to take an account how matters have been managed during his
   absence. The usual period which is fixed to ordinances is the Lord's
   coming to judgment: 1 Cor. xi. 26, Ye do show forth the Lord's death
   till he come;' and 1 Tim. vi. 14, Kept his commandment without spot
   until the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ.' He hath left his
   ordinances in his church as a pledge of his coming, and to keep the
   great promise still afoot; therefore above all things they should be
   kept pure and uncorrupt.

   Ver. 7. Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them, in like
   manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange
   flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal
   fire.

   In this verse is the third example, fitly suited to the former: the
   angels had the blessings of heaven, the Israelites of the church, and
   Sodom of the world. But the angels upon their apostasy lost heaven; the
   murmuring Israelites were shut out of Canaan; and the Sodomites were,
   together with their fruitful soil and pleasant land, destroyed. You see
   heaven -mercies, and church-mercies, and world-mercies, are all
   forfeited by the creatures' ingratitude. This last instance is
   propounded as the first part of a similitude, the reddition of which is
   in the next verse. In the words observe:--

   1. The places or people judged. Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities
   round about them, in like manner. Those two cities are only mentioned
   here, as also Gen. xix. 24, because the principal; in Hosea xi. 8, two
   others are only mentioned, Admah and Zeboim; but Deut. xxix. 23, all
   four are mentioned, The whole land is brimstone, salt, and burning,
   like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim, which the
   Lord overthrew in his anger and in his wrath.' Now the cities are
   mentioned rather than the persons, to note the utter destruction of the
   places, together with the inhabitants; for that clause, the cities
   about them in like manner, in the original, ton omoion toutois tropon,
   the word for them is in the masculine gender, whereas cities, the next
   antecedent, is in the feminine; therefore some refer it to the remote
   antecedent: the angels and Israelites, as they were punished, so Sodom
   and those cities in like manner. So Junius; but I suppose, because
   cities doth not only imply the places, but the inhabitants, therefore
   the masculine gender was used by the apostle.

   2. Their sin is specified, giving themselves over to fornication, and
   going after strange flesh. Here are two great sins charged upon them.
   (1.) The first is, giving themselves over to fornication,
   ekporneusasai, the word is unusual, and therefore diversely rendered.
   One translation, defile themselves with fornication, the Vulgar,
   exfornicatae, as noting the strangeness and abominableness of their
   lust; but that is implied in the next expression. Our translation fitly
   rendereth it by such a phrase as signifieth their excess and vehement
   addictedness to unclean practices. (2.) The next sin is, going after
   strange flesh. It is a modest and covert expression, implying their
   monstrous and unlawful lusts, contrary to the course and institution of
   nature, a filthiness scarce to be named, from them called Sodomies. The
   apostle Paul expresseth it thus: Rom. i. 27, Leaving the natural use of
   the woman, they burned in their lust one toward another, men with men
   working that which is unseemly.' It is called here strange flesh,
   sarkos heteras, other flesh,' as being other than what nature hath
   appointed, or because it is impossible that man and man in that
   execrable act should make one flesh,' as man and woman do. (3.) Their
   judgment is set down, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. Sodom,
   we know, and the cities round about it, were consumed by fire and
   brimstone rained down from heaven, which, though a dreadful, was but a
   temporal fire: in what sense doth the apostle call it here eternal
   fire'? Some, to mollify the seeming austerity of the phrase, read thus,
   were made an example of eternal fire, suffering vengeance, that is, in
   that judgment which was executed upon them, God would give the world a
   type and figure of hell. Others by eternal fire understand the duration
   of the effects of the first temporal punishment, the soil thereabout
   wearing the marks of God's curse to this day. Others, not much
   differing from the former, by eternal fire understand an utter
   destruction, and labour to evince it from the use of the phrase in a
   like sense, and the parallel place in Peter: 2 Peter ii. 6, He turned
   the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, and condemned them with an
   overthrow,' that is, utterly destroyed them. But why we need to be so
   tender I know not, the Sodomites being generally represented as men
   under everlasting judgment, Mat. xi. 24, and the temporal judgment
   making way for eternal, though as to the state of particular persons we
   judge not. See Rivet in Gen., Exercit. 97, p. 474.

   3. Here is the end and aim of the judgment, are set forth for an
   example, that is, to be a notable document and instruction to the world
   to keep them under the law of God; and therefore everywhere in the
   prophetic threatenings of the word is this instance alluded unto.

   The words are explained, but how shall we accommodate them to the
   apostle's purpose? I answer--Very well; there is a fit correspondency
   between the case in hand and this example; the Sodomites went after
   strange flesh, and these apostates after strange opinions. These errors
   and opinions of theirs tended to sensuality, and so still there is a
   greater suitableness. The school of Simon, the Nicolaitans, the
   Gnostics, did defile themselves with monstrous and abominable lust, as
   the Sodomites did; and therefore he threateneth them with a destruction
   like to that of Sodom, yea, with eternal fire, figured thereby;
   especially they having been formerly enlightened with some knowledge of
   the truth, which the Sodomites were not. Let me now come to the
   observations.

   Obs. 1. Cities and countries suffer for the evil of the inhabitants, as
   Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities round about them were consumed with
   fire and brimstone, and turned into a dead lake. Original sin brought
   on an original curse; Adam's fall a curse upon the whole earth: Gen.
   iii. 17, Cursed is the ground for thy sake, thorns and thistles shall
   it bring forth to thee;' and actual sins do bring on an actual curse:
   Ps. cvii. 34, He turneth a pleasant land into saltness, for the
   wickedness of them that dwell therein.' A traitor forfeits not only his
   life but his goods; so do we not only forfeit our persons, but all our
   comforts into God's hands; and it is but fit that the earth should be
   to us, after all our labours, what we are to God after all his
   husbandry bestowed upon us; we are barren of good fruits as to God, and
   so justly may the land be to us. I remember the apostle saith, The
   creature was made subject to vanity,' ouch ekousa, not willingly.' Rom.
   viii. 20; the creature hath only a natural tendency and inclination,
   and that carries it to its own good; we had free-will and choice, but
   abused it, and so brought ourselves and the creature under the bondage
   and thraldom of corruption; so that the earth, which was in tended to
   be a monument of God's glory, is now in great part a monument of God's
   displeasure and our rebellion. It is observable, on the contrary side,
   that the glorious times of the gospel are expressed by the restoration
   of the creatures, Isa. xxx. 23-26, and Isa. xi. 6-8. For as the
   condition of the servant doth depend on the master, so doth the state
   of the creature upon our conformity or disobedience to God. Well, then,
   avoid sin, if not in pity to your poor souls, in pity to the poor
   creatures, to your poor country; as David said, What have these poor
   sheep done?' So what have the creatures done that you kindle a burning
   under their glory? See Jer. ii. 15-19, The land is laid waste, and
   cities burnt without an inhabitant.' What is the cause of all this?
   Even our sins against the Lord, that a man shall be the ruin of his
   country and native soil; this should go near to us; shall we turn this
   pleasant land into saltness, and lay these dwellings waste, these
   streets into ashes? Carnal men are usually moved by carnal arguments,
   and tremble more to hear of the loss of their estates than of their
   souls; we are startled to hear of scarcity, and famine, and fires, and
   pestilences; all these are the fruits of sin.

   Obs. 2. Those cities were utterly destroyed, and accordingly is the
   destruction of Sodom put for an utter overthrow. See Isa. xiii. 19,
   Zeph. ii. 9, Jer. xlviii. 18, Jer. 1. 40, 2 Peter ii. 6. Observe
   thence, that in judgments wicked men may be brought to an utter
   destruction. The synagogue of Satan may be utterly destroyed, but not
   the city of God; in the saddest miseries there is hope of God's
   children, that their dead stock will bud and scent again: Zech. ix. 12,
   Prisoners of hope;' the cutting off of root and branch' is the judgment
   of the wicked, Mal. iv. 1. Their memorial may be blotted out, but
   Sion's cannot. It is the design of the enemies to extinguish the memory
   of the church; and many times, to appearance, there is none left, yet
   out of their ruins and ashes there springeth up a new brood and holy
   seed to God: they are sorely afflicted,' Ps. cxxix. 1, 2; yet Christ
   stands his ground; they are not wholly prevailed over; the church may
   visibly fail, but not totally. Well, then, in the midst of sad
   miseries, bless God for a remnant; it may be bad, but it is not as
   Sodom, Isa. i. 9. In times of general defection there will be two or
   three berries in the top of the uppermost bough,' Isa. xvii. 6. Some
   that may continue the name of God, and survive the church's troubles,
   that may yet praise him. Again, do not haunt with the wicked, and
   suffer your souls to enter into their secret; evil societies may be
   absolutely destroyed, root and branch. Sodom was condemned with an
   overthrow.' It is seasonable advice, Come out of her, my people, lest
   you partake of her plagues,' Rev. xviii. 4. Babylon, that was a nest
   for unclean sinners, will be made a cage for unclean birds.'

   Obs. 3. From that, and the cities about them in like manner, observe,
   likeness in sin will involve us in the same punishment; they perished,
   and the other cities in like manner:' none had safety but Lot, who
   consented not, but grieved for these impurities, 2 Peter ii. 8. God's
   wrath maketh no distinction. Quos una impietas profanavit, una
   sententia dejicit, saith Ambrose; they were found in the same sin, and
   therefore surprised by the same judgment:; The destruction of the
   transgressors and sinners shall be together,' Isa. i. 28; that is, the
   one as well as the other, by what names or titles soever distinguished.
   Why? I answer--Fellowship in evil can neither excuse sin nor keep off
   wrath. It cannot excuse sin; nothing more usual than for men to say,
   they do as others do; if you do as others do, you shall suffer as
   others do: example doth not lessen sin, but increase it, partly because
   their own act is an approbation of the act of others; imitation is a
   post constat, and so, besides your own guilt, you are guilty of their
   sins that sinned before; partly because it is hard to sin against
   example, but we sin against conscience, we allowing that in ourselves
   which we formerly condemned in another; partly because it is a sin
   against warning; to stumble at the stone at which we see others stumble
   is an error and without excuse. Say not, then, it is the fashion and
   guise, how can we do otherwise? [124] Be not conformed to the fashions
   of this world; you should be like Lot, chaste in Sodom, or like those
   Christians that were godly in Nero's court. Again, it doth not keep off
   wrath; multitudes and single persons are all one to avenging justice;
   the devouring burning of God's wrath can break through briars and
   thorns. It is said, Prov. xi. 21, Though hand join in hand, the wicked
   shall not be unpunished.' Confederations and societies in evil are as
   nothing to the power of God, though sometimes the sons of Zeruiah,
   powerful oppressors, with their combined interests, may be too hard for
   men. Well, then, learn to live by rule and not by example, and propose
   the sins of others to your grief, not imitation: Have no fellowship
   with the unfruitful works of darkness, but reprove them rather,' Eph.
   v.; their practice will never afford you excuse nor exemption. Your
   duty is to be good in a wicked age, fresh, like fish in the salt water.
   Follow not a multitude to do evil,' wickedness is never the less odious
   because it is more common; it is not safe always to keep the road; the
   bad way is known by the breadth of it, and the much company in it, Mat.
   vii. 13. To walk with God is praiseworthy, though none do it besides
   thyself; and to walk with men in the way of sin is dangerous, though
   millions do it besides thee.

   Obs. 4. Again, from that, and the cities about them in like manner. The
   lesser cities imitated the greater; Admah and Zeboim followed the
   example of Sodom and Gomorrah. An error in the first concoction is
   seldom mended in the second; if sin pass the heads and chiefs of the
   people, it is taken up by others under their command. When the first
   sheet is done off, others are printed by the same stamps. Magistrates
   are public fountains of good or evil to the people over whom they are
   set. If they be cold and careless in the worship of God, given to
   contempt of the ministry, enemies to reformation, it will be generally
   taken up as a fashion by others. When the head is sick, the whole heart
   is faint,' Isa. i. 5. Diodorus Siculus telleth us of a people in
   Ethiopia, that if their kings halted, they would maim themselves that
   they might halt likewise; if they wanted an eye, in a foolish imitation
   they would make themselves blind, that they might comply even with the
   defects and diseases of their princes. The vices of them in place and
   power are authorised by their example and pass for virtues; if they be
   slight in the use of ordinances, it will be taken up as a piece of
   religion by inferiors to be so too.

   Obs. 5. From the first crime here specified, giving themselves over to
   fornication, that adulterous uncleanness doth much displease God. When
   they were given over to fornication they were given over to judgment.
   (1.) This is a sin that doth not only defile the soul but the body: 1
   Cor. vi. 18, Every sin that a man doth is without the body, but he that
   committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.' Most other sins
   imply an injury done to others, to God or our neighbour. This more
   directly an injury to ourselves, to our own bodies. It is a wrong to
   the body, considered either as our vessel,' 1 Thes. iv. 4, or as the
   temple of the Holy Ghost,' 1 Cor. vi. 19. If you consider it as our
   vessel or instrument for natural uses, you wrong it by
   uncleanness--namely, as it destroyeth the health of the body, quencheth
   the vigour of it, and blasteth the beauty, and so it is self-murder. If
   you consider it as the temple of the Holy Ghost, it is a dishonour to
   the body to make it a channel for lust to pass through. Shall we make a
   sty of a temple? abuse that to so vile a purpose which the Holy Ghost
   hath chosen to dwell in, to plant it into Christ as a part of his
   mystical body, to use it as an instrument in God's service, and finally
   to raise it out of the grave, and conform it to Christ's glorious body?
   The dignity of the body well considered is a great preservative against
   lust. (2.) It brawneth the soul; the softness of all sensual pleasures
   hardeneth the heart, but this sin, being the consummate act of
   sensuality, much more: Hosea iv. 11, Whoredom and wine take away the
   heart.' These two are mentioned because usually they go together, and
   both take away the heart, besot the conscience, take away the
   tenderness of the affections. So that men are not ashamed of sin,
   insensible of danger, and unfit for duty, and so grow sapless,
   careless, senseless. (3.) Next to the body and soul there is the name,
   now it blotteth the name: Prov. vi. 33, A wound and a dishonour shall
   he get, and a reproach that shall not be wiped off.' Sensual wickedness
   is most disgraceful, as having turpitude in it, and being sooner
   discerned than spiritual. (4.) It blasteth the estate: Heb. xiii. 4,
   Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge;' he will judge others, but
   surely these, and that remarkably in this life. (5.) This doth
   exceedingly pervert the order of human societies; Solomon maketh it
   worse than theft, Prov. vi. 29-32. A thief stealeth out of necessity,
   but here is no cogent necessity; the loss here is not reparable, as
   that which is made by theft. It bringeth in great confusion, in
   families, &c., therefore adultery under the law was punished by death,
   which theft was not. (6.) It is a sin usually accompanied with
   impenitency--namely, as it weareth out remorse, and every spark of good
   conscience. Bead those cutting places: Prov. xxii. 14, The mouth of a
   strange woman is a deep pit, and he that is abhorred of the Lord shall
   fall therein;' so Prov. ii. 19, None that go unto her return again; nor
   do they take hold of the ways of life.' So see Eccles. vii. 26-28. It
   is a sin into which God useth to give over reprobates. Solomon saith he
   knew but one returning. Well, then, be not drunk with the wine of
   Sodom, and do not squeeze out the clusters of Gomorrah. Whoredom is a
   deep ditch or gulf, wherein those that are abhorred of the Lord are
   suffered to fall. Beware of all tendings that way; do not soak and
   steep the soul in pleasures; take heed of effeminacy, ma'lakoi: The
   soft or effeminate shall not enter into the kingdom of God,' 1 Cor. vi.
   9. Beware of lustful glances, Mat. v. 28, of rolling the fancy upon
   undone [125] objects; heart defilement maketh way for corporal; lust
   beginneth in wanton eyes many times, and it is fed by a delicacy and
   unworthy softness. Guard the senses, cut off' the provisions of the
   flesh, avoid occasions, be employed. Again, if you have stumbled into
   this deep ditch, repent the more speedily, the more seriously; the case
   is sad, but not altogether desperate. We read of a possibility for
   publicans and harlots entering into the kingdom of God. Bewail your
   estate as David doth, Ps. li. His adultery left a stain upon him:
   Except in the matter of Uriah,' &c. Job saith, It is a fire that
   consumeth to destruction, and will root out all your increase,' Job
   xxxi. 12; therefore quench it the sooner, &c.

   Obs. 6. Again, from the other sin, and going after strange flesh,
   observe, sin is never at a stay; first, uncleanness, and then given
   over to uncleanness, and then strange flesh. When a stone runneth down
   hill it stayeth not till it cometh to the bottom; a filthy sinner is
   growing more filthy still, until he hath outgrown the heart of a man,
   as the Sodomites did, men with men working that which is unseemly,' a
   sin which none but a devil in the likeness of a man would commit, a sin
   that hath filthiness enough in it to defile the tongue that speaketh of
   it. Well, then, here is a glass wherein to see the wickedness of our
   natures. Who would think reason should invent so horrid an act? Rom. i.
   27. They had no more original corruption than thou and I have. If God
   remove the bridle, whither shall we run? Let wicked men consider hence
   how foolishly they promise themselves immunity from drunkenness,
   adultery, or any gross wickedness. Caution any of them against those
   things. No, I warrant you, say they; do you think I am such a wretch?
   Is thy servant a dog?' 2 Kings viii. 13.

   Obs. 7. From that, the vengeance of eternal fire. The wicked Sodomites
   were not only burnt up by that temporal judgment, but cast into hell,
   which is here called eternal fire.' Hell is set forth by two notions: A
   worm that never dieth, and a fire that never goeth out,' Mark ix. 44.
   In both which expressions there is an allusion to the worms that breed
   in dead bodies, and the fire wherewith they were wont to burn their
   dead in former times; and the one implieth the worm of conscience, the
   other the fire of God's wrath.

   1. The worm is bred in the body itself, and therefore fitly
   representeth the gnawings of conscience. The worm of conscience
   consisteth in three things, There is memoria praeteritorum, sensus
   praesentium, et metus futurorum. First, Conscience worketh on what is
   past, the remembrance of their former enjoyments and past pleasures:
   Luke xvi. 25, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime,' &c. So of time
   wasted, opportunities of grace slighted, the folly of their own choice,
   &c., all which are sad reflections to them. Secondly, There is a sense
   of the present pain. Here when they were corrected they were senseless,
   like stocks and stones; but then, there being nothing to mitigate their
   grief or beguile the sense of it, no carnal pleasures wherein to steep
   conscience, there must needs be sense and feeling, joined with a bitter
   discontent at their condition. Thirdly, For the future their condition
   is hopeless; despair is one ingredient into their torment: Heb. x. 27,
   There remaineth nothing but a fearful looking for the fiery indignation
   of the Lord.' Thus for the worm.

   2. The next notion is that of the text, fire, or the wrath of God
   transacted upon them. In the sufferings of the damned God hath an
   immediate hand, Heb. x. 31; no creature is strong enough to convey all
   his wrath. In bearing this wrath, the capacity of the creature is
   enlarged to the uttermost; and in their punishment God sets himself
   a-work to show the glory of his strength.' Rom. ix. 22. He upholdeth
   the creature with one hand, and punisheth it with the other; if his
   anger be but kindled a little,' and a spark of it fly into the
   conscience, the poor creature is at his wits' end: but how dreadful
   will their portion be against whom he stirreth Up all his wrath?' Ps.
   lxxviii. 38. The human nature of the Lord Christ in a just abhorrency
   recoiled when he was to taste of this cup. We, that cannot endure the
   gripes of the cholic, the torment of the stone, the pain of the rack,
   how shall we dwell with devouring burnings?' and all this is for ever.
   As our obligations to God are infinite, and as we turn back upon
   eternal happiness offered in the gospel, and as the majesty offended by
   sin is infinite, so that we cannot restore the honour to God which we
   have taken away, therefore by just reason is our punishment eternal. In
   the other world men are in their final estate; the fuel continueth for
   ever, the creature is not abolished, and the fire continueth for ever,
   the breath of the living Lord still keepeth the flame burning. We think
   a prayer long, a sermon long; what will hell be? In the night, if we
   cannot sleep, we count the hours, and every minute seems tedious. Oh!
   what will they do that are tormented night and day for ever and ever'?
   Rev. xx. 10. Now this is the portion of all that forget God. Oh! who
   would run this hazard for a little temporal satisfaction? The scourges
   of conscience that we meet with here are too great price for the short
   pleasures of a brutish lust, much more the worm that never dieth, the
   fire that shall never be quenched.'

   Obs. 8. There is one note more, and that is from that clause, are set
   forth for an example. Observe thence, that Sodom's destruction is the
   world's great example. Both Peter and Jude show that this was the end
   of God's judgments upon Sodom, that they might be an example to all
   that live ungodly.'

   You will say, What have we to do with Sodom? their sins being so
   unnatural, their judgments so unusual. (1.) As to their sins, I
   inquire, Are there none of Sodom's sins amongst us? If not going after
   strange flesh,' yet fornication;' if not fornication, yet pride and
   idleness, and fulness of bread?' I say again, though our sins be not so
   great in themselves, yet by necessary circumstance and aggravation,
   they may be greater; as impenitency, unbelief, abuse and neglect of the
   gospel, despising the offers of grace. The grossest sins against the
   law are not so great as sins against the gospel: Mat. xi. 24, It shall
   be more tolerable for Sodom,' &c. We sin against more light, more love,
   &c. (2.) As to the judgments, though God doth not now-a-days smite a
   country with judgments immediately from heaven, or make it utterly
   unuseful, as he did Sodom, yet his displeasure is no less against sin;
   and if not the same, a like judgment, one very grievous, may come upon
   us.

   This being premised, let us come to open this example, in which these
   three things are considerable:--(1.) The state of Sodom; (2.) The sins
   of Sodom; (3.) The judgment. The first will show you God's mercy; the
   second, their guilt; the third, God's justice. Usually these three
   follow one another; great mercies make way for great sins, and great
   sins for great judgments.

   1. I begin with the state of Sodom. There--(1.) The quality of the
   place. There were sundry goodly cities, of which Sodom was the
   principal, fairly situated in the plain of Jordan, full of people, and
   well supplied with corn, wine, oil, and all earthly contentments. It is
   said, Gen. xiii. 10, Sodom was pleasant, and as the garden of the
   Lord.' And yet afterwards this was the place which was the scene of so
   much wrath and utter desolation. What may the world learn from hence?
   That we must give an account for common mercies. God reckoned with the
   servant that had but one talent, Mat. xxv. The world is a place of
   trial, all men have a trust committed to them. The talents of the
   heathens were fruitful seasons, food and gladness,' Acts xiv. 17. God,
   that never left himself ama'rturon, without a witness,' hath left us
   anapologe'tous, without excuse:' a plentiful soil doth not argue a good
   people, but a good God. Sodom was pleasantly and richly situated. If we
   bad nothing else to answer for but an island of blessings, how poorly
   have we discharged this trust? (2.) Take notice of their late
   deliverance. Four kings made war upon them, by whom they were carried
   captive, and rescued by Abraham, Gen. xiv. 15, 16. Deliverances from
   war and. captivity leave a great engagement. When God hath once spared
   us, if we repent not, the next turn is utter destruction. Deliverances,
   if not improved, are but reprievals; we are not so much preserved, as
   reserved to a greater misery; hoisted up that our fall may be the more
   dreadful, snatched out of one misery that we may be cast into a worse.
   Oh! what have we to answer for our late deliverances! Sodom was but
   once saved in war, we many times. It is to be feared that passage
   recordeth our doom, Ps. cvi. 43, Many times did he deliver them, but
   they provoked him by their counsel, and were brought low for their
   iniquity.' Deliverances not improved are pledges of certain ruin. (3.)
   God's patience in bearing with them. Sodom for a long time slept
   quietly in its sins unmolested, undisturbed. The sins of Sodom cry to
   me.' [126] The Lord proffered Abraham, if there were but ten righteous
   persons found there, he would spare the cities. In four cities not ten
   righteous persons! God is silent as long as their sins would let him be
   quiet; but then, when he could no longer bear, he goeth down to take
   vengeance. How long doth the Lord protract the ruin of these wicked
   cities? Justice is his strange work,' but it is his work; mercy does
   much with God, but not all; justice must be heard, especially when it
   pleadeth on behalf of abused mercy. God, that would spare the sinner,
   yet hateth the sin. When a people do nothing but weary justice and
   abuse mercy, the Lord will rain from the Lord,' &c., [127] Gen. xix.
   24. Christ will interpose for such a people's destruction; heaven will
   rain down hell upon a people so obstinately wicked. The Lord is
   gracious, but not senseless. As he will not always contend, so not
   always forbear. (4.) Lot's admonition; it seemeth he frequently
   reproved them, and therefore do they scorn him: Gen. xix. 9, This one
   fellow came to sojourn amongst us, and he will needs be a judge.' His
   soul was not only vexed with those lewd courses, but, as occasion was
   offered, he sought to dissuade them. Thence learn that God seldom
   punisheth without warning: the old world had Noah's ministry, and Sodom
   Lot's admonitions. The Lord may say to every punished people, as Reuben
   to his brethren, Did not I warn you, and you would not hear?' Gen.
   xlii. 22. Seldom doth he hew a people with the sword but first he
   heweth them by prophets: means of conviction aggravate both the sin and
   the judgment. Ah! we have a clearer light, and therefore must expect a
   heavier doom, Mat. x. 15. Sins are aggravated not only by the foulness
   of the act. but the degrees of light against which they are committed.
   Sodom sinned sorely as to the act, but they could not sin against so
   much light as we do; therefore it shall be easier for them at the day
   of judgment. (5.) They had the benefit of magistracy; those were cities
   that were brought into government. We read of the king of Sodom,' Gen.
   xiv. 2; but it seems he did not interpose his authority, but rather
   connive at and tolerate the wickedness of this people, yea, rather
   approve and partake with them in their abominations. Consider, when the
   vices of inferiors are dissembled and winked at by governors, the Lord
   himself taketh the matter in hand; and then look for nothing but speedy
   ruin. The guilt of a nation is much increased when sin is tolerated,
   yea, favoured and countenanced; especially when righteousness is rather
   restrained and curbed than sin, as the affronts done to Lot witnessed;
   the end why magistracy was ordained is then perverted, 1 Tim. ii. 2,
   Rom. xiii. 5, namely, for the punishment of evil-doers,' and that
   goodness be encouraged: they were punished for allowing the filthiness
   of strange flesh. What will become of us if magistrates should be
   careless and wink at, yea, countenance, strange opinions, as horrid and
   as much against the light of Christianity as that was against the light
   of nature.

   2. Let us look upon the sins of Sodom. See Ezek. xvi. 49, Lo! this was
   the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and
   abundance of idleness; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor
   and needy;' to which add the sins of the text, and then this black roll
   is complete. I shall consider--(1.) The sins; (2.) The aggravations.

   [1.] The sins. (1.) Pride. It is hard to enjoy plenty and not to grow
   haughty. Prosperous winds soon fill the sails, but, blowing too
   strongly, overturn the vessel; how few are able to carry a full cup
   without spilling? to manage plenty without pride? Men grow rich and
   then high-minded, and that is the next way to ruin. (2.) Idleness; an
   easy, careless life maketh way for danger. God sent all into the world
   for action; standing pools putrify, and things not used contract rust;
   so do idle persons settle into vile and degenerate lusts. (3.) Fulness
   of bread; that is, corporal delights: Luke xvii. 28, They ate, they
   drank, they bought, they sold, they build ed;' their whole lives were
   but a diversion from one pleasure to another. How soon are earthly
   comforts abused into luxury and excess! Fulness of estate maketh way
   for fulness of bread, and many beastly sins. (4.) Unmercifulness. You
   never knew any prodigal but they were' also uncharitable, as Sodom
   here, and the epicure, Luke xvi.; and you shall see James v. 4, 5,
   those that nourished their hearts as in a day of slaughter,' oppressed
   the labourers. They that set their hearts for ease and pleasure, know
   not the bitterness of grief, and therefore do not compassionate it in
   others, Amos vi. 6. (5.) Uncleanness and fornication. This followeth on
   the former; fulness of bread must be emptied and unladed in lust. (6.)
   That beastly wickedness implied in the text. When the angels came to
   destroy them, because they were of a comely visage, they came raging at
   the doors, Gen. xix., as usually wickedness is increased to the height
   when God cometh to punish it. Well, then, if we put all these together,
   they were a lazy, easy, secure, oppressing, filthy, and unclean people.
   We may wonder more at God's patience, that he bore with them so long,
   than at his justice, that he punished them so sorely.

   [2.] The aggravations. (1.) Shamelessness: Isa. iii. 9, They declare
   their sin as Sodom, they publish it as Gomorrah;' when a people are
   past shame they are past hope; such do dare God to punish them. (2.)
   Contempt of reproof, a sure forerunner of ruin, when the reprover of
   sin is blamed more than the actor. Lot seemed as one that mocked,' Gen.
   xix. 14. When God's messengers are contemned, he can hold no longer.

   [3.] Their judgment. The Lord rained from the Lord fire and brim stone
   upon them.' Observe here--(1.) The suddenness; the sun shone in the
   morning as at other times, Gen. xix. 23; they had not the least fear of
   any such mischief at hand. God usually surpriseth a people in their
   security; after a great calm cometh a storm: Perish in the midway,' Ps.
   ii. 11, in their full career, when they dream of no such matter. (2.)
   The equity: the sin was like the punishment. They first burned with
   lusts, and then with fire; they burned with vile un natural lusts, and
   therefore, against the ordinary course of nature, fire falleth down
   from heaven. In this fire there was a stink for their filthiness. [128]
   Thus doth God retaliate. Nadab and Abihu offered strange fire, and they
   were consumed with strange fire coming down from heaven. Job,
   professing his innocency in case of adultery, saith, Otherwise let my
   wife grind to another, and a stranger bow down upon her,' Job xxxi. 10,
   implying that God would punish him in his own bed, if he had violated
   another's. In the Gospel we read, Luke xvi., that he was denied a drop
   that would not give a crumb, &c. (3.) Observe the power of God. God a
   little before had drowned the world with water, now he consumeth Sodom
   by fire; all the elements are at his beck, the creatures are his hosts,
   Job xxxvii. 6. If God say, Be thou upon the earth,' they presently
   obey. If we find sins, God will find punishments; he can execute
   judgments by contrary means, now drown and then burn. (4.) The severity
   of God; he raineth down fire and brimstone, which is a map and type of
   hell, Isa. xxx. 33; Rev. xxi. 15. The calamities that light upon the
   godly are a token of heaven,' Phil. i. 28; namely, as they work to
   purify us from sin; but those on the wicked are types of hell,
   preambles to future woes, as darkness on the Egyptians was a figure of
   utter darkness. So these were first turned to destruction, and then
   into hell. It is sad to think of the judgment past; worse of judgment
   to come.

   Thus God delighteth to make those that have been examples to others in
   sinning, examples to them in punishment.

   Ver. 8. Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise
   dominion, and speak evil of dignities.

   In this verse you have the apodosis of the former instance: likewise is
   the adverb that implieth the connection between the two terms of a
   comparison; they perished that went after strange flesh, so these
   filthy dreamers that defile the flesh, &c., shall perish. In the words
   you may observe--(1.) A description of their persons, filthy dreamers.
   (2.) A discovery of their sins; two are mentioned in this verse. (1st.)
   Akatharsi'a, their impurity, they defile the flesh. (2d.) Ataxi'a,
   their tumultuous carriage towards superiors, expressed in two phrases:
   First, They despise dominion; secondly, They speak evil of dignities.
   What these two phrases import is some question. Some think the first
   noteth their judgment and affection, the second, their speech and
   practice. Some think two kinds of government are here understood, and
   refer despising of dominion to contempt of magistracy and public
   government, and speaking evil of dignities to the private government of
   masters, 1 Tim. vi. 12, which was also despised by these wretches under
   the pretence of Christian liberty. Others more properly understand the
   first clause of civil government, usually expressed in scripture by
   ku'riotes, or domination; and speaking evil of dignities is fitly
   referred to the traducing and opposing of government and governors
   ecclesiastical, as apostles, pastors, teachers, and elders. The
   officers of the church are called do'xa, the glory of Christ,' 2 Cor.
   viii. 23, and what we translate speak evil of dignities, is in the
   original speak evil of glories; but of this more anon.

   Let me open the words: Likewise. In the original there are many words,
   omoios mentoi kai houtoi, likewise, notwithstanding; that is, though
   there be so many and such apparent instances of God's judgment, and
   those set before us for an example, yet they, being blinded with their
   wicked passions, are not afraid, but boldly cast themselves upon the
   hazard of the same ruin. Filthy dreamers; the word in the original is
   enupniazomenoi, led, inspired, or acted by dreams, or deluded by
   dreams. Beza rendereth it sopiti, being lulled asleep, as noting their
   security. I suppose rather the dotage of error, by which they were as
   it were bewitched and enchanted. Our translation seemeth to carry it
   another Way, as applying it to nocturnal pollutions, because dreaming
   is joined with defiling the flesh. And Peter chargeth these persons
   with rolling their fancies upon unclean objects, 1 Peter ii. 14; or,
   possibly, it may be taken literally, the persons here noted pretending
   to dreams inspired by associate and assistant spirits, see Euseb., lib.
   iv. cap. 7. The next phrase is defile the flesh; that is, pollute
   themselves with libidinous practices: 2 Peter ii. 10, They walked after
   the flesh in the lust of uncleanness,' and that under a pretence of the
   gospel, vide Irenaeum passim de Haer. Valentin. The Nicolaitans taught
   community of wives, and that it was an indifferent thing to commit
   adultery, Rev. ii. 6, 14. The Gnostics gave themselves up to all manner
   of prodigious and incestuous pollutions; whence, from their obscenity
   and beastly life, they were called Borborites. See again Euseb. Epihan.
   Haer. 26, lib. iv. cap. 7. How many ways they did defile the flesh we
   cannot with modesty express. The heathens, who made no distinction,
   charged these impurities upon the Christians in the general, as if they
   used the unlawful company of their mothers and sisters, &c. The next
   phrase is despise dominion, athetountes. The word athetein signifieth
   to remove a thing out of its place with some scorn and indignation; and
   so it implieth their utter enmity to civil policy and government: 2
   Peter ii. 10, They despise government, presumptuous are they, and
   self-willed,' Kurio'teta, dominion. Some apply this to the dominion of
   Christ, which by their fables of the Æones or lords rulers they did set
   at nought; but of that in the 4th verse. But now he speaks of the
   government of men, and there is an emphasis in the word kurio'teta,
   dominion, which is more than if he had said kuri'ous, rulers; for they
   did not only despise their magistrates, or men invested with
   superiority, but magistracy itself, as a thing unfitting for believers,
   and such as were made free by Christ, to endure. The last part of the
   charge is they speak evil of dignities, or, as it is in the original,
   blaspheme glories; by which some understand angels, as Clemens
   Alexandrinus; these impure heretics devising things unworthy and
   misbeseeming the angels; rather, I suppose, it implieth their scorns,
   curses, and reproaches cast upon the officers of the church, who are
   the glory of Christ, and the practice is afterward compared with the
   rebellion of Korah, who rose up, not only against Moses, but Aaron,
   Num. xi. In the whole you have a lively description of our modern
   ranters, levellers, familists, quakers, who, by dreams, are led on to
   defile the flesh, and to despise all authority, both in church and
   commonwealth, and that with bitter curses and evil speakings, so that
   our days afford us but too clear a comment on the expressions of this
   scripture; it is sadly fulfilled before our eyes. I come to the
   observations.

   Obs. 1. From that filthy dreamers; note, that the erroneous thoughts of
   wicked men are but a dream. It is but friar-like to follow an illusion
   too far; only a little for illustration. Wicked men are dreamers--(1.)
   In regard of their state and condition, every carnal man is in a state
   of a deep sleep,' Isa. xxix. 10; snorting upon the bed of ease, without
   any sense of the danger of their condition, as Jonah in the ship was
   found asleep when the storm arose. They sleep, but their damnation
   sleepeth not,' 2 Peter ii. 3. (2.) In regard of the suitableness
   between their vain thoughts and a dream. A dream, you know, tickleth
   with a false delight, and deceiveth with a vain hope.

   1. Tickleth with a false delight: they hug a cloud, as we say, instead
   of Juno, and embrace the contentments and pleasures of the world in
   stead of the true riches; a carnal man's running from pleasure to
   pleasure is but a sweet dream, a fit of mirth and pleasure while
   conscience is asleep: They walk in a vain show,' Ps. xxxix. 6; they
   imagine a great deal of felicity and contentment in their condition;
   but when they come to warm themselves by their own sparks, they lie
   down in sorrow,' Isa. l. 11.

   2. Deceiveth with a vain hope, as where the prophet compareth the dream
   of the enemies of the church to the dream of a night vision, Isa. xxix.
   7, 8, And it shall be as an hungry man dreameth, and be hold he eateth,
   but he awaketh and his soul is empty; or when as a thirsty man
   dreameth, and behold he drinketh, but he awaketh, and behold he is
   faint, and his soul hath appetite.' So it is with them, all their hopes
   are dashed in an instant. The foolish virgins slept, Mat. xxv., and
   when they slept they dreamed that the door of grace would still be open
   to them, but they found it shut. Many flatter themselves with fair
   hopes till they awake in flames, but then all is gone.

   Take heed, then, of being deceived by your own dreams, and the fictions
   of your own brain; there are no dreams so foolish as those we dream
   waking, as Epiphanus saith of the Gnostics; it was not enupni'asis tou
   u'pnou, a sleeping dream that they were guilty of, but lerologi'a
   psu'ches os di' u'pnou legome'nes, the dotage of their minds, putting
   them upon fancies as monstrous and incoherent as men's thoughts in a
   dream. Waking dreams are most pernicious. There are two sorts of these
   dreams--(1.) Dreams in point of opinion, when we hug error instead of
   truth. (2.) Dreams in point of hope, when we cherish presumption
   instead of faith.

   1. Dreams in opinion, which are very rife now; the old world is apt to
   dote. [129] Idle and ungrounded notions, how plausible soever, are but
   the dreams of a misty sleepy brain. To prevent these take these
   rules--(1.) If you would beware of dreams, beware of a blind mind. Men
   sleep in the dark, and in sleep fancy gets the start of reason;
   indistinct thoughts do easily dispose to error, and a half light will
   certainly abuse you: The simple believeth every word,' Prov. xiv. 15.
   (2.) Suffer not yourselves to be blinded, First, Not by vile
   affections: men would fain have that true which is pleasing, and most
   accommodate to their own interests. Vile affection taketh away the
   light of reason, and leaveth us only the pride of reason; and therefore
   none so confident and touchy in their opinions as they that are misled
   by lusts and interests. How easily do we exasperate our minds, and
   invent prejudices against a hated truth! If the weights be equal, yet
   if the balances be not equal, wrong will be done. When the heart is
   biassed before the search, and swayed with some carnal desire or
   interest, the judgment is obscured and cannot consider of the weight of
   what is alleged; there is an idol in the heart. Secondly, By vulgar
   prejudice. That the devil may keep the world asleep, it is his usual
   trick to burden the ways of God with clamour and vulgar prejudice. A
   dream or lie dareth not combat with truth in open field, and therefore
   fortifieth against it with popular arguments, that the ways of God may
   be suspected rather than tried; and usually it falleth that error is
   more specious at the first blush, God's providence suffering his own
   ways to be under the cross and the world's displeasure. Now, in such a
   case, men keep at a distance, and are loath to search lest they meet
   with trouble of conscience for not obeying the truth, or trouble from
   the world for crossing their customs and fashions. Thirdly, By personal
   administration in spiritual things; we learn to dream from one another,
   Deut. xiii. 3, Zech. x. 2. No man must be set up in God's chair, and
   their dictates followed as if they were infallible.

   Study the word, else there is no light in what is brought to you, Isa.
   viii. 20; it is but only a dream and dotage of men's brains, and the
   closer you keep to the letter of the word the better. Many are
   perverted by mystical interpretations, when men bring that to the word
   which they do do not find there; the letter must not be receded from as
   long as it is capable of any commodious interpretation. Now this word
   must be hidden in the heart,' Ps. cxix. 9, and dwell in us richly,'
   Col. iii. 16.

   2. There are dreams in point of hope; and so--(1.) Some wholly mistake
   in the object, and dream of an eternal happiness in temporal
   enjoyments, Ps. xlix. 11; so Luke xii. 19, Rev. xviii. 9. (2.) Others
   dream of attaining the end without using the means; they live in sin,
   and yet hope to die comfortably, and go to heaven at length for all
   that, as if it were but an easy and sudden leap from Delilah's lap to
   Abraham's bosom; and the pleasures of sin for a season' would be no
   hindrance to the enjoyment of the pleasures at God's right hand for
   ever more;' a vain dream, see Luke xvi. 25, and James v. 5. (3.) Others
   mistake about the means, because they have a cold form; they are apt to
   be conceited of their spiritual condition and estate, Rev. iii. 17. If
   you would not dream in this kind, examine your hearts often;
   examination is like a rubbing of the eyes after sleep, and reviving of
   conscience the recollection of our dreams; a man laugheth at his dreams
   when he is awake, and when fancy is cited before the tribunal of God,
   vain apprehensions fly away. Again, be sober and watchful,' 1 Peter v.
   9, 2 Thes. v. 6. Confessing sin it is telling our dream when we are
   awake and come to ourselves.

   Obs. 2. From that defile the flesh, observe that dreams of error
   dispose to practices of sin and uncleanness, and impurity of religion
   is usually joined with uncleanness of body, which cometh to pass partly
   by the just judgment of God, who punisheth spiritual fornication with
   bodily: Hosea iv. 12, 13, They have gone a-whoring from their God,
   therefore their daughters shall commit whoredom, and their spouses
   adultery.' That is God's course, that the odiousness of the one may
   make them see the heinousness of the other; see Rom. i. 24. Partly by
   the influence of error; [130] it perverteth the heart; a frame of truth
   preserveth the awe of God in the soul, and a right belief maketh the
   manners orthodox: all sins are rooted in wrong thoughts of God, 3 John
   11, either in unbelief or misbelief: unbelief is the mother of sin, and
   misbelief the nurse of it; it springeth from distrust, and is
   countenanced by error. Partly because the design of most errors is to
   put the soul into a liberty which God never allowed. Some errors come
   from the pride of reason, because it will not veil and strike sail to
   faith; but most come from vile affection;' a carnal heart must be
   gratified with a carnal doctrine: 2 Peter ii. 19, They promise
   liberty,' &c. Errors are but a device to cast off Christ's yoke, and to
   lull the conscience asleep in a course of disobedience. Well, then,
   avoid error of judgment if you would avoid filthiness of conversation;
   men first dream, and then defile the flesh; abominable impurities
   (unless temper of nature and posture of interests hinder) are the usual
   fruit of evil opinions. Truth is the root of holiness: Sanctify them by
   thy truth; thy word is truth,' John xvii. 17. God's blessing goeth with
   his own doctrine, 1 Peter i. 22. Again, those that have taken up the
   profession of a right way of religion should beware of staining it by
   such kind of practices. Nothing maketh the ways of God suspected so
   much as the scandals of those that profess to walk in them: Walk in the
   light as children of the light,' Eph. v., otherwise you will be a
   reproach to the truth, and deprive it of its testimony.

   Obs. 3. Again, observe that sin is a defilement; it staineth and
   darkeneth the glory of a man, Mat. xv. 20. This defilement was implied
   in the washings of the ceremonial law, and in baptism; we are washed as
   soon as we are born, because we are sinners as soon as we are born.
   Surely they that glory in sin do but glory in their own shame; it is
   but as if a man should boast of his own dung, and count his spittle an
   ornament; when you count graceless swearing, mightiness to drink,
   revenge, pride, a glory to you, you do the same: there is nothing
   maketh us stink in God's nostrils but sin: Ps. xiv. 3, They are
   altogether become filthy;' so much sin as you have about you, so much
   nastiness. Gain is pleasant to those that are taken with that kind of
   lust, but the scripture calleth it filthy lucre,' 1 Tim. iii. 3; all
   sins are compared to filthy garments,' Zech. iii. 4, Jude 19, and Isa.
   xxx. 22. Desire to be washed, and that thoroughly, Ps. li. 2.

   Obs. 4. Again observe, that of all sins, the sin of uncleanness or
   unlawful copulation is most defiling. It defileth the whole man, but
   chiefly the body; and therefore it is said they defile the flesh. It
   staineth the soul with filthy thoughts, Mat. xv. 20; it staineth the
   name, Prov. vi. 33; but in a singular manner it polluteth the body, 1
   Cor. vi. 18. In all other outward sins, though the body be the
   instrument, yet it is not the object of them. All other sins do abuse
   objectum extra positum (as Piscator explaineth it), as a drunkard,
   wine; an epicure, meats; a worldling, riches. All these are objects
   without us; but here the body is not only the instrument, but the
   object: Rom. i. 24, God gave them up to uncleanness to dishonour their
   own bodies.' So see 1 Thes. iv. 4. It wasteth the strength and beauty
   of the body, Prov. v. 9-11, hindereth our serviceableness, and doth not
   consider that this body is consecrated to God, Rom. xii. 1, and 1 Cor.
   vi. 15; a temple of the Holy Ghost,' 1 Cor. vi. 19; interested in hopes
   of glory, Phil. iii. 21; and therefore puts it to so vile a use as to
   be an instrument of lust. Christians, shall those eyes which are
   consecrated to God, to behold his works, be windows to let in sin? 2
   Peter ii. 14; that body which is the Holy Ghost's temple, be made the
   member of a harlot,' and so wasted in the service of lust as to become
   a clog to us, and wholly useless as to any gracious purposes? Are not
   your beauty, health, strength, concernments too good to be spent upon
   so vile an interest? Take heed, then, of all uncleanness, both
   conjugal, consisting in excess and immoderation of lust in. the married
   estate, si vinum ex apothecâ tuâ, &c., you may not be drunk with your
   own wine, nor quench the vigour of nature by excess in those pleasures
   which the laws of God and men do allow you; and also of uncleanness
   adulterous, which is more brutish, when men scat ter their lusts
   promiscuously, without confinement to one object.

   06s. 5. From that despise dominion. Observe that errors, especially
   such as tend to sensuality, make men unruly and anti-magistratical.
   Dreamers that do defile themselves,' do also despise dominion.' Now
   this cometh to pass, partly from the permission of God's wise and just
   providence, who suffereth such miscarriages to awaken the magistrate to
   a care of truth, if not in zeal for God's glory, yet out of a sense of
   his own interest, and upon reason of state, the commonwealth being
   troubled by those who first began to trouble the church, oi peri` ta
   theia xeni'zontes pollou`s anapei'thousin allotrionomein; new doctrines
   put men after an itch upon new laws, and false religions are usually
   turbulent; partly because persons loose and erroneous would free
   themselves from all awe, both of God and man, as it is said of the
   unjust judge, that he feared neither God nor man,' Luke xviii. So with
   those men. Error taketh off the dread of God, and sedition the dread of
   the magistrate, that so they may more freely defile the flesh. God hath
   two deputies to keep a sinner under awe--conscience and the magistrate.
   Now false doctrine benumbeth conscience, and then that all authority
   may be laid aside, the rights of the magistrate are invaded, that as
   conscience may not stand in the way of their lust, so not the
   magistrate in the way of their sin. That there were anciently such
   libertines in the church appeareth by Gal. v. 13, and 1 Peter ii. 16,
   and 1 Cor. vii. 20-23. Vain man would fain be free and yokeless,
   neither would he have his heart subject to God, nor his actions to
   man's censure. Partly because all errors are rooted in obstinacy, and
   that will bewray itself, not only in divine and spiritual, but in civil
   things: see 2 Peter ii. 10, But chiefly them that walk after the flesh
   in the lust of uncleanness. Presumptuous are they and self-willed; they
   are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.' Usually errors sear the
   conscience, and give the sinner a front and boldness, so that God is
   not only dishonoured, but civil societies disturbed, as Nazianzen
   observeth of the Arians. They began in blasphemous language against
   Christ, but end in tumultuous carriage against the peace of the
   commonwealth; for, saith he, how shall we hope that they will spare men
   that would not spare God? [131] Often it falleth out that they that
   please not God' are also contrary to all men,' 1 Thes. ii. 15. Tully, a
   heathen, ob serveth the same, Pietate adversus Deos sublatâ, fides
   etiam et societas humani generis, &c. Partly because opposition to
   magistracy is a kind of indirect blow and aim at God, and that either
   as it is his ordinance, Rom. xiii., or a kind of resemblance of his
   glory: I have said you are gods,' Ps. lxxxii. 6. So that it is a
   contempt of God in his image and picture. Look, as under the law God
   forbade men cruelty to the beasts, as not to destroy the dam from the
   young, to seethe the kid in the mother's milk, and that such kind of
   prohibitions might be as a fence and rail about the life of man, so
   respect to magistracy is a kind of fence about his own dignity and
   divine glory. Magistrates being representative gods, ei'kon de
   basileu`s e'stin e'mpsuchos Theou; therefore through their sides they
   strike at God himself. Partly be cause the end of magistracy is to
   suppress evil, Rom. xiii. 5. An indefinite speech is equivalent to a
   universal in a matter of necessary duty, and the universal particle is
   expressed elsewhere: Prov. xx. 8, A king that sitteth upon the throne
   of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes'--all evil that
   falleth under his cognisance, whether it be of a civil or spiritual
   concernment. We must not limit and distinguish where the word doth not.
   I know there be some that do defalcate and cut off a great part of that
   duty which belongeth to the magistrate, confining his care only to
   things of a civil concernment, but preposterously, truths according to
   godliness belonging also to his inspection, upon which ground we are
   bound to pray for them, that they may come to the knowledge of the
   truth,' 1 Tim. ii. 2, and under them we may lead a quiet life in all
   godliness and honesty,' where it is plainly implied that the converted
   magistrate is to look to the countenance and maintenance of godliness
   as well as honesty. Well, then, sensual heretics being doubly
   obnoxious, as sensual, as venting errors, no wonder that they rise up
   in defiance of God's ordinance.

   Use 1. It showeth us the evil of inordinate lustings. We may learn
   hence whence they proceed and whither they tend; they proceed from the
   pride and obstinacy of error; men dream, and are then licentious; and
   it tendeth to the casting off of all duty to God and man. Nip this
   disposition in the bud; it is in all our natures: Man is born like the
   wild ass's colt,' Job xi. 12; not only for rudeness of understanding,
   but untamedness of affection. We love to break through all bonds and
   restraints, as if none were lord over us,' Ps. xii. 3.

   Use 2. It informeth us what will be the issue when libertism
   .aboundeth, even an utter confusion. See Socrates Scholast., lib. v.
   Eccles. iv. ii, in proëm.: Nonnunquam tumultus ecclesiarum antegressi,
   reipublicae autem confusiones consecutae sunt--the ruin of the public
   weal is brought on by pestilent and evil doctrines. So our divines at
   the Synod of Dort: Cavendum est, ne qui magistratu connivente res novas
   in ecclesia moliantur, eodem etiam repugnante idem in republica
   efficiant. Tully, in his book De Legibus, saith, that the glory of
   Greece presently declined when the people were given malis studiis,
   malisque doctrinis, to evil manners and evil opinions. Let us lay these
   things to heart. I do not love to envy against the times, and to
   indulge the petulancy of a mistaken zeal, but the king's danger made
   Croesus' dumb son to speak.

   Use 3. It may take off the prejudice that is often cast upon religion
   and the true ways of God. It is not truth that troubleth Israel, but
   error: 1 Kings xviii. 18, I have not troubled Israel, but thou and thy
   father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord.'
   It is an old slander that strict religion is no friend to
   commonwealths. As soon as Christianity began to fly abroad in the
   world, it was objected against her, as if it was prejudicial to civil
   power and greatness, thereby to defeat her of the patronage of princes,
   and to hinder them from becoming nursing fathers,' Isa. xlix. 23.
   Magistracy being that power which is left, able to suppress or advance
   religion, the devil striveth all that he can to incense it against her.
   There is a natural and wakeful jealousy in princes over their dignities
   and prerogatives, and therefore the enemies of the church have ever
   sought occasion to represent the people of God as enemies to their just
   power. So Christ was accused, Luke xxiii. 2, and Paul, Acts xxiv. 5;
   but altogether without cause. It is true, if religion be not kindly
   received it bringeth a judgment there where it is tendered, as the ark,
   when it was irreverently handled, brought a plague upon the
   Bethshemites, 1 Sam. vi. 19; but yet a blessing upon the house of
   Obed-Edom. So religion, where it is worthily treated, bringeth a
   blessing, otherwise a judgment. Let the world say what it will, it is a
   friend to magistracy, partly by its commands enforcing civil duties by
   a sacred bond and obligation. See Prov. xxiv. 21, Mat. xxii. 21, 1
   Peter ii. 17, Eccles. viii. 2. Partly by its influence, meekening the
   hearts of men, and obliging them to faithfulness. Those that are
   faithful to God, I shall expect them to be faithful to me, said
   Constantine's father. [132] Certainly none live so sweetly under the
   same government as those that are united in the same faith, or cemented
   together with the same blood of Christ. Partly by the indulgence of
   God's providence, who is wont to favour those states where true
   religion is countenanced and vigorously owned. Oh! that our magistrates
   would regard this; their wisdom lieth in kissing the Son, Ps. ii. 10.
   Christ came not to gain persons, but nations to his obedience, and the
   more that is effected, though it be but by a public profession, the
   more safety may they expect; it is but a necessary thankfulness of the
   powers of the world to him to whom they owe their crowns, Prov. viii.
   16. Let us pray for them that God would raise their zeal, and make them
   more cordial in the support of religion. A heathen said, Aut undiquaque
   religionem tolle aut usque quaque conserva--either wholly abandon
   religion, or maintain it more entirely.

   Use 4. It showeth us what little reason magistrates have to countenance
   and spread their skirt over obstinate and impure heretics, such spirits
   being usually most opposite to magistracy. They do but nourish a snake
   in their own bosoms, and cherish a faction that in time will eat out
   their bowels. Were there no respects of religion but only those of
   civil policy, they should not be so sleepy in this case; but you will
   say, Is it lawful for them to intermeddle in matters of religion, and
   to use any compulsive power? I answer--Yes, verily; they bear not the
   sword in vain.' We have frequent instances in the word of good kings
   whose zeal is commended for so doing, and frequent injunctions also to
   this purpose. The Levites are commended for assisting Moses in the
   execution of those that worshipped the calf, Exod. xxxii. 26-28.
   Abraham was to command his children, Gen. xviii. 29. Asa commanded
   Judah to worship God, and the thing was right in the eyes of the Lord,
   2 Chron. xiv: 2-4. So see 2 Chron. xv. 23, and Ezra x. 8; so 2 Chron.
   xxxiv. 32, 33; and that promise, Isa. xliii. 23. I know I touch the
   sore of this age, and that this is a truth much prejudiced; therefore I
   shall first remove the prejudices, and then state the question.

   First, Remove the prejudices. The first is taken from the fathers, or
   primitive Christians, who almost generally express themselves against
   planting religion by the sword and compulsive force. [133] Defendenda
   est religio non occidendo sed monendo, non soevitia sed patientia, so
   Lactantius, and suitably others. I answer--Were religion now to be
   planted, these sayings would take place. Pagans are not to be
   compelled, but enlightened; taught, not destroyed. And yet in such a
   case it is a question not easily resolved, whether the magistrate, if
   he had power, were not bound to compel his people, though professed
   pagans, to hear or attend upon the ministry of the word, it being the
   ordinary means of working faith. Augustine determineth that a Christian
   in such a case should improve his power for Christ. Felix necessitas
   quae ad meliora nos cogit, foris inveniatur necessitas et nascitur
   intus voluntas; and a little after, non quia cogantur reprehendant, sed
   quae cogantur attendant--it is a favour that the magistrate will take
   care to bring them to the means of salvation. Again, in such a case
   they are to be kept from scandalising and blaspheming the true
   religion; that is the least a magistrate can do for Christ. But where a
   people are Christianised, and do profess the true religion, they should
   not be set free to atheism, error, and apostasy.

   2. Another prejudice is, that the examples before mentioned are brought
   from the Old Testament, and so proper to the policy of the Jews. I
   answer--Some alleged were before Moses' law, as that of Abraham, and
   Jacob's commanding his family to put away their idols, Gen. xxxv. 2.
   And the injunctions in the Old Testament were built upon reasons of
   immutable equity, as God's glory, the danger of infection, &c., and so
   concern us as well as them; and the thing in question is agreeable to
   the light of nature, there being instances of pagan princes who were so
   far convinced of their duty to the true God, that they enjoined his
   worship, punishing the contempt thereof; see Ezra vi. 11; so Ezra vii.
   26, and Dan. iii. 29. The Gentiles by the light of nature saw it to be
   suitable and agreeable to right reason. Arist. Polit., lib. vii. cap.
   8, saith the first thing that falleth under a magistrate's care is e
   peri` to` theion epime'leia, a care of divine worship. The Athenians
   banished Protagoras for speaking doubtfully, and by way of extenuation
   of their religion, and burnt his books. Besides all this, the reason
   why we have only precedents in the Old Testament is, be cause the
   people of the Jews were the only state that were acquainted with the
   knowledge of the true God. We have some prophecies that the like should
   be done in the New, Isa. xlix. 23, and Zech. xiii., which concerneth
   gospel times, Isa. lx. 10, Rev. xxi. 24. We were worse provided for
   than they were in the Old Testament, if men that had the plague-sore of
   heresy running upon them should without restraint be permitted to come
   into all companies.

   3. Another prejudice is, it will make men hypocrites. I answer, with
   Athanasius--Would to God all were got so far as hypocrites, it would
   certainly be better for the Christian world; but however duties must
   not be left undone for ill consequences.

   4. And another is, this will make way for persecution, and the
   calamities of the godly upon every change of the prince's mind. I
   answer--If the Lord see persecution necessary for the church, we must
   endure it, and so we shall be gainers both by good princes and bad: by
   the persecution of evil princes truth is made glorious; by the ministry
   of the good, error is suppressed and discountenanced. God would oblige
   us the more to pray for them in power, Ps. lxxii. 1, and 1 Tim. ii. 2;
   and he hath promised to hear such prayers, and provide nurse-fathers
   for the church. Sometimes a wicked magistrate, understanding his duty,
   may, by the overruling power of God in his conscience, be with held
   from persecuting the truth, yea, carried out to the suppression of
   error. When Paulus Samosatenus revolted from the orthodox Christian
   faith, and would yet retain the bishopric of Antioch, the business was
   brought to Aurelian, a pagan emperor, who removed him.

   Secondly, I shall state the point, and show you how far compulsion is
   necessary. (1.) The magistrate should use no compulsion before care had
   for better information, and resolution of the doubting conscience;
   otherwise the practice were fell and cruel, like that of false
   religions, that brook no contradiction. Consciences scrupulous must not
   be too hardly dealt withal. To answer arguments by a prison or the
   fires is a Popish topic, [134] and to supply in rage what wanteth in
   strength of reason and clearness of light is but a butcherly violence;
   punishment and compulsion should not be hastened, as long as there
   appeareth a desire to be informed, with meek endeavours after
   satisfaction. The apostle Paul is for two admonitions before church
   censure, Titus iii. 10; and the censure of the magistrate should not
   precede that of the church. (2.) In things indifferent, Christian
   toleration and forbearance takes place; all men never were, nor ever
   will be, in this world, of one and the same opinion, no more than of
   the same feature and complexion. There is a due latitude of allow able
   differences wherein the strong should bear with the weak, Rom. xv. 1;
   Eph. iv. 2; Gal. vi. 1. There are some lesser mistakes of conscience
   and infirmities incident to all men; namely, such as are consistent
   with faith, the main and fundamental truths and principles of salvation
   and charity, as not tending to foment faction in the church or sedition
   in the commonwealth; but if either of these limits be transgressed,
   circumstances may make these lesser things intolerable, as Paul
   withstood Peter to the face,' though otherwise he did not count the
   matter great, Gal. ii. 11; yet, when it was urged to the scandal of the
   churches, he thought it worthy of a contest. And here it belongeth to
   Christian princes, as to defend truth, so to see that peace be not
   violated for rites and ceremonies, and lesser differences that lie far
   from the heart of religion. I am persuaded that want of condescension
   to brethren hath brought all this confusion upon us, fec. (3.) A gross
   error kept secret cometh not under the magistrate's cognisance, but the
   diffusion and dissemination of errors he must take notice of; as when
   men infect others, and openly blaspheme Christian doctrine, he beareth
   not the sword in vain.' The mind and conscience, as to any power under
   God, is sui juris; thoughts are free. It is a saying in the civil law,
   Cogitationis poenam nemo patitur--all command is exercised about such
   things as fall within the knowledge of him that commandeth. Now, God
   only knoweth the heart, Quis mihi imponat necessitatem credendi quod
   nolim, saith Lactantius, vel quod velim non credendi. Theodosius and
   Valentinian, in their law concerning the heretic, give this limitation,
   Sibi tantummodo nocitura sentiat, aliis obfutura non
   pandat--subscriptions and inquisitions into men's consciences, we
   cannot but justly condemn. (4.) Errors, according to their nature and
   degree, merit a different punishment, Jude 9, and Ezra vii. 26. (5.)
   Blasphemy, idolatry, and gross heresy are to be put into the same rank
   with gross, vicious actions, and supposed (if entertained after the
   receiving of the truth) to be done against light and conscience. Paul
   saith of the heretic that he is autoka'takritos, after due admonitions,
   Titus iii. 11. Therefore, in some cases, these may be punished with
   death, as Baal's prophets were slain, 1 Kings xviii. 40, Exod. xxi. 20,
   and Lev. xxiv. 16. But of the whole question elsewhere.

   Obs. 6. Again, I observe from the same clause, that it is a sin to
   despise dominions. For it is here charged upon these seducers. It is a
   sin, because it is against the injunctions of the word, Rom. xiii. 1,
   Titus iii. 1. We are apt to forget our civil duties, or to count them
   arbitrary, as if the same authority had not established the second
   table as well as the first; and it is a sin, because magistracy is
   God's ordinance, the general instruction of it is of God, though the
   particular constitution of it be of man. Compare Rom. xiii. 1, with 1
   Peter ii. 13. Government itself is of God; but this or that special
   manner or form of government is not determined by God, which is the
   difference between civil and ecclesiastical government, for there the
   particular form is specified, as well as the thing itself appointed.
   Again, it is a sin, because dominion preserveth human societies, so
   that we should trespass against the common good and public order if we
   should despise this help, yea, against the law of our own nature, man
   being by nature a sociable creature. Well, then, let us obey every
   ordinance of man for the Lord's sake. The public welfare is concerned
   in our obedience, as also the honour of religion, both which should be
   very dear to one that feareth God. The public welfare: better bear many
   inconveniences than embroil the country in war and blood. We are bidden
   be subject, skoliois, to the froward,' 1 Peter ii. 18. And the honour
   of religion: God will have the world know that Christianity is a friend
   to civil policy; see 1 Peter ii. 15, and Mat. xvii. 27. We learn hence,
   too, that they are but libertines that think that religion freeth them
   from the subjection which they owe to God or man; it doth not exempt us
   from our duty, but enable us to perform it. Many take such a liberty in
   civil things that they begin to grow contemptuous even in divine, and
   so cast off God's yoke as well as the magistrate's.

   Obs. 7. The last expression is that, speak evil of dignities, or of
   glories, by which probably church officers are intended, such being
   spoken against in that age, 3 John 10, and expressed by the word
   glories, a term given both to the apostles and other officers of the
   church. Note, there is a respect due to persons invested with church
   power. This is established by God's ordinance, and therefore should not
   be set at nought; neither should the persons invested with it be evil
   spoken of. That obedience is required to them, see Heb. xiii. 17; and
   respect and honour, see 1 Thes. v. 12, 13, and 1 Tim. v. 17; that they
   should not be lightly evil spoken of, 1 Tim. v. 19. Though for their
   persons and outward estate they are mean and despicable, yet they are
   called to a high employment, and have the promise of a great power and
   presence with them,: Mat. xvi. 19, John xx. 23; their regular
   proceedings are ratified in the court of heaven. We are fallen into an
   age wherein no persons are more contemptible than ministers, nothing
   less valued than church authority: it is become the eyesore of the
   times. Not to speak of those barking Shimeis the Quakers, and their
   foul-mouthed language, taught them by the father of lies; surely others
   have not such a reverence of God's ordinance as they should have.

   Ver. 9. Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil (he
   disputed about the body of Moses}, durst not bring against him a
   railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.

   The apostle had charged the seducers, against whom he wrote, with
   opposition of magistracy, and contemptuous speaking against those
   lights which God had set in the church; he now cometh to aggravate
   their effrontery and impudence by the carriage of Michael the arch
   angel towards the devil. In the comparison there is an argument a
   majore ad minus, from the greater to the less, which is evidently seen
   in all the circumstances of the text.

   1. In the persons contending, Michael the archangel with the devil. If
   Michael, so excellent in nature, so high in office, contending with
   Satan, an impure spirit, already judged by God, used such modesty and
   awe, who are they, sorry creatures, that dare despise persons invested
   with the dignity and height of magistracy?

   2. There is an aggravation from the cause, when he disputed with him
   about the body of Moses,' a matter just, and in which the mind of God
   was clearly known; and dare they speak evil of things they know not'?
   that is, in matters so far above their reach to take upon them to
   ensure [135] and determine?

   3. There is an aggravation taken from the disposition of the angel, he
   durst not bring against him a railing accusation.' His holiness would
   not permit him to deal with the devil in an indecent and injurious
   manner. But these rashly belch out their reproaches and curses against
   superiors without any fear.

   4. In the manner of speech, the Lord rebuke thee.' The whole judgment
   of the cause is referred to God; but these Gnostics take upon them as
   if the whole judgment of things, persons, and actions were left in
   their hands, as our modern Quakers take upon them to curse and to
   pronounce dreadful judgments upon God's most holy servants according to
   their own pleasure. The sum of the whole is this, if an angel that is
   great in power durst not bring against the worst creatures, in the very
   heat of contention about a good cause, any undue language and reproach,
   certainly it is a horrible impudence in men to speak contemptuously,
   yea, in a cursing and blaspheming manner, of those whom God hath
   advanced to superiority in church or commonwealth.

   This is the sum of the words; but because this scripture is difficult,
   before I come to the observations, I shall premise some explicatory
   questions.

   Quest. 1. Whence had the apostle this story; the scriptures making no
   mention of it?

   Ans. The substance of it is in scripture. We read, Deut. xxxiv. 6, that
   the body of Moses was secretly buried by the Lord. But now for the
   circumstances of it. He might receive them by divine revelation, which
   are here authorised and made scripture; and indeed it is usual with the
   penmen of holy writ to add such circumstances as were not mentioned in
   the place where the history was first recorded, as in Exodus we read of
   the opposition of the magicians to Moses; but their names are
   mentioned, 2 Tim. iii. 8, As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses.' The
   whole story of their contest with him is in the Talmud; and in
   Apuleius, and other histories, we read that these were famous
   magicians. So Ps. cv. 18, we read that Joseph's feet were hurt in
   fetters, and he was laid in iron,' which, in the story in Genesis,
   appeareth not; so Moses quaking, Heb. xii. 21, and the following of the
   water of the rock, 1 Cor. x. 1, 2. Those things might be received by
   tradition or divine inspiration, or were extant m some known book and
   record then in use. Origen quoteth a book, peri` anale'pseos tou
   Mo'seos, about the assumption of Moses, for this history, some
   remainders of which are in the books of the Jews unto this day.
   Capellus, I remember, repeateth a long tale out of the book called
   Rabboth, or the mystical expositions of the Pentateuch, concerning the
   altercation between Michael and Samael, or the archangel and the devil,
   about the body, or rather soul, of Moses; and how God, to save it from
   Samael, sucked out his soul from the body by a kiss: but the story is
   so fabulous that I shall not repeat it. See Capelli Spicileg. in locum,
   pp. 128, 129.

   Quest. 2. Is this a real history, or an allusion?

   Ans. There are three opinions about this. (1.) One is, that it is a
   figurative expression of God's care for his church; and they that go
   this way by the body of Moses understand either the whole body of the
   Levitical worship, or else the community of Israel, represented in
   Joshua the high priest, who stood before the angel of the Lord,' Zech.
   iii. 1, 2, and Satan at his right hand ready to resist him; and the
   Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, the Lord, that hath chosen
   Jerusalem, rebuke thee.' In Joshua the Levitical worship newly restored
   is figured, and the angel of the Lord, before whom he stood, is Christ,
   the judge, advocate, and defender of the church; and the Lord, that is,
   the Lord Christ, called the angel' before, puts forth the efficacy of
   his mediation against this malicious opposition of Satan. So some
   accommodate this text to the sense of that place; and the main reason
   is, because of the form here used, The Lord rebuke thee.' This sense is
   argute, but not so solid. Junius, who first propounded it, seemeth to
   distrust it. The reason is of no force, for the same form might be used
   on divers occasions; and my reasons against it are, because these
   expressions are typical and visional. Now to make a type of a type,
   especially in the New Testament, which usually explaineth the
   difficulties of the Old, seemeth irrational; and though by Michael
   Christ may be intended, yet the change from Joshua to Moses is too much
   forced. (2.) Others conceive that it is not a history, but a Talmudic
   fiction and parable; and that Jude, in citing it, doth not approve the
   story as true, but only urgeth it upon them for their instruction, who
   were mightily pleased with this kind of fables: as the fathers against
   the heathens did often make use of their own stories and fictions
   concerning their gods; such condescensions are frequent. But against
   this opinion; it seemeth to be urged here by way of downright
   assertion, not as an argument ad homines, and by Peter on the like
   occasion: 2 Peter ii. 11, Whereas angels, that are greater in might and
   power, bring not a railing accusation against them before the Lord.' I
   say, he doth not urge it as a Jewish fable, but as a real argument
   taken from the nature of the holy angels. (3.) There is another
   opinion, that it is a real history, namely, that the devil was earnest
   to discover the place of Moses' grave, and to take up his body again,
   wherein he was resisted by Michael, some principal and chief angel, and
   his attempts made fruitless by this holy and modest address to God, The
   Lord rebuke thee.'

   Quest. 3. The next question is, who is meant by Michael the arch angel?

   Ans. Michael is the name of his person, and archangel of his office.
   Michael signifieth he is strong God, or who is like the strong God, and
   therefore some apply it to Jesus Christ, who in many places of
   scripture is set forth as head of angels.' See Exod. iii. 2 with 4, and
   Exod.. xxiii. 20-22; Gen. xlviii. 16; and in Dan. xii. 1, and x. 13.
   Jesus Christ seemeth there to be intended by Michael, he being the
   Prince of Israel. But there is no necessity of interpreting those
   places in Daniel of Christ, much less is he intended here, it being
   beneath the dignity of his person to contend with the devil, which
   though he did in his humiliation, Mat. iv., yet to do it before that
   was unworthy of him; besides, that phrase, he durst not, is not so
   applicable to Jesus Christ, and besides, Christ and the archangel are
   in scripture distinguished, yea, Peter applieth this to angels in
   general, whereas angels,' 2 Peter ii. 11. But you will object, how can
   any creature be called Michael, equal to God in power and strength? I
   answer--It may be taken (1.) Absolutely, and so it is proper to Christ,
   who is God's fellow, Zech. xiii. 7; (2.) Comparatively, and so it may
   be applied to him who is highest in dignity among the creatures, and is
   next to God in excellency and strength, and so it may imply the highest
   angel, as in hell there is a Beelzebub, or a chief devil; therefore it
   is said, Mat. xxv., The devil and his angels.' So in heaven there may
   be a Michael, one highest in order among the blessed angels.

   Quest. 4. Why should the devil so earnestly dispute about the body of
   Moses?

   Ans. The rabbins, among others of their fables, interpret it of the
   desire which the devil had to destroy Moses by death, there being no
   man like Moses, that saw God face to face.' Therefore his rage was
   great against him, and he sought to destroy him; and to this purpose
   applies that of the psalmist: Ps. xxxvii. 32, The wicked watcheth the
   righteous, and seeketh to slay him.' Among Christians some say this
   striving was before, some after, his burial; some before his burial, as
   Junius, that his body might not be removed out of sight, but he might
   satisfy his rage and malice upon it in abusing it. But that is not so
   probable, the body being suddenly disposed of by God to some secret
   place of burial. Some say after burial the devil sought to take it up
   again, and upon that ground arose this contention between him and
   Michael. But why should the devil contend so much about the buried body
   of Moses? To answer this we must consider what might be the ends of
   God's concealing his burial. Possibly this might be done lest in a
   preposterous zeal they should yield honour to the dead body of such a
   famous and excellent prophet, and so. it might become a snare to the
   people. Possibly there might be something typical in it--the dead body
   of Moses was buried in an unknown place, lest they should take it up,
   and carry it into the land of Canaan--to signify the abolition of the
   legal ordinances, under the evangelic state. So that to revive the
   antiquated ceremonies of the law now is to but rake up Moses' dead
   body. Now the devil may be supposed to contend for the body of Moses,
   partly out of obstinate curiosity, whereby sinful creatures are
   strongly inclined to desire things forbidden; partly to defeat the
   purposes of God; but chiefly by dead Moses to set up himself in the
   hearts of the living, seeking thereby to provoke them to a worship of
   his relics or remains.

   These questions premised, the explication of the words is easy. Michael
   the archangel; that is, some principal angel deputed to this ministry
   and service. When he contended with the devil, diabo'lo diakrino'menos.
   The word signifieth an altercation or contention in words, a dispute
   with the devil. About the body of Moses, about the knowledge of the
   place of his burial. Durst not, his fear of God, modesty, and meekness
   would not permit him. Bring against him a railing accusation, kri'sin
   epenenkein blasphemi'as, the judgment of blasphemy,' or such unworthy
   language as the heat of contention is wont to provoke and extort from
   us. But said, The Lord rebuke thee. It is a modest referring of the
   matter to God's cognisance, or a prayer that the Lord would check this
   malicious opposition.

   Observations are many:--

   Obs. 1. Observe, that to aggravate their virulency, he compares it with
   the modesty of an archangel; whence note, that pride and contempt in
   them of a low degree is less tolerable than in those whom God hath
   advanced to a higher rank and sphere. Partly because these have less
   temptation to be proud; and when a sin is committed without a
   temptation it is a sign that the heart is strongly inclined that way,
   as there needeth no force to make a bowl run down hill, because of its
   natural tendency. Their wants and meanness should keep them humble; we
   look that the fire should go out when the fuel is taken away. When men
   have nothing to be proud of, the want of an opportunity should make men
   at least forbear the sin. Partly because they have more reason to be
   humble; as the rich and great have reason to be thankful, so the poor
   have reason to be humble. With a low condition there should be a lowly
   mind: It is better to be of a humble spirit with the lowly,' &c., Prov.
   xvi. 19. Well, then, poverty and pride are most unsuitable; pride is
   allowable in none, but in the poor most prodigious. It is an odd sight
   to see those of the highest rank turn fashionists, and display the
   ensigns of their own vanity; but when servants, and those of a low
   degree, put themselves into the garb, these are prodigies of pride. As
   the modesty of the archangel was an upbraiding to the pride of the
   Gnostics, so should those that are advanced to the highest degree of
   honour shame the meaner sort with their comely plainness. Again, to see
   men of the greatest sufficiencies humble in style and mind, and denying
   their great parts for the sake of the simplicity of the gospel; it is a
   shame that persons of low parts should be puffed up, and appear
   flaunting in the pomp of words, or blustering in Greek and Latin
   sentences, as if all reading and learned worth were their own. The
   apostle condemned the Corinthians for the pompous use of tongues in the
   church, and shameth them by his own example: 1 Cor. xiv. 18, I thank
   God I speak with tongues more than you all; yet rather,' &c.

   Again, to take down pride, look to others whom God hath set higher, and
   yet are more humble, as usually the higher the sun the less shadows it
   casteth. Usually God's children carry a low mind in a high condition,
   James i. 10; they are rich, yet made low,' that is, lowly.' If, in the
   fulness of riches, honours, parts, and enjoyments, they are so meek and
   humble, why should I, that have less temptations, be more proud? They
   are lifted up by God, but not in their own spirits. I am a worm, in a
   much lower sphere, and yet of a prouder heart. They are affable, meek,
   modest, why am I so fierce and impatient of contradiction? Once more,
   if the judgments of God light upon greater personages for their pride,
   say what will become of me? In me it is more odious. If God destroy
   those whose height is as the height of cedars,' Amos ii. 9, surely the
   reed should tremble. Many times mean and base people, that have no
   tincture of ingenuity, and are of no name or quality in the world, have
   pride enough to be bitter enemies to God's children. David saith, Ps.
   xxxv. 15, The abjects gathered themselves together to make songs
   against me,' when as God rebuketh kings for their sakes.' If he visit
   the throne, will he not visit the ale-bench? What scorn will he cast
   upon this saucy dust? these spiteful worms, that have only malice
   enough to snarl and can go no further? If the great men of the earth'
   tremble, shall the bondmen' go free? Rev. vi. 15. But chiefly upon this
   occasion would I commend to you the example of the Lord Christ to take
   down pride. This is an example that will shame us indeed, whatever the
   pride be. Are you puffed up with pride of vain conceit? Christ stripped
   himself of all his glory, Phil. ii. 7. With pride of revenge? Men are
   loath to strike sail, to seek to an enemy; they scorn it. Jesus Christ,
   though such an excellent person, loved us first,' 1 John iv. 19, sued
   to his enemies. Is it disdain of our condition, pride of murmurings? He
   made himself a worm and no man,' and when he was rich in the glory of
   the Godhead, became poor for our sakes:' Mat. x. 24, The disciple is
   not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.' If we be
   scorned, would we be better dealt with than our master was? Many times
   you have seen a master do the work of a servant to shame him; so did
   Christ. Do but think of Christ's excellency and your own base
   condition; as here, to shame the brutish Gnostics, the apostle telleth
   them they took more upon them than a glorious angel.

   Obs. 2. Again, from the archangel's contending about the body of Moses.
   The devil would discover Moses' grave, and the archangel is ready to
   resist him. The note is, that God hath angels and archangels that are
   always ready to defend a good cause. They are many; the king of heaven
   hath a brave court: Dan, vii. 10, A thousand thousand minister to him,
   and ten thousand times ten thousand stand before him.' Christ saith he
   could pray for twelve legions' in an instant, Mat. xxvi. 53. Now a
   legion, in the least computation, is six thousand foot and seven
   hundred horse. They are able, they excel in strength.' One angel slew a
   hundred and eighty-five thousand in one night, Isa. xxxvii. 36. They
   are always ready, attending on God's commands, Ps. ciii. 20. They
   rejoice in names of service more than names of honour. They are swift
   in execution; they are described to have six wings apiece,' Isa. vi. 2;
   as being at the Lord's beck, and ready to execute his command as soon
   as they hear the word. All which informeth us (1.) Of the danger of
   wicked men in opposing a good cause; they fight not only against men,
   but against angels. (2.) That angels have more to do in human affairs
   than we are aware of. There are evil angels assisting in the counsels
   against the church, and good angels resisting, in those days of
   conflict. The combat is not only between men and men, but between
   angels and angels, Dan. x. 13. The protection of the holy angels is
   invisible, but true and real. (3.) Here is comfort to God's children
   when they are embarked in a hazardous but in a holy business; there are
   far more with us than can be against us,' 2 Kings vi. 16. There is God
   the Father's power on the church's side; the Son puts forth the
   strength of his mediation, Zech. iii. 2; the Spirit comforts and
   animateth us, and then holy angels are employed as instruments. The
   Lord Jesus and his angels will stick to the church when none else dare:
   Dan. x. 21, There is none holdeth with me in these things but Michael
   your prince.' When all human strength faileth, Christ by their ministry
   can uphold the affairs of the church; omnipotency is a great deep.
   Usually we look to means, and can better conceive of the operations of
   finite creatures than of the infinite God; therefore doth the Lord
   represent the help of the church as managed by these powerful
   instruments. Only now take heed that you do not betray your succours,
   nor defraud yourselves of their protection. (1.) By neglecting to seek
   to the God of angels: Dan. x. 12, From the first day thou didst set
   thine heart to understand, and didst chasten thyself before thy God,'
   &c. We are not to pray to them, but for them, to the Lord. (2.) By
   unwarrantable practices, for then you join with Satan to their grief:
   Ps. xxxiv. 7, The angel encampeth about them that fear him.' A good
   cause should be well managed, and then trust God, who, if he seeth fit
   to glorify himself by our deliverance, rather than our sufferings, can
   find means enough to save us when men fail.

   Obs. 3. Observe again, that angels have a care not only of the souls,
   but of the bodies, yea, even of the dead bodies, of the saints, as
   Michael disputed with the devil about the body of Moses.' That you may
   understand the particular care which the angels have about the people
   of God, I shall open it to you in several propositions:--

   1. It is certain the angels had a great care about the people of God in
   ancient times. Examples are found everywhere in the word of God. Lot
   was led out of Sodom by angels; Daniel taught by an angel; Cornelius
   answered by an angel; an angel withstood Balaam in the way, Num. xxii.;
   an angel walked with the three children in the fiery furnace, Dan. iii.
   25; an angel shut up the mouths of lions that they might not hurt
   Daniel in the den, Dan. vi. 22; an angel comforted Paul in the tempest,
   Acts xxvii. 23, 24. Scarce any remarkable thing befell the people of
   God, but it was accomplished by their ministry.

   2. The ministry of angels, though not so visible and sensible as
   heretofore, is not wholly ceased. The privilege of it belongeth to all
   saints: Heb. i, 14 Are they not ministering spirits sent forth for the
   heirs of salvation?' All that are called to inherit a blessing were
   under their tutelage. So see Ps. xci. 12; and those instances alleged
   in the former proposition are patterns and precedents by which we may
   know what to expect. Their tutelage then was more visible and sensible,
   because the church, newly planted, needed to be confirmed; but God
   would have us live by faith, and expect all our supports in a more
   spiritual way; though we have not visible apparitions, yet we have real
   experiments of their succour; the evil angels appear not, yet we doubt
   not of the hurt done by them. In the first times of the gospel Christ's
   bodily presence was necessary, but now only his spiritual.

   3. The proper object of their ministry and care are the children of
   God, wicked men are not under their covert and protection; it is true,
   they may be under a general care, as Hagar and Ishmael, who are set out
   in scripture as the types of those that are rejected by the Lord; yet,
   Gen. xxi. 17, An angel of the Lord came and stood by Hagar, and said,
   The Lord Lath heard the cry of the lad.' Though possibly this might be,
   as he was Abraham's son; dogs in the house have the crumbs.

   4. The ministry of the angels is over all the children of God, without
   exception; not only Moses, but the meanest saint is under their care.
   God's love to his people is not dispensed with respect to their
   peculiar pomp and greatness: Mat. xviii. 10, Offend not these little
   ones, for their angels behold my Father's face.' It is chiefly meant of
   those that are little in esteem and account in the world; the message
   of Christ's birth was brought by angels to shepherds, feeding their
   flocks in the fields, Luke ii.

   5. As no saints are excepted from receiving the benefit of their
   ministry, so no angels are excepted from being employed in it. Michael
   contendeth with Satan, and the apostle saith, ouchi` pa'ntes, Are they
   not all,' &c., Heb. i. 14. The archangels themselves are ministering
   spirits;' it is a rash boldness in the schoolmen to exempt any from
   this office. What an instance is here of God's love, that the highest
   angel should not be exempted from a care of the lowest saint!

   6. That every single believer hath his proper and allotted angel to
   attend him from his birth to his death, is rather matter of problem and
   dispute than positive assertion; there are some scriptures make it
   probable, but not certain. Sometimes we read of one angel attending
   many men, and at other times of many angels attending one man, as Jacob
   had many, Gen. xxxii. 1, 2, God's host,' &c.; so Elisha, 2 Kings vi.
   17, Elisha prayed and the mountains were full of chariots and horses of
   fire,' that is, of angels coming to offer help in that case. It is
   true, the opinion of a particular angel guardian was ancient. Plato
   saith, eka'sto o`n e'leto dai'mona tou'ton phu'laka xumpe'mpein tou
   bi'ou kai` apoplerote`n ton airethe'nton, and among the ancient fathers
   places of scripture are brought for it that are full of probability,
   not cogency. One is that of the Old Testament, Gen. xlviii. 16, The
   angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads,' &c., in which
   passage he seemeth to ascribe his preservation and deliverance to some
   particular angel; but to this may be replied what was before alleged of
   the host of God' going along with him; and by this angel is meant the
   Lord Christ, who is alone the object of worship and adoration; and who,
   because of the frequency of his personal appearance and mediation
   between God and man, is set forth under the term of an angel. The
   rabbins expound it of the angel of God's presence.' Another place is
   Mat. xviii. 10, Their angels see my Father's face;' not the angels, but
   their angels; but the word there may only imply their common interest
   in the whole host of God. Christ doth not say that every one of them
   hath an angel. As, for instance, it may be said, These prisoners have
   their keepers, these scholars have their masters, these soldiers have
   their captains; it doth not follow that every one hath a particular
   keeper, master, captain, &c. Another place is Acts xii. 15. When the
   maid said Peter was at the door, they, distrusting her report, said, It
   is his angel.' This place may be answered thus--That sayings of men in
   scripture are not all scripture, or a part of our rule; and that many
   things were spoken by the disciples in their rudeness which are not
   altogether justifiable; but because this place is the main, let me
   examine it a little. Three opinions there are about the place. Some
   understand it appellatively, it is his angel, or messenger, sent by him
   out of prison. [136] But Rhoda heard Peter's voice, and that was the
   ground of the sayings. Others understand it of some angel come to give
   notice of his death; but that is groundless. Lastly, some, as
   Chrysostom, of a particular tutelar angel. But whence doth it appear
   that these angels had the shape and habit of those they kept? And
   angels do not use to knock at doors, and wait for opening; and if Peter
   had a special angel, it followeth not that all have; the meaning
   probably is, it is a spirit that hath assumed his shape.

   7. Though it be not certain that every particular believer hath an
   angel deputed to his attendance, yet in the general there is an
   assurance of a guardianship and tutelage from the angels; the heirs of
   salvation' have them among them. If the whole city hath a sufficient
   guard, it is as good as if every citizen had a distinct soldier to
   defend him; nay, it is more for our comfort, that we have many rather
   than one; we have to do with many enemies, and therefore we need much
   assistance: Ps. xci. 11, He shall give his angels charge over thee.'
   Many angels are charged with our safety, and though they be not so
   particularly conversant about us as the other opinion conceiveth, yet
   they behold the face of God,' and are always in his presence, and wait
   for his command,' Ps. ciii. 20, who so careth for every one as if he
   had none to care for besides him.

   8. This tutelage is from their first conception in the womb till the
   translation of body and soul into glory. Survey all the passages of
   life from the womb to the grave, nay, after death, till the
   resurrection, the ministry of angels doth not wholly cease. Their care
   beginneth as soon as the child is quickened in the womb, for then they
   have another distinct charge to look after; and as they are servants of
   providence, by their help they are born and brought into the world;
   God's providence taketh date thence, Gal. i. 15; and they, I say, are
   instruments of providence; they watch over us in infancy and childhood;
   little ones are committed to their custody, and babes and sucklings
   have their angels, Mat. xviii. Jesus Christ was provided for in his
   cradle by an angel, Mat. ii. 13. The devil rampeth about the elect
   whilst they are yet in their swaddling-clothes. That expression, Rev.
   xii., of the dragon's seeking to devour the man-child as soon as he was
   born,' is figurative, but it alludeth to what is true. Again, as we
   grow up they rejoice at our conversion, Luke xv. We read of joy in
   heaven over a sinner that repenteth;' you cannot gratify the angels
   more than in your conversion to God; the devil seeks to hinder it as
   much as he can, but they rejoice when a brand is plucked out of the
   burning,' Zech. iii. Again, after conversion, they watch over us in
   duty, and danger, and temptations. In duties; where Satan is most busy
   to hinder, Zech. iii. 1, they are most helpful: the angels are in the
   assemblies of the faithful, 1 Cor. xi. 10. So in dangers; when Peter
   was in prison, God sendeth him an angel to bring him out, Acts xii.
   Ruffinus speaketh of a young man, a martyr on the rack, that had his
   face wiped by an angel, and refreshed by him in the midst of his pains.
   Nay, in casual dangers, which we cannot foresee and prevent: Ps. xci.
   12, He shall give his angels charge over thee, that thou dash not thy
   foot against a stone.' So in temptations; Mat. iv. 11, they ministered'
   to Christ when he was tempted by the devil; they came to show how God
   will deal with his people in like cases. Once more, they are with us to
   comfort us in death; in the midst of his agonies the Lord Jesus was
   comforted and refreshed by an angel, Luke xxii. 43; so they are with
   the faithful, helping and easing them in their sicknesses. After death
   they carry our souls to heaven, as Lazarus was carried into Abraham's
   bosom, Luke xvi. 22. Though the body had not the honour of a pompous
   burial, yet the soul is solemnly conveyed by angels, and gathered up
   into the communion of the souls of just men made perfect; as Christ
   himself also ascended into heaven in the company of angels, Acts i.
   Once more, after death they guard our bodies in the grave, as the
   angels guarded Christ's sepulchre, Mat. xxviii. 2-4. God did set his
   guards, as well as the high priests. Their last ministry and service
   about the faithful is to gather up their bodies at the last day: They
   shall gather up the elect from the four winds,' Mat. xxiv. 31, and then
   their office and charge ceaseth.

   9. This tutelage is ever administered according to God's pleasure: Ps.
   ciii. 21, Ye ministers of his that do his pleasure;' not their own, not
   ours, but his pleasure. The help of angels is more powerful, but no
   more absolute, than the help of other means, for it dependeth still on
   the will of God, as all other means of defence and outward support do;
   their employment is to attend us, and serve us, according to the Lord's
   direction.

   Let us now apply what hath been spoken.

   Use 1. First, it serveth for information, to show us:--

   1. The care of God for the elect. He engageth his own power for our
   preservation, as also the mediation of Christ, the conduct of the
   Spirit, and the ministry of angels. In Zech. i. you have a scheme of
   providence; the man that stood among the myrtle trees' sent the angels
   to and fro throughout the earth, and then they came and gave him an
   account of what passed in the world. The man is Jesus Christ, who, to
   prefigure his incarnation, is thus represented; and he hath all the
   angels at his command, to send them forth as the condition of his
   church requireth; and they, as his intelligencers and agents, are to
   bring him notice how all affairs and matters pass in the world. Thus
   doth the Lord set forth himself to our capacity, and that we, who are
   used to means, may the better believe in him.

   2. The condescension and humility of the angels; they rejoice in names
   of service more than in names of honour, and will perform offices of
   respect to the meanest creatures,--an angel clothed with light and
   glory would come to the shepherds,--and do not refuse at Christ's
   direction to wait upon those who are despised and rejected of men.

   3. It informeth us of their man-kindness, which shameth our envy; their
   love is great to mankind, and are affectionately desirous of our good,
   and therefore decline no office of love and service to us. They
   rejoiced when the world was created as a dwelling-place for man Job
   xxxviii. 7; and again at the coming of Christ, which was man's
   restoring, Luke ii. 13; and so at the calling and conversion of a
   sinner, Luke xv. 7, when we come to be possessed of our privileges in
   Christ.

   4. It informeth us of the dignity of the saints. What a price doth the
   Lord and the holy angels set upon the meanest Christian; God's own
   court is their guard. Certainly a godly man, though of the meanest
   calling, should not be contemptible; there is somewhat in holiness more
   than the world seeth, some worth in it, or else God would not set such
   a guard upon it, a guard so full of state and strength. It was a mighty
   favour for Mordecai to have a courtier of a great king to wait upon him
   for one hour: we have angels that still attend and wait for our good.

   5. It informeth us of the obedience of the angels in the lowest
   services. God saith, Go, and they go, though it be to wait upon poor
   and mean creatures. We usually dispute commands when we should practise
   them, and stick at duties that have anything of abasement and
   self-denial in them. In the Lord's Prayer we are brought to this
   pattern, Mat. vi., Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven,' that
   is, by the holy angels; it should be done by us with like readiness and
   submission. No office or employment that God calleth us to should be
   looked upon as too mean and base for us; the angels, that excel in
   strength, when God commandeth, being willing to condescend to the
   guardianship of men.

   Use 2. Secondly, it serveth for exhortation to the children of God:--

   1. To wait for the angels' help. Do you keep in God's ways in your
   callings, and you shall have safety and defence, when the Lord sees it
   fit for you. Remember you are a spectacle to God, men, and angels, in
   all your actions, trials, and sufferings, and bear up with a confidence
   becoming Christians. Though you can do little as to the promotion of
   Christ's interest, what cannot God do by his angels?

   2. To behave ourselves as those that do expect this help, not tempting
   God, not grieving the angels. We should take heed how we carry
   ourselves in regard of this honourable attendance; our sins and vanity
   offendeth them, as it doth God. Lot was a man of a mixed nature, yet
   vexed with the impure conversation' of the Sodomites, 2 Peter ii. 8.
   Angels are pure and holy creatures, that still abode in the truth;
   pride, lust, and vanity is very offensive to them, especially
   impurities and indecencies in God's worship, about which they have a
   special attendance; therefore the apostle biddeth the women to cover
   their heads because of the angels, 1 Cor. xi. 10, their fashion being
   to come into the congregation with loose dishevelled locks; he mindeth
   them of the presence of the angels. We may use a like argument to women
   to cover their naked breasts, now their immodesty is grown so impudent
   as to out-face the ordinances of God.

   3. To observe this when it is bestowed upon us: The angel of the Lord
   encampeth round about them that fear him;' and then, Oh! come, taste
   and see,' Ps. xxxiv. 7, 8. When deliverances are strange and wonderful,
   and there is the least concurrence of visible causes to defend Christ's
   interest, remember that all things, visible and invisible, were created
   by Christ and for Christ, even thrones, principalities, and powers,'
   Col. i. 16.

   Use 3. Thirdly, Here is reproof to wicked men, that perform the devils'
   ministry, act the part of the bad angels rather than the good, despise,
   slander, oppose, seduce, and tempt the children of God. How darest thou
   despise those whom the angels honour? You think them unworthy of your
   countenance and company, when angels disdain not to vouchsafe them
   their service and attendance. You slander those whom they defend, and
   oppose and persecute them whom they are engaged to protect, and wrong
   them whose angels behold the face of God, and tempt and seduce them
   whom they rejoice to see brought home to God.

   Obs. 4. I have but one word more, and I have done with this point. Get
   this interest if you would be under this tutelage; get an interest in
   Christ, and then you get an interest in the angels, their angels,' &c.,
   Mat. xviii. 10. They are not called God's, but theirs. Hereafter the
   saints shall be isa'ngeloi, Like the angels-in heaven,' Luke xx. 36;
   and here, till we have this glory, we shall have their defence.

   In the next place, somewhat may be observed from the style and
   character of this angel, Michael, the archangel.' That there is an
   order among the angels, both good and bad; they have their distinct
   heads; we read of Michael, and we read of Beelzebub; there is an order
   in hell, thence that expression, Mat. xxv. 41, The devil and his
   angels,' which seemeth to intimate a prince among the unclean spirits;
   much more is there an order among the good angels. God, that made all
   things in order, would not endure confusion among those heavenly
   creatures, for that would seem to infringe their happiness; but now to
   define this order, and the several degrees of it, were but to intrude
   ourselves into things we have not seen,' Col. ii. 16. Cyril [137]
   calleth it te`n ton tolmeron kurio'teta, the domineering of bold
   spirits. The schoolmen take upon them as if they knew all the
   particulars of their government and distinction; but in things not
   revealed there can be no certainty. The apostle indeed speaketh of
   several ranks of in visible creatures: Col. i. 16, Thrones, dominions,
   principalities, and powers;' but who can particularly define their
   office and order? A distinction there is, but what it is we know not;
   however the general consideration is useful; partly to show us the
   necessity of order and subordination; no creatures can subsist without
   it. They that are against magistracy are against peace and happiness;
   the angels and devils are not without their heads and princes. Partly
   to represent to us the majesty of God; he hath angels, and archangels,
   thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers. Our eyes are dazzled at
   the magnificence and lustre of earthly kings, when we see them
   surrounded with dukes, marquises, and earls, and barons. Oh! what poor
   things are these to those orders and degrees of angels with which God
   is environed! Partly to acquaint us with the happiness of the
   everlasting estate. It is the misery of the wicked that they shall be
   cast out with the devil and his angels,' and our happiness that we
   shall make up one church and assembly with angels and archangels, Heb.
   xii.

   Obs. 5. Somewhat may be observed from the matter of the contention, the
   body of Moses, which the devil would abuse to idolatry; that is the
   reason why he was so earnest in the contest. Note, that the devil
   loveth idolatry; all false worships, either directly or by consequence,
   tend to the honour of the devil; therefore idol-feasts are called the
   table of devils,' 1 Cor. x. 21. Now it is observable that those
   sacrifices which were offered to the true God, but in an unbecoming
   manner, are called the sacrifices of devils,' Lev. xvii. 7, compare it
   with ver. 3, 4. Though they killed a goat, or an ox, or a lamb to the
   Lord for a sacrifice, because it was in the camp, and not before the
   tabernacle, God saith, They shall no more offer sacrifice to devils.'
   So it is said of God's own people, Deut. xxxii. 17, They sacrifice to
   devils, and not unto God,' In their intention it was unto God, but in
   the issue and necessary interpretation of it, it was to the devil. Now
   the devil delights in idols and false worships, partly in malice to
   God. The Lord above all things is most tender of his worship, and
   therefore Satan is most busy to corrupt it. There are two things that
   are dear to God--his truth and his worship. Now Satan bendeth his
   strength and spite to corrupt his truth with error, and his worship
   with superstition. Partly in malice and spite to men. God is a jealous
   God; Satan knoweth that corruptions of worship do not go unrevenged:
   Ps. xvi. 4, Sorrows shall be multiplied on them that hasten after
   another God.' Of all sinners they shall not escape; the severest
   revenges of God have been occasioned by prevarications in worship; as
   Lev. x. 3, on Aaron's sons strange fire in the censers brought down
   strange fire from heaven; so 1 Sam. vi. 20, there were fifty thousand
   Bethshemites slain for an undue circumstance; so the breach made upon
   Uzzah,' 2 Sam. vi. 6. 7. The devil is not ignorant of this, and
   therefore, longing for man's destruction, seeketh to hasten it as much
   as he can by idolatry and false worship. Partly out of pride; he is
   constant in evil, and abode in pride; though he abode not in the truth,
   he would fain be worshipped, and assumed into a fellowship of the
   divine honour and glory. He saith to Christ, Mat. iv. 9, Fall down and
   worship me, and I will give thee all these things.' The devil is no
   changeling; though he doth not retain his place, he retaineth his
   pride: nothing so pleasing to him as worship and adoration, and so he
   can get it any way from the creatures, he is contented.

   Use 1. Well, then, it showeth us:--

   1. What care we should take to be right in worship, both for the object
   and manner. It is idolatry not only to worship false gods in the place
   of the true God, but to worship the true God in a false manner, and
   both sorts do gratify the devil. W r hen he cannot hold the people
   under utter blindness and paganism, he is glad if he can draw them to
   undue rites and ceremonies in worship; therefore let us hate the least
   kind of idolatry, if we would not prog for the devil's kingdom. David
   saith, Ps. xvi. 4, I will not take their name into my lips;' that he
   would abhor the very mention of idols. So Hosea ii. 16, God would no
   more be called Baal, though it signified Lord and husband, because the
   title had been applied to idols. The Israelites, when they took cities,
   they changed their names if they had any tincture of idolatry: Num.
   xxxii. 38, Nebo and Baalmeon, their names being changed;' so exact
   should we be in keeping from idols.

   2. Let ns beware of idolatry. Satan loveth it, and that is motive
   enough. We should hate as Christ hateth, and love as he loveth, Rev.
   ii. 6; and on the contrary, love what Satan hateth, and hate what he
   loveth. Naturally we are wondrous prone to this sin, and therefore
   idolatry is reckoned as a work of the flesh,' Gal. v. 20. Man naturally
   hath a corrupt and working fancy and imagination, which, depending upon
   sense, formeth fleshly conceptions and notions of God; and therefore
   are we so prone to err in this worship. It is not needful, I hope, to
   speak to you of paganish and popish idolatry; let me only now dissuade
   you:--

   First, From making the true God an idol in your thoughts, by forming
   apprehensions unworthy of the glory of his essence: Ps. l. 21, Thou
   thoughtest that I was altogether like thyself.' Now, thus we do when we
   conceive him of such a mercy as to hold fellowship with one that
   continueth under the full power of his sins, so weak as not to be able
   to help in deep extremities, Zech. viii. 6, of a rigorous and
   revengeful disposition, as not to pardon injuries and offences upon
   submission and repentance, Hosea xi. 8, of a fickle nature, so as to
   fail in his promises, Num. xxiii. 19. Thus it is easy to turn the true
   God into an idol of our own brains. To remedy this, consider God in his
   works and in Christ. In his works: Cyril, I remember, observeth, that
   before the flood we read of no idolatry. Aquinas addeth a reason to the
   observation, because the memory of the creation was then fresh in their
   thoughts. Again, look upon God in Christ: you heard before, in Lev.
   xvii., if they did not bring their sacrifice to the tabernacle, it was
   called a sacrifice of devils. The tabernacle was a type of Christ. You
   make God an idol when you worship him out of Christ, for the Father
   will be honoured in the Son, John v. Therefore, whenever you go to God,
   take Christ along with you.

   Secondly, From setting up any idol against God in your affections. When
   you set up anything above God in your esteem, especially in your trust,
   that is an idol. Covetousness is twice called idolatry, Col. iii. 5,
   Eph. v. 5, because it doth withdraw our affections from God; yea, our
   care, our esteem, our trust, which is the chiefest homage and respect
   which God expecteth from the creature. I mention these things because I
   would speak somewhat to practice, and because Satan is gratified with
   spiritual idolatry, as well as with that which is gross and bodily.

   Obs. 6. From that clause, about the body of Moses, once more observe,
   that of all kinds of idolatry, the devil abuseth the world most with
   idolatrous respects to the bodies and relics of dead saints. If you ask
   why, I answer--Partly because this kind of idolatry is most likely to
   take, as being the most plausible and suitable to that reverent esteem
   which we have of those that are departed in the Lord; and so our
   religious affections become a snare to us: partly because when men
   become objects of worship and adoration, the Godhead is made more
   contemptible, and men's conceits of a divine power run at a lower rate
   every day: partly because this malicious fiend hopeth this way to beat
   the Lord with his own weapon, when the bodies and relics of those
   saints who, by the famousness of their examples, were likely to draw
   many to God, do as much, or more, withdraw men from him, and
   superstition doth as much hurt as their example did good: partly
   because the devil, by long experience, hath found this to be a
   successful way in the world. Lactantius proveth it, that the idolising
   of famous men was the rise of all idolatry; and Tertullian, in the end
   of his Apology, observeth the same, that heathen idolatry came in this
   way: sub nominibus et imaginibus mortuorum--by a reverence to the
   images of dead men whose memory was precious amongst them. Ninus, or
   Nimrod, the first idolater, set up his own dead father, Belus; whence
   came the names of Baal and Bel for an idol. The teraphim, stolen by
   Rachel, Gen. xxxi. 35, were the images of their ancestors, whom Laban
   worshipped. So in the primitive times, before any other idolatry was
   brought into the church, they began with the tombs and shrines of the
   martyrs.

   Use 1. First, It showeth us the first rise of idolatry, respect to the
   relics and remains of some men famous in their generations. Satan
   attempted it betimes, not only among the heathens, but among the people
   of God; he contended for the body of Moses, that he might set it up for
   this use; but that which he could not obtain then he hath effected now
   in the Roman synagogue, by the arms, the legs, the hands, the feet, the
   pictures of the martyrs. Surely such a known artifice and ancient
   method of deceit, a man would think, should long ere this have been
   discerned, but that God hath given them up to believe a lie.' Well
   might the antichristian state be called, Rev. xi. 8, Babylon, Sodom,
   and Egypt;' that is, Babylon for idolatry, Sodom for filthiness, and
   Egypt for ignorance and darkness; the same idolatry being practised
   which was in use in the darkest times of paganism. Heathenism and
   Popery differ but little, only the names are changed, a new saint for
   an old heathen idol; their canonising and the heathens' apothe'osis are
   much alike; so are their saints and the heathens' heroes and middle
   powers: only that the Papists have put many in the calendar which
   either never were in the world, or else were wicked and traitorous; as
   our Becket, and St George, an Arian bishop, that so the devil might be
   doubly gratified--by the shrine itself, and that, by the canonisation
   of the infamous person, sin might become less odious.

   Secondly, It showeth the perverseness of men, who are apt
   superstitiously to regard the relics of them dead whom they despised
   living. Moses was often opposed living, and after death likely to be
   adored; as it is often the condition of God's people to live hated and
   die sainted. Vetus morbus est, saith Salvian, quo mortui sancti
   coluntur, vivi contemnuntur. The Scribes and Pharisees garnished the
   tombs of the dead prophets, and killed the living,' Mat. xxiii. 29, 30;
   and the Jews, in the 5th of John, pretended love to Moses, and showed
   hatred to Christ. Posterity honoureth them whom former ages destroyed;
   living saints are an eyesore; they torment the world, either by their
   example or their reproofs, Rev. xi. 10, Heb. xi. 7; but objects out of
   sight do not exasperate and stand in the way of our lusts. This fond
   affection is little worth; those that were ready to adore Moses would
   not imitate him.

   Obs. 7. Again from that he durst not, ouk etolmese, he had not the
   boldness to do anything contrary to the law of God, or unbeseeming his
   rank and ministry. Note, that sin is a hold contest, or a daring of
   God. Every sin is an affront to the law that forbiddeth it: 2 Sam. xii.
   9, Wherefore hast thou sinned in despising the commandment?' A sinner
   doth in effect say, What care I for the commandment? I will go on for
   all that; but a godly man feareth the commandment,' Prov. xiii. 13. If
   a law of God standeth in his way, he durst not go forward; he feareth
   more to break a law than to meet with the devil in all his ruff, or any
   opposition from the world; this is a holy timorousness: whereas, on the
   contrary, no such boldness as in sinning; it is not only a despising of
   the law, but a contest with God himself: 1 Cor. x. 22, Do we provoke
   the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?' Will you enter into the
   lists with God, as if you could make your part good against him? Ezek.
   xxii. 14. He that sins against light and conscience, he biddeth open
   defiance to the majesty of God, and his lust and God's will do contend
   for the mastery. Let this make us afraid of sin, it is a daring attempt
   of the creature against his maker, a challenging of God to the combat.
   Well might the apostle say that the carnal mind is e'chthra, enmity
   against God.' Rom. viii. 7. Therefore, when you are tempted, consider,
   What am I now a-doing? Shall I challenge the combat of my maker? draw
   omnipotency about my ears? An angel durst not: How can I do this
   wickedness and sin against God?' Gen. xxxix. 9. Again, it informeth us
   what is the proper remedy against sin--a holy awe and fear; therefore,
   the first and chiefest point of true wisdom is made to be the fear of
   God,' Prov. ix. 10; so Prov. xiv. 27, this keepeth the soul from
   daring. Job's eschewing evil is ascribed to his fearing God, Job i. 1.
   There are two grounds of this fear--God's power and goodness.

   1. God's power. Shall we contend with him who can command legions?
   Surely he will always overcome when he judgeth.' Rom. iii. 4, and have
   the best of it at last; and so. this sin will be my ruin. There is a
   difference between striving with him in a sinful, and wrestling with
   him in a gracious way; there God will be overcome by his own strength:
   Command ye me,' &c., Isa. xlv. 11; but when you have the confidence to
   contest with him in a sinful way, what will become of you? Ps. lxxvi.
   7, Thou, even thou, art to be feared; and who can stand in thy wrath
   when thou art angry?' Man may make his part good against man, but who
   can cope with the Lord himself?

   2. God's love and mercy; that should beget a fear, or an un willingness
   to displease God: Hosea iii. 5, They shall fear the Lord and his
   goodness;' not only abstain from sin (as a dog from the bait, for fear
   of a cudgel) out of bondage or servile fear, but out of a holy,
   childlike affection to God, and so do not only forbear sin, but abhor
   it. It is base and servile when we are moved with no other respects but
   our own danger. There is a holy fear, which ariseth from grace, and
   partly of nature: an archangel durst not, that is, the holiness of his
   nature would not permit him. There is a holy reverent fear, by which we
   fear to offend our good God as the greatest evil in the world; and it
   ariseth partly from the new nature, and partly from thankfulness to
   God, because of his mercy in Jesus Christ.

   I have done with this note when I have told you that boldness in
   sinning resembleth the devil, but a holy fear resembleth Michael. It is
   devil-like to adventure upon sin without fear and shame. Satan had the
   impudency to seek to defeat the Lord's purpose of burying the body of
   Moses, but the good angel, in opposing him, durst not bring a railing
   accusation.' Certainly they that fear neither God nor man,' Luke xviii.
   7, have outgrown the heart of a man, and are next to the devils. Many
   account it a praise to themselves when they are bold to engage in
   villanous actions and attempts. Oh! to be presumptuous and self-willed
   is the worst character that can be given to a man, 2 Peter iii. 10; a
   stubborn boldness argueth a seared conscience.

   Obs. 8. Once more from that, ouk eto'lmese, he durst not; that the
   angels are of a most holy nature, which will not permit them to sin:
   therefore they are called holy angels,' Mat. xxv. 31, and the devils
   unclean spirits.' In their apparitions they usually came in a garb that
   represented their innocency; as at Christ's sepulchre there were two
   angels in white, the one at head, the other at feet, where Jesus had
   lain,' John xx. 12 So to Daniel: chap. x. 5, one appeared, having his
   loins girt with fine gold of Uphaz,' with long white robes; gold, to
   show his majesty; in white robes, as an emblem of purity and holiness:
   see Acts x. 30. Now this holiness they have partly by the gift of God
   in their creation. God made them so at the first, which may beget a
   hope in us men; the same God must sanctify us that made the holy
   angels: surely he can wash us, though never so filthy, and make us
   whiter than snow,' Ps. li. 7. Partly by the merit of Christ, which
   reached to things in heaven as well as in earth, Col. i. 20, Eph. i.
   10. If those places be not cogent, but be thought to intend the
   glorified saints, yet because they are called elect angels,' 1 Tim. v.
   21, and all election is carried on in and by Christ, Eph. i. 4, it
   seemeth probable at least that they have benefit by him; yea, Heb. xii.
   22, 23, they are made a part of that general assembly' of which Christ
   is the head, and so by consequence they are members of the redeemed
   society; which should encourage us the more to come to Christ. Angels
   have much of their whiteness from being washed in Christ's blood; they
   are preserved in Jesus Christ as well as we, and have their
   confirmation from him, or else they had fallen with the other apostate
   spirits.

   Again, this holiness is the more increased and augmented:--

   1. By their constant communion with God, for their always beholding his
   face must needs beget the more holy awe and reverence: Michael durst
   not, &c. It is a great advantage to holiness to set God before our
   eyes, and to foresee him in all our ways: Ps. xviii. 23, I was upright
   before thee;' that is, the thought of his being before God made him
   more sincere: He that doth evil hath not seen God,' 3 John 11; that is,
   hath no acquaintance with him: the good angels, being so near the
   chiefest good, are at the greater distance from evil.

   2. By their continual obedience: They do his commandments, hearkening
   to the voice of his word,' Ps. ciii. 20. Exercise perfecteth and
   strengtheneth every habit. The angels, the more they do the will of
   God, the more they hate what is contrary to his will. The evil angels
   grow worse by frequent acts of spite and malice, and the good, angels
   better by frequent acts of duty. For the first, see 1 John iii. 8, The
   devil sinneth from the beginning.' Satan is still a-sinning, and his
   whole life a continued act of apostasy. So the good angels are always
   doing;' they rest not day and night,' Rev. iv. 8. Surely it will be a
   matter of great advantage to exercise ourselves unto godliness,' the
   greater will be our hatred of sin, and delight in obedience; as on the
   other side the exercising of the heart unto sin doth much strengthen
   and increase it, 2 Peter ii. 14. In heaven, where there is continual
   duty, there is no sin.

   Use 1. Let us apply it now.

   First, It serveth to humble us. We are the next rank of reasonable
   creatures, but how do we differ from them? Their natures engage them to
   holiness, and ours, being corrupted, engage us to sin; their nature
   will not permit them to sin, and our nature will not permit us to do
   that which is good, Rom. vii. 21. And yet the angels are ashamed of
   this their nature; they cover their faces when they behold God's: Job
   xv. 14, 15, What is man, that he should be clean? and he that is born
   of a woman, that he should be righteous? Behold, he putteth no trust in
   his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.' These holy
   angels, when they compare themselves with God, are abased; and should
   not we much more? See also Job iv. 19.

   Secondly, It serveth to stir us up to holiness. You will say, Where
   lieth the motive? I answer:--

   1. We are bound as well as they. They behold his face,' and we behold
   his face in a glass;' we are under a law as well as they, yea,
   commanded to observe their pattern: Mat. vi. 10, Thy will be done on
   earth, as it is in heaven.' The examples of the saints on earth are no
   fit copy for us to write after, for there we shall find many of the
   letters set awry. In their lives corruption is more visible than grace.
   Therefore Christ giveth us a copy from heaven, that we might aim at the
   holiness and perfection of the angels. It is but equal that we, who
   expect to be like the angels' in glory, Luke xx. 36, isa'ngeloi, should
   be like them in grace now. Many would strive to be as angels for gifts
   and parts, but not for holiness, for exact purity and cheerfulness and
   readiness in service, which yet are the things propounded to our
   imitation. The devil retaineth cunning since his apostasy. To be wise
   to do evil is to be like the bad angels, not the good. If you would not
   be cast out with them hereafter, you should not take their copy and
   example for imitation, but that of the holy angels.

   2. We are bound more than they, as being of an inferior rank; and acts
   of submission and obedience do chiefly oblige inferiors. The angels
   themselves are inferior to God; but dwellers in houses of clay' much
   more. That passage of the psalmist is emphatical, Ps. ciii. 20, The
   angels, that excel in strength, do his commandments.' Shall the peasant
   scorn that work in which the prince himself is engaged? If the glorious
   mighty angels durst not sin against God, we should not much more. When
   John would have worshipped the angel, he saith, Rev. xxii. 9, See thou
   do it not, for I am thy fellow-servant.' Ah! who would decline the work
   when an angel is our fellow-servant? When these mighty spirits put
   their necks to the work of the Lord, shall sorry man be excused?

   3. We are the more bound for their sakes, because of their tutelage,
   They are present with. us. We are awed by a man of gravity, much more
   should we be by the presence of an angel. When Cato was upon the stage,
   they durst not call for their obscene sports. There is an angel always
   by you. What reports, think you, will they carry to Christ, if they
   should see anything that is unseemly? 1 Tim. v. 21, I charge you before
   God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels,' fec. The holy
   angels are, as it were, the spies and intelligencers of heaven, and do
   acquaint Christ, not only with our miseries, but our sins. God's
   omnipresency is a great depth, we cannot fathom it with our thoughts,
   and therefore it worketh but little with us. The nearer things come to
   the manner of our presence, the more do they affect us. Consider the
   angels are present with you in the room where, it may be, you are
   acting your privy wickedness.

   Again, we had need be holy, the rather for the angels' sake, because
   else we shall lose their tutelage. They care not to take notice of an
   impure, obstinate sinner: Ps. xxxiv. 7, The angel of the Lord encampeth
   round about them that fear him.' They that fear God themselves delight
   most in them that do likewise. Suitableness of spirit and life breedeth
   a holy and sweet familiarity between us. They delight to keep us, and
   go with us here, that they may lay a foundation for a more familiar
   acquaintance in heaven. Now, shall we grieve such blessed companions?
   When Balaam went to curse the people of God, a good angel resisteth
   him, Num. xxii. 22. If an angel stood in the way of a sorcerer, much
   more do they seek to stop and prevent the miscarriages and offences of
   God's children. Will you break forth or go on violently when an angel
   standeth in the way, and leave their tutelage for a lust? They are
   holy, and disallow all carnal enterprises, and would withstand the
   execution of them. Will you constrain them to forsake you? You know how
   it sped with Josiah, when he would not turn his face, but go out
   without the defence of God and his angels. See 2 Chron. xxxv. 22; he
   was wounded in the battle, and goeth home and dieth.

   Thirdly, It teacheth us to be more awe-full; all fear is not slavish.
   The angels, that have a pure nature, are afraid to sin; we have a mixed
   nature: corruption is already gotten into our souls, and therefore have
   more need of caution; as they that have an enemy without and a
   treacherous party within have need to watch and ward. Fear is all the
   remedy left us; we cannot stop the flux of natural corruption, but we
   may withstand a natural temptation. As the angels resist the admission
   of sin, so let us withstand the increase and propagation of it; we are
   always in the presence of God, and shall we affront him to his face?
   Fear keepeth the angels pure and us holy, them from the admission of
   sin, and us from the commission of it: so Solomon saith, Blessed is he
   that feareth always,' Prov. xxviii. 14; that is, not that perplexeth
   himself with needless terrors and scruples; that were a torture, not a
   blessedness; that is the devils' fear, who believe and tremble.' But
   when we are always cautious, out of a deep respect to God, that we dare
   not offend him at any time, this is a blessed fear, like the good
   angels' fear; as Michael here durst not bring a railing accusation.'

   Obs. 9. The next point is from that a railing accusation. In the
   original it is krisin blasphemias, the judgment or sentence of
   blasphemy, or evil-speaking.' The meaning is, such unworthy language as
   would not become any serious judgment or process; and because the angel
   was a party, not a judge, we translate it not a railing judgment, but a
   railing accusation. Thence observe, that to the worst adversary in the
   best cause, railing and reviling must not be used: Michael, when
   contending with the devil about the body of Moses,' &c. The reasons
   are:--

   1. Because such reproaches come from an evil principle, contempt or
   passion, both of which argue pride. One that over-valueth himself
   disdaineth others; and stormeth when he is crossed, as a full stream
   roareth and swelleth when it meeteth with a dam and obstruction.

   2. Such reproaches are most unsuitable to matters of religion. The God
   of peace will not be served with a wrathful spirit, and Christ's
   warfare needeth no carnal weapons. Christianity of all religions is the
   meekest and most humble; the foundation of it is the Lamb slain, and
   the consignation and sealing of it is by the Spirit, who descended in
   the form of a dove, both emblems of a modest humility; and should a
   meek religion be defended by the violence and fury of our passions?
   Cursing doth ill become them that are called to inherit a blessing,' 1
   Peter iii. 9.

   3. They are flatly against the word. The scripture is a great friend to
   the peace of human societies, for it condemneth the least offensive
   word and gesture: Isa. lviii. 9, Thou shalt put away from thee the
   yoke, and the putting forth of the finger;' a gesture of indignation,
   and therefore God would have it laid aside, even the putting forth of
   the finger, as well as the yoke broken. So see Mat. v. 22, But I say
   unto you, Whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause, is in
   danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say unto his brother, Raca,
   is in danger of the council: and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall
   be in danger of hell-fire.' The Scribes and Pharisees had restrained
   the sixth commandment to the gross act of murder; Christ telleth them
   that rash anger, with all the expressions of it, is murder. His
   expressions allude to the courts of the Jews; three there were
   specially among them--the lowest, the middle, and the highest. Their
   lowest judicatory was of three men, who took cognisance of lighter
   matters, as injuries and strifes about goods, and things of a pecuniary
   concernment; this court was set up in lesser towns that had few in
   habitants. The second court was of three and twenty men, before whom
   the weightiest causes were brought: concerning the life of a man, all
   capital crimes, or if an ox had gored a man or woman, or in case of any
   abominable commixtion with a beast, if a woman approached to a beast,
   &c., Lev. xx. 16. This court was set up in all the cities of Palestine,
   and was called the lesser Sanhedrim; and because Jerusalem was the head
   city, the seat of the prince and temple was there, therefore, in that
   city were two of these lesser Sanhedrims: the lower sate in the Gate of
   the Mountain, that is, that gate which gave en trance to the mountain
   of the temple; the other, being the higher, sate in the Gate of Ezra,
   near the porch of the temple. The third judicatory was the greater
   Sanhedrim, which consisted of severity men, in imitation of the counsel
   of God to Moses, Num. xi. 16. This was the highest judicatory, from
   whence there was no appeal, as there might be from the lower courts to
   this. Into this assembly were chosen such as did excel others for
   nobility and wisdom, and that by a solemn laying on of hands; strangers
   or unclean persons or common people might not come nigh unto them. To
   this tribunal were referred all doubtful matters too hard for inferior
   courts to decide, Deut. xvii. 8, 9, as also all things that did belong
   to the twelve tribes, or to the whole nation; all things that concerned
   the high priest, matters of war and peace, the false prophet, fec.
   Therefore Christ saith, Luke xiii. 33, It can not be that a prophet
   should perish out of Jerusalem,' that being the city where the
   Sanhedrim sate. By this court was Christ condemned, and the apostles,
   Acts iv. 5; and Stephen, chap. vii. 7; and Paul, chap, xxiii. 1. They
   sate in a part of the temple called Gasith; their punishments were
   strangling, beheading, stoning, burning; those that were condemned to
   be burned were burnt in the Valley of Hinnom; and in great cases,
   besides his corporal death, the malefactor was appointed and accursed
   to the judgment of hell. Let me apply all to the present case. Christ
   doth not meddle with the lowest court, the judgment of three men,
   because capital matters did not belong to their cognisance, and his
   intent is to show what a capital matter the least expression of anger
   is: Whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause,' saith he, is
   in danger of judgment;' that is, of the judgment of twenty-three men,
   to show that rash anger is before God a capital matter. And whosoever
   shall say to his brother, Raca'--thou vain and witless fellow; this was
   the lowest kind of contumely then in use; some make it only an
   interjection of indignation--is in danger of the council;' that is, of
   the Sanhedrim, which noteth, that anger expressed, though in the lowest
   way, is a higher fault than single and bare anger, as the fault was
   greater for which they appeared before the higher Sanhedrim than that
   for which they appeared be fore the twenty-three judges. But whosoever
   shall say, Thou fool'--this noteth a higher contempt, as implying a
   charge, not only of weakness of nature, but of sin and wickedness,--he
   is in danger of hell-fire,' which was the highest judgment of the
   Sanhedrim, to burn them in the Valley of Hinnom, and to leave them
   accursed till the Lord come; and so proportionably it noteth the
   greatness of the crime which is committed in slandering and reproaching
   our brethren. It is a most odious sin before God; for, in allusion to
   man's judgment, he showeth, that though there be degrees in the sin,
   and will be in the punishment, yet the whole kind is very displeasing
   to the Lord.

   4. Because reproaches have an influence, and do exasperate rather than
   convince. The dog that followeth the game with barking and bawling
   loseth the prey; and there is not a more likely way to under mine the
   truth than an unseemly defence of it. Satan is mightily gratified, if
   men had eyes to see it, with the ill-managing of God's cause.

   Use 1. First, It serveth for information, to show us the vanity of
   those excuses by which men would disguise their wrath and passion.
   What! will you plead, I am in the right way, it is God's cause?

   Ans. Passion is blind, and cannot judge: James i. 20, The wrath of man
   worketh not the righteousness of God.' The wrong way may be usually
   descried by the excesses and violences of those that are engaged in it.
   If we be in the right, extremities and furies of passion are not
   lawful; our religious affections may overset us. When religion, which
   should limit us, is made a party to engage them, it is hard to keep
   bounds. A stone, the higher the place from whence it falleth, giveth
   the more dangerous blow; so the higher the matter about which we
   contend, usually our anger falleth with the more violence, and is the
   more unmortified, because of the pretence of zeal. If the erring
   parties offend through ignorance, remember a bone out of joint must be
   settled again with a gentle hand, Gal. vi. 1. Are the opposite
   stubborn? In meekness instruct those that oppose themselves,' 2 Tim.
   ii. 25; when their absurd opposing is apt to tempt us to rage, passion,
   and reproach, we must contain ourselves; the hasty disciples knew not
   what spirit they were of.'

   Do they provoke, revile, wrong us first?

   Ans. The railing and ill-dealing of another doth not dissolve the bond
   of our duty to God; to return injury for injury is but to act over
   their sin; it was bad in them, and it is worse in us; for he that
   sinneth by example sinneth doubly, as having had experience of the
   odiousness of it in another--qui malum imitatur, bonus esse non potest.
   Revenge and injury differ only in order of time; the one is first, the
   other second in the fault; and it was no excuse to Adam that he was not
   first in the transgression.' Christianity teacheth us a rare way of
   overcoming injuries, not only by patience, but doing good to those that
   wrong us: Rom. xii. 17, and 1 Peter iii. 9, Bender not reviling for
   reviling, but, contrariwise, blessing.' We have for our pattern Christ,
   who being reviled, reviled not again,' 1 Peter ii. 23, And herein he
   was imitated by his disciples, 1 Cor. iv. 13, blasphemou'menoi
   parakaloumen, being defamed, we intreat'--a motto which I would have
   prefixed to all rejoinders or replies to a virulent opposition.
   Calvin's modesty concerning Luther is notable: Etiamsi me, diabolum
   vocarit, eum tamen insignem Dei servum agnoscam--though he should call
   me devil, yet God forbid but I should account him an eminent servant of
   Christ. It was once an argument for the truth of our religion that the
   scriptures contained a doctrine that could not be of men, as forbidding
   revenge, which is so sweet to nature, and commanding us to do good to
   them that hate us.

   But shall I suffer myself, and in me the cause of Christ, to be
   trampled upon?

   Ans. You are allowed a modest vindication of the truth and your own
   innocency: Prov. xxvi. 4, 5, Answer not a fool according to his folly,
   lest thou be like him. Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be
   wise in his own conceit.' You will say, Here is hot and cold in one
   breath. I answer--Solomon speaketh of a scoffing, railing fool; and the
   meaning is,--do not imitate him in his foolish passion. This were to be
   evil because he is so; and it is against reason, that because I am
   sensible of indecent carriage in him, therefore I should allow it in
   myself; but yet answer him,--that is to the purpose, and with solid
   reason beat down his presumption and ignorance with a meek but a strong
   reply, such as may check his pride, but not imitate his folly. It is
   observable, when it was said of Christ, John viii. 48, 49, Thou art a
   Samaritan, and hast a devil,' he answered not a word to the personal
   reproach; but where his commission was touched, to that he replieth,
   saying, I have not a devil, but I honour my father.' It is but weakness
   of mind, or strength of passion, to regard personal invectives. In
   short, we may answer, but not with harsh and contumelious language.

   Use. 2. Secondly, Here is a direction to public persons, and those that
   can handle the pen of the writer. Passion is apt to taint our religious
   defences; but check it. Michael durst not bring a railing accusation;'
   leave all unhandsomeness of prosecution to them that defend an evil
   cause: The servant of God must be gentle and patient,' 2 Tim. ii. 24.
   Opprobrious language doth but darken a just quarrel and contention. But
   you will say, May we not reprove the sins of men, and that somewhat
   sharply? I answer--Yea, it is lawful, as appeareth both by the practice
   of the prophets and angels, yea, of Christ himself, and also by the
   precepts of the word. Paul saith, Titus i. 7, that a bishop must not be
   self-willed, and soon angry;' and yet (ver. 13) he biddeth him
   elenchein apo'tomos, to rebuke some gainsayers sharply. There is a
   great deal of difference between railing and a reproof. A sermon
   without some warmth and keenness in it is but like a cold ration; men
   that speak from their brain will speak coldly, because they only
   declaim against things for fashion's sake, without any sense or touch
   upon their hearts; an affectionate pleading for Christ is like strong
   water, whereas a formal narration is but like river water, without any
   strength and vigour. They that love Christ will be zealous for his
   truths and ordinances, and zeal cannot deliver itself without some
   smartness and earnestness; but a cold indifferency is more tame and
   flat. But then this must be done with great caution; you had need look
   to your spirits. Partly because Satan loveth to corrupt a religious
   affection; partly because, in these businesses, God is not only
   engaged, but ourselves; and many times the savour of the main river is
   lost when it is mingled with other streams; too, too often do we begin
   in the spirit and end in the flesh. The cautions which I shall give
   respect--(1.) The object, or cause; (2.) The persons; (3.) Manner; (4.)
   Principle; (5.) End.

   1. The cause must be regarded, that it be real and weighty: weighty it
   must be; it is preposterous to be all of a fire about question able
   truths and matters of a less regard. The flaming sword was set about
   paradise. And real it must be; the sin we reprove must be manifest, and
   the faults we charge apparent: Mat. v. 22, If any be angry with his
   brother without a cause,' &c. Otherwise Christ and his apostles called
   Raca, Mat. xxiii. 17, O fools and blind;' and Luke xxiv. 25, O fools
   and slow of heart to believe,' &c.; and Gal. iii. 1, O foolish
   Galatians;' and James ii. 20, O vain man,' &c. But in all these cases
   there was a cause. False and rash imputations are but railing; zeal
   being a fierce and strong passion, you must not let it fly upon the
   throat of anything but what is certainly evil.

   2. The persons must be considered; weak sinners are to be distinguished
   from the malicious, and the tractable from the obstinate. God's tender
   lambs, though straying, must be gently reduced;' put a difference,'
   saith our apostle, ver. 19. Ad evangelizandum, non maledicendum, missus
   es, said OEcolampadius to Farel, who was a good man, but a little too
   violent--Thou wert not sent to revile, but to preach the gospel. But on
   the other side, there is a difference to be used in the case of
   hypocrites, that gain by that repute and esteem which they have. Christ
   himself inveighed against the Pharisees, asperrimis verbis, in the
   roughest ways: Mat. xxiii., Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees,
   hypocrites,' &c. We may pluck off the disguise from a hypocrite,
   especially when they seduce and deceive the miserable multitude by an
   opinion of holiness. The Pharisees and Sadducees, to keep up their
   repute, submitted to John's baptism, but doth he treat them gently? No;
   Mat. iii. 7, O generation of vipers,' &c. So Paul to Elymas the
   sorcerer, Acts xiii., O thou full of all subtlety and mischief, thou
   child of the devil, and enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease
   to pervert the holy ways of the Lord?' In these cases there is a regard
   had to others, that they may not perish by too good an opinion of such
   deceivers; and here that of Solomon is of regard, Prov. xxviii. 4, They
   that forsake the law, praise the wicked; and they that keep the law,
   set themselves against them;' a vigorous opposition doth better here
   than a cold dislike.

   3. For the manner. With our zeal we should still manifest love and
   compassion; and our way of dealing must rather be rational than
   passionate. There is a holy contemperation of zeal and meekness if we
   could hit upon it; the same Spirit that appeared in cloven tongues of
   fire appeared also in the form of a dove. The work of righteousness'
   may be sown in peace,' James iii. 18. The church's garden thriveth by
   the cool gales of the north wind, as well as the sultry heat of the
   south, Cant. iv. 16; God's cause should neither be neglected nor
   disparaged by an indiscreet carriage.

   4. Concerning the principle; see that it be good; it must not be zeal
   for our private concernments, but for the glory of God; not a strange
   fire, but a holy fire. Moses was the meekest man upon earth in his own
   cause: Num. xii. 3, When Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses, the man
   Moses was meek above all men of the earth.' When our zealous contests
   come from a heart bleeding for God's dishonour, from hatred of sin, a
   fear of the public, then they are right. Lot was vexed not with Sodom's
   injuries, but Sodom's filthiness, 2 Peter ii. 8. When love of our
   neighbour, desire of his amendment, we are loath to suffer sin upon
   him, puts us upon this earnestness, our heart is upright with God; but
   when we seek to disgrace the men rather than condemn the sins, and we
   rage most upon the hazard of our own interest, and can be earnest
   against some sins and errors, and comply with worse, it is not zeal for
   God, but for a party.

   5. Great regard must be had to the end. A reproof aimeth at the
   conviction or conversion of a sinner, but censure at his disgrace and
   confusion. Our aim must be as right as our passion is strong; what ever
   we do must not be done out of a spirit of ostentation and popularity,
   or to keep up a devotion to our own interests. John Baptist sharply
   reproved the Pharisees, not when contemning his person, but when coming
   to his baptism.

   Obs. 10. There remaineth nothing of the 9th verse to be discussed but
   the last clause, the Lord rebuke thee. Though Michael doth not rail,
   yet he referreth the matter to God, Whence observe, that in religious
   contests we must carry on the opposition, though not in an unseemly
   manner. Michael doth not let Satan alone, so we must not let errors
   alone, and the devil carry it clearly without rub or opposition. Many,
   under a pretence of meekness, are still and silent in the cause of
   Christ. Cursed is this peace and meekness, when we let the envious man
   sow his tares, and we never give warning. God's messengers are compared
   to watchful dogs; when the wolf cometh we must bark; if the sleepy
   world be troubled at it we must bear their reproach.

   Obs. 11. Again, he referreth it to God, who is the fittest patron of
   his own causes. In our contests about religion, God must especially be
   sought unto for a blessing. Michael contended, bat said, The Lord
   rebuke thee; disputing times should also be praying times. Prejudices
   will never vanish till God send out his light and truth,' Ps. xliii. 3;
   and if the devil be not prayed down, as well as disputed down, little
   good cometh of our contests.

   Ver. 10. But these speak evil of the things which they know not; but,
   what they knoiu naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they
   corrupt themselves.

   In this verse he showeth the disproportion between them and the
   archangel; he was modest in a known good cause, but these are
   contemptuous, and given to railing in matters of which they are wholly
   ignorant. Two faults are charged upon them in this verse:--(1.) Pride,
   in condemning things without knowledge; (2.) Wickedness, in abusing the
   knowledge they had.

   But these, ou'toi, the seducers spoken of in the context, speak evil,
   blasphemousi, take liberty to belch out their reproaches of the things
   they know not. What are those things? Some say, the dignities before
   spoken of; others, the mysteries of the Christian faith. For the former
   opinion, that clause may be alleged, ver 8, ta`s doxas blasphemountas,
   speaking evil of dignities;' and so it will imply that they were
   ignorant of the nature of angels, with whom they pretended so great a
   familiarity as to know their courses, services, conjugations; [138] or
   else of the nature of church ordinances, they taking upon them to speak
   so reproachfully of the offices which God hath set in the church; or of
   the nature of civil power and magistracy, they allowing themselves in
   such intemperate language. But for the latter opinion, the universal
   particle in the text, o'sa me`n ouk oi'dasi, Whatsoever things they
   know not;' so Peter's phrase is general, 2 Peter ii. 12, But these, as
   natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the
   things they understand not.' The scope of both these apostles being to
   set out these deceivers as ignorant and brutish sensualists, and yet
   under a pretence of great and more curious knowledge than others had,
   wherefore they were called Gnostics. For my part, I shall interpret the
   clause generally of their ignorance in all truly spiritual matters,
   which was bewrayed in that they did deliver their sense in matter of
   magistracy and church ministries with some impudence and reproach. But
   what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt
   themselves. Before I come more particularly to open the words, let me
   tell you there is some difference about that clause, as brute beasts;
   to what part of the sentence is it to be referred? if to the former
   part, thus, what they know naturally as brute beasts, then the sense
   will be that knowledge which they have in common with the beasts. Man
   is in part an angel, in part a beast; in his reason and upper part of
   the soul he resembleth an angel, and in his appetite and senses a
   beast. What they know by their senses and brutish desires, that will be
   the sense, if you allow of this first reference. If to the latter part,
   thus, in those things as brute beasts they corrupt themselves, then it
   will suit with the parallel place in Peter, 2 Peter ii. 12, os a'loga
   zoa phusika`, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed;'
   and it will imply that they degenerated into beasts, notwithstanding
   that natural knowledge wherewith they were endowed. But to speak my own
   thoughts in this matter; the former reading is more agreeable to the
   posture of the words in the original, o'sa de phusikos os a'loga zoa
   epi'stantai, what they naturally as brute beasts know,' in those things
   they are worse than beasts, corrupting and defiling themselves by the
   excesses of the sensual appetite: as in eating and drinking, and the
   use of the woman in common copulation, as if there were no law, nor
   limited use of those things, which yet they might discern in the beasts
   themselves, and the dictates of their own consciences.

   This being premised, I come to explain the words. What they know,
   phusikos, naturally. There is a threefold light:--(1.) Sense or
   instinct; (2.) Reason; (3.) Grace; and accordingly as a man is
   furnished he may be said to be pneuma'tikos, spiritual, or furnished
   with the light of grace, or psuchiko`s, which we translate natural, 1
   Cor. ii. 14,--it signifieth one that hath nothing but the light of a
   reasonable soul. Lastly, phusiko`s, merely natural, which signifieth
   one guided by the blind motion and instinct of nature, without reason,
   counsel and choice, as the beasts are. So it is said here, what they
   know naturally,' that is, what they understand by natural inclination,
   or the mere judgment or perception of sense, to be good or evil, in
   those things they corrupt themselves, phthei'rontai, are corrupted. So
   Erasmus; but the word is not simply passive, but after the form of the
   conjugation Hithpael among the Hebrews, which infert passionem in se,
   it implieth such a passion as we cause to ourselves. But how do they
   corrupt themselves? sinfully or penally? I answer--Both ways; sinfully
   they corrupt and defile themselves, and so draw down punishments both
   upon their souls and bodies, 2 Peter ii. 12, They shall perish in their
   own corruption.'

   Obs. 1. Having made this way, I come to the observations; and in the
   first place observe, that truth is usually slandered out of ignorance;
   because men do not understand the ways and things of God, therefore
   they do condemn them. In the apostles' days, the doctrine of the cross'
   was accounted foolishness' by those that knew least of it; and
   afterwards the Christian religion was condemned because it could not be
   heard; Simul ac desinunt ignorare, desinunt odisse, so Tertullian in
   Apologia--when they knew it, they could not hate it. It is the devil's
   cunning to keep us at a distance from truths, and therefore burdeneth
   them with prejudices, that we may suspect rather than search, and
   condemn that out of ignorance and upon vulgar clamour which upon
   knowledge we could not choose but love and profess; and it is man's
   perverseness and pride to speak evil of things above his reach, and to
   disprove that which he has not attained unto or cannot understand.
   Nazianzen speaks of some ignorant people that condemned learning,
   because they had not the happiness to attain to it; i'na to` kat'
   autou`s kru'ptetai, saith he, Orat. xx.; that their own deficiency
   being the more common, might be less odious; or to instance in a higher
   case, Papists and carnal men scoff at imputed righteousness, assurance
   of salvation, and the testimony of the Spirit, because they are things
   they are utterly unacquainted with. Well, then, when we declaim against
   things, we should speak out of advised knowledge, not rash zeal. See
   John iii. 11, We speak that which we know, and testify that which we
   have seen:' zeal, as it must have a right aim, so a solid ground to
   proceed upon. It is a vain thing to begin at the affections, and to
   hate before we know: Prov. xviii. 13, He that answereth a matter before
   he heareth it, it is a folly and shame to him.' If you light right, it
   is but a happy mistake and stumble: Quid iniquius quam ut oderint
   homines quod ignorant, etiamsi res meretur odium--Tertul. ut supra.
   When the affections outstart the judgment, men grow obstinate in their
   ignorance, and will not know what they have a mind to hate: Malunt
   nescire quia jam oderunt, as Tertullian goeth on. Bash prejudices
   engaging men in opposition, they will not own the truth when
   represented to them; having hated it without knowledge, they hate it
   against knowledge, and so are hardened against the ways of God, which
   is the case of many who in a blind zeal have appeared against the
   public ministry and ordinances; and being engaged, are loath to strike
   sail, and lay down their defiance, when sufficient conviction is
   offered.

   Obs. 2. Observe again, blockish and stupid men are most bold in
   reproaching. A fool's wrath falleth very heavy, because it falleth with
   all its weight, there being nothing to restrain and stop it: Prov.
   xxvii. 3, A stone is heavy, and sand is weighty, but a fool's wrath is
   heavier than them both.' When the mind is void of judgment, it is more
   overcome and carried out in the way of a naughty passion. Usually we
   find it, the weakest spirits are most violent, there being nothing of
   judgment to counterbalance affection; men are all flame and rage.
   Liquors, when they run low and are upon the dregs, they grow more tart
   and sour; so it is usually with the dregs of men, for when they are
   weak and run in low parts, their opposition is most troublesome. What
   ado in the ministry have we with young heady professors, that have more
   heat than light! and how troublesome are those wild sectaries, that
   have only knowledge enough to prate a little against the undoubted
   ordinances of Jesus Christ! for there being nothing of knowledge and
   civility to restrain them, they easily give vent to the excesses of
   their passion, by clamour and evil-speaking.

   Obs. 3. From the second part of the charge, observe, that men of
   corrupt minds are usually sensual, and sensual men are usually men of
   corrupt minds; an unsound heart is best sheltered under unsound
   doctrine, and carnal delights blunt and weaken the edge and intension
   of the mind, so that they are very liable to mistakes. Therefore, on
   the one side, we should labour to keep the mind right and sound in the
   faith; fish stink first at the head; when the judgment is poisoned, the
   taint is soon conveyed to the affections. On the other side, add to
   your knowledge temperance,' 2 Peter i. 6. The apostle joineth these,
   because many times men of the greatest parts are overcome by appetite;
   and some say that temper of body which is fit for wit and scholarship
   is much inclined this way. Solomon, so famous for wisdom and knowledge,
   was enticed by women. Oh! let not fleshy lusts betray you. That is the
   best knowledge that endeth in temperance, or begets a holy moderation
   in the use of sensual pleasure; if we can not govern our affections, we
   know nothing as we ought to know;' nay, otherwise, your knowledge will
   be corrupted by your affections: many errors take their rise and
   beginning from evil manners and filthy lusts.

   Obs. 4. Observe again, that wicked men, left to themselves, do but
   abuse and corrupt that natural goodness and knowledge which they have
   in them. Natural abilities are soon depraved with evil habits. He that
   had but one talent is called a wicked and slothful servant,' Mat. xxv.
   26; slothful for not growing better, and wicked for growing worse.
   Naturally we are blind, and we cannot endure to be enlightened, 2 Peter
   iii. 5. Yea, rather, we put the finger in nature's eye, and then there
   cometh on judicial blindness, Rom. i. 28; we suffer lusts to blow out
   the candle of reason, and then we are justly left to the power of vile
   affections. Certainly they do not flatter us that say there is a power
   in nature as to conversion and turning to God. We are so far from
   improving ourselves, that we corrupt ourselves in what we know
   naturally,' and suffer brutish lusts to blind the mind and harden the
   heart.

   Obs. 5. Once more observe, sin where it reigneth turneth a man into a
   brute beast: Ps. xlix. 12, Man being in honour, abideth not; he is like
   the beasts that perish:' the meaning is, he abode not in the honour of
   his creation; hence compared to wolves for their cruelty, dogs for
   their filthiness, to horses and mules for the rage of lust, to a wild
   ass's colt for wildness and dulness of understanding; see Jer. v. 8,
   Ezek. xx. 23, Job xi. 12, Rev. xxii. 15. You may see here to what sin
   will bring you; with Nebuchadnezzar we outgrow the heart of a man; what
   he did through that deep melancholy that fell upon him by God's
   judgment, Dan. iv. 32, we do spiritually. If we had the head of a
   horse, or the face of a swine, or the hoofs of an ass, how should we be
   looked upon as monsters: but to have the hearts of the beasts is worse;
   to be like them in the inward man is more monstrous in the sight of
   God. Consider this, sin maketh a beast of you; nay, it maketh you worse
   than the beasts: The ass knoweth his owner,' &c., Isa. i. 3; they are
   serviceable to their benefactors, but thou art a rebel against God that
   made thee, and hath kept thee all thy days. The sluggard is put to
   school to the ant, Prov. vi. The beasts know their stint and measure; a
   horse or a dog will not be drunk, &c. Shall I speak one word more? Sin
   doth not only make a beast of you, but a devil of you: John vi. 70, One
   of you is a devil;' the devils said, What have we to do with thee,
   Jesus, thou son of David?' and wicked men, What is the Almighty? depart
   from us, we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.'

   Obs. 6. Again observe, it is a sign of a man turned beast to follow the
   passions and lusts of corrupt nature. Why? For then the government of
   reason is renounced, and all is yielded up into the hands of lust and
   appetite. In men reason should have the chief governance, and exercise
   a coercion and restraint over our affections; but now, when we yield up
   ourselves to the passionateness of lust, and are transported with
   violence of it, it answereth to that rage which reigneth in the beasts.
   I shall take occasion here to show you how many ways a man turneth
   beast.

   1. By an addictedness to sensual pleasures and delights. It is the
   beasts' happiness to enjoy pleasures without remorse; they have no
   conscience, they are not called to an account, &c. Now he is not worthy
   the name of a man, saith Tully, that would willingly spend one whole
   day in pleasure. We may take pleasures sometimes, but they should not
   take us; that is, we should not be vehemently addicted to them.

   2. When, in the use of these delights, we keep neither modesty nor
   measure, this is but like swine to wallow in our own filthiness; a
   beast can do no more; nay, many a beast would not do so much.

   3. When men live by appetite rather than reason and conscience, feeding
   without fear, and nourishing the body, but taking no care to refresh
   the soul. This should humble many that think highly of themselves; they
   do but carry a beast's heart under a man's shape: while they are wholly
   given up to sensual delight, pampering the body, when in the meantime
   the precious but neglected soul may justly complain of hard usage.

   Obs. 7. In the last place observe, that sensuality doth but make way
   for corruption: you may counterpoise the temptation to the sin with the
   punishment; usually secret sins and sweet sins meet with a heavy
   punishment: secret sins, that do not betray us to shame, may yet beget
   horror when we think of what will ensue; and sweet sins, that entice
   our affections, to prevent them we may counterbalance one affection
   with another, delight with fear. Well, then, to check the brutish rage
   of sensual inclinations, say, This will tend to my corruption, and
   perishing for ever: They that sow to the flesh shall reap corruption,'
   Gal. vi. 8. Carnal pleasures turn to an ill account in the issue: so
   Rom. viii. 13, If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die.' The Lord
   fenced Eden with a flaming sword; so is the garden of carnal delights
   fenced with the wrath of God: we run a great hazard to enter in. Say,
   then, Shall I for a superfluous cup adventure to drink a cup of wrath
   unmixed? for pleasures here, forfeit the pleasures at God s right hand
   for evermore? for a little wanton dalliance, lose the embraces of
   Christ when he cometh out to receive the saints to himself at the last
   day? God forbid.

   Ver. 11. Woe unto them, for they have gone the way of Cain, and run
   greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the
   gainsaying of Korah.

   Here the apostle cometh to reckon up their sins, and he doth it by
   examples which are suited so that they may imply both the sin and the
   punishment. Three are produced in this verse: that of Cain, to note
   their malice and cruelty; that of Balaam, to note their covetousness
   and seduction; that of Korah, to note their faction and sedition
   against magistracy and ministry, as Korah and his accomplices rose up
   against Moses and Aaron.

   Woe unto them. It is prophetically spoken, not execratorily; as a
   threatening or denunciation, not as a curse. For they have gone in the
   way of Cain. Cain's example is produced, because he was the first and
   chief of them that departed from the true church and pure service of
   God: Gen. iv. 16, Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and
   dwelt,' &c. Tertullian saith, he was the devil's patriarch, the first
   root of the carnal seed, or of the seed of the serpent,' in whom
   persecution began. Now Cain's way was a way of murder; he slew his
   brother because he was more righteous and godly than himself, 1 John
   iii. 12, and so they go in his way that have an envy and hatred against
   their holy brethren, which many times proceedeth so far as violence,
   persecution, and murder. This instance is fitly applied to these
   seducers; for, if the Targum of Jerusalem say true, besides the
   particular grudge which Cain had against Abel about the acceptance of
   his sacrifice, there was a dispute which happened between them in the
   field concerning the providence of God, and the last judgment, and
   world to come. Non est judicium, nec judex, nec saeculum aliud, nec
   merces bona pro justis, nec poena pro impiis: nec Dei misericordia
   creatus est mundus, nec ejus misericordia regitur, eo quod suscepta est
   oblatio tua cum beneplacito, mea vero non--Targ. Hieros. [139] So were
   these seducers exasperated against the orthodox, not only because of
   the greater presence of God among them, but also because of difference
   of judgment about Christ, the world to come, and providence, with other
   wholesome doctrines by which godliness is maintained. Again, Cain slew
   Abel; so were these Gnostics ready to break out into all violence
   against those that dissented from them, and stirred up the Jews to
   persecution against the Christians. Cain after this murder was haunted
   with his own ghost, and trembled wherever he came; so doth Cain's end
   attend Cain's curse, such quakings and fears of conscience following
   them wherever they went. It is said, The Lord set a mark upon Cain,'
   Gen. iv. 15: what this mark was is much disputed; most say it was a
   continual trembling and quaking throughout his body. Vide Aug., lib.
   xii. contra Faust., cap. 12; Chrysost. Hom. 19, in Gen. And the
   Septuagint render that, Gen. iv. 12, Thou shalt be a vagabond upon the
   earth, ste'non kai` tre'mon e'se epi` tes ges, Thou shalt be groaning
   and trembling upon the earth:' and the word Nod, the name of the place
   where he sojourned, is by interpretation agitatio, commotio, quaking or
   trembling:' o so`s tro'mos no'mos gugne'stho tois u`steron, and Basil
   Seleuc. apud Neiremb. Stromat., i. p. 23; which, if so, our wicked
   Quakers may see who was their patriarch. Now. from this first instance
   observe:--

   Obs. 1. That the practice of wicked men now, and the practice of wicked
   men from the beginning is still the same. Cain's club, as Bucholcer
   speaketh, is still carried about in the world, stained with the blood
   of Abel; [140] see Gal. iv. 29, But as then, he that was born after the
   flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit, even so it is
   now.' So it was then, so it is now. so it will be while the spirit of
   the devil worketh in the world; we have the same original sin which
   they had in former times. For a long time a disease runneth in the
   blood, and is continued in a line and family; but after some
   generations it is worn out; but this filth will still run as long as
   there is a channel of carnal generation to convey it. Again, we have
   the same devil to tempt us; whoever is converted, he will never turn
   Christian to be sure; and there are the same provocations and occasions
   to exasperate men's corruptions. Well, then, let us not be over
   troubled; there is no new thing under the sun,' the same devil that
   rageth now hath been a murderer from the beginning,' John viii. 44; the
   same devil that deceiveth now was a liar from the beginning.' Are there
   those now that separate from all churches of Christ? There were
   Donatists in former times. Are there now that deny the Godhead of
   Christ? There were Arians then. Are there now ranters, familists? And
   there were Gnostics then. Are there bloody enemies of the truth? Every
   age can yield its Cains. Again, if we would better know the state of
   our times, let us blow off the dust from our old precedents; the devil
   doth but play over the old game; and though the scene be shifted and
   furnished with new actors, the plot is the same.

   Obs. 2. Observe again, heretics and libertines usually turn
   persecutors; for it is said here, They go in the way of Cain.' Satan,
   that is a liar, is also a murderer; a false way cannot subsist without
   the props of blood and cruelty,--witness the Circumcellians, the
   Priscillianists, the Arians, the Donatists, the tragedies at Munster.
   An erroneous opinion is touchy, and therefore efferates the minds of
   men against those that oppose it. Believe not seducers, then, when they
   come in sheep's clothing; it is but that they may get a power to play
   the wolves the better: and when libertines, increase, let magistrates
   look about them, there are, clouds gathering together towards a dismal
   storm; and though they seem to be meek and full of love, while their
   party is contemptible, yet when they grow considerable they appear in
   their colours. Again, let us bless God for the peace we enjoy; there
   are swarms and droves of locusts abroad, but blessed be God that there
   is a restraint upon them, that there is a spirit of perversity mingled
   with their counsels. I tell you, the great danger of the latter times
   is from libertines; many fear, a second deluge of antichristianism, but
   that is not so probable as the seditious insurrections of sectaries.
   What sad havoc will be made of the people of God when once those
   bloody-minded wretches get power! The latter times,' kairoi` chalepoi',
   perilous times,' 2 Tim. iii. 1. Why? From what sort of men will the
   danger arise? Not from the antichristian, or Popish party, so much as
   from a libertine party, from Quakers, ranters, anti-scripturists,
   familists, &c. The antichristian party carrieth things by power and
   worldly greatness; but this party there described is a creeping' party,
   that gets into houses, leadeth captive silly women,' ver. 6. The
   antichristian party abuseth the sword of the magistrate; but this is a
   traitorous party,' heady, high-minded, ver. 4, a party rising up
   against magistracy. The antichristian party are stiff and obstinate in
   their old forms; but this is a party of seekers, looking for new
   discoveries, holding nothing certain in religion, ever learning and
   never coming, eis epi'gnosin, to the acknowledgment of the truth,' ver.
   7. In short, the party there described are a party that deny civil
   reverence, natural affection, and are contemptuous despisers of the
   true and holy servants of Christ; and all this carried on under a
   pretence and form of godliness. This is the party from whence I fear
   such danger and disturbance, if the Lord put not a hook into their
   jaws, or do not awaken the magistrate to look to the safety, not only
   of Christ's interests, but his own. Cursing Balaams will soon prove
   bloody Cains, and wicked seducers tyrannous oppressors.

   The next part of the description is, and run greedily after the error
   of Balaam for reward. His story begiuneth Num. xxii., and his tragedy
   you have Num. xxxi. 8. [141] Balaam had linguam venalem, oracles to
   sell; so they adulterated the doctrine of the gospel out of
   covetousness and filthy lucre. Simon Magus, out of whose school the
   Gnostics came, would, you know, buy and sell the Holy Ghost, Acts viii.
   Now, after this error, it is said, they ran greedily,' exechuthesan,
   were poured out,' it is a metaphor taken from a river overflowing the
   banks, or from a thing poured out from a bucket, with a full current.

   Now from hence observe:--

   Obs. 1. That the devil enticeth his slaves to divers sins; as to the
   malice of Cain, so to the covetousness of Balaam.

   Obs. 2. That men are usually carried into errors by the bait of gain
   and worldly profit: 2 Peter ii. 3, Through covetousness shall they with
   feigned words make merchandise of you;' that which is the root of other
   evils' is often the root of heresies or sect-making. Souls are a
   precious commodity. Christ thought them worthy of his own blood, but
   seducers count them cheap ware; for their own gain and worldly
   interests they care not how they betray souls; yea, Christ himself is
   sold by them, as Judas purchased a field with the reward of iniquity,'
   Acts i. 18. Oh! then beware of covetousness, it is a great snare: a
   covetous man the devil hath him upon the hip, and how far, or whither
   he will carry him, he cannot tell. Balaam had many good gifts; God is
   said to have put words into his mouth,' Num. xxiii. 26; he asked
   counsel of the Lord, loath to go, yet covetousness by degrees wrought
   upon him.

   Obs. 3. From the word exechuthesan, men sin with full bent of heart,
   and are carried out violently against all restraints of conscience; as
   Balaam, notwithstanding the checks and disappointments which he met
   with in the way, the dumb ass forbidding the madness of the prophet,' 2
   Peter ii. 16, yet was still hurried on by the violent impulsions of his
   own lust and greedy desire of reward; so the apostle speaketh of some
   that work uncleanness with greediness,' Eph. iv. 19. The motions of
   lust are rapid and violent; we are in earnest when we do the devil's
   work: a stone runneth down hill with a swift motion, because of its
   propension and tendency that way. Oh! when shall we learn to serve God
   as we have served Satan? Our work is better, our wages better, and our
   Master best of all. When shall we pour out our hearts in prayer as we
   do in sin? In the business of religion we act with a great deal of
   dividedness and partiality; our evil works are merely evil, but our
   good by no means can be purely good.

   Obs. 4. Again observe, that covetousness is a violent, headstrong lust;
   you would think uncleanness is most violent, as having a rage and a
   passionateness in it; it is so; but covetousness is more strong, as
   engaging not only the lighter part of the affections, but the will
   itself: 1 Tim. vi. 19, He that will be rich,' &c. Fits of lust are ear
   nest for the present, but this is the constant and more deliberate bent
   of the heart towards that which is evil; watch the more, that your feet
   be not taken in this snare.

   The last instance is, perished in the gainsaying of Korah. This is
   produced to note their factious practices. You have the story of him,
   Num. xvi. Being overcome with ambition he would take upon him the
   priesthood. He and his accomplices made head against Moses and Aaron,
   but he perished in the attempt; and so will these likewise that rise up
   against magistracy and ministry, as surely as if it were already
   accomplished; and therefore, though they were not as then born, yet
   they are said to perish when Korah perished. From hence note:--

   Obs. 1. That ambition breedeth faction, hence Korah gainsaid;
   Diotrephes loveth the pre-eminence, and therefore troubled the church,
   3 John 10. All stirs begin first in our own lusts; men are discontented
   with their estate, would be higher, and therefore break rank.
   Lactantius observeth of the troubles of his age, thus--Fuerunt quidam
   nostrorum vel minus stabilitâ fide, vel minus docti, vel minus cauti;
   qui dissidium facerent unitatis et ecclesiam dissiparent, sed ii quorum
   fides fuit lubrica, cum Deum nosse se et colere simularent augendis
   opibus et honori studentes, affectabant maximum sacerdotium, et a
   potioribus victi, secedere cum suffragatoribus suis maluerant quam eos
   ferre praepositos, quibus concupiebant ante praeponi, &c. (Lactant. de
   Vera Sapientia, lib. iv. cap. 30.) It is an excellent thing to be
   contented with our own station; Jesus Christ was chadal ischim: Isa.
   liii. 3, The leaving-off of men,' or contented to be in the lowest
   rank. If God hath denied thee any condition in the world which thou
   affectest, thou art not worthy of it, or it is not fit for thee, &c.

   Obs. 2. Observe, ambition, that carrieth men against ministry, carrieth
   them against magistracy also. Korah and his companions rose up against
   Moses and Aaron. The church and commonwealth are like the soul and the
   body; the one fareth the better for the welfare of the other; and
   seditious spirits will brook no restraint; let them alone in the
   church, and they will soon disturb the state also. But of this before,
   ver. 8.

   Obs. 3. Once more. The levelling humour is no new thing in the church
   of God; their plea was, Num. xvi. 3, All the Lord's people are holy,'
   or saints, and why should any be set over them? Let us beware, then, of
   that parity which some affect; there must be rule and superiority, or
   all will come to nought. God made the world to consist of hills and
   valleys, and in church and state there must be governors and governed,
   teachers and taught. It is Koran's sin to invade offices without a
   call, and to destroy that order which God hath established.

   Obs. 4. Again, observe, schisms and factions in the church bring
   destruction in the end. Those that made a cleft in the congregation,
   the earth cleaved to swallow them up. Christ saith, Woe be to that man
   by whom offences come,' Mat. xviii. 7. It is sad to take offence, but
   worse to give it; all the mischief that ensueth will be reckoned to
   your score. Surely men would be more tender in this point if they did
   but think of the punishment that sensibly overtaketh the disturbers of
   a well-ordered society.

   Obs. 5. Again, observe, the scripture speaketh of things to come as
   already past; for it is said, These perished,' &c. So Rev. xiv. 8,
   Babylon is fallen, is fallen.' What is threatened is as certain as if
   it were already accomplished. So also for promises; you have the mercy
   if you have the promise; by God's word all things were created and do
   subsist. Let it be, was enough to make a world; when God saith it shall
   be, is not the thing sure, though unlikely? Hath God's word lost
   anything of its creating power? God counteth our work done when but
   intended: Abraham offered,' &c., Heb. xi. 17. Well, then, let us be
   able by faith to see the ruin of wicked men when they reign most.

   Obs. 6. Lastly, observe, wicked men may read their destruction, in the
   destruction of others that sinned before them. They transgress the same
   law, and God is as tender of it as ever; and there is the same
   providence to take vengeance, which is as mighty as ever; and they act
   out of the same lusts, which God hateth as much as ever: sin, is not
   grown less dangerous now in the latter days. Surely, then, a man. would
   think the old world should grow wiser, having so many precedents. Pride
   may see its downfall in Nebuchadnezzar, sedition in Korah, rebellion in
   Absalom, violence in Cain, painted adulterousness in Jezebel, disorders
   in worship in the fall of the Bethshemites and the breach made upon
   Uzzah, the usurping of sacred offices without a call may see its danger
   in the leprosy of Uzziah. There is scarce a sin of pestilent influence
   of which we have not some example, which is set up like a mark in the
   way, in effect saying, Take heed, enter not here; it will prove your
   ruin and destruction; or, Look upon me and be godly.

   Ver. 12. These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast
   with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without
   water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without
   fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots.

   In the former verse the apostle setteth them forth by examples, in this
   by similitudes. Let us go over the expressions apart, as the text
   offereth them. These are spots in your feasts of charity, spila'des.
   The word also signifieth rocks, but is fitly here rendered spots, for
   it is in Peter, spiloi kai` momoi: 2 Peter ii. 13, Spots they are and
   blemishes.' So he called them, as being in themselves defiled and to
   others disgraceful; or because defiling with their presence and
   infecting by their example. In your feasts of love or charity. These
   were suppers used in the primitive times, either to manifest their
   brotherly union, or for the comfort and refreshing of the poor, in
   obedience to Christ's injunction, Luke xiv. 12, 13, though little
   observed for the ends for which they were at first appointed, divisions
   being hereby nourished, 1 Cor. xi. 21, each faction by themselves
   taking their own supper, and the poor excluded, 1 Cor. xi. 22. Some
   dispute the lawfulness of them, it being an addition to the Lord's
   Supper, taken up in imitation of the heathens, and blasted by God's
   providence in the very beginning, never approved, and, it seemeth, but
   slightingly spoken of. Your love feasts,' saith our apostle. However,
   they might be law fully used. Tertullian showeth a lawful use of them
   in his time, Tert. in Apol., cap. 39, Coimus in coetum ut ad Deum quasi
   manu faustâ, &c. We meet together, saith he, that by a holy conspiracy
   we may set upon God by a force that is welcome to him, where prayers
   are made, and the scriptures opened, and after this meeting a supper,
   begun with prayer: Non prius discumbitur quam oratio ad Deum
   praegustetur; editur quantum esurientes cupiunt, bibitur quantum
   pudicis est utile; and their discourses were such as did become the
   ears of God, and after washing they sang a psalm, and so soberly
   departed. Now these sensual persons did defile the love feast, the
   infamy of their lives being a scandal to the meeting, and the church
   fared ill for their sakes; for Peter maketh them to be spots, not only
   for their disorderly carriage at the meeting itself, but because of
   their constant course: 2 Peter ii. 13, They count it pleasure to riot
   away the daytime.' Partly by their indecent words and actions, when the
   Christians were met together, giving up themselves to excess: 1 Cor. i.
   21, Some are drunken;' and libidinous practices, for this was frequent
   in the meetings of the Gnostics.

   Obs. Observe hence, that sensual persons are the spots of a Christian
   society. They are not only filthy in themselves, but bring a dishonour
   upon the whole church whereof they are members: Heb. xii. 15, Take heed
   lest any root of bitterness spring up amongst you, whereby many may be
   defiled.' Now what that root of bitterness is he showeth, ver. 16, Lest
   there be any fornicator or profane person, as was Esau, who sold his
   birthright for a mess of pottage.' When any root springeth up, or
   breaketh out into a scandalous action, the whole society is defiled;
   therefore when such are discovered, they are to be cast out, for
   otherwise we should turn a church into a sty. Their spot is not as the
   spot of his children,' Deut. xxxii. 5. They have no God's mark, but
   Satan's. Calvin observed that nothing doth mischief to the church so
   much as remissness and kindness to wicked men. Partly as they do infect
   by the taint of their evil examples, and partly as they bring infamy
   upon the body; therefore cut off these ulcerous members. Again, we
   learn that the purest churches have their spots. In Christ's family
   there was a devil: John vi., One of you is a devil.' You would be
   scared to see a devil come among you. Every malicious sinner is a
   devil, and every sensual sinner is a beast. Such may now and then creep
   into the church, but they should not be allowed there. They that put
   off the nature of man are unfit for the communion of saints. These are
   spots to be washed off. Holiness is the church's ornament: Ps. xciii.
   5, Holiness becometh thy house, O Lord, for ever.' Again, they that are
   in a church should be the more careful; you defile yourselves else, and
   the society whereof you are members. Yea, your miscarriages reflect
   upon Christ himself. Carnal Christians carry up and down in the world
   the picture of the devil, and put Christ's name upon it, and so expose
   it to scorn and derision in the world. It was an old complaint of the
   Gentiles, mentioned by Cyprian in his book De Duplici Martyrio; the
   words are these: Ecce qui jactant se redemptos a tyrannide Sathanae,
   qui praedicant se mortuos mundo, nihilo minus vincuntur a cupiditatibus
   suis, quam nos quos dicunt teneri sub regno Sathanae. Quid prodest
   illis baptismus, quid prodest Spiritus Sanctus, cujus arbitrio dicunt
   se temperari? &c.--So in Salvian's time the heathens were wont to
   upbraid the Christians thus: Ubi est catholica lex quam credunt? Ubi
   sunt pietalis et castitatis exempla quae discunt? Evangelia legunt et
   impudici sunt; apostolos audiunt et inebriantur; Christum sequuntur et
   cupiunt, &c.--they talk of a holy Christ, and yet are unjust, unclean,
   wrathful, covetous; of a meek, patient Christ, and yet are rapacious
   and violent; of holy apostles, and yet are impure in their
   conversations. Our author goeth on thus: Sancta a Christianis fierent
   si sancta Christus docuisset, aestimari a ciultoribus potest iste qui
   colitur, quomodo bonus magister cujus tam malos esse videmus
   discipulos?--if their Christ were a holy, meek Christ, they would be
   better. Now judge you whether such wretches be not spots both to Christ
   and the church, a disgrace to head and members. Therefore all church
   members should be more watchful and circumspect than others, lest they
   give occasion to those that watch for their halting to speak evil of
   the way of God.

   The next clause is, when they feast with you. The word signifieth, to
   feast liberally together. This is added to show that they perverted the
   nature of the meeting, and made that an action of luxury which was at
   first an action of charity. In the feasts of the godly there was
   moderation and temperance, but these were blithe and jocund, filling
   their paunches at the charge of the church. What we translate feasting
   with you,' others read feasting upon you;' and 2 Peter ii. 13, Sporting
   themselves with their own deceivings, while they feast with you;' that
   is, by carnal gospelling and subtle devices justifying their own
   intemperance. Whence note:--

   Obs. That it is an odious filthiness to make religion serve our
   bellies, and to turn charity into luxury. This is here charged upon
   them, and often practised in the world: Rom. xvi. 18, They serve not
   our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly;' Christ hath the name, but
   the belly the respect. So Phil. iii. 19, Whose God is the belly.' When
   men aim at nothing but their own ease and pleasure, they set the belly
   in God's stead. Among the Papists, religious houses are but so many
   sties of filthiness, and the charity of well-meaning persons diverted
   to feed the luxury of a few slow-bellies.' Well, then, those that live
   upon church maintenance should be the more sober and temperate, though
   a double portion will well become them that take double pains; yet you
   should take heed of luxury, that you may not be corrupted with ease,
   that you may have enough for charity, that you may silence the clamours
   of the world; your temperance and sobriety should be known to all men.
   Paul giveth such an account of his life as will shame most ministers
   when they think of it: 2 Cor. xi. 27, In weariness and painfulness, in
   watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and
   nakedness;' and Paul had his enforced fasts, his voluntary fasts, not
   withstanding his great pains. Our lives should carry some proportion;
   we do not always suffer persecution, but we should still have a weaned
   heart in the fullest estate that doth befall us. Certainly maintenance
   would be more cheerfully given if well used.

   Feeding themselves without fear, poimainontes heautous, feeding
   themselves as a shepherd doth his sheep. It noteth their excess, eating
   beyond all measure, and without respect to that communion that should
   be among saints. They fed themselves, not others; their own bodies, not
   others' souls: Ezek. xxxiv. 2, 3, Ye feed yourselves, but the flocks
   have ye not fed.' Whence note:--

   Obs. That at our meetings and feasts we should have respect to
   Christian communion; not only take in meats, but give out gracious
   discourses and instructions. Christ, when he sat at meat, raised their
   thoughts to a better banquet: Luke xiv. 15, Blessed is he that shall
   eat bread in the kingdom of God.' When the body is fed, let not the
   soul be neglected; the word of God is chi'los psuchon, the food of
   souls; it should not be wholly banished from our tables. At every meal
   the devil usually bringeth his dish. When our hearts are warmed with
   the use of the creature, he setteth our corruptions a-working, and we
   are ready to censure, or to brawl, or jest in an unseemly manner. It is
   but reason that Christ should set his dish upon our tables also; and it
   being a solemn time of coming together, we should take occasion to
   quicken each other to the love of God, and an affectionate remembrance
   of our Creator, by whose bounty we enjoy what is set before us, that
   the spiritual appetite may be refreshed as well as the bodily.

   Here is yet another word in this clause, aphobos, without fear. The
   meaning may be either without fear of God, or without fear of the
   church, or without fear of the snare in the creature. If you take the
   first sense, without fear of God,' you may either understand it of his
   presence or judgments.

   1. Of his presence; they had no dread of him before whom the assembly
   was met. Note thence, it is sinful to sit down at meat without thoughts
   of God. You shall see it is said, Exod. xviii. 12, that the elders of
   Israel did eat with Moses' father-in-law before the Lord, that is, in
   his presence. When thou art eating bread, thou art before the Lord. As
   the eyes of all things look up unto him for meat in due season,' Ps.
   cxlv. 15, so are God's eyes upon us, upon our carriage and behaviour;
   therefore still retain a dread of his presence; the fear of God is a
   grace that is never out of season: Be thou in the fear of God all the
   day long;' not only in the morning, when immediately employed in acts
   of worship, but in thy shop, at thy meals. As the lungs are in
   continual exercise, whether we are sleeping or waking, so are some
   graces. Who is it that giveth us food and gladness'? Acts xiv. Shall we
   forget God when he remembereth us most? The Lord forbid; when his
   creatures are in our hands, let his eye be in our thoughts: Deut. viii.
   10, 11, When thou hast eaten, and art full, beware that thou forget not
   the Lord thy God;' it will be a good curb to our loose and vain
   affections.

   2. Without a fear of his judgments. Thence note, that riot and
   voluptuous living bringeth a brawn upon the heart, and men that are
   given up to a luxurious course grow secure. They that did drink wine in
   bowls,' did put far away the evil day,' Amos vi. 3; that is, all
   thought and sense of approaching judgments. When Jerusalem was grown
   riotous, she grew careless; and therefore God biddeth the prophet to
   eat his bread in trembling,' Ezek. xii. 18. Well, then, avoid
   immoderation in carnal pleasures, as you would avoid security and
   hardness of heart. We lose our tenderness by bathing and steeping the
   soul in these delights; epicures are past feeling,' Eph. iv. 19; and
   the wanton is said to be dead while she liveth,' 1 Tim. v. 6. Wine and
   women take away the heart,' Hosea iv. 11, as they do extinguish every
   spark of conscience, and abate of the vigour and tenderness of our
   affections. It was and it is the opinion of libertines that it is
   perfection to get the victory of conscience, and to live as we list,
   without any trouble and sense of danger. Possibly such a thing may be
   aimed at here: it is the perfection of sinning, I confess, to do evil,
   and then choke the conscience with carnal pleasures, that we may not
   fear evil.

   You may expound it without fear of the church' then assembled; in such
   an holy meeting they were not awed from riotous practices. Whence
   note:--

   Obs. That sensuality maketh men impudent, partly because where
   spiritual sense is gone, shame is gone; partly because when the bodily
   spirits are warmed with wine and meat, men grow bold and venturous;
   Solomon saith, Prov. xxiii. 33, The drunkard's heart shall utter
   perverse things.' In such a case men take a liberty to speak or do
   anything that is unseemly. I do not exclude this sense, because Peter
   in the parallel place maketh them all along presumptuous and sensual, 2
   Peter ii. 10-14.

   You may expound it, without fear of the snare in the creatures.' Whence
   observe:--

   Obs. In the use of pleasures and outward comforts there should be much
   caution. When Job's sons feasted, he falleth to sacrifice, lest they
   should have sinned against God,' Job i. 5. It is good to be jealous of
   ourselves with a holy jealousy, lest unawares we meet with a snare in
   our cup or dish. At a feast there are more guests than are invited;
   evil spirits haunt such meetings, they watch to surprise us in and by
   the creature; and therefore we should watch, especially if we be given
   to appetite,' then put a knife to thy throat,' as Solomon saith: that
   which is sweet to the palate may wound the soul, and gluttony may creep
   upon good men before they are aware; as Austin confesseth, that he was
   far from drunkenness, but crapula nonnunquam surrepit servo
   tuo--sometimes he would eat too much; but, saith he, Lord, thou hast
   now taught me to use my meat as my medicine, to repair nature, not to
   oppress it; a holy course and to be imitated. Christians, you may think
   it needless that we should speak to you about your meat and drink, as
   if the light of conscience were pregnant and active enough to warn you
   in such cases. Oh! but you cannot be too cautious; the throat is a
   slippery place, and a sin may get down ere you are aware. Christ did
   not think it needless to warn his own disciples of excess: Luke xxi.
   34, Take heed to yourselves, lest ye be overcharged with surfeiting and
   drunkenness,' &c.

   The next clause is, clouds they are, without water, carried about of
   winds. Here now comes in a heap of similitudes to express their vain
   arrogancy and ostentation in professing themselves to be far above what
   indeed they were; though they were inapt to teach, and to every good
   work reprobate, yet they gave out as if they were illuminate men, and
   of a higher attainment than others. The first similitude is in these
   words, nephelai anudroi, clouds without water. Aristotle called barren
   and light clouds such as are carried up and down with the winds,
   omi'chlas; and to these are the seducers likened, because, though they
   seem to look black and promise rain, yet they do not give us one drop,
   one wholesome notion that may occasion more light in. the
   understanding, of saving doctrine, or any further relief for the poor
   thirsty conscience, or any more forcible excitement to the practice and
   power of godliness. The apostle Peter, 2 Peter ii. 17, hath two
   similitudes--wells without water,' and clouds carried about with a
   tempest;' but here they are contracted into one. If you will have the
   Holy Ghost's own comment upon this similitude, see Prov. xxv. 14, He
   that boasteth of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.'
   That which is observable is:--

   Obs. 1. That the word of God is like a moistening rainy cloud: Deut.
   xxxii. 2, My doctrine shall distil like the dew, and my speech like the
   small rain.' Among the Hebrews the same word signifieth to teach and to
   rain. Well, then, let us, as parched ground, wait for the droppings of
   God's clouds. In this time of drought, when you go abroad into the
   fields, you shall see the grass burned and turned into stubble, and the
   earth gaping for a refreshing, and with a silent eloquence begging for
   the influences of the heavens; every chap is a mouth opened to swallow
   up the clouds as soon as they fall, or a cry to the God of heaven for a
   little rain. Just so should you come to wait upon God in the word: My
   soul desireth after thee as a thirsty land,' Ps. cxliii. 6. Oh! for a
   little refreshing from the presence of the Lord in his ordinance.
   Promise yourselves also that from the word which you would from rain,
   Isa. lv. 10, 11; this is the means by which the grace of God soaketh
   into the heart to make it fruitful.

   Obs. 2. False teachers are clouds without rain; it is the proposition
   of the text; partly because they make show of more than they have; they
   boast of a false gift,' Prov. xxv. 14. There is a great deal of show to
   affect the minds of the simple, but little of substance and truth; like
   boxes in the apothecaries' shop, that have a fair title, but no
   medicine in them; much pretence of light and spirit, and when all comes
   to all, there is nothing but pride and boldness: Aperiunt fontes
   doctrinae, sed non habent aquam scientiae--they will adventure to rain
   when they have but a few heat drops, a few poor fragments of truth,
   which, being disguised and transformed into some strange conceits, are
   cried up for rare mysteries and attainments. However, thus much we
   learn from them, that it is seducer-like to promise more than we can
   perform, and to be much in the pretence when we have little of real and
   true solid worth. Partly because they do not that good to others which
   they promise to do. Satan will always be found a liar; it is the
   property of his instruments to beguile men into a false expectation.
   Papists cry up their masses and indulgences, which yet do not one
   pennyworth of good. Preachers that study pomp and edification [142]
   come with much fancy and appearance; but, alas! these airy notions are
   too fine for the conscience. Seducers pretend to some heights of
   discovery, as if they would carry you into the third heaven, but you
   are where you were at first; they promise you hidden manna,' rare
   discoveries of Christ; but is your heart the better? Two things they
   never do, which may be explained by two properties of rain, namely,
   refreshing the earth, and making it fruitful.

   1. Refreshing the earth. Do they offer any doctrine that will give the
   conscience solid comfort and relief in distress? Here you will find
   them barren clouds. The locusts tormented the dwellers on earth,' Rev.
   ix. 5; they tickle the fancy for a while, but when you come to die, and
   are serious, you must return to the old truths to find rest for your
   souls, Jer. vi. 16; your fancies then are like the brooks of Teman,
   consumed out of their place;' when Pharaoh was under any trouble, Moses
   and Aaron must be sent for, his magicians could not satisfy him nor
   ease him.

   2. To make the earth fruitful. Do you find holiness improved by their
   notions? 2 Peter ii. 19, They promise liberty, when you are the
   servants of corruption;' they promise a new way of mortification, but
   still your bondage under your lusts is increased.

   Obs. 3. Again, in the third place, false teachers are light, easily
   driven up and down in various motions;' carried about of winds,' it is
   said in the text, sometimes with this opinion and sometimes with that,
   as light clouds yield to the motion of the winds; the winds are their
   corrupt passions, lusts, and interests: Eph. iv. 14, Be not tossed
   about with every wind of doctrine.' periphe'ro'menai, carried round the
   card and compass. When the chain of truth is once broken, man is at
   large, and being taken off from his bottom, left loose to strange
   contrary winds. We see many scrupulous persons, that at first made
   conscience of all things, afterward grow so loose as make conscience of
   nothing.

   Obs. 4. Again, they are as clouds driven with a tempest;' so Peter.
   They do not yield rain, but breed factions, and schisms, and turbulent
   commotions; light clouds are driven with great violence. Well, then,
   Mark them that cause divisions and offences.' Rom. xvi. 17; they are
   not what they seem to be; you will find in the end that you get nothing
   by dancing after their pipe.

   We go on with the verse. Trees whose fruit withereth, twice dead,
   plucked up by the roots. This is the second similitude; here are four
   properties of evil trees reckoned up by way of gradation.

   The first is, trees whose fruit withereth. Let us first look to the
   grammatical interpretation of these words, and then the sense and
   accommodation of them. Dendra phthinoporina: the Vulgar readeth arbores
   autumnales. [143] In autumn things begin to decay, and trees lose both
   fruit and leaves; and so would some explain it, like trees that lose
   their leaves in harvest-time, and bring forth no fruit; some go another
   way, making it an allusion to a particular experiment of young plants,
   who, if they flower at autumn, husbandmen take it for a sure sign that
   they will die. But similitudes are taken from things usual and known; I
   suppose, therefore, the apostle useth the word in its native and
   original signification. It is derived, para` to phthi'nesthai tas
   opo'ras, from corrupting fruits; and the meaning is, they bring forth
   no fruit but what is rotten and withered; and so it is applied to these
   seducers, whose lives were not full of good fruits. They pretend much,
   but what fruits do you find? More holiness, true mortification,
   strictness, piety to God, or equity and mercy to men? Nay, rather all
   manner of brutishness, disobedience to civil powers, neglect of God,
   abuse of gospel, contempt of their betters, &c.

   Obs. I. Observe, corrupt doctrine produceth corrupt fruits. Principles
   have an influence upon the life and conversation; our Saviour directeth
   us to this way of scrutiny and trial, Mat. vii. 16, By their fruits you
   shall know them.' How can that be, since they do easily counterfeit a
   holiness? it is said before, they come in sheep's clothing.' I
   answer--Pretences will not last long; observe then narrowly, and you
   will find the wolf breaking out. Ay! but may not a good way be promoted
   by men of an ill life? Ans. Look to the fruits of the doctrine; if it
   hath no influence upon strictness, but be only curious, and tend to
   foment pride, malice, envy, sedition, and turbulent practices and
   contempt of superiors, certainly it is naught, whoever brings you that
   doctrine, whatever holiness they pretend in other things. [144] On the
   contrary side, the wisdom that is from above is full of good fruits,'
   James iii. 17, mercy, justice, piety, strictness, meekness, &c. The
   Lord sealeth the integrity of faithful teachers by guiding them to
   holiness, and by his judgments suffereth hypocrites and seducers to
   discover their filthiness and shame, that they may be manifested to the
   congregation,' Prov. xxvi. 26. Holiness hath been the usual badge of
   truth, and the professors of it, when watched, have been in no point
   liable to exception, but in the matter of their God,' Pliny could find
   no fault with the Christians, but that they worshipped one Christ, whom
   they owned for a God, and had their hymnos antelucanos, their morning
   meetings and songs of praise to him. One of the notes by which the
   inquisitors of the Waldenses descried them was that they were sobrii et
   modesti vultu et habitu, of a sober deportment and modest garb. But may
   not seducers put on a demure garb, as Swenckfield prayed much, lived
   soberly, but his doctrine tended to looseness, destroyed the person of
   Christ, &c.? I answer, as before--You must consider the aim of the
   doctrine, which is not always to be discovered by the life of the first
   broacher of the error. Satan may transform himself into an angel of
   light to set on a design of darkness; paint will in time wear
   away--cito ad naturam ficta reciderunt suain: 2 Tim. iii. 9, They shall
   proceed no further, for their folly shall be made manifest to all men;'
   they begin with great shows at first to gain credit and entrance, but a
   discerning eye may find the deceit, and in due time God will discover
   them to the congregation. Well, then, try ways and persons by this
   note.

   1. Ways. Men do not easily teach point-blank contrary to their manners:
   surely the devil would not assist to bring holiness in fashion, and
   promote Christian practice. Observe the fruits and evils both of their
   lives and doctrines: in two cases it is a sure note:--(1.) When there
   is a fair compliance between principles and practices; if neglect of
   God, mutinous practices, fraud, injustice, contempt of civil dignity,
   be the very aim and design of the doctrine, and accordingly men live,
   this is of the devil. (2.) If it be so generally, and in the most
   zealous of this way. Some men are of a reserved temper, not disposed to
   gross and sensual wickedness, and so can counterfeit the better; and
   possibly so much of truth as they do retain in the midst of their
   errors may somewhat operate to sanctification; and, on the other side,
   a true way may be prejudiced if we should look to one or two; a street
   is not measured by the sink and channel, but if it be usual, and for
   the most part so, then their principles are corrupt. (3.) We may not be
   always enticed to a course of looseness or gross wickedness; if it be
   to a dead, powerless course, or formality, if it weaken the life and
   power of godliness in you, from such turn away, 2 Tim. iii. 5, your
   love to God, and delight in God, and converse with him in the Spirit,
   is forcibly lessened; fear the influence of such an opinion.

   2. You may judge persons by it, especially yourselves. Wherever there
   is grace there will be fruits of grace, and corrupt fruits show a
   naughty tree. If the clusters be clusters of Sodom, and the grapes
   grapes of Gomorrah,' it showeth the vine was of that race and kind:
   Eph. v. 9, The fruit of the Spirit is righteousness, goodness, and
   truth.' The apostle instanceth in such fruits as concern civil
   commerce, partly because by these we adorn our profession, and set it
   off to others; partly because here we have a frequent trial, these
   graces being of a daily use and exercise.

   But I would rather apply it by way of exhortation to those that profess
   the truth, to honour it in their lives. Let your manners be orthodox,
   lest you expose the ways of God to suspicion: Mat. iii. 8, Bring forth
   fruits worthy of repentance,' axi'ous metanoi'as, beseeming the change
   of your minds.

   Obs. 2. The next evil property is a'karpa, without fruit, and in the
   application it implieth that they bring no honour to God, no good to
   others, neither are they wise for their own souls. To be barren and
   unfruitful under a profession of Christ, is a sign of great hypocrisy;
   he that hid his talent is called a naughty servant,' and, because of
   his unprofitableness, cast into utter darkness,' Mat. xxv. A vine is
   good for nothing if it be not fruitful, not so much as to make a pin in
   the wall. Now God compareth Israel to an empty vine, Hosea x. 1,
   because they poured out all their strength, and time, and care upon
   their own interests. Well, then, Be not barren and unfruitful in the
   knowledge of Jesus Christ,' 2 Peter i. 8. Grace is an active thing;
   where it is it will show itself; garden trees must not be like the
   trees of the forest. If you would be fruitful:--

   First, You must be planted with a right seed;' a wild vine will yield
   but wild grapes. The trees of righteousness' are of God's own
   planting,' Isa. lxi. 3; and when you are grafted into the noble vine,
   Christ Jesus, then are you laden with clusters, like the vine of
   Eshcol: John xv. 25, In me ye shall bring forth much fruit.

   Secondly, There must be good husbandry and culture: Isa. v. 2, 3; Ps.
   xcii. 13, 14, Planted in the courts of God,' &c.; that is, the kindly
   soil. Good fruit needeth the manure of ordinances, wild plants grow and
   bear of their own accord.

   Thirdly, This fruit must be ripe, not buds and blossoms, but fruit; you
   must not be almost, but altogether; there must be not only the flowers
   and leaves of profession, but the solid works of godliness. It is said
   here, trees without fruit,' but it is not said here, trees without
   leaves;' see John xv. 4. There are branches in the vine that are only
   pampinarii.

   Fourthly, Fruit is for the owner. The profit of trees returneth to the
   husbandman and master; see John xv. 8, and Phil. i. 11. The spiritual
   life beginneth in God, and its tendency is to him. God must have the
   glory of all, but you shall not be without the comfort of it: Rom. vi.
   22, Ye have your fruit to holiness, and the end everlasting life.' The
   grave is but a winter, it taketh off your leaves and verdure for the
   present, the sap and life remaineth in the roots.

   The next evil property, taken from trees and applied to men, is di`s
   apothano'nta, twice dead. If you apply this to the trees, they may be
   twice dead, either in regard of fruit, as a barren thing is said to be
   dead, as the deadness of Sarah's womb.' Rom. iv. 19; or, in regard of
   substance, rotten and like doaty trees, growing worse and worse; or
   twice dead,' by a Hebraism, very dead,' as double is put for much. But
   now, if you look to the reddition of this similitude, these seducers
   are twice dead,' both in regard of their natural estate, dead in
   trespasses and sins,' and their apostasy, or decay of that life which
   they seemed to have by the grace of the gospel, wilful defection making
   their case incurable, Heb. vi. 5, 6, 2 Peter ii. 20.

   Obs. 1. Now, in this description you may observe a gradation:--(1.)
   Whose fruit withereth;' (2.) Without fruit;' (3.) Twice dead.' First
   bad fruit, and then leaves, and then rottenness. Note, that deceivers
   and hypocrites grow worse and worse.' You have it from the apostle Paul
   also, 2 Tim. iii. 13, But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and
   worse, deceiving and being deceived.' They deceive others, and the
   devil deceiveth them. The two states are not at a stay; wicked men grow
   worse and worse, and godly men grow better and better. Observe, then,
   which way is your progress and growth. The glory of the Lord, in
   Ezekiel, departed by degrees: first from the holy place, then from the
   altar of burnt-offering, then the threshold of the house, then the
   city, then the mountain which is on the east side of the city; it stood
   hovering there, as loath to be gone. So the Spirit of God doth not all
   at once depart from men, but by degrees. First men suspect duties, then
   dispute against them, then shake them off, and then come to beastliness
   and profaneness. Or, if you will, take the gradation thus:--First, God
   is cast out of the closet, private intercourses are neglected; then out
   of the family; then out of the congregation, and public ordinances seem
   useless things; and then blasphemies and a profane vertiginous spirit
   ensueth. First, men begin to wrangle, and sceptically to debate matters
   of religion, and within a while to oppose the truth: The beginning is
   foolishness, and the latter end is mischievous madness,' Eccles. x. 13.

   Obs. 2. Again, I observe, men that fall off from the profession of the
   truth are twice dead. To natural they bring on judicial hardness; when
   they seemed to make some escape from the misery of nature they relapse
   into it again, and then their chains are doubled; as a prisoner that
   hath once broken prison, if taken again, is laden with irons. Two ways
   do natural men come to be twice dead--by custom in sinning, and by a
   revolt from God after they had given their names to him. By custom in
   sinning, for by that means they are hardened in their way, and given up
   to a reprobate mind,' so as to lose all sense of sin, Rom. i. 26-28;
   and by revolt from God; those that will, after trial, forsake him, no
   wonder if God leave them to their own choice, to be held under the
   power of the devil, by a dark and foolish heart.

   There is one clause yet remaining, ekrizothenta, plucked up by the
   roots, and then trees are past all hope of springing and sprouting
   again; and so it fitly noteth their incurable apostasy. In this latter
   clause is set forth:--(1.) Their being deprived of all spiritual
   communion with Christ and his mystical body. (2.) Their incapacity to
   bring forth fruit. (3.) Their readiness for burning and destruction.
   Note:--

   Obs. That barren and corrupt trees shall utterly be rooted out of God's
   vineyard; they shall not have a visible abode and standing there. Now
   this is brought to pass partly by their own act: 1 John ii. 19, They
   went out from us because they were not of us; for if they were of us,
   they would have continued with us;' they separated themselves from the
   communion of the faithful, to which they did never truly belong, both
   from the doctrine professed in the church, and fellowship with them in
   the use of ordinances. Partly by God's act, an act of judgment on his
   part: Rom. xi. 20, For unbelief were they broken off.' Partly by the
   act of the church, by which scandalous sinners are taken from among
   them: 1 Cor. v. 13, Put away from among yourselves that wicked person.'
   Well, then, let us walk so that this heavy judgment may never be laid
   upon us; let us get a real union with Christ, for then we can never be
   broken off: you can no more sever the leaven and the dough than Christ
   and a believer, [145] &c. Walk with the more caution: Be not
   high-minded, but fear;' it is dreadful to be cast out of the true
   church; the finger that is cut off from the hand is also cut off from
   the head. That censure, if rightly administered against us, should be
   matter of great sorrow and humiliation to us, &c.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Ver. 13. Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their shame; wandering
   stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.

   Here are two other comparisons, the one taken from raging waves,' the
   other from wandering stars.' For the first, raging waves of the sea,
   foaming out their own shame, there is a great deal of variety among
   interpreters in the application or accommodation of this simili tude;
   some go one way, some another. Waves are not more various and uncertain
   in their motions than they in their expositions. Some apply it to their
   levity and inconstancy, some to their restless activity in sin, some to
   their turbulency, others to their pride and ostentation. In such
   uncertainty what shall we fix upon? Two things will direct us--the
   scope, and the force of the words. The scope of the apostle in all
   these similitudes is to show that these seducers were nothing less than
   what they pretended to be: clouds, but dry barren clouds; trees, but
   such as bore either none or rotten fruit; waves, that seemed to mount
   up unto heaven, and to promise great matters, as if they would swallow
   up the whole earth, but being dashed against a rock, all this raging
   and swelling turneth into a little foam and froth. So Calvin applieth
   it to the libertines, who scorn and disdain the common forms of speech,
   and talk of illumination and deification, so that their hearers seem to
   be rapt into the heavens; but, alas! they suddenly fall into beastly
   errors.

   Obs. 1. From the scope observe, that spiritual boasters will certainly
   come short of their great promises. All is but noise, such as is made
   by empty vessels. In the latter times you are troubled with boasters,'
   2 Tim. iii. 2, men that boast of depths, and seem to be wise and
   knowing above the ordinary sort, that will pretend to show you new ways
   a shorter cut to heaven, and rare discoveries of Christ and gospel
   light, &c.; but, alas! in the issue they leave you much more the
   servants of sin than you were before.

   But let us a little examine the force of the words. The whole
   similitude alludeth to what is said of wicked men in general, Isa.
   lvii. 20, The wicked are like a troubled sea that cannot rest, whose
   waters cast up mire and dirt.'

   Obs. 2. Observe, in the first place, that they are waves, which noteth
   their inconstancy: Gen. xlix. 4, Reuben is as unstable as water.'
   Water, you know, is movable, soon furled, and driven to and fro by the
   winds; so were these carried about with every wind of doctrine,' Eph.
   iv. 14. Note thence, that seducers are unsettled and uncertain in their
   opinions; so 2 Peter iii. 16, Unlearned and unstable.' If you ask why?
   Because they are not rooted and grounded in their profession, but led
   by sudden affection and interests rather than judgment; they are
   unstable because unlearned; such as do not proceed upon clear and
   certain grounds, and those whom they work upon are of no principle,
   beguiling unstable souls.' Well, then, discover them by their levity;
   you will never have comfort and certainty in following them who, like
   weathercocks, turn with every wind. Ecebolius is infamous to all ages,
   see Socrat. Scholast., lib. iii. cap. 2. He was professor of eloquence
   at Constantinople, under Constantius zealous of Christian religion,
   under Julian a Pagan, and when he was dead, he professed Christianity
   again; but then he came weeping to the church, pate'sate me` to` a'las
   to` anai'stheton--tread upon me, unsavoury salt, and cast me to the
   dunghill. Constantius Chlorus, though a heathen (both Sozomen and
   Eusebius give us the story) yet loved constancy and faithfulness in men
   as to their profession; he made proclamation that whosoever would not
   sacrifice should be discarded, and no more retained in pay with him;
   but when many false Christians had renounced their profession for gain
   and preserving their civil interests, he would not receive them,
   saying, pos ga`r a'n po'te basilei pi'stin phula'xousi peri` to`
   krei'tton alontes agno'monein--how can they keep faith with their king
   and emperor that would falter in a higher matter, in the business of
   their God and religion, for a small and petty interest? Much to the
   same purpose there is a passage of Theodoric, king of the Goths, who
   loved a deacon who was of the orthodox profession, though he himself
   was an Arian; the deacon, to please the king the more, changed his
   religion, and professed Arianism also; but he beheaded him, saying, ei
   to The'o pi'stin ouk ephu'laxas, pos anthro'po phula'xeis sunei'desin
   ugiai'nousan--if thou hast not kept thy faith with God, how wilt thou
   preserve a good conscience in thy duty to men? The story is in
   Theodoret. Some are merely waves, rolling hither and thither in a
   doubtful uncertainty.

   Waves of the sea. There you have their restless activity, they are
   always tossed to and fro: Jer. xlix. 23, The Lord shall trouble
   Damascus, that she shall become like a fearful sea that cannot rest;'
   so these cannot rest from evil: 2 Peter ii. 14, Eyes full of adultery,
   that cannot cease from sin.'

   Obs. Usually wicked men are of an unquiet spirit, restless in evil.
   They are acted by Satan, who is a restless spirit, and there is a great
   correspondency between their activeness in sin and the importunity of
   Satan's malice: 1 Peter v. 8, He goeth about like a roaring lion,
   seeking whom he may devour. Now you shall see the like diligence and
   readiness in his instruments; they walk the devil's round: Mat.
   xxiii.15, Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for ye
   compass sea and land to make one proselyte,' &c. Blind zeal leadeth on
   men with an incessant rage to poison others with their error, and draw
   them to their sect. Well, then, we may learn diligence from our
   enemies. Shall they be more busy to pervert the truth than we to
   propagate it? Dan. xii. 4, Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge
   shall be increased.' Once more, learn that it is a sign of a naughty
   heart to be restless in sin: Prov. iv. 16, They sleep not unless they
   have done mischief, and their sleep is taken from them unless they
   cause some to fall.'

   Raging loaves of the sea. There you have their turbulency; they fill
   all places with troubles and strifes.

   Obs. Wicked seducers are usually of a turbulent and impetuous spirit.
   Why? Because they are urged by their own pride and vanity, and have
   lost all restraints of modesty, and are usually, as to their
   constitution, of violent and eager spirits. Well, then, be not borne
   down with impudence and rage; there may be daring attempts and much
   resolution in an ill cause; besides it is an hint to the magistrate to
   look to seducers betimes, for they are raging waves.'

   The next expression is foaming out their own shame, as a raging sea
   casteth up mire and dirt; or it alludeth to that scum and froth which
   the waves leave upon the rocks, and so it noteth the abominableness of
   their opinions and practices. Whence note:--

   Obs. That though errors come in blushing, and with a modest dress, yet
   usually they go out of the world with a great deal of shame. They dash
   against the rock upon which the church is built, and what is the issue?
   They are covered with froth and foam: 1 Cor. iii. 13, The day shall
   declare it;' that is, time, whose daughter truth is: have a little
   patience, and you shall see that all that is but hay and stubble which
   is accounted gold. When worldly interests are unconcerned, and the heat
   of contention a little allayed, that men may have more clear
   discerning, and the world hath a little more experience of the fruit of
   false ways and opinions, there will not need any great confutation:
   evil men will sufficiently bewray their own filthiness. Guicciardini
   saith of the expedition of Charles the Ninth into Italy, that he came
   in like lightning, and went out like the snuff of a candle. So errors
   come in like a raging wave, as if they would bear all before them, but
   they go out like foam and froth, in scorn and infamy. Well, then,
   observe the fruitlessness of all Satan's attempts: The gates of hell
   shall not prevail against this rock,' Mat. xvi. 18. By the gates of
   hell,' is meant strength and counsel, power and policy; for in the
   gates were their ammunition and seats of judicature. They that seek to
   slaver the church or deface the truth, which is the foundation of it,
   they do but spit against the wind, the drivel is returned upon their
   own faces. We often betray our trust and faith by our passions; we have
   not a holy greatness of mind to look above every trouble. Contend for
   God, but wait upon him; Satan may prevail a long time, but he can never
   carry it clearly from Christ: the Arians had a day of it, but they soon
   grew infamous for their cruelty and baseness.

   We come now to the next similitude, wandering stars, asteres planetai.
   It may be taken two ways--properly or improperly. (1.) Properly, for
   the stars which we call planets, or wandering, though indeed no stars
   wander less than they do; they have their name from the opinion and
   common judgment of sense, because they are not carried about the whole
   circuit of the heavens, but in a shorter orb and course. In themselves
   they have certain stated motions, and do keep the just points of their
   compass: The sun knoweth his going down,' Ps. civ. (2.) Improperly;
   there are a second sort of wandering stars, which Aristotle calleth
   aste'ras diathe'ontas, running and gliding stars; not stars indeed, but
   only dry exhalations inflamed, which glare much and deceive the eye
   with an appearance of light, but soon vanish and are quenched. Now
   these glancing, shooting stars do excellently express the quality of
   these seducers, who pretended great knowledge, being therefore called
   Gnostics, and gave out themselves for illuminate and profound doctors,
   but were various and uncertain in their motions, and soon extinguished
   and obscured. It is notable that the apostle ransacketh all the
   elements for comparisons whereby to set them forth: The air, clouds
   without water;' the earth, barren, rotten trees;' the water, there he
   compareth them to raging waves;' the fire, to wandering stars,' which
   are of a fiery nature. A fruitful fancy can make use of all the world,
   and a willing mind cannot want objects of meditation. But let us come
   to observe something from this similitude.

   Obs. The guides of the Lord's people should be stars, but not
   wandering, gliding stars. These seducers pretended to be stars,' and
   great lights of the church (which is the office of the ministers), but
   were indeed wandering stars,' and such as did seduce and cause to err.

   First, Stars they should be:--(1.) In regard of the light of doctrine:
   Mat. v. 14, Ye are the light of the world,' that is Christ's honour,
   John i. 9; but he taketh his own crown and puts it upon his servants'
   heads. They are the light in a subordinate sense; stars, though not the
   sun; he is the original and fountain of all light, and we are used as a
   means to convey it to others. Thus John is called, John v. 35, A
   burning and a shining light.' He useth our service to dispel the mists
   of error, the night of profaneness, and the darkness of false worship.
   You had need prize those whom God hath set over you; they are light,
   and will you quench the light of Israel'? 2 Sam. xxi. 17. (2.) In
   regard of the lustre of their conversations. It is said of all
   Christians, Phil. ii. 15, that they should shine as lights in this
   world;' they are the bright part of the world, as the stars are the
   shining part of heaven; as the star directed the wise men to Christ, so
   they must shine to light others by their example to him, as it is
   required of all Christians, much more of ministers, who are placed in a
   higher orb and sphere. Alas! we are but dim lights; we have our spots
   and eclipses, but this sets the world a-talking.

   Secondly, They must not be gliding falling stars; that is charged upon
   these seducers. A false teacher and a falling star symboliseth in three
   respects:--(1.) It is but a counterfeit star; so is he an angel of
   light; only in appearance, 2 Cor. xi. 14. A true Christian should covet
   more to be than to seem to be; to be light in the Lord' before he is a
   light in the world.' Hypocrites are all for appearance. (2.) In respect
   of the uncertainty of its motion. Falling stars are not moved with the
   heavens, but with the motion of the air, hither and thither, and so are
   no sure direction. So are they inconstant and unstable in the doctrines
   which they teach, running from opinion to opinion; vagabond lights,
   that seduce, not direct, as meteors mislead travellers out of the way.
   (3.) In regard of the fatal issue. A wandering star falleth to the
   ground, and becometh a dark slime and jelly; so their pretences vanish
   at length, and they are found to be those that were never enlightened
   and fixed in the firmament of God; counterfeits cannot last long; we
   see stars shoot in the turn of an eye, and Satan's instruments fall
   from heaven like lightning,

   Well, then, for a guide to heaven, choose a star, but not a wandering
   star. New light is admired, but it should be suspected rather. Usually
   we are rather for things new than excellent: homini ingenitum est magis
   nova quam magna mirari, saith Seneca. We gaze more on a comet than the
   sun. Check this itch; those that are various and given to changes are
   no lights for you; and if they be not burning and shining lights, avoid
   them. True stars have influences; they do not only enlighten and fill
   you with notions, but inflame and stir you to practice.

   The last clause of the text is, to whom is reserved blackness of
   darkness for ever. Having described them in several metaphors, he
   cometh to speak again of their punishment, continuing the last
   metaphor, as some suppose, as glaring meteors after a while vanish into
   a perpetual night and darkness, and are no more seen and heard of; so
   these vanish, and are swallowed up of the horrors of eternal darkness.
   In this threatening three things are notable:--(1.) The dreadfulness of
   the punishment; (2.) The sureness; (3.) The suitableness of it.

   1. The dreadfulness, in two circumstances:--(1.) The nature of it; (2.)
   The duration of it.

   [1.] The nature of it, ho zophos tou skotous, the blackness of
   darkness.' It is a Hebraism for exceeding great darkness, called in the
   gospel to` sko`tos to` exo'teron, outer darkness,' as being, furthest
   from God, the fountain of life and glory, and so expressing that
   extreme misery, horror, and torment which is in hell. Hell is a dark
   and dismal region, where men lie deprived of the light of God's
   countenance, tormented with presence of devils, and become the burden
   of their own thoughts, calling to remembrance their past sins, and
   having an active sense of their present pains, and dreadfully looking
   still for future judgment; but of this before. [146] Well, then, let us
   not begin our hell ourselves, by shunning God's presence, by preferring
   carnal pleasures before the light of his countenance, by remaining in
   the night or darkness of ignorance or error, by darkening the glory of
   our holy profession through scandalous living, by sinning against
   conscience, and so providing food for the gnawing worm, or matter of
   despair to ourselves to all eternity. Briefly, let us beware of a dark
   and doubtful condition; it carrieth too great a proportion with hell;
   the more bondage we have, the more fearful looking for of judgment,'
   the more are we like the damned; as the more assured and possessed of
   God's love, the more like the blessed; joy in the Holy Ghost is the
   suburbs of heaven.

   [2.] The next thing is the duration, the blackness of darkness for
   ever. The torment prepared for the wicked is everlasting, their worm
   dieth not, and their fire is not quenched,' Mark ix. 44. This is the
   hell of hell, that, as the torments there are without measure, so
   without end; vivere nolunt, mori nesciunt. Here they might have life,
   and would not, and now would have death, and cannot: Rev. xx. 10,
   Tormented for ever and ever.' Woe, alas! it is for ever. Poor wicked
   wretches! whose bodies shrink at the prick of a pin or the flame of a
   candle, how will they endure those endless pains? When their restless
   thoughts shall have run through thousands of years, they must look for
   more: the pains of the damned are eternal; partly because of the
   greatness of the majesty against whom they have sinned. We are finite
   creatures, and so not fit to judge of the nature of an offence against
   an infinite God; the Lawgiver best knoweth the merit of sin, which is
   the transgression of the law, as a jeweller knoweth the price of a
   jewel, and can best give sentence in the case what he is to pay that
   hath lost or spoiled it. With man offences of a quick execution meet
   with a long punishment, and the continuance of the penalty in no case
   is to be measured with the continuance of the act of sin--Scelus non
   temporis magnitudine sed iniquitatis magnitudine metiendum est. Partly
   because man sinneth as long as he can; he sinneth in aeterno suo, as
   Aquinas, and therefore is punished in aeterno Dei. We would live for
   ever to sin for ever; in hell the desire of sinning is not extinguished
   or mortified. [147] Partly because they despised an eternal happiness,
   and therefore do justly suffer an eternal torment. Partly because they
   are in their final estate: Peace upon earth,' Luke ii. 14. Here God is
   upon a treaty with us, but there we are beyond a possibility of
   repentance and pardon. Partly because their obligations to God are
   infinite, and so their punishment riseth according to the excess of
   their obligations. Well, then, this representeth the folly of sinners,
   that will run the hazard of eternal torments for a little temporal
   satisfaction, as he cried out, For how short a pleasure have I lost a
   kingdom! when he had parted with his sovereignty for a draught of
   water. So you, out of a desire of present contentment, forfeit heaven,
   and run the hazard of the horrors of everlasting darkness; therefore,
   to counterbalance the violence of a temptation it is good to think of
   it, Can I dwell with everlasting burnings? If a man be sick in the
   night, he tumbleth and tosseth and telleth the hours, and wisheth it
   were day; oh! what will a man do that is held under an everlasting
   night and darkness? We are wont to think a sermon long, a prayer long;
   what will hell be, when conscience shall repeat over the passages of
   our lives, and remember us of the wrath of God that endureth for ever?
   Here sin is ever working, all the day it runneth in the mind, all the
   night it playeth in the fancy; we begin the morning with it, and end
   the day with it, and in the visions of the night it easily gets the
   start, and outrunneth reason and conscience; there the guilt of it will
   torment us day and night, and man is ever haunted with his own horrors,
   and the wrath of God inflicted upon him.

   2. So much for the terribleness of the judgment; now, secondly, let us
   consider the sureness of it, teteretai, it is reserved. Hell torment is
   sure, prepared, kept for the wicked; so Mat. xxv., Prepared for the
   devil and his angels.' Heaven is prepared for the saints, and they for
   it. In one place it is said, The kingdom prepared for you;' in another,
   Vessels of mercy aforehand prepared unto glory.' So is hell fitted for
   the wicked, and they fit themselves for hell. God prepareth the saints
   and fitteth them, but endureth the wicked, and beareth with them whilst
   they fit themselves for destruction;' see Rom. ix. 22, 23. Carnal men
   may lord it abroad for a while, and ruffle and shine in worldly pomp,
   but the blackness of darkness is kept for them.

   3. Observe the suitableness of the judgment to the sin; he saith
   darkness, not fire. Clouds that darken the truth are justly punished
   with the mists of darkness for ever;' see 2 Peter ii. 17. They that
   would quench the true light are cast into eternal darkness. God loveth
   to retaliate, that men may read their sin in their judgment here in the
   world, he may do it in mercy to the saints. Jacob, that came the
   younger for the elder, to blind Isaac, had the elder daughter given him
   instead of the younger. Asa, that put the prophet in the stocks, was
   diseased in his feet. But in hell he doth it for the greater horror to
   the wicked; they that chose left-hand blessings, Prov. iii. 16, are
   justly placed with the goats on the left hand, Mat. xxv.; he that
   denied a crumb could not receive a drop; they that cared not for God's
   company are then banished out of his presence, and to those that loved
   darkness more than light is the mist of darkness reserved for ever.'

   [146] See ver. 6, on those words, chains of everlasting darkness; and
   ver. 7, those words, eternal fire.

   [147] Wicked men are not changed in hell; melted metal groweth hard
   again; the bad thief had one foot in hell, and yet dieth blaspheming;
   their judgments are changed, not their hearts; they would have dallied
   with God longer, grieved his Spirit here in the world longer, but that
   their candle went out, &c.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ver. 14. And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,
   saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints.

   The apostle urgeth another argument to imply the destruction of those
   seducers, and that is, the prophecy of Enoch. Whether this prophecy
   were written or not, the same Spirit that spake in Enoch inspired our
   apostle: if he received it by tradition, it is here made authentic and
   put into the canon. [148] The Jews have some relics of this prophecy in
   their writings, and some talk of a volume, extant in the primitive
   times, consisting of 4082 lines, called the Prophecy of Enoch; but that
   was condemned for spurious and apocryphal. Tertullian saith there was a
   prophecy of Enoch kept by Noah in the ark, which book is now lost. Be
   it so; many good books may be lost, but no scripture. But most probably
   it was a prophecy that went from hand to hand, from father to son. Jude
   saith, Enoch prophesied;' he doth not say it is written, as quoting a
   passage of scripture. But why should he rather produce Enoch's
   prophecy, than a passage out of the authentic books of scripture, where
   are many such to this purpose? I answer--(1.) It was done by the
   providence of God, to preserve this memorial to the church. (2.)
   Because ancient things are more venerable, for by all men's confession
   those times were most simple and free partium studio, from factions and
   partialities; therefore all along the apostle bringeth instances of the
   most ancient date.

   And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, that is, inclusivè, putting Adam for
   the first. But why is this circumstance mentioned? I answer--(1.) To
   commend the antiquity of the doctrine, the seventh in descent from Adam
   intimates that judgment was to be administered by Christ. (2.) Some
   observe a mystery; the seventh person was a prophet; as the seventh day
   was holy. (3.) I think it is to, distinguish him from Enoch, the son of
   Cain, who was the third from Adam, as Enoch, the son of Seth, was the
   seventh; see Gen. iv. 17. Prophesied; that Enoch was a prophet is clear
   here, and may be gathered from Gen. v. 22, where he is said to walk
   with God,' a phrase proper to those that served the Lord in some near
   way of ministration. It is there applied to Enoch, who was a prophet,
   and to Noah, Gen. vi. 9, who was a preacher of righteousness,' 2 Peter
   ii. 5; and to Eli, 1 Sam. ii. 30, who was a priest. Of these, saying.
   Of these,' because of such like; it is a general prophecy brought down
   to a particular case and instance. The Lord cometh; that is, the Lord
   Jesus, appointed to be the judge of the world; nay, mark it, Behold,
   the Lord cometh, as putting it before their eyes. Cometh, elthe, is
   come; that is, he shall as certainly come as if he were come already.
   The Jews say the great excommunication Maranatha was instituted by
   Enoch; the word signifieth The Lord cometh.' With ten thousand of his
   saints; it may be rendered with his holy myriads,' or ten thousands,'
   an uncertain number for a certain; that was their highest and roundest
   reckoning. The meaning is, with huge multitudes of angels and saints:
   as the apostle, 1 Thes. iii. 13, At the coming of the Lord Jesus with
   all his saints;' Zech. xiv. 5, The Lord my God shall come, and all thy
   saints with thee;' not only the angels, but the saints do help to make
   up the triumphs of that day.

   The notes are these:--

   Obs. 1. That what is spoken in the word in general doth as much concern
   us as if it were spoken to our own persons. Enoch prophesied of these,
   &c. Particulars are comprised in their generals; some scriptures speak
   directly to every single person; the Decalogue is most ex press in this
   way, thou, thou, &c., as aiming to awaken every one to a sense of their
   duty; God doth as it were talk with every person immediately. The
   gospel indeed speaketh largely, Come, all ye,' &c., as excluding and
   exempting none out of the hopes of it; yet sometimes the gospel
   speaketh as particularly as the law, especially where the condition is
   annexed to the offer; as Rom. x. 9, If thou believest in the Lord Jesus
   with thine heart,' &c. If you, as speaking to me; [149] if thou, as
   speaking to thee, and every other man in particular. Well, then, though
   the word speaketh generally, take home your own share, as men cut a
   passage out of the common river to water their own fields. Let not the
   scriptures speak in vain,' James iv. 5. We are all concerned when his
   speech is directed to men of our condition: Ps. xxvii. 8, Thou saidst,
   Seek ye my face;' and David subsumeth, Thy face, Lord, will I seek.'

   Obs. 2. Prophecy or preaching; the word is ancient, for Enoch, the
   seventh from Adam, prophesied.' Still some have been set apart for this
   work; Enoch was a prophet, and Noah a preacher of righteousness. It is
   sad that in the latter end of six thousand years, we should be rooting
   up an ancient ordinance that hath stood from the beginning of the world
   till now. In the old time before the law there were some to teach,
   every master in his family, churches were then in houses, and some
   special prophets to instruct in public, and continue the tradition.
   Under the law also there were some solemnly set apart for the work of
   the tabernacle, and prophets immediately called to deliver the special
   messages of God, not only for the instruction of the present age, but
   to increase the canon or rule of faith and manners, even for our
   comfort. And in Christ's time apostles were added to unveil the figures
   of the law and deliver the gospel more clearly; and when once the canon
   was settled, and enough delivered to make us wise to salvation, some
   were set apart by the constitution of Christ as pastors and teachers to
   explain and apply scripture; and though all the saints be kings and
   priests to God,' yet the office ministerial must not be invaded; for as
   spiritual kingship is no warrant to disturb the magistrate, or to wrest
   the exercise of authority out of his hands, so spiritual priesthood
   doth not lay the ministry in common; but still there must be some set
   apart for that work. If we grudge at the institution, we repine at
   Christ's bounty to us, and in effect bid him take his gift to himself,
   for in the day of his royalty or ascension he gave gifts to men, some
   to be apostles, some prophets, some pastors, some teachers,' &c., Eph.
   iv. 11.

   Obs. 3. That the doctrine of the day of judgment is ancient, long since
   foretold. Enoch prophesied of it, yea, the sentence of death pronounced
   in paradise did imply it, and the Lord's messengers have ever urged the
   terror of it. Many passages in Moses may be applied to this purpose,
   Deut. xxxii. David clearly saith, Ps. 1. 22, I will set thy sins in
   order before thee; now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear
   you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.' So Solomon, Eccles. xi.
   9, Remember that for all these things thou shalt come to judgment.' It
   were needless to tell you of Daniel, Joel, Malachi, Christ, Paul,
   Peter, John, Jude. Still this truth was pressed in the church; nay, the
   Lord was pleased to grant some intimation of it to the heathens, e'xei
   d' su'rano'then basileu`s, &c., in the fragments of the sybils in
   Eusebius; by the light of nature the philosophers had some dark and
   uncertain guesses at such a thing. Conscience is soon sensible of the
   truth of it, as Felix trembled when it was mentioned, Acts xxiv. The
   ancient judgments of drowning the world and burning Sodom were types
   and forerunners of it. Well, then, entertain this doctrine with the
   more certainty: verum quod primum--that which is first is true. We are
   secret atheists; can a man believe judgment to come that walloweth in
   sin and profaneness? Our actions are the best image and expression of
   our thoughts. The apostle saith, The latter days shall yield scoffers
   and mockers,' 2 Peter iii. There may be atheists in the church, but
   there are none in hell. We deny and doubt of that at which the devils
   tremble. If the Spirit, scripture, conscience, reason will not teach
   men, there is no other way of learning but by feeling and experience.

   Obs. 4. Enoch prophesied, the man that walked with God; he could see
   the day of judgment, though so far off.

   Those that have most communion with God do most discern his mind. Let a
   man walk humbly and closely with God, and he is near, not only the root
   of life, but the fountain of light:' Ps. xxv. 14, The secret of the
   Lord is with them that fear him.' When the disciples doubted of
   anything, they pointed to him whom Jesus loved, and who leaned on
   Jesus' bosom, John xiii. 23. Those that are in Christ's bosom know his
   mind. Well, then, if we would pry more deeply into the things of God,
   walk humbly and closely with him. There is a promise, John vii. 17, He
   that will do the will of God, shall know what doctrine is of God.' Pure
   souls are soonest enlightened, [150] and they discern most of the
   Lord's counsel who are not darkened with lusts and interests.

   Obs. 5. From that behold. He speaketh of this day of the Lord, as if it
   were instant and before their eyes.

   We should always realise the day of the Lord, and represent it to our
   thoughts as near at hand. It is the work of faith to give things ab
   sent and at a distance a present being in the heart of a believer, Heb.
   xi. 1. Six thousand years ago Enoch said, Behold, he cometh.' It is not
   for us to fix the seasons which the Father hath put in his own hands,
   there may be much of snare and temptation in that; therefore the
   apostle Paul reproveth them that confidently gave it out that the day
   of the Lord was at hand, 2 Thes. ii. 2, ene'steke, instantly to come.
   Austin giveth a reason of it thus, Ne forte cum transisset tempus quo
   eum credebunt esse venturum de ipsa mercede fidei desperarent--lest
   they should question all, when deceived in the time of their
   foresetting, which indeed experience hath verified. In the year of
   Christ 1001, when many vain opinions and conceits of the end of the
   world were disappointed, men began publicly to assert, mundus est
   incorruptibilis (Bar. ad annum 1001). The faith of all truths is shaken
   by the disappointment of a rash confidence; but though we are not
   punctually to state the time, yet the thing being certain, faith should
   represent it to the thoughts as actually present, and we should live as
   if the trumpet were always sounding in our ears, and the judge were
   set, and the books opened. To put off the thought of that which will
   one day, and within a short time, come about, is a spice of atheism,
   Amos vi. 3; for things foretold in the word should be as certain, and
   have a like influence upon us, as if they were already accomplished:
   Behold, the Lord is come.'

   Obs. 6. From that with ten thousand of his saints. When Christ cometh
   to judgment, his saints come to judge the world with him. When the
   wicked are filled with amazement, they come in Christ's company, partly
   that the world may know what shall be done to the men whom God will
   honour, and that Christ may be admired' in the glory he putteth upon
   them, 2 Thes. i. 10: partly that Christ may make them partakers of the
   mediatory kingdom; therefore they are associated with him in judging
   the world, Mat. xix. 28; their suffrage is required as approving the
   sentence of the judge, 2 Cor. vi. 2: partly for the greater sorrow of
   the wicked; they shall be judged by mean men, whom they once hated and
   persecuted: Ps. xlix. 14, The upright shall have dominion over them in
   the morning,' that is, of the resurrection; they counted their lives
   madness and folly, but now they are exalted: partly to make amends for
   the perverse censures of worldly men; now they are judged every day,
   counted the off-scouring and reproach of men; but then the Lord will
   clear up their innocency, and they shall sit as justices with the judge
   upon the bench. Well, then--(1.) Be saints, if you would have a saint's
   privilege. Felons may be jovial in the prison, but they tremble at the
   bar; they are happiest that have joy and boldness at Christ's
   appearance. When wicked men come like miserable captives, how shall the
   saints arise out of their graves like sons of the morning,' they and
   angels intermixed in the train of Christ! What is wanting here is
   richly made up there. (2.) Walk as those that shall be associated with
   Christ in judging the world; walk with Christ now, and you shall come
   with him then: Follow the Lamb wheresoever he goeth.' When he is
   crowned at Hebron he will not forget his old companions; cleave to him,
   cry not up a confederacy with them that cry up a confederacy against
   him. He will say to you, You have been with me in all my sufferings and
   sorrows, now you shall be with me in my glory, Mat. xix. 27, 28. Again,
   judge the world now, condemn them by your lives, as knowing that you
   shall condemn them hereafter by your vote and suffrage. Noah condemned
   the world,' Heb. xi. 7. A serious Christian is a living reproof; a
   carnal professing hypocrite justifieth the wicked: Ye have justified
   your sister Sodom,' see Ezek. xvi.; but a sincere Christian condemneth
   them.

   Obs. 7. From that with ten thousand saints. At Christ's appearance his
   train shall consist of multitudes of saints and holy angels. Now they
   are but as two or three berries upon the top of the upper most bough,'
   scattered here and there as God hath work and service for them to do;
   but when they appear together in that great rendezvous, they are a
   number which no man can number;' see Rev. v. 11, and Rev. vii. 9. It is
   a comfort against the paucity and smallness of those that are upright
   with God. In heaven we shall have company enough; God's family, when it
   cometh altogether, is very numerous, or rather innumerable, Heb. xii.
   23. As the wicked shall be exposed to the fellowship of devils, and
   persons like themselves, where the company shall add to the torment, so
   shall we be called to a great assembly,' Ps. i. 5, and to bear a part
   with that glorious train which cometh with Christ.

   Ver. 15. To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are
   ungodly amongst them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly
   committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have
   spoken against him.

   Having described the judge, with his attendants, he cometh to describe
   his work, which is to convince and execute judgment, together with the
   persons against whom he will thus proceed, all that are ungodly amongst
   them: as also the grounds and reasons of the process, because of their
   ungodly practices and hard speeches against Christ.

   Some say the 14th verse doth only contain the prophecy of Enoch, and
   that these words are the apostle's application or explication of it;
   but improbably, the words running on in a continued sense or form of
   speech, and the application is at the 16th verse.

   To execute judgment; it is a hysteron proteron; the last act is put
   first, execution before conviction or arraignment. Upon all, that is,
   upon all such as are here spoken of, upon all the ungodly; for judgment
   is not executed upon the saints, but for them. And to convince,
   elenxai; it implieth such a clear proof that we see it is impossible
   things should be other wise at the day of judgment; wicked men are
   speechless,' Mat. xxii., and self-condemned.' All that are ungodly
   amongst them; that is, amongst the wicked, and the severity of the
   process is chiefly bent against those that are ungodly. Of all their
   ungodly deeds; in the Greek, the deeds of their ungodliness.' Now
   ungodliness here is not taken in its proper sense, for denying God his
   due honour and worship, but for any opposition against his servants,
   Worship, truth. Which in an ungodly manner they have committed, hon
   esebesan; which argueth the malice and spite which they bewrayed in
   their oppositions and reproaches. And of all their hard speeches,
   skleron; hard,' as applicable to things as well as speeches. Our
   speeches are here intended, as appeareth by the following clause.
   Wicked practices and an evil tongue are seldom severed; that by hard
   speeches is meant any proud, taunting, cursed, or contumelious
   language. See 1 Sam. ii. 3, in the Hebrew, and Ps. xciv. 4, How long
   shall they utter and speak hard things, and the workers of iniquity
   boast themselves?' Which ungodly sinners; not only sinners, but ungodly
   sinners, for the greater emphasis; see Ps. i. 1. Against him; that is,
   against himself, against his person, or messengers, or truths,
   ordinances; for what is spoken against any of these is spoken against
   Christ himself.

   This verse is large, and full of points; but because the doctrine of
   the day of judgment hath been already touched upon, and ungodliness
   opened at large, ver. 4, therefore the briefer notes will serve the
   turn.

   Obs. 1. Christ's second coming is to judgment; so it is said in the
   text, He shall come with ten thousand of his saints to execute
   judgment.' Of his first coming it is said, John iii. 17, God sent not
   his Son to judge the world, but that the world through him should be
   saved.' He came not then as a judge, but as a redeemer, offering and
   procuring grace and life. When we frustrate the end of his coming as a
   redeemer, we make way for the end of his coming as a judge, and he that
   then came to us will now come against us.

   Obs. 2. When Christ cometh to judgment, one great part of his work will
   be to convince sinners, and that openly, publicly. Some think that the
   whole work will be dispatched in the conscience, without any audible
   and external voice, both as to examination and sentence; others think
   the trial and conviction shall be in the conscience of a sinner, but
   the sentence audibly pronounced; and because the punishment is to light
   upon the body and the soul, the ear is to receive it as well as the
   conscience feel it. I conceive that conviction, trial, and sentence
   will be all open and public. Though I cannot expressly say that every
   particular sin shall be discovered before the whole world, yet enough
   manifested to show the sentence just; as their unfaithfulness in their
   callings, their opposition of God and godliness, their oppression of
   his servants, their neglect of grace, &c., with all the circumstances
   and aggravations of it, as the gracious opportunities and means which
   they have enjoyed, stirring sermons, motions of the Spirit, checks of
   conscience, blessed methods of love and mercy, &c. God keepeth an
   account of these things. Those passages which imply God's reckoning
   with his people in the world are but pledges of what he will do at the
   day of our last account. Now here God taketh exact notice of the long
   time and many means which we have enjoyed; as Luke xiii. 7, These three
   years,' &c. It alludeth to the time of Christ's ministry; he was just
   then entering upon his last half year, as by a serious harmonising the
   evangelists will appear: John iv. 54, This second miracle did Jesus in
   Cana of Galilee;' account is kept of a former: 1 Kings xi. 9, Appeared
   to him twice;' so these twenty-three years,' Jer. xxv. 3. All this is
   remembered and produced to convince the sinner.

   This conviction implieth two things:--(1.) The opening of the
   conscience: Rev. xx. 12, The books were opened;' that is, the book of
   conscience and the book of God's remembrance; the consciences of men
   shall then be extended to an exact view of all their works and deeds
   past. It is wonderful, but it shall be done by the mighty power of God;
   for it is said here, he shall convince them of all their un godly deeds
   and hard speeches.' Their works and words are not lost and forgotten,
   but do follow them into the other world, and stand in the view of
   conscience, challenging the sinner, Tu nos egisti, opera tua
   sumus--sinner, these are the things that thou hast done and spoken; we
   will not leave thee, but bring thee to judgment; see Hosea vii. 2, Ps.
   xlix. 5. Then is that expression made good, Their iniquities shall find
   them out,' Num. xxxii. 23. Our old sins and carnal practices were long
   since forgotten and worn out of memory, so that we think we shall never
   hear of them more, but there they find us out, and pursue us to
   Christ's tribunal. (2.) There is an outward publication and
   manifestation of all these sins, or of most of them, before the world;
   for the apostle saith, 1 Cor. iv. 5, Hidden things shall be brought to
   light' in that day; that is, not only called to remembrance by the
   sinner himself, but exposed to the notice and censure of others, as the
   context there showeth. So Eccles. xii. 4, it is said, Secret sins shall
   be brought to judgment.' If only discovered to the conscience of the
   sinner, they are still kept secret. Wicked men are already in a great
   measure convinced, yea, and condemned, in their own consciences. It is,
   then, God's design to shame them before all the world. How otherwise
   shall the suspected innocency of his servants be vindicated, and saints
   and angels applaud the equity of his judgments, unless they have some
   cognisance of the matter for which wicked men are condemned? Now, these
   sins maybe discovered many ways; either by their own confessions and
   pitiful complaints extorted from them by the power of God. They shall
   bewail and bemoan their case thus, probably: Oh! that ever I despised
   Christ, oppressed his servants, opposed his truth, slighted the seasons
   of grace,' &c.; see Rev. vi. 16, 17. Or by the sentence of Christ, in
   the pronouncing of which there is some repetition of their sins, see
   Mat. xxv. 41-43; and also by the testimony of the good and bad angels
   against them. The good angels and guardians of the saints are sensible
   of the injuries done to them, and may possibly accuse you to Christ
   upon that score, Mat. xviii. 10. The devil, who is now a tempter, will
   then be an accuser. One of the fathers bringeth in the devil pleading
   thus, Domine, sit meus per culpam, qui tuus esse noluit per gratiam,
   &c.--Lord, let him be mine by sin, who would not be thine by grace. I
   never died for him, had no heaven to offer him, only a little carnal
   pleasure or profit, and this was enough to draw him from thee, &c. Yea,
   further, the ministers and other godly persons, by whose example they
   have been reproved or condemned, may give testimony against them: John
   v. 45, There is one that accuseth you, even Moses,' &c. The cries of
   those whom they have oppressed and wronged may possibly be renewed,
   James v. 4. Abel's blood may cry out against Cain afresh. Starved souls
   may cry out against a lazy minister, oppressed subjects against a
   bloody magistrate, the neglected poor against those that have shut
   their bowels against them; as, on the other side, the godly poor that
   have been refreshed and relieved by the bounty of the rich are said to
   receive them into everlasting habitations,' Luke xvi. 9. Again, the
   example of those that have had less means may be produced against them,
   because they went further in a way of compliance with the Lord's
   purpose, Mat. xii. 41, 42. Others with whom we have sinned may complain
   of us. Dives was afraid lest his brethren should come into the place of
   torment,' Luke xvi. 28, which might be a means to increase his anguish,
   they sinning by his example. I have produced these suppositions only to
   make the conviction at the day of judgment more intelligible and
   effective.

   Obs. 3. Again observe, when Christ hath convinced, he will condemn, and
   when he hath condemned, he will execute. Conviction now maketh way many
   times for conversion, but then for confusion; now God killeth, that he
   may make alive, but then they are presently transmitted and sent into
   their everlasting estate. Let us imitate the method of Christ's process
   in our judging ourselves; let us examine, judge, execute, not
   ourselves, but our sins; voluntary acts prevent enforced.

   Obs. 4. From that of all their ungodly deeds, &c., observe that the
   process of the last day chiefly lieth against the ungodly. These are
   expressly mentioned in the text; unrighteousness is a cause of God's
   wrath as well as ungodliness, Rom. i. 18. But ungodliness doth chiefly
   provoke; for the first part, and chiefest part of the law, provideth
   for our duty to God, ex ordine modum, ex loco statum et dignitatem
   uniuscujusque prcecepti, [151] &c. The dignity of every command is
   known by the order of it. Now, in the first place, godliness is
   required, and then righteousness, or a care of moral duties.

   If you would know who are ungodly, see the notes on ver. 4, where they
   are described at large; all atheists, speculative and practical,
   pagans, sinners that slight the offers of Christ, that neglect
   communion with God, and are touched with no reverence and dread of his
   majesty, all these are ungodly persons, and also all that scoff at
   religion and holiness of conversation, that despise the ordinances of
   God, oppress and persecute his servants, hate his truths, these are all
   in the scripture branded with the same mark, as I could easily show
   you, if I listed to dilate upon this argument.

   Now none of these will be able to hold up the head in the day of
   judgment: Ps. i. 5, The ungodly shall not stand in judgment, nor
   sinners in the congregation of the righteous;' for since they hate or
   neglect God, how shall they be able to look him in the face, or appear
   among his servants? They that have despised the mystery of godliness,'
   1 Tim. iii. 6, vi. 3, how can they expect the reward of godliness? You
   that mock at godliness, make duties the objects of your scorn, not your
   care, how will Christ scorn you at the last day! Well, then, if you
   would have the day of judgment comfortable to you, be not only just and
   strict, but godly, for godliness is a notion distinct from holiness, 2
   Peter iii. 11. It is not enough to do actions just and good, but we
   must do them upon the sight of God's will, and with aims at his glory.
   Holiness implieth a conformity to the law of God, but godliness an
   unfeigned respect to his glory. Now a Christian's whole life should
   have such a tendency and ordination, for it is called a living to God,'
   Gal. ii. 19.

   Obs. 5. Once more observe, these ungodly men are the rather judged
   because they commit sin with an ungodly mind, or sin with a sinning
   mind; for so it is in the text, ungodly deeds ungodly committed.' A
   child of God may fall into wickedness, but he doth not commit it
   wickedly, with a full consent; men are not condemned for infirmities,
   but iniquities. As a child of God cannot act with such liberty, purity,
   and perfection in the ways of God as he doth desire, so in the ways of
   sin he cannot do what he would, nor be carried out with such a' full
   bent and purpose of heart as wicked men are, because of the opposition
   of the new nature. To this latter sense it is said, Gal. v. 17, Ye
   cannot do the things that ye would,' as will appear by a serious
   inspection of the context. Wicked men follow the devil's work with all
   their might: Micah vii. 3, They do evil with both hands earnestly.' The
   Lord, that is tender of those that sin through infirmity, yet taketh
   notice to the purpose when men sin for sin's sake, and their hearts are
   largely and eagerly set upon it; those that are disclaimed at the day
   of judgment are called workers of iniquity,' Mat. vii. 23, such as make
   a business and a trade of it. A godly man doth not so much act sin as
   he suffereth by it, peccatum patitur, non facit (Bernard). He doth not
   pour out his whole heart this way; there are constant dislikes in the
   soul, which are a let and restraint to him. Usually the sins of the
   godly are either sins of ignorance, incogitancy, sudden surreption, and
   daily incursion; if they sin deliberately, there is not such a spite
   and rage as there is to be found in the sins of the wicked.

   Obs. 6. From the next clause, and their hard speeches, observe, not
   only the deeds of ungodly men, but their speeches are brought into
   judgment. Words do not perish with the breath with which they are
   uttered; no, they remain upon record, and we are to give an account of
   them at the last day, Mat. xii. 36, James ii. 12. Men are more serious
   in their actions, but in their speeches rash and inconsiderate, and
   those that dare not act evil dare yet speak. Oh! consider, if Christ
   did only call us to an account for our actions, and our words were
   free, it were another matter; but he reckoneth with us about our
   speeches, therefore so speak and so do as those that would be judged by
   the law of liberty.'

   Obs. 7. Once more from thence observe, that of all speeches men's hard
   speeches' shall be produced at the day of judgment. Now, what are these
   hard speeches? I answer--Either such as have anger in them, as Solomon
   speaketh of the froward mouth and perverse lips,' Prov. iv. 24, when
   men breathe nothing but fire, and drop coals instead of words; or such
   as have pride in them, or contempt of others, as when we lessen their
   abilities, insult over their miseries: They speak to the grief of those
   whom thou hast wounded,' see Ps. lxix. 26; or triumph over their slips
   and failings; this is to pour salt and vinegar into new wounds.

   Again, such as have bitterness and malice in them, as calumnies and
   reproaches: Ps. lxiv. 3, 4, They bend their bows to shoot their arrows,
   even bitter words.' By whisperings and clancular suggestions they wound
   the credit of God's servants, and so bring them into disesteem with
   others. Well, then, be not hasty to utter hard speeches, especially
   against God's children: Num. xii. 8, Were ye not afraid to speak
   against my servant, against Moses?' The repetition of these hard
   speeches will be sad notes to your ears at the last day.

   Obs. 8. The next note is, that of all hard speeches those are the worst
   which do most directly reflect upon the honour and glory of Christ; for
   so it is in the text,--hard speeches spoken against him. Now, hard
   speeches against Christ are either blasphemies against either of his
   natures;--the Ebionites denied him to be God; the Valentinians made him
   a fantastical man, or a man only in appearance;--or murmurings against
   his providence and regimen of the world: Your words have been stout
   against me,' Mal. iii. 13. When we tax and excuse [152] providence, as
   if the Lord were blind, careless, unjust, or injurious in his dealings:
   The Lord shall not see, he shall neither do good nor evil; how should
   the Most High know?' or when we scoff at his word, as these, Jer.
   xxiii. 36, The burden of the Lord, the burden of the Lord; every man's
   word shall be his burden.' Because the prophets usually began their
   sermons with this preface, The burden of the Lord,' they scoffingly
   were wont to say, What burden have you for us to day? Now, saith the
   prophet, this shall return into your bosoms, your words shall be your
   burden.' So also when we speak against his ways, calling zeal fury,
   strictness a foolish preciseness, and godliness puritanism. O
   Christians! these hard speeches will cost dear, here or hereafter. It
   is possible that blasphemy repented of may be be forgiven, Mat. xii.
   31; but when you are brought home to Christ it will cost you bitter
   pangs and a sound remorse.

   [151] Tertullian.

   [152] Qu. accuse'?--ED.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ver. 16. These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own
   lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's
   persons in admiration because of advantage.

   Here the apostle cometh to make application, and to prove that these
   were such as Enoch had described, and therefore liable to the judgment
   threatened. Here are several things charged; I shall take them in
   order:--

   The first thing is their unsatisfiedness with their present condition,
   expressed in two words:--(1.) Murmurers; (2.) Complainers.

   The first word, gongustai, signifieth such a muttering as men use when
   they are under a passion and discontent. The other word, mempsimoiroi,
   signifieth blamers of their lot and portion; namely, of that portion
   which is set out for them by God; the one implieth their discontented
   thoughts, the other their querulous expressions, Note hence:--

   Obs. 1. That murmuring is a great sin. It is so charged here upon the
   seducers. I shall, first, show what murmuring is; secondly, prove that
   it is a great sin.

   First, What it is. One saith well, [153] it must needs be known,
   because it is so commonly practised; but if you will have me describe
   it, I shall say, it is the scum of discontent, or the vent of
   impatience, or such bold expostulations and complaints as flow from an
   exulcerated mind. In the text, you see first men mutter and then
   complain; the heart boileth with impatience, and then the froth is cast
   out in passionate speeches and complaints. Humble complaints are not
   murmuring, else there would be no room for prayer; but bold
   expostulations are murmurings, when we complain rather of God than to
   God, taxing the administration of his providence, as if he dealt too
   hardly with us; so that in effect murmuring is an anti-providence,
   first cherished by repining thoughts, and then vented and uttered in
   bold and uncomely speeches. Thoughts are audible with God, but it is
   worse when thoughts are not controlled, but break out openly in words
   tending to God's dishonour; if the fire be kindled in our bosoms, it is
   some kind of victory if we smother it, and will not let the sparks fly
   abroad.

   There are several kinds of murmuring--either against men, or against
   God, though in the issue all be against God, against God about men.

   1. Against men, and so either against our equals or superiors.

   [1.] Equals, when we murmur because they are admitted to the same
   privileges with ourselves: see Mat. xx. 11, They murmured against the
   goodman of the house, saying, These last wrought but one hour.' So Luke
   xv. 30, This thy son devoured thy living with harlots,' &c. And Beza,
   of some that reproached him with the sins of his unregenerate
   condition: Hi homines invident mihi gratiam Divinam--surely these men
   are angry because God hath showed me mercy. There is an envious nature
   in man: we would all shine alone, and inclose the common salvation. To
   upbraid men with late conversion is all one as to make it a crime
   because they are born but yesterday: it is to take up that filth which
   God would have covered.

   [2.] Against superiors, especially because invested with magistracy or
   ministry. Some men are of a yokeless, libertine spirit, will
   acknowledge no other law but their own lusts, as in the text,
   Murmurers, walking after their own lusts;' think magistracy to be an
   encroachment upon their freedom, and therefore cannot away with any
   established order; and as for ministry, that all the Lord's people are
   holy,' Num. xvi. 3; what need any to be set apart for that work? Thus
   would they level all things in church and commonwealth, as those rebels
   rose up against Moses and Aaron. But though not against the office, we
   may murmur at the persons that are advanced, as if we would teach God
   how to govern the world, and whom to lift up and cast down; or else by
   finding fault with their government without a cause. Some presumptuous
   persons, that never learned obedience, are always un satisfied. It was
   observed of Egypt, that it was Loquax et ingeniosa in contumeliam
   praefectorum provincia; si quis forte vitaverit culpam, contumeliam non
   effugit. Many such ungoverned spirits there are, that are always
   traducing public government, especially when it is most faithfully
   managed, and to the discouragement of opinionists and evil-doers. God
   will not suffer this evil to go unpunished, Exod. xvi. 8, and 2 Sam.
   xviii. 7. The calling is his ordinance, the persons are designed by his
   providence, and the work concerneth his glory; and therefore God taketh
   himself to be much interested in the quarrel.

   2. There is a murmuring which is immediately against God himself. Since
   the fall man is always quarrelling with his Maker, either against his
   decrees, or his laws, or his providence.

   [1.] Against his decrees. Proud man cannot endure to hear of God's
   absolute sovereignty; we will do what we will, but we will not give
   leave to God to do what he will. The good man of the house was fain to
   plead his right, Mat. xx. 15, Shall I not do with my own?' &c. We can
   see no reason why God should pass by one and choose another: though we
   can see no reason, it is enough it is God's pleasure, Mat. xi. 26. God
   hath his arcana imperil, as well as earthly princes, and we have cause
   to admire what we cannot understand; things may be just, though his
   reasons appear not to us; God is not bound to give us an account, or to
   tell us all his secrets; human reason groweth giddy by prying into the
   depth of God's decrees. It is good to change disputes into wonder and
   reverence: Rom. ix. 20, Who art thou, O man, that disputest with God?'
   We may chop logic one with another, the potsherds of the earth with the
   potsherds of the earth, but God's prerogative is above the tribunal of
   our reason.

   [2.] His laws. A proud creature cannot endure to hear of restraints; we
   could love other things in God, but not his legislative power, Rom.
   viii. 7; the carnal mind will never stoop, but complaineth of him as
   harsh and severe, as if he had forbidden us the satisfying of those
   desires which he hath planted in us. The Israelites murmured thus: the
   land was a good land, but there were giants and sons of Anak, Num.
   xiii. 32. The heaven promised is a good heaven, but the way is rough
   and impassable; duties are difficult, and it is cumbersome to thwart
   our lusts. The project of carnal nature is to find out an easy and
   smooth path to eternal happiness: see Ps. cvi. 24, 25, They despised
   the pleasant land; they believed not his word, but murmured in their
   tents.' Heaven, figured by the land of Canaan, is not counted worth the
   pains and difficulty of getting thither.

   [3.] His providence. In general, when the wicked prosper, it is a
   temptation that hath shaken the tallest cedars in Lebanon: David,
   though afterwards he was ashamed of it, and counts it brutish
   ignorance, Ps. lxxiii. 22; so Jer. xii. 1-3, and Hab. i. But let us
   come to temptations that are of a more particular and private
   experience. We murmur either for what we want, or for what we have
   lost, or for what we affect.

   First, For what we want. As soon as we are straitened we complain
   presently; this is not so bad as when we murmur out of wantonness. The
   Israelites, I observe, did fall a-murmuring either out of want, and
   then they were spared; as for want of waters, Exod. xv. 24; for want of
   meat, Exod. xvi. 2; want of bread, Num. xx. 3; but at other times out
   of wantonness. They loathed manna,' must have quails; but then some
   special judgment or other broke out upon them. But, however, it is bad
   enough when our necessities extort these complaints from us: want is a
   time of praying, not of murmuring. The throne of grace was erected for
   a time of need,' Heb. iv. 16. But it is man's usual custom to change
   duties into sins, as admonition into censuring; instead of speaking to
   men, we speak of men; so in stead of complaining to God, we complain of
   God, and so make murmuring take the room of prayer. Necessity is a time
   to put the promises in suit, to try faith, to awaken affections, not to
   provoke murmurings: I was dumb, and opened not my mouth,' saith David,
   Ps. xxxix. 9. We may open our mouths in confessions of sin, humble
   narratives, pleading of promises, but not in self-justifications,
   stormings against providence, or words of unbelief and impatience; so
   we must be dumb, and not once open our mouths.

   Secondly, For what we have lost. We complain when God taketh away such
   a child, or such a comfort, or blasteth such a confidence of ours as
   our affections were much set upon, and in bitterness of heart speak
   unworthily of God and his dispensations: see 2 Sam. xviii. 33. We hate
   going back a degree or two, and count it miserable to be once happy,
   &c. But, O Christians! remember, when anything is lost, it is a wonder
   all is not gone. Job lost all, and yet blessed God,' Job i. 23.
   Abstulit, sed et dedit, [154] He took, but he gave first. That we were
   once happy showeth we have not always been miserable; our pilgrimage
   might have been wholly evil and uncomfortable: Shall we receive good
   and not evil at the hands of the Lord'? Job ii. 10. There is much gone,
   but somewhat left; that little that is left is more than we have
   deserved; many in the world would be glad of our relics. Hath he taken
   aught from us? He might have taken more; he taketh part that giveth
   all; all is his own, he reserved the property to himself; as much right
   as we had to our comforts was long since forfeited. If God hath lent us
   blessings and demand them again, shall we grudge them to the right
   owner? It is needful now and then that God should take our comforts
   from us. When we have gotten a carnal pillow under our heads we are apt
   to fall into a deep sleep, and dream many a fond dream till God take it
   from under us. He withdraweth comforts to see how we will take it, and
   bear up upon our great and everlasting hopes: Heb. x. 34, Ye took
   joyfully the spoiling of your goods,' &c. You will say that was by
   martyrdom, but your loss by an ordinary providence; and will not you
   let God take as willingly as thieves and persecutors? You have the same
   encouragements, a better and enduring substance.'

   Thirdly, For what we affect. We are wont to murmur at the smallness of
   our portion; we have not so much as others; our condition in the world
   is not so great, so rich, so honourable as theirs; we have but a
   single, but they a double, a Benjamin's portion. Oh! but consider this
   is mere murmuring. God never undertook to maintain all his children at
   the same rate, and we cannot expect so much. Variety of conditions is
   necessary for the preservation of the world. Levelling is not God's
   dispensation. Some must be high and some low. The wise preserver of all
   things distributeth his gifts variously--wealth to one, skill to
   another, strength to a third; one must reign, another serve, and all
   for the common good. A piece of arras is composed of several parcels.
   We should all famish for company if all were of one sort. Who should
   endure the handy labours? How low soever thou art, thou art there where
   God hath set thee, and there thou must tarry till the fair invitation
   of providence call thee higher. Look backward; thou hast made some
   increase. Jacob took notice that he was become two droves,' Gen. xxxii.
   10, though when he first came into the country he had nothing but his
   staff in his hand. Many of God's children are not so high as thou art.
   If you murmur, what should others do that have less? We cast our eyes
   forward on those before us, and because we have not so. much as they,
   so good trading, houses so well furnished, such honour and esteem in
   the world, all is as nothing. You do not look about you to the
   thousands that come short of you. You say, Why should not we thrive as
   they, be preferred as they? Joseph knew why Benjamin had a larger mess,
   though the rest at the table did not. So doth the Lord know why he
   giveth to one and not to another.

   Secondly, Let me show you the heinousness of the sin by--(1.) The
   causes of it; (2.) By the injustice of it.

   1. The causes of murmuring are many, but ail naught, as--

   [1.] Pride and self-love. When men are conceited of themselves, they
   storm that others are preferred before them. A proud man must needs be
   discontented, because he sets a high price upon himself; and when
   others will not come up to his price he is troubled. You will find such
   a proud thought rising in your heart that men of your worth are not
   taken notice of, and yet they that deserve least complain and murmur
   most. The best say, I am not worthy. Real worth is humble. The laden
   boughs hang their heads; the nettle mounteth when the violet lieth
   shrouded under its leaves, and is only found out by its own scent. All
   God's blessings are low to him that is high in his own eyes.

   [2.] Impatience. We cannot endure the least inconvenience. Touchy
   natures would be at ease, tumbling and wallowing in all kinds of
   pleasure. Therefore, as soon as we are touched in our skins, we fall
   a-murmuring, Why is this evil befallen me?' and Why should I wait upon
   the Lord any longer?' An unsubjection of will to God will inevitably
   put us upon repining.

   [3.] Presumption of merit. Where all is of free cost there is no
   complaining. Men ascribe to themselves when they prescribe to God what
   he shall do for them, or how bless them. Everything is welcome where
   nothing is deserved. If you keep a man of alms, you take it ill that he
   should not be pleased with his diet. When we look to desert, we may
   wonder more at what we have than what we want. God would do us no wrong
   if we were reduced to a less pittance. If in a prison, it is a favour
   we are not in hell. A malefactor would be glad to commute his
   punishment, a greater for a less, death for exile, exile for loss of
   estate, and then the whole for a part. Can a firebrand of hell murmur?
   There is our desert; but we think God is bound, and that it is a wrong
   that he taketh no more notice of us: Wherefore have we fasted?' &c.,
   Isa. lviii.; I am not as other men,' &c., Luke xviii.

   [4.] Carnal affection. We are too ravenous and greedy upon outward
   things, [155] and therefore the disappointment breedeth the more
   vexation. Our desires and hopes of more destroy the memory and
   consideration of what we have. God giveth sufficiently to satisfy our
   necessities, and we seek to supply our lusts. Lust is more given to
   murmuring than necessity. Nature is contented with a little. It is soon
   satisfied; but lust enlargeth the desire as hell.

   [5.] Unbelief and distrust: Ps. cvi. 24, 25, They believed not his
   word, but murmured in their tents.' Men quarrel with God's providence
   because they do not believe his promises. Distrust will be sure to
   breed discontent. It is ill for the present, and they cannot see how it
   will be better. They could not believe that the wilderness was the way
   to Canaan, that God can love one whom he corrects, and therefore as
   soon as they feel the smart of the rod they give vent to their
   passions.

   2. The injustice of it. It is injurious to God, to others, to
   ourselves.

   [1.] It is injurious to God. Murmuring is a sin that pulleth God out of
   the throne; you enter into judgment' with him; as David, on the other
   hand, prayeth, Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord.'
   Murmurers either deny his providence or tax it. Implicitly they deny
   it, as if God did not set out to every man his portion. If men did
   believe that God did govern the world, even as he made the world, why
   do they not complain of creation as well as providence? We would laugh
   at him that would murmur because God did not make him an angel or a
   star. Why! is it not as ridiculous to murmur because God hath made thee
   a subject and not a prince, a beggar and not a rich man, a servant but
   not a master, but that they own the hand of God in one and not in the
   other, as if the world were governed by blind chance? Or else they tax
   providence of indiscretion or unrighteousness. It is marvellous to see
   how murmuring robbeth God of all his attributes. It clippeth his
   sovereignty. We will not let him do with his own as it pleaseth him.
   The great contest between him and us is, Whose will shall stand, his or
   ours? It limits his power, and slights it. When God doth not satisfy us
   we think he cannot, Ps. lxxviii. 20. We set him a task, and if God
   perform it not, we question his sufficiency. It is a contention with
   our maker, an entering into the lists with God, as if we could make our
   party good against him, Ps. lxxviii. 17. We tax his wisdom. Men will be
   teaching God how to govern the world, for we prescribe to him as if he
   did not understand what is fit for us. He pleaseth us not in his wisest
   dispensations, and we bear it out as if we could mend his works: Job
   xxi. 22, Shall any teach God knowledge, seeing he judgeth those that
   are high?' They that disallow of God's proceedings take upon them to be
   God's teachers. It was a blasphemous speech of Alphonsus, Si Deo a
   consiliis adfuisset in creatione mundi, multa se consultius
   ordinaturum--if he had been of God's council when he made the world, he
   would have ordered many things better. Many abhor the blasphemy, and
   yet think almost to the same effect. If they had the governing of the
   world, such men should not prosper, and such and such things should not
   be done. Thus do we darken counsel with words without knowledge,' Job
   xxxviii. 2, and cast a reproach of folly and injustice upon God's
   providence. Again, to his goodness we are injurious, by disvaluing what
   we have in comparison of what we expect: Mal. i. 2, Wherein hast thou
   loved us?' as if they had nothing, because not fully what they
   expected. [156] It is man's nature to forget what is granted, and pitch
   only upon what is denied, [157] as children in a pet throw away what
   they have if you do not give them more. Saith Haman, All this availeth
   me nothing,' &c., Esther v. 13; and the whole kingdom of Israel would
   not content Ahab when he falleth sick for Naboth's vineyard, 1 Kings
   xxi. 4. As in the body, if one humour be out of order, or one joint
   broken, the soundness of all the rest availeth us nothing; a little is
   enough to set the creature a complaining. His justice also we tax, as
   if he did defraud us of our due. We think somewhat is due, or else why
   do we complain? Mat. xx. 13, Friend, I do thee no wrong,' &c.

   [2.] It is injurious to others; it puts us upon acts of violence and
   sedition; the murmurers are called rebels,' Num. xvii. 10. Schism in
   the church and sedition in the commonwealth are but the fruits of
   murmuring. Men dislike their own rank and station, and then murmur, and
   then perturb all. Oh, that I were a judge!' said Absalom, and
   afterwards breaketh out into open rebellion. Thin exhalations end in
   great storms. Servants would be masters, and the poor would be rich,
   and subjects would be in office and power; and by giving vent to their
   repining thoughts, inflame the zeal of persons likeminded with
   themselves, till all be embroiled in blood and confusions.

   [3.] It is injurious to ourselves. Man is a foolish creature; what doth
   he get by complaining of God? Who shall right us? Before what tribunal
   will you put him in suit? Of all sins, murmuring is most unreasonable,
   but very pernicious. What do we get by it but disquiet and judgment? It
   is like spitting against the wind, the drivel is returned upon our own
   heads. Disquiet it breedeth us. A murmuring spirit is a greater evil
   than any affliction; like a sour vessel, it turneth all things that are
   put into it into sourness. Most men's misery ariseth from their
   discontent; if their heart and their condition were suited, they would
   do well enough in the world; we trouble our own peace. If we could
   learn to frame our minds to our estates, as the skilful musician
   letteth down the strings a peg lower when the tune requireth it, we
   should pass to heaven more comfortably. Again, it bringeth down
   judgment; expressions tending to God's dishonour have a loud cry in his
   ears. Miriam was smitten with leprosy for murmuring, and Dathan and
   Abiram swallowed up alive; fiery serpents, and plagues, and exclusion
   out of Canaan were Israel's judgments when they were sick of the fret:
   see 1 Cor. x. 10, Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and were
   destroyed of the destroyer.'

   Let us now make application. Beware of murmurings, it is a greater sin
   than the world taketh it to be. Here I shall speak of two things:--(1.)
   Murmuring at the times and public changes which have happened amongst
   us; (2.) Murmuring in our own private case.

   First, Murmuring at the times. It is a repining age we live in; many
   factions are disappointed, and therefore the most are full of
   discontent, forgetting that all this is the work of a wise God. Mistake
   me not; I list not to become the times' advocate; it little beseemeth
   us to be patrons of public miscarriages, or factors for any private
   interest.

   Therefore, let me proceed with the greatest scripture evidence and
   conviction, and state what is murmuring at the times. It is forbid den,
   Eccles. vii. 10, Say not thou that the former times were better than
   these; for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.' Now, what is
   the sin taxed in this scripture? I answer:--

   1. Not godly sorrow, and complaining to God, and bewailing the
   corruptions of the times. No; the mourners in Sion are marked for
   preservation, Ezek. ix. None are better friends to public interest. It
   were well if these doves of the valleys' had more company. This is no
   sin, for this is the only way of entering our protest, and being free
   from the corruptions of the age. God hath bound up all politic bodies
   in the same bundle, and we are concerned in others' sins. It is the art
   of divine mercy by this means to prevent public ruin, by interesting
   his people in the welfare of those places where they live, that every
   man in his place may be sensible of present sins and approaching
   judgments. Two dry sticks will set a green one a-fire. Can you blame
   the children of God, then, if they mourn, and enter their protest
   against the iniquity of the times? The Corinthians were not clear of
   the incest committed amongst them till they had mourned; then the
   apostle saith, Now ye are clear in this matter,' 2 Cor. vii. 11. Surely
   they that are involved in the guilt, concerned in the judgment, had
   need mourn.

   2. Not zeal in public reproof: Isa. lviii. 1, Cry aloud, spare not,'
   &c. Vitium saeculi is no excuse. If we spare, God will not spare; if we
   hazard our bodies in bearing our testimony, we save our souls. We must
   cry out upon sin with a full throat, and that again and again, provided
   we be clear in our principles and aims, and do it without clamour and
   popular invectives. When a fire is kindled in a city, we do not say
   coldly, Yonder is a great fire, I pray God it do no harm. In times of
   public defection we are not to read tame lectures of contemplative
   divinity, or fight with ghosts and antiquated errors, but to oppose
   with all earnestness the growing evils of the world, whatever it cost
   us.

   3. Nor yet a holy dislike and singularity, standing aloof from public
   corruptions, as Lot in Sodom, and Noah walked with God in his
   generations,' Gen. vi. 9. God's children most commonly are forced to
   walk in a counter motion to the times. Paul, when he had accused the
   times as evil, adviseth Christians to walk circumspectly,' Eph. v. 16.
   Worldly wisdom would draw quite another conclusion. The times are bad,
   let us do as well as we can. There is no living in the world unless we
   yield a little. The oak is rent to pieces with the fury of the wind
   when the willow boweth and bendeth. Shall we alone resist such a
   torrent? Thus would we reason; but the Spirit doth not loosen the
   reins, but straiten them, upon this consideration, The days are evil,'
   therefore be circumspect;' that is, be careful to keep close to rule,
   lest you be blinded and perverted by the subtleties of those that lie
   in wait to deceive, and elsewhere: Shine as lights in the midst of a
   perverse generation.' Dead fishes swim with the stream. There is a
   difference between subjection to God and compliance with men, &c.

   But now, positively, what is the fault there reproved? I answer:--

   [1.] Foolish murmurings, or such a fond and unthankful admiration of
   former times that we have not a good word for the present. Tacitus
   observed it, Vitio malignitatis humanae vetera laudantur, praesentia
   fastidio sunt. It is a common evil, men are praising past times and
   declaiming against the present: querulous natures are never pleased,
   neither full nor fasting. Past temptations are forgotten, and therefore
   present evils seem worst, and laziness many times occasioneth
   complaints. Many repine against God because he hath given us our lot in
   such an age, wherein public contests put us upon the trouble of prayer,
   discourse, and diligent searching in the mind of God; now usually to
   excuse other duties we fall a-complaining.

   Again, private discontent may exasperate some; things are not suitable
   to their humours and interests. No wonder if Demetrius and the
   coppersmiths call those evil times when the gospel is like to get up,
   because their craft is like to go down, and they are not favoured as
   they desire. Again sottish carnality may be in the wind; carnal men
   will extol the happiness of former times, their great hospitality and
   kind neighbourhood, their honest dealing, and good devotion, what a
   merry time it was, and how plentiful all things were before the new
   gospel came in, and they had nothing but mass and matins; as those
   sots, Jer. xliv. 18, 19. Formalists cry up the goodness of the old
   religion to disparage times of reformation; so the pagans said that the
   Roman empire thrived more under false gods than under the Christian
   religion; wherefore Augustine wrote his book, De Civitate Dei, to
   answer that charge. Christians, these times may be the worse for those
   that went before; we may smart for their blood and idols and hatred of
   the people of God; judgments were then in the causes, as the clouds
   gather before the rain falleth.

   [2.] When we pass over the good, and look only upon the evil; we should
   counterbalance our afflictions with our mercies: Shall we receive good
   and not evil at the hands of God?' Job ii. 10. It is railing to gather
   up the failings of others and not to take notice of their graces; so it
   is a railing against providence and an ill office to be only like flies
   pitching upon a sore place. Is there no blessing with all this bad?
   with our temporal calamities have we not some increase of spiritual
   privileges, as in the wilderness they had God's presence, though they
   had a tedious passage of it? The free use of ordinances will
   countervail all public burdens. Some suppose that Solomon, in that
   Eccles. vii. 10, alludeth to the people's murmuring in his time; there
   was a temple building, but the taxes were great, and therefore they
   cried The former times were better than these.' See 1 Kings xii. 4.

   [3.] When we charge our guilt upon the times. Man is apt to transfer
   his faults upon others, and obliquely upon God himself: The woman which
   thou gavest me,' &c.; and so usually the times wherein we live are
   such, &c. Why, God ordered them, and if you were as you should be, the
   times could not hurt you. A great deal of fire falleth upon a stone and
   it burneth not, but a dry chip soon taketh fire. Men think, if they be
   corrupt, the fault is not theirs, but the times. It is yours certainly;
   it is bad men make bad times, as I shall show anon.

   Let me now give you a few remedies.

   (1.) When your hearts storm, look back; there were inconveniences in
   the wilderness, but a sore bondage in Egypt; a good memory is a help to
   thankfulness. For my own case, when I am brimful, I consider the times
   that are past,--see 2 Chron. xv. 3-6--when there was no peace to him
   that went out or came in;' when private meetings were a conventicle,
   and in public we could only sigh, not speak; when maypoles and carnal
   sports were preferred before the Sabbath; when afternoon preaching was
   suppressed to make way for those sports; when it was a crime to go from
   a doting service-reader to hear the preaching of the word. Surely they
   that are so ready to return into Egypt have forgotten their bondage,
   when their cry came up to God because of the anguish of their souls.
   Our hard taskmasters,' the domineering prelates, and their oppressing
   filthy courts, are forgotten, our promiscuous communions, and the flat
   and cold repetitions of an imposed liturgy quite forgotten; so the
   confinement of preaching, and the restraint of doctrines; these things
   are out of feeling, and therefore out of remembrance. One great defect
   the people of God are troubled withal is a bad memory: Micah. vi. 5, O
   my people! remember,' &c. I tell you, if we did but remember how we
   were prelate-bitten, we would not murmur, but give thanks.

   (2.) There is nothing new under the sun,' Eccles. i. 7. We say, Is
   there any sorrow like unto my sorrow?' things never were as they are
   now. Certainly you do not rightly inquire after this matter; the world
   is the world still; men have ever had the same principles, the same
   corruptions, the same temptations; there were Donatists then as well as
   Separatists now, Pelagians then as well as Arminians now, Arians then
   as well as Socinians now; all new lights are but old darkness revived,
   neither new, nor lights. It is easy to parallel what is most odious;
   there is a circular motion of opinions and fashions, as the sun
   returneth every year to the same points of his compass.

   (3.) All cometh to pass by God's providence; he is the great master of
   the scenes that present the world with a new stage both of acts and
   actors: 1 Sam. ii. 7, 8, The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich; he
   bringeth low, and he lifteth up; he raiseth up the poor from the dust,
   and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among the
   princes, and make them inherit the crown of glory; for the pillars of
   the earth are the Lord's, and he hath set the world upon them.' The
   government of the world is in God's hands, and he casteth down some,
   and raiseth up others from beggary to sovereignty, from the dunghill to
   glory. You see there his course is contrary to levelling; he will have
   some upon the throne of glory. And you see, again, that God hath a hand
   in all the mutations and changes that fall out in the world, and that
   these mutations are frequent. The world is tossed to and fro like a
   ball from hand to hand, that God's sovereignty and dominion over events
   may the better appear, and that power may not want a bridle, nor the
   low condition a comfort. Again, that all the kings of the earth do hold
   their estates of God. Say, then, If God hath set up these persons, let
   me see what God will do with them.

   (4.) The good of times is not to be measured by the carnal quiet of
   them. Physic provoketh ill humours; better they should be stirred than
   lie still and foment a disease. God usually cometh with a fan and a
   sword: we should not murmur against the sword, because of the benefit
   of the fan.

   (5.) If every one did amend himself, the times would soon amend. Mend
   thyself and as many as are under thy charge, and mourn for others, and
   thou hast no cause to complain: Josh. xxiv. 15, I and my house will
   serve the Lord.' If every one did sweep before his own door, the common
   filth would be sooner carried away. Usually complainers do least, as
   the crafty lapwing will go up and down fluttering and crying to draw
   the fowler from her own nest. We have some secret nest of our own, and
   we are loath it should be rifled and exposed to public view.

   (6.) The worse the times are the more exercise for grace. We have more
   opportunities of showing love to God than formerly, and zeal for his
   interests, and industry in finding out the right way. Man is never
   contented; sometimes we question God's love if we meet with no
   opposition, and yet we complain when the ways of God are opposed.

   (7.) There is an antiperistasis in grace as well as nature. You should
   be better in bad times, as fountain water is hottest in winter, and
   fire scaldeth most in frosty weather, or stars shine brightest in the
   darkest night; see Phil. ii. 15. When the air is infectious we are the
   more careful of our diet.

   (8.) Complaining will not excuse duty; it argueth little faith--is not
   Christ king? doth not he reign?--little obedience and care of
   reformation; a gracious heart is most apt to return upon itself. If the
   times be bad, what have I done to make them better? If not, thou art
   one that hast made them worse.

   (9.) He that is not good in bad times will be naught in better, Isa.
   xxvi. 10, In the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly.' A sick man
   thinketh to have ease in another bed, in another room; carry him
   thither, his pain continueth. If a carnal man had lived in the
   prophets' times or the apostles' times, he would be the same as now;
   see Mat. xxiii. 29, 30. A briar is a briar wherever it groweth; change
   of times will not do the work without a change of heart. Adam sinned in
   paradise, the apostate angels in heaven; Lot was unchaste in the
   mountains, where were none but his own family; in a howling wilderness
   where they had no outward enticements, the Israelites were given to
   fleshly lusts.

   Secondly, The next part of use is to rebuke murmuring in our own
   private case. By way of consideration take these helps:--

   1. A little is enough; too much is a snare: Luke xii. 15, Man's life
   consisteth not in the abundance of what he possesseth.' The wants of
   nature are very few, till lust make it ravenous; a garment too long
   will soon prove a dirty rag; the greater gates open to the greater
   temptations and cares; it is a hard lesson, to learn to abound,' Phil,
   iv. 12. We say such a one would do well to be a, lord or a lady; it is
   a harder thing than you think it to be. A little sufficeth to keep us
   till we come to heaven; if we have clothes for warmth, though not for
   pomp, it is enough. What need a Christian care how, finely dust and
   ashes be wrapped up, [158] or of what stuff his excrements be made of?

   2. God hath a hand in all things,. Ps. xxxix. 9, Isa. xxxviii. 15. God
   is the party with whom we have to do in sickness or any other trouble;
   every wheel moveth according to the motion of the first; when we see
   the hand of God, it is a piece of religious manners to keep silence.

   3. God seeth what is fittest for us. If a man should be left to carve
   out his own portion, he would be his own greatest enemy. None hath more
   love than God, more wisdom and justice than God; therefore count the
   present estate best, because it is of his choosing. Should the shepherd
   choose the pastures, or the sheep? We are all for the delicacies of
   pleasure and prosperity;. children think green fruit the best diet
   because it suiteth with their appetite. What a strange creature would
   man be if he were what he would be himself! Well, then, let us leave it
   to God to choose our portion, and to appoint us what part we shall act
   in the world. Usually we set up a court in our own affections, and
   enact laws, prescribe to providence, we would have this and we would
   have that; and when our expectations are not answered we fall
   a-murmuring. It is very hard to repeal the decrees of our own will;
   therefore it is good to resign ourselves to the disposal of providence,
   as David doth, 2 Sam. xv. 26, 27; and to keep our desires low till
   God's will be declared. It is easier to add than to subtract, and to
   ascend with providence, when the master of the feast biddeth us to sit
   higher,' than to be compelled to descend and lie in the dust.

   4. If it be bad, it might have been worse, in regard of God's absolute
   power and our desert. Your sufferings are not so great as your sins:
   Ezra ix. 13, Thou hast punished us less than we have deserved.' God is
   too just to do us wrong. If he will exchange hell for Babylon, there is
   much of mercy in it, nothing of injustice. If you do not deserve this
   usage from the hands of men, you have deserved this, and much more,
   from God: it is deserved of God, and therefore to be borne patiently;
   it is not deserved of men, therefore to be borne cheerfully. Whose
   cross would we bear, Christ's or the thieves' cross? When we suffer
   deservedly and as malefactors, we bear the thieves' cross.

   5. The Lord disposeth all for the benefit of his own people, so that if
   it be not good for the present, it will turn to good, Rom. viii. 28. If
   God should not thus exercise us, we would have more cause to complain.
   He is too gentle a physician that lets his patient die for want of
   putting him to the trouble of physic. Consult with God's aim. rather
   than your present feeling; let him cut and burn here that he may save
   hereafter--Domine, hic ure, hic seca, &c.

   6. Murmuring is so bad in none as in God's children. It doth not become
   their privileges, their vows, their hope. God in covenant is theirs,
   and he hath all things that hath him that made all things: all things
   are comprised in God. If our lumber be changed into silver, our silver
   into gold, our gold into one rare pearl, that is all the other
   virtually. If God hath given us himself, his Christ, his Spirit, will
   not all this content us? It doth not become our vows, and the promises
   which thou madest to God when thy terrors were upon thee; then thou
   didst say, O Lord, let me have Jesus Christ, and I will be content,
   though I should beg my bread, and be reduced to rags, and extremity of
   want. When thy heart was stung with sin, thus desirous wert thou to
   reckon upon Christ as thy all-sufficient portion. How grew the
   consolations of God to be small' with thee? Job xv. 11. Now God trieth
   whether thou wilt stand to thy word, and thou fallest a-murmuring: it
   may be just with God to dip his arrows in venom and vengeance, and
   shoot them into thy soul again. Once more, it is below your hopes; you
   should have a spirit as high as heaven, and will you storm at every
   petty loss? as he said, Art thou the king's son-in-law, and art so lean
   from day to day?' are you heirs of glory, and stand so much upon
   trifles? It should -not be.

   Having given you some general considerations against murmuring, I now
   come to particular cases.

   1. Dost thou lie under deep pressing wants? Divers have been put to
   great straits that have done God more glory. Musculus, a great divine,
   yet forced to serve a weaver for his subsistence; Paul made tents that
   he might not be burdensome, and so prejudice men against the gospel;
   the more destitute, the more sensible of the care of providence. God
   beareth the purse for us; when we have but from hand to mouth, we are
   still supplied: the more immediately you live upon God, the more you
   begin the life of heaven, where God is all in all. Deep poverty is the
   sauce of the present life. Austin saw a beggar frisking after his belly
   was filled; he could find no such delight after the use of the
   creatures, being daily and abundantly supplied. The spectacle much
   wrought upon him.

   2. Hast thou sustained great losses? If God hath lent us blessings, and
   taken them again, shall we grudge them to the right owner? He took part
   that gave all.

   3. Dost thou endure great pains? There is a gradation in miseries;
   those that light upon the estate do not sit so close as those that
   light upon the body, and those that light upon the body are not so
   terrible as those that light upon the soul: A wounded spirit, who can
   bear?' Bodily pains is the case we now speak to: you are full of pains,
   but Christ on the cross suffered more; but he was God-man. The martyrs
   suffered more, Heb. xi. 35: they were tortured, etumpani'sthesan--they
   were stretched out like a drum; but those were rare instances, and had
   a singular assistance. Paul's was an ordinary case; his thorn in the
   flesh,' 2 Cor. xii., was some great bodily pain; but Paul was a choice
   spirit: heathens have borne it stoutly. Epicurus was full of solace in
   a fit of the colic, ob memoriam inventorum, by calling to mind his
   inventions in philosophy; and Tully speaketh of Possidonius the
   philosopher, that whilst he was under a great fit of the stone, could
   discourse freely that nothing was good but virtue, nothing evil but
   vice; and when his pain twinged him, would say, Nihil agis, dolor!
   quamvis sis molestus, nunquam confitebor te esse malum--pain, thou dost
   nothing alter my opinion; though thou art troublesome, yet thou art not
   evil. But these were men that obsti nately maintained an
   insensibleness. Little children have endured great pains, and wilt thou
   startle at that which poor little children have suffered? Besides all
   this, it is God's design to try you. There is a great deal of valour to
   be showed in the sick-bed: [159] either the end of it will be life or
   death: if death, it is the last brunt, bear it patiently: Those enemies
   which ye now see, ye shall see them no more,' Exod. xiv. 13; heaven
   will make amends for all: if life, you will be ashamed, when well, that
   you had no more patience whilst sick. Passive valour is the glory of a
   Christian; active valour, that is fomented with plenty of blood and
   spirits, is a poor thing to it. Great soldiers, that will venture upon
   the mouth of a cannon, yet tremble at a disease and lingering death;
   when they are sick they are under God's arrest, &c.

   Thus I have given you remedies against murmuring by way of
   consideration: now by way of practice.

   1. Divert the stream another way. As to the disposition of heart, take
   this rule: Be still examining thyself rather than judging God, Ps. iv.
   4. If God seemeth to neglect me, have not I neglected him? &c. As to
   the outward expression of murmuring, turn the streams again; express
   thy sorrows often in a way of prayer, thy rejoicings in a way of
   praise. Prayer cureth murmuring, for that is a duty wherein we profess
   subjection and dependence: and besides, utterance giveth ease to the
   soul: an oven stopped is the more hot within; complain more to God, and
   we shall not complain of God. Praise cureth murmuring, Job i. 23; as
   long as we can give thanks, we will not be querulous: but when we are
   disdainful of blessings, and we say, What! no more? Mal. i. 2, the
   distemper is getting ground upon the soul.

   2. Affect rather to be good than great. None murmur because of the
   smallness of grace; that is not their complaint; but because of the
   lowness of their condition in the world. A man that looketh after the
   increase of grace, he can bless God for his outward decays, 2 Cor. iv.
   16, and look upon murmurings as worse than pains or losses; those are
   afflictions, these are sins. So much for the first crime charged.

   The next part of their character is walking after their own lusts. This
   is fitly subjoined to the former, for lusts make men fro ward and hard
   to be pleased, and the persons here described were exact libertines,
   making their lusts their rule and their law; yea, the most brutish of
   all lusts, the lusts of the flesh; and therefore in Peter it is, 2
   Peter ii. 10, That walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness.'
   How portentious they were for impurities in this kind we told you
   before. Their walking after their lusts implieth their giving up
   themselves to such a course, contrary to all fear of God, care of laws,
   or restraint of nature.

   The point is, that it is an argument of ungodliness when men walk after
   their own lusts. The apostle, applying the prophecy of Enoch against
   ungodly men, bringeth this as a part of the charge, that they walk
   after their own lusts.' I shall inquire:--

   1. What lusts are?

   2. What it is to walk after their own lusts?

   3. Prove it to be a note of ungodliness.

   First, What lusts are? This I have answered elsewhere; see my
   commentary on James i. 14. For the present, let it suffice to note,
   that lust is either original or actual.

   1. It signifieth our original proneness to all that is evil, James i.
   14.

   2. Actual lust, so it signifieth any evil motion of the heart that
   swerveth from the law of God, more especially our inordinate desires
   and inclinations to pleasures, honours, or profit. Sometimes they are
   called fleshly lusts,' 1 Peter ii. 11, as carrying us out to the
   satisfaction of our bodily and brutish appetites; sometimes worldly
   lusts,' Titus ii. 12, because they are stirred by worldly objects.
   Lusts are the fever of the soul, unnatural heats, transgressing the
   laws of reason and bounds of religion.

   Secondly, What doth this walking imply? It is elsewhere expressed by
   serving divers lusts and pleasures,' Titus iii. 3, and by fulfilling
   the desires of the flesh and the mind,' Eph. ii. 3. It noteth:--

   1. A willing subjection to lust as a law or as a master, The one is
   implied in walking after our lusts,' the other in serving our lusts,'
   when men do as they please, and let their sensual heart give law to the
   whole man. A child of God may be overcome by his lusts, but he doth not
   walk after them, or serve them; he may be foiled, but he doth not give
   over the combat, and is still resisting, striving, praying, calling in
   the help of the Spirit; his soul suffereth a rape by lust, there is not
   a plenary consent on his part.

   2. Customary practice and observance. Walking is a progressive motion,
   and so implieth men's course and the tenor of their lives. A child of
   God his walking is in the Spirit, Gal. v. 16, and doth not fulfil the
   lusts of the flesh; but it is a wicked man's work and employment.

   3. A fond indulgence; they are so far from thwarting lusts, that they
   provide, contrive for them: Rom. xiii. 14, Make not provision for the
   flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.' They nourish their hearts, fondle
   lust, and make a wanton of it; they do not crucify it, and set up a
   course of mortification against it.

   Thirdly, This is a note of unregeneracy, or a state of ungodliness. The
   apostle describeth the natural state by this serving,' Titus iii. 3;
   and this fulfilling,' Eph. ii. 3; and when the Holy Ghost doth deride
   the pride and folly of young men in giving themselves up to a course of
   lust and vanity, he saith, Go, walk in the way of thine own heart,'
   Eccles. xi. 9; and the negative or privative work of regeneration is
   called a putting off the old man with his deceitful lusts,' Eph. iv.
   22, and it standeth with good reason:--

   1. Because they that walk after their lusts seek to cherish that which
   Christ came to destroy, and so go about to defeat the Redeemer, and to
   hinder him from obtaining his purpose in their hearts. Christ came to
   destroy the works of the devil,' 1 John iii. 8, i'na lu'se, to untie
   and loosen those cords of vanity wherewith Satan hath bound us. The
   works of the devil are lusts, which are of his inspiring and
   cherishing: John viii.44, Ye are of your father the devil, and the
   lusts of your father ye will do.' Now when Christ cometh to loose these
   cords, carnal men tie them the faster, and therefore certainly are to
   be reckoned to the devil, and not unto God. Every degree of service
   done to Satan is an act of treason and disloyalty to Christ; therefore,
   when men make it their work to fulfil their lust, they renounce all
   allegiance to Christ.

   2. They that walk after their lusts have not taken the rule of the new
   creature upon them. The new man hath another master and another rule;
   the renewed soul is not governed by lust, but by the law of God, Gal.
   vi. 16. If we have not changed our rule, it is a sign we have not
   changed our master.

   3. They that walk after their lusts never felt the power of grace, for
   the grace of God teacheth us to deny all ungodliness and worldly
   lusts,' Titus ii. 11, 12. How doth it teach us? I answer--(1.) Partly
   by diversion, by acquainting us with better things in Christ: Rom.
   xiii. 14, Put ye on the Lord Jesus, and make not provision for the
   lusts of the flesh.' Love cannot lie idle in the soul, the mind of man
   must have some oblectation and delight; either love runneth out in lust
   or in respects to God, either to heavenly or worldly things. When we
   only savour the things of the flesh, it is a sign we never tasted how
   sweet God is in Christ. (2.) Partly by way of help and supply; it
   planteth opposite principles, and makes use of an opposite power; it
   plants opposite principles, a new nature that hath new desires and
   delights, 2 Peter i. 4, and maketh use of an opposite power, which is
   the Spirit of God, Rom. viii. 13. (3.) Partly by way of argument. Grace
   out-pleadeth lust; it urgeth the unsuitableness of it to our condition.
   See Rom. xiii. 13; 1 Peter iv. 3, i. 14; Rom. vi. 2. To our vows;
   baptism implieth a renunciation of sins, 1 Peter iii. 21. It is an
   answer to God's demands: Credis?--Credo. Abrenuncias?--Abrenuncio.
   Spondes?--Spondeo. Therefore he that liveth under the full power of
   lust hath forgotten his baptismal vows, 2 Peter i. 8, for gotten that
   he was purged from his old sins.' It pleadeth also the unsuitableness
   of it to our hopes, 1 Peter ii. 11. We are passing on to another
   country, where we shall enjoy a pure and sinless estate.

   Let us now apply the point:--

   Use 1. It dissuadeth us from walking after our own lusts. You that are
   Christians should deny them, and not gratify them, otherwise you
   renounce your allegiance to God. Lust sets up another lord, and maketh
   us stand in defiance of the God that made us; his laws call for one
   thing, and your lusts crave another. God saith, Put off the old man
   with his deceitful lusts,' and you say, We will keep them. Can they be
   good subjects that live in defiance of their sovereign's laws? If a
   prince should send a message to a city not to harbour such and such
   traitors, but to search them out, and bring them to condign punishment;
   if they never look after them, yea, are angry with those that discover
   them, it argueth they do inhaunt with traitors, and are enemies to
   their prince. We are often warned in God's name to look to our sinful
   lusts, to put them away; and we go home and never regard it, nay, are
   angry with those that grate upon the conscience: Herod would not have
   his Herodias touched. We take it heinously when the word beareth hard
   upon our hearts; what do we but show ourselves traitors to the crown of
   heaven?

   2. Otherwise you renounce your interest in Christ: Gal. v. 24, They
   that are Christ's have crucified the flesh, with the affections and
   lusts thereof He doth not say they are Christ's that take up this
   opinion and naked belief that he was crucified, or died for sinners,
   but they are Christ's that feel that he was crucified, that, by the
   virtue of his cross, do crucify their own lusts and sinful affections.
   What! a Christian, and yet worldly! a Christian, and yet sensual! a
   Christian, and yet proud! You that are given to pleasures, do you
   believe in Christ that was a man of sorrow? You that are carried after
   the pomp and vanity of the world, do you believe in Christ, whose
   kingdom was not of this world'? You that are proud and lofty, do you
   profess an interest in Christ, who said, Learn of me, for I am humble
   and lowly'? It is in vain for you to talk of his dying for sinners, and
   boasting of his cross, when you never felt the virtue of it, Gal. vi.
   14. What experience have you that his cross was the cross of the Son of
   God, when your hearts linger as inordinately after carnal things as
   ever? Have you got anything by it? Do you feel any weakening of lusts?
   any decay of sin? Are you planted into the efficacy of his death'? Rom.
   vi. 5. If not, how can you glory in the cross of Christ?

   3. Otherwise you are not acquainted with the Spirit; his work is to
   mortify lusts, Rom. viii. 13, and they that are after the flesh do
   savour of the things of the flesh; and they that are after the Spirit,
   the things of the Spirit.' Rom. viii. 5. After whom do ye walk? After
   your own lusts, or after the Spirit of God?

   4. God doth not only require you in point of sovereignty to put away
   your lusts, but also pleadeth with you upon terms of grace: Titus ii.
   11, 12, The grace of God that bringeth salvation, teacheth you to deny
   worldly lusts.' Grace hath denied us nothing, it hath given us Christ,
   and all things with him; and shall we stick at our lusts, that are not
   worth the keeping? Nature is much addicted to these lusts, but surely
   God loves Christ much more than we love the world; his love is infinite
   and unlimited, like his essence, yet God gave up the Son of his love.
   Grace counteth nothing too dear for us, not the blood of Christ, the
   joys of heaven; and shall we count anything too dear to part with for
   grace's sake? God forbid! A right eye,' and a right hand,' Mat. v. 29,
   cannot be so dear to us as Christ was to God. What a cost hath grace
   been at to redeem us and save us! and shall grace be at all this cost
   for nothing? If God had commanded us a greater thing, ought we not to
   have done it? If to give the body to be burned,' to offer the
   first-born for the sin of the soul'? Considering his absolute right
   over the creature, he might have required thy life, and thy children's
   life, but he only requireth thy lusts, things not worth the keeping,
   the bane of the soul, a bad inmate, which, if we know its pestilent
   influence, we needed no more arguments to turn out of doors. Thy lusts
   God requireth; things we are bound to part with, to preserve the
   integrity and perfection of our natures, if God had never dealt with us
   in a way of grace. But how shall grace plead in vain when it presseth
   to deny lusts? It will be the shame and horror of the damned to all
   eternity that they have stood with God for a trifle, that they would
   not part with dung for gold, with a little brutish contentment for the
   consolations of the Spirit, especially when grace, which hath so deeply
   pre-engaged us, pleadeth for it.

   5. Consider what lust is; it is the disease of the soul. Natural desire
   is like the calor vitalis--the vital heat; but lust is like a feverish
   heat, that oppresseth nature. We should get rid of it as we would of a
   disease; the satisfaction of it is sweet to carnal nature, so is drink
   to a man in a fever. Who would desire a fever to relish his drink?
   Better be without the disease than enjoy the pleasure of the
   satisfaction; better mortify lust than satisfy it; in the issue it will
   be sweeter. I am sure the pains of mortification will not be so bitter
   as the horrors of everlasting darkness. Lust let alone beginneth our
   hell; it is a burning heat that at length breaketh out into everlasting
   flames. Again, lust is the disorder of nature: as it is monstrous in
   the body if the head be there where the feet should be, and the feet
   there where the head should be; such a deordination is there in the
   soul when the affections carry it; and when reason should be in
   dominion, we suffer lust to take the throne. Man rightly constituted,
   his actions are governed in this manner: the understanding and
   conscience prescribe to the will; the will, according to right reason
   and conscience, moveth the affections; the affections, according to the
   command and counsel of the will, move the bodily spirits and members of
   the body; but by corruption there is a manifest inversion and change;
   pleasures affect the senses, the senses corrupt the fantasy, the
   fantasy moveth the bodily spirits, they the affections, and by their
   violence and inclination the will is enslaved, and the mind blinded,
   and so man is carried headlong to his own destruction. Now, shall we
   cherish these lusts and brutish appetites? The Lord forbid!

   6. It is lusts that hinder the peace of the world, our own peace. How
   quietly and happily would men live if they were more mortified! Men
   desire more than they have, and so are made poor, not by want so much
   as desire. He that expects little is soon satisfied. It is our own
   passions that raise a storm in the soul. A man that is vile and little
   in his own eyes, when others contemn and slight him, they do but ratify
   his private opinion of himself; and who can be angry with others
   because they are of the same judgment with ourselves? Take away the
   lust and the trouble ceaseth. What need Haman be troubled that Mordecai
   did not bow the knee, but that he looked for it? Nay, lusts trouble our
   peace of conscience. Lusts let alone end in gross sins, and gross sins
   in desperation. Love of pleasures, if uncontrolled, will end in
   drunkenness, or adultery; and envy, in murder and violence. Sins
   unchecked grow licentious and unruly. Judas allowed his covetousness,
   and it brought him to betray his Master, and that brought him to the
   halter. Gehazi was first blasted with covetousness, and then with
   leprosy, and so became a burden to himself; Ananias and Sapphira, taken
   off by a sudden judgment. The devil loveth by lust to bring us to sin,
   and by sin to shame, and by shame to horror and despair; so that, if we
   walk after our lusts, it proveth a sad walk in the issue. Again, it
   disturbeth our peace with others. These libertines were yokeless, and
   could not endure restraints, because wedded to their own lusts. It is
   not opinions divide the world so much as lusts and interests.

   7. The more you walk after your lusts, the more you may. They are not
   quenched when they are satisfied, but increased rather, as the fire is,
   by laying on new fuel; the distemper groweth every day, till you are
   quite enslaved: Given to much wine,' Titus i. 7, ii. 3; it is
   dedoulome'nas, enslaved to wine,' in the Greek. In this sense we are
   said to be brought under the power of the creature, 1 Cor. vi. 12; so
   that whatever shame or loss ensueth, you cannot leave your lusts: Jer.
   xviii. 12, There is no hope,' &c.; they see it is bad, and cannot see
   how it should be otherwise.

   8. What can we get by sin but a little pleasure? Titus iii. 3, Serving
   divers lusts and pleasures.' This is the great sorceress that enchants
   the whole world, the root of all sin; they loved pleasures more than
   God,' 2 Tim. iii. 4. It is not imaginable that an intelligent creature
   should rest in his own actions; we aim at somewhat in walking after our
   own lusts; if we balk that which is honest, it must be profit or
   pleasure. Now, that a man should enslave himself for ever, and that for
   a little pleasure, which is base in itself, and lost as soon as
   enjoyed, is monstrous and absurd. Breve est quod delectat, aeternum
   quod cruciat--the pleasure is but short, vanishing, but the pain is for
   ever. And will you for a thing of nought break with God, and forfeit
   your immortal souls? Oh! let it not be.

   Let all this now persuade you to deny your lusts, rather than to feed
   and cherish them, to renounce them, and not to walk after them. There
   are three degrees of this denial:--(1.) They must be prevented, and
   kept from rising; (2.) Suppressed and kept from growth; (3.) We must
   not accomplish them, and if they gain consent, keep them, from
   execution. Suitable to which three degrees there are three
   duties:--(1st.) Mortification, that we may prevent them. (2d.)
   Watchfulness, that we may suppress them; (3d.) Resolution, that we may
   not accomplish them.

   1. To begin with the top and highest degree, to prevent the lust: 1
   Peter ii. 11, Abstain from fleshly lusts.' It is not enough to abstain
   from acts of sin, but we must abstain from lusts; yea, the root must be
   deadened: Gal. v. 24, Crucify the flesh.' She is chaste that checketh
   an unclean solicitation, but she is more worthy of praise whose grave
   carriage forbiddeth all assaults and attempts in that kind; so should
   we be so mortified as to prevent a temptation, not to have a lust
   stirring. But because this cannot always be--

   2. The next degree is, timely to suppress them, laus est aliqua in
   secundis stare--to conquer lust when we cannot curb it, and wholly keep
   it under. Dash Babylon's brats against the stones, and take the little
   foxes; smother it in the conception, James i. 15. It is a great sin to
   quench the Spirit's motion, so it is a great neglect not to take notice
   of the first thoughts and risings of sin; the little sticks kindle
   first, and set the great ones on fire; crush the cockatrice in the egg.
   The flesh riseth up in arms against every graceful motion; so should
   the spirit, the better part, against every sinful motion, Gal. v. 17.
   Chide away your carnal thoughts, and let them not find harbour. If the
   envious man throw weeds over the garden wall, the gardener will not let
   them root there. If Satan cast in thoughts, cast them out again with
   indignation.

   3. Let not. worldly lusts be put in execution. If thou hast neglected
   the mortification and deadening of the affections, if sin hath got the
   start of thee, and gained a consent, yet at least restrain the
   practice: James i. 15, Lust, when it hath conceived, bringeth forth
   sin,' that is, an external sinful action; there are works of the
   flesh,' that follow the lusts of the flesh,' Gal. v. 19. It is good to
   stop at lust; though the lust grieveth the Spirit of God, yet the work,
   besides the grief, bringeth dishonour to God, giveth an ill example,
   bringeth scandal to religion, maketh way for a habit and further
   proneness to sin; therefore if thou hast not prevented the lust, act
   not the sin: Micah ii. 1, 2, Woe be to them that devise evil upon their
   beds, and when the morning is light, they practise it.' It is naught to
   harbour the motion, to plot and muse upon sin, but it is worse to
   practise it, for every act strengthens the inclination; as a brand that
   hath been once in the fire is more ready to burn again. If the devil
   have kindled a fire in thy bosom, let not the sparks fly abroad, but
   keep the temptation within doors, lest thou more betray thyself into
   Satan's hands.

   The third clause in this application of Enoch's prophecy is, that their
   mouth speaketh great swelling words. In Enoch's prophecy not only
   unholy deeds are noted, but hard speeches. These Gnostics were faulty
   both ways, both in word and deed; that which is charged here is a fault
   in their speech. It is said, Dan. xi. 36, The king shall speak
   marvellous things against the God of gods,' In the Septuagint the same
   phrase is used that is here, kai` o basileu`s upsothe'setai kai`
   megalunthe'setai epi` pa'nta theo`n, kai` lale'sei uperonka, and so
   possibly it may imply their blasphemies against God, a crime of which
   these wretches were guilty, in exalting Simon Magus above the true God.
   Or else these swelling words' may relate to their boasting of their own
   knowledge, from whence they were called Gnostics; and Tertullian saith
   of them, Omnes tument, omnes scientiam pollicentur; ipsae mulieres
   haereticae, quam sunt procaces!--they all swell with pride, and make
   ostentation of deeper knowledge; their very women, how conceited are
   they! Or else it may signify their proud censures of others, their
   scorning of the guides of the church, as it is said of some: Ps.
   lxxiii. 9, They speak loftily, they set their mouth against the
   heavens, their tongue walketh through the earth.' They took a liberty
   to speak of all things and persons at pleasure, without any restraint,
   which was and is the very genius of these and other seducers. Bather, I
   suppose, though not excluding the other senses, these swelling words
   relate to their phraseology and unsavoury gibberish which they used in
   representing their opinions. Peter calleth them swelling words of
   vanity,' 2 Peter ii. 18. The note hence is this:--

   Obs. 3. That the pride and vanity of seducers is usually bewrayed in
   the fondness and affectedness of their expressions. The affected
   language of the Gnostics and Valentinians may be seen in Irenaeus; and
   how much this pattern hath been improved by men of a fanatical spirit,
   may be found in those that have written of the heresies of succeeding
   ages. Jerome taxeth Jovinian with his swelling words. [160] In times
   more modern, Swinkfield was observed to be always talking of
   illumination, deification, &c.; and the familists' cant is not unknown,
   of being godded with God, and christed with Christ. So Jacob Behmen's
   greening of the inward root, &c.; and Calvin saith of the libertines of
   his time, communi sermone spreto, exoticum nescio quid idioma sibi
   fingunt, interea nihil spirituale afferunt, they pretend to matter more
   spiritual, and when all cometh to all, it is but noisome errors
   disguised, or common things represented in uncouth forms of speech,
   which the scriptures own not, rational and truly spiritual men
   understand not. The same unsavoury and unintelligible forms of speech
   may be observed in a wicked book lately put forth by a knight of this
   country, called The Retired Man's Meditations,' wherein the highest
   principles of our most holy faith are endeavoured to be undermined by
   this artifice of covert and affected speech; but that by the providence
   of God the book fell under neglect and scorn presently upon the
   publication. Now the reason of this affectation is, I suppose, to amuse
   the reader with the pretence of mystery and depths, Rev. ii. 24, that,
   despising the simplicity of the word, and the common and avowed
   principles, he may be the more pliable to their carnal fancies, which,
   if nakedly exposed at first, would have nothing of allurement and
   temptation in them to any well-disposed minds. Well, then, be not rapt
   into admiration with novel and conceited expressions, nor troubled with
   oppositions of science falsely so called,' 1 Tim. vi. 20. This is the
   devil's device, first to maze people, as birds are with a light and a
   bell in the night, and then to drive them into the net. If you would
   keep to wholesome doctrine, keep to a form of wholesome words, and do
   not place religion in conceited speaking; a holy dialect I know
   becometh saints, but an affected phraseology is one of Satan's lures,
   and a means to corrupt many.

   The fourth clause is, having men's persons in admiration because of
   advantage. Junius applieth this to those that set up angels, and
   unknown names and persons in the church, instead of Christ; but I think
   it is rather to be applied to men. Person is therefore put for the
   outward state and appearance, in which sense it is said, Thou shalt
   have no respect of persons in judgment,' that is, of their outward
   condition and estate. Accepting of persons, as Gen. xix. 21, is
   rendered in the Septuagint by thauma'zein to` pro'sopon, [161]
   wondering at a man's face or outside, as being overcome and dazzled at
   the splendour of it. Accordingly our apostle saith here, Having men's
   persons in admiration.' Now this they did for advantage,' that is,
   either to gain men to their party, by crying them up as holy and
   knowing, to the contempt of others who were more valuable for the
   sincerity of their religion; or else for worldly profit's sake, those
   whom they feared, or from whom they expected any worldly profit, as the
   rich and powerful, upon these would they fawn, and with these in a
   servile manner in sinuate themselves, commending their actions and
   magnifying their persons.

   Having been so long in the former part of the verse, I shall but
   mention the notes here,

   Obs. 4. None so fawning and base-spirited as the proud for their
   advantage: these spoke swelling words and yet basely crouched for
   profit's sake. Ambrose noteth it of a spirit of ambition: Ut dominetur
   aliis, prius servit; curvatur obsequio, ut honore donetur--none stoop
   so as they that have a mind to rise. One observed of our late prelates,
   [162] that they were willing to take Ham's curse upon them, to domineer
   in the tents of Shem, that is, would be servants of servants,' slaves
   to great men's servants, that they might lord it over God's heritage.
   Men of proud insulting spirits bow low for their own ends. As Absalom
   courteth the people to jostle his father out of the throne, 2 Sam. xv.
   2-5. And Tacitus observeth the like of Otho, that he did projicere
   oscula, adorare vulgus, et omnia serviliter pro imperio--adore the
   people, kiss the meanest, basely dispense his courtesy to the vilest,
   all to further his designs upon the empire. So Ammianus Marcellinus,
   lib. xxv., observeth the same of Julian, that out of affectation of
   popularity he delighted to converse with the meanest of the people.
   Certainly a proud spirit is no great spirit, no more than a swollen arm
   can be accounted big.

   Obs. 5. Having men's persons in admiration for advantage is a sin. We
   may admire the gifts of God in others so as to praise the giver, but
   not so as to be guilty of anthropolatry, or man-worship, 1 Cor. iii.
   21; not so as to despise others,' who have their usefulness, and it may
   be as excellent a gift in another kind, 1 Cor. xii. 7-11; not so as to
   promote our interests thereby, this is servile flattery, condemned in
   the text and Hosea vii. 8; not so as to be afraid to tell them their
   own, or for their fear or favour to wrest the truth of God: Matt. xxii.
   16, Thou teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any
   man, for thou regardest not the person of men.' Let all regard this,
   especially the ministers of Christ.

   Obs. 6. That seducers are apt to insinuate with great persons and men
   of power and interest, that having their ear and countenance, they may
   engage them against the truth. Having not truth of their side, they use
   the more craft; as the ivy, not being able to support itself, twineth
   about the oak till it sucketh out its heart. God's messengers carry it
   more openly, and with a single plainness; see 2 Cor. i. 12. Creepers
   and fawning parasites do but draw a suspicion upon themselves. Surely
   God's cause is able to stand upon its own legs, and needeth not the
   support of so base an artifice.

   Quest. But is it not lawful to use some prudence in this kind, and to
   insinuate with great men for the advantage of a good cause?

   Ans. To be over solicitous in this kind argueth distrust of God's
   providence, and draweth suspicion upon the way which we would needs
   maintain: that matter is not very combustible where men blow so hard.
   What favour cometh in the fair way of God's providence we may accept:
   All men seek the ruler's face, but every man's judgment is of the
   Lord;' and what may be gotten by honest, open, and lawful means, as by
   humble addresses, and the magnetic virtue of truth itself, and the
   holiness of them that maintain it, may be sought after. Thus the
   apostles dealt with the rulers and great ones, to gain their respect to
   Christianity, that they might with less prejudice in sinuate the truth
   to the people, Acts xviii. 8, and xix. 31. Some of the chief of Asia'
   were friends to Paul. But, now, when this respect is to be gotten by
   clancular and dishonest arts, and cannot be kept without flattering
   them in their sins, or compliance with their lusts and carnal designs,
   and men stretch their consciences, and make it their business to humour
   those that they may advance them, and trample upon all that may be
   called right and honesty to accomplish their ends, and magnify those
   whom they would have scorned if their station had not been so
   high,--this is to have men's persons in admiration for advantage.'

   Obs. 7. Usually men of a false way in religion admire those of their
   own party above others of known worth and integrity. This is one part
   of the sense. All of their own way they accounted Gnostics, that is,
   knowing persons; as if others, how much soever owned by God, as having
   the stamp and impress of gifts and graces upon them, were not to be
   compared with them. This is the genius of all sectaries: illic ipsum
   esse est promereri, saith Tertullian, it is religion enough to be one
   of them.

   Ver. 17. But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before
   of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   Having described these seducers, he exhorteth those to whom he wrote to
   beware of them, alleging the warning of the apostles, to show that not
   only Enoch, who might be supposed to speak of the wicked men of his own
   time, but the apostles, who expressly spake of the present age,
   foretold that scoffers and sons of Belial should arise in the church.

   There is nothing difficult in this verse, only a doubt is to be
   discussed. Doth not this passage yield an argument against the
   authority of this epistle? He speaketh of apostles,' and of words
   spoken before' by them, rhematon ton proeiremenon, as if he were of an
   inferior orb, and written long after their publication of the word. I
   answer--No. For (1.) Peter maketh mention of the epistles of Paul, yet
   it doth not weaken his authority, 2 Peter iii. 15, 16. (2.) In the
   place exactly parallel to this, 2 Peter iii. 2, 3, that apostle citeth
   other writings, yet avoweth his apostolical authority, Be mindful of
   the words spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandment of
   us, the apostles of Jesus Christ,' (3.) This term, before spoken of,
   only showeth that he wrote late, when either the apostles were dead, or
   their writings were common in the church.

   But why doth he quote the words of the apostles, neither urging his own
   authority, nor including himself, as Peter doth? I answer--(1.) Partly
   out of modesty, to point at the place whence he had taken these things,
   and to show that he was not ashamed to use and allege the writings of
   his fellow apostles. (2.) To declare their mutual consent: In the mouth
   of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.' (3.) His
   own authority is employed in vouching theirs, and before expressed,
   when he calleth himself the brother of James.'

   Notes from this verse are these:--

   Obs. 1. From that beloved; which compellation is used to note his
   affection in this writing: the like is used by Peter, 2 Peter iii. 1,
   Beloved, I thought meet,' &c. When we declaim against errors, we should
   do it out of love and a tender respect to the good of souls. In all
   contests we had need watch our own hearts. People suspect us to act out
   of peevishness and sinister affections, to serve a sect and party, and
   our engagement to be faction, not zeal; therefore, be the more careful
   that the flame be pure; incense must not be kindled with strange fire,
   nor zealous engagements arise from a carnal impulse.

   Obs. 2. Again, we may be earnest against error when corrupt men are
   gotten into esteem; but it is in love to you, if we express ourselves
   with some warmth and affection; it is for God, and your souls are
   concerned. It is observable, John, the disciple of love, is most
   earnest against deceivers: Bid them not God-speed,' saith he, 2 John
   7-10; and everywhere in his epistles, My little children, believe not
   every spirit,' &c.;' there are many antichrist--men that lie and have
   not the truth.' It is sad your ministers should be looked upon as
   enemies because they love you and warn you. But you will say it is out
   of perverseness, to serve their faction, and to cast an odium upon
   parties opposite to themselves. I answer--Charity thinketh no evil;' we
   should not interpret the worst; those that storm at a warning give a
   shrewd presumption of their own guilt. Usually persons that object thus
   are such as would have us tamely suffer the honour and interest of our
   Lord and Master Jesus Christ to be trampled under foot; but it is our
   heart's desire that tender consciences may know that it is not the
   shame of others, but their good, which we aim at.

   Obs. 3. From that remember. Seasonable remembrance of truths is a great
   help and relief to the soul: John ii. 22, When he was risen from the
   dead, the disciples remembered,' &c. In events it is good to remember
   prophecies; they confirm the soul, and support it against the present
   distress and temptation; both sins and discomforts arise from
   forgetfulness mostly and want of actual remembrance: Have ye
   forgotten?' Heb. xii. 5. But now, when the Spirit is ready with the
   remedy, as the flesh is with the temptations, it is a mighty support.
   In the debates between the carnal and spiritual part, seasonable
   thoughts carry it. I do not say bare thoughts do it, unless God be iu
   them; there may be gracious disallowing thoughts, and yet the flesh go
   away with the victory for all that; but this is the way by which the
   Spirit of God worketh by fresh and seasonable thoughts; he poiseth the
   heart, and inclineth it to the better side. Well, then, let your
   memories be as an ark or chest, in which the tables are kept. Lay up a
   good stock of knowledge, that you may have truths always fresh and
   present with you: they will be a help to prayer, Eph. vi. 17, 18, Take
   the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, praying always,'
   &c.; a check to temptations to sin, Ps. cxix. 9, I have hid thy word in
   my heart, that I might not sin against thee;' a support in afflictions,
   Heb. xii. 5; a remedy against error, John xiv. 26.

   Obs. 4. The next clause is the words spoken before. The prophecies of
   scripture evince the truth of it; things are there spoken long before
   they fall out; not only before the event, but before the causes or
   remote tendencies to such an event. Wise men may guess when they see
   probabilities, and foretell that which dependeth on natural causes; the
   devil can many times shrewdly interpret the predictions of the word;
   but a certain prescience of what is future, and merely in itself
   contingent, is the prerogative of God: Isa. xli. 22, Let them foretell
   things to come,' &c. This is done in the scripture. Cyrus is mentioned
   by name a hundred years before he was born, Isa. xlv. 1; the birth of
   Josiah three hundred years before it came to pass, 1 Kings xiii. 2; the
   building of Jericho five hundred years before it was re-edified, Josh.
   vi. 26, with 1 Kings xvi. 34; the great promise of Christ in paradise,
   accomplished four thousands of years afterwards. The people of the Jews
   were ever warned by prophecy of the good or bad that befell them;
   scripture was to them not only an authentic register, but an infallible
   prognostication. These two signal prophecies, of the rejection of the
   Jews, and the calling of the Gentiles, were they not abundantly
   foretold, and accordingly came to pass? Can there be any compact here?
   When the Jews were the keepers of the oracles of God, would they foist
   in prophecies against themselves? Well, then, venture upon the truth of
   the word more than you have done; God hath ever hitherto stood to his
   word rather than he would go back from it; he would not only cast off
   his ancient people, but sent his own Son to suffer a shameful and an
   accursed death. He that hath been faithful hitherto, is he like to fail
   at last?

   Obs. 5. I go on in the text,--of the apostles of our Lord Jesus. That
   the words of the apostles are the rule of faith. These were legati a
   latere, sent from the side of Christ; they had an extraordinary mission
   and call immediately from Christ, as Christ from the Father, John xvii.
   18, and xx. 21. They had extraordinary gifts, as infallibility, quoad
   hoc, as to the work of an apostle, the power of working miracles, &c.,
   and ordinary gifts in an extraordinary manner, as tongues, &c. They
   were to write scripture, and to consign a rule for the use of the
   church in all ages: This word of the kingdom must be preached till the
   end come,' Mat. xxiv. 14; and Christ prayed for no more than do believe
   through their word,' John xvii. 20; and to them he said, Mat. xxviii.
   20, I am with you to the end of the world.' No other doctrine can we
   expect till we come to study divinity in the Lamb's face.

   Obs. 6. Once more, these apostles of the Lord were Paul and Peter, 2
   Tim. iii. 1-4, 2 Peter iii. 2, 3; from whence Jude taketh many
   passages.

   It is not unlawful to make use of the writings of other men. Compare
   the 15th and 16th chapters of Isaiah with the 48th of Jeremiah,
   especially Isa. xvi. 8-11 with Jer. xlviii. 32-36, and you shall see
   how they agree almost word for word. The gifts and labours of others
   are for our use, not to feed laziness, but to exercise industry. In
   some cases, if we speak, iisdem poene literis et syllabis, as
   Melancthon wished divines would--in the same words--it is not a fault
   in controversies and positive truths; better make use of old words than
   coin new matter. Many now scoff at common truths, as if preachers did
   but talk like clocks, one after another. Doctrine cannot be varied: A
   good scribe,' indeed, must bring forth out of his treasury things both
   new and old,'--represent things in a fresh, savoury way; yet it is not
   altogether unlawful to make use of the words of others, where they are
   poignant and emphatical, not lazily to go on in the track, but as
   improving their conceptions.

   Obs. 7. Yet again, Jude, an apostle, quoteth apostles; Daniel, a
   prophet, read in the prophecies of Jeremiah, Dan. ix. 2; Peter was
   conversant in the epistles of Paul, 2 Peter iii. 16; Paul himself had a
   care of the parchments,' that is, as some suppose, the volumes and
   books of scripture, 2 Tim. iv. 13. Certainly the scripture is not only
   for novices and young beginners, but for the highest: a study becoming
   the most eminently gifted. There is a passage, Ps. cxix. 79, Let those
   that fear thy name turn unto me, and those that have known thy
   testimonies.' That turning to him, some understand of joining with him
   in friendship and familiarity, as certainly godly men, by a secret
   inclination, are moved to join one with another; others make the end of
   turning to him to behold in him a pattern and example of the Lord's
   grace; but the Chaldee paraphrase thus: Turn to my doctrine; those that
   know, let them come to know more. Well, then, do not rest in the light
   you have, and think that you are above these helps; you may be further
   instructed and established; if you had all knowledge, there are
   affections to be wrought upon; you may be quickened if not learn.
   Ministers, and those that abound in knowledge, may be stirred up by the
   admonitions and exhortations of others.

   Ver. 18. How that they told you that there should be mockers in the
   last time, walking after their own ungodly lusts.

   How that they told you. He meaneth not in word, but in writings. They
   told the church in general, but the apostle applieth it to them. Places
   are everywhere, 1 Tim. iv. 1, 2 Tim. iii. 1, Acts xx. 29, 30. In the
   last time. The days when the gospel was first preached are so called in
   a double sense--(1.) Either with respect to the approaching judgments
   on the Jews: 1 John ii. 18, Little children, now it is the last time.'
   The lease of their mercies was running out apace; so James telleth the
   carnal Jews, James v. 3, Ye have heaped up treasure for the last days.'
   When God was pulling down and plucking up, they were scraping and
   hoarding up wealth, and so became a greater prey to the destroyer. Or
   (2.) Because then the last dispensation began, which God would continue
   without change unto the world's end: Heb. i. 2, He hath in these last
   days spoken to us by his Son.' The Lord hath now fully revealed his
   mind, and the doctrine of salvation is put into a settled course, never
   more to be altered.

   But why do the scriptures speak so much of scoffers in the last time? I
   answer:--(1.) Either by way of aggravation, that there should be
   scoffers then, when God had sealed doctrine by the coming of his Son,
   beyond which godly men did not desire a greater confirmation; (2.) Or
   diakritikos, by way of distinction, more mockers in the last time
   rather than another, partly because the world was still continued,
   notwithstanding the threatenings of its destruction, 2 Peter iii. 4;
   partly because the holy people were then divided, Jews and Christians,
   and times of division prove times of atheism and scoffing; partly
   because carnal hopes of a temporal Messiah were disappointed, and by
   that means their assent was much weakened as to principles of faith.

   Mockers. Some think it implieth seducers, who, by deluding, do, as it
   were, make a mock of men. But I suppose it is rather taken properly for
   such as in the Old Testament are termed scorners,' Prov. ix., or
   scoffers.' When men slight that of which themselves or others have had
   a high esteem, they usually do it by scorning and scoffing, thereby the
   more to deface all feelings of conscience. If you inquire what they
   mocked at, I answer--In general, it seemeth to be the Lordship of
   Christ; in particular, the glorious exercise of it at the day of
   judgment: Where is the promise of his coming?' 2 Peter iii. 4. And
   therefore is Enoch's prophecy produced, which foretelleth the Lord's
   coming with ten thousands of his saints;' and Hieron. in Isa. lib. xiv.
   cap. 51, telleth us of a discourse between Peter and Simon Magus,
   against whose school and sect our apostle is supposed to write,
   concerning the destruction of the world. If God be good, saith Simon,
   why will he destroy that which is good? if the world be bad, how is God
   good that made it? &c.

   These scorners are said to walk after their own ungodly lusts. Walking
   implieth their settled course and daily custom of life; and their lusts
   are called ungodly lusts, partly to note the profane temper of their
   spirits, and partly to distinguish them from the motions and lustings
   of the new nature.

   The notes are these:--

   Obs. 1. What is told to the church in general, we must apprehend it as
   told to us. Paul telleth Timothy, and Peter telleth the distressed
   strangers, and Jude saith they told you. So Heb. xii. 5, The
   exhortation speaketh to you,' &c.; as if the Hebrews were the persons
   to whom the Proverbs were directly written. The scriptures speak to
   every age, every church, every person, no less than to those to whom
   they were first directed. Well, then, it showeth us how we should be
   affected in reading the word; we should read it as a letter written by
   the hand of God from heaven to us by name. If an angel should bring us
   a letter from heaven, certainly we would regard it. The Bible is a
   message sent from heaven to acquaint us with the mind of God; if we own
   the divine authority of it, why do we regard it no more?

   Obs. 2. We should not be troubled at what is foretold; monsters
   expected are not wondered at; expectation, as it deflowereth any good.
   thing that we expect, so it fore-armeth the mind against evil: John
   xvi. 4, These things I have told you, that when the time shall come ye
   may remember.' I have told you. Why? What good will that do? Ans. We
   are the better prepared to entertain evils when we expect them before
   they come, and the evil to which the mind is accustomed seemeth the
   less. Again, we have an experience of God's truth in the prediction,
   which will help us to believe and depend upon other promises. Finally,
   it assureth us that the Lord hath a hand and a counsel in all our
   troubles, for he told us of them before.

   Obs. 3. That the scriptures speak much of the evil of the latter times;
   there is more knowledge, and yet more sin and error. Knowledge, where
   it is not sanctified, puffeth up and maketh men curious, and so they
   have an itch after novelties; or else it maketh men wicked,
   exasperating our evil affections, and so, none so bad as they that sin
   against light; hence much of the error and profaneness in the latter
   clays. Again, the latter days are as the bottom and sink that receive
   the dregs of foregoing ages, and as the world groweth old it is much
   given to dreams and dotage. [163] Once more, much division there will
   be, and beating their fellow-servants,' Mat. xxiv. 49. Much
   libertinism; instead of casting off ceremonies, they will cast off
   ordinances, and desire to be freed not only from the Pope's laws, but
   the very law of Christ.

   Obs. 4. Among other sins that are found in the latter times, there will
   be many scoffers, partly because in times of controversy men will lose
   all awe--when truths are made questionable assent is weakened; partly
   because in times of liberty men will give vent to their thoughts;
   partly because the scandals of professing Christians will make many
   turn atheists; partly because fabulous conceits concerning the coming
   and temporal kingdom of Christ will make men question the whole
   doctrine of his coming. Well, then, wonder not if you find many
   scoffing at the authority of the scriptures, Godhead of Christ, day of
   judgment, the ordinances, fasting and prayer. The latter age will yield
   such kind of men; and it is one of the arts of Satan, by his
   instruments, to make things of the saddest and most serious concernment
   to seem ridiculous, that when once the awe of these blessed truths is
   weakened, men may be more easily induced to cast off both the
   concernment and profession of them.

   Obs. 5. Mockers and scoffers are usually the worst of sinners. In, the
   first psalm there are three degrees of sinners mentioned, and the
   highest rank are those that sit in, the seat of scorners,' Ps. i. 1.
   The Septuagint render there loimon, the chair of pestilences.' These
   are the pests of mankind. Scorning cometh from custom in sinning, and
   maketh way for freedom in sinning. When conscience is seared, and men
   have lost not only restraints of grace, but natural modesty, then they
   fall a-scoffing; and when once they are turned scoffers, nothing will
   reclaim them. Reproofs enrage them. Rebuke a scorner, and he will hate
   thee,' Prov. ix. 8; yea, none do the devil so much service in
   preventing others as they. If your feet have been taken in this snare
   of death, extricate yourselves betimes. Beg earnestly for the more
   grace; there is some hope; God inviteth scorners, Prov. i. 22.

   Obs. 6. Again observe, those that cast off the awe of the Lord's coming
   will certainly give up themselves to brutish lusts. Those mockers that
   said, Where is the promise of his coming?' are said here to walk after
   their own lusts.' Negantes enim poenam, negant et disciplinam, saith
   Tertullian (De Resurrect., cap. 11)--denying the resurrection of the
   flesh, they must needs be fleshly; for therefore they denied the day of
   his coming, to avoid the fear of his judgment.

   Obs. 7. It argueth a state of wickedness to walk after our own lusts;
   that is, when sin and lust is our constant practice. A godly person may
   too often do according to his lusts, but he does not walk therein, it
   is not his constant road and path: Ps. lxviii. 21, He will wound the
   head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such a one as goeth on
   still in his trespasses.' Such as go on still are there accounted
   enemies to God. But what is to walk in sin? Ans. To make lust our
   principle, our course, our end. Our principle: Whatever a wicked man
   goeth about, he doth it out of some carnal impulse. His good duties are
   either to hide a lust or feed a lust. If he abstain from one sin, it is
   to feed another. Again, when it is our way and course: carnal men
   follow earthly things with greater earnestness and delight, but
   heavenly things in a slight and overly manner. The world and the flesh
   is their e'rgon, their business, all their care and comfort is it; and
   this is their end, to please themselves and to satisfy their lusts.
   Well, then, walk in the Spirit, that you may not fulfil the lusts of
   the flesh.' See ver. 16.

   Ver. 19. Those be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the
   Spirit.

   Here the apostle cometh to inform them who these mockers were of whom
   the apostles of the Lord spake. He describeth them by three notes:--

   1. They separate themselves; (2.) Sensual; (3.) Not having the Spirit.

   1. These be they who separate themselves, hoi apodiorizontes eautou`s.
   The old English translation had it thus: These are the makers of
   sects.' The word signifieth those which determinate and pluck up the
   bounds which God hath set. The apostle meaneth those that, without any
   necessity and warrant from God, cut off themselves from the communion
   of the church.

   2. Sensual, psu'chikoi, animal or soul-men that have nothing but a
   reasonable soul, which, being corrupted, mindeth only the things of the
   flesh, and so noteth fleshly corrupt men. Tertullian, when leavened
   with Montanism, called the orthodox psychicoi, because they did not,
   with Montanus, condemn second marriages. The word is notable. It will
   be some advantage to us to consider it a little more fully. It is three
   times used in scripture, as in 1 Cor. ii. 14, the natural man,'
   psu'chikos, who is opposed to pneuma'tikos, the spiritual man.' So in
   James iii. 15, The wisdom that is from above is earthly, sensual,
   psu'chike`, devilish;' and then in this place, the word, as I said
   before, properly signifieth those that have a soul, and psu'che is
   elsewhere used for the sensitive soul; as where the apostle
   distinguished of body, soul, and spirit,' 1 Thes. v. 23, soma, psuche`,
   pneuma, where, by pneuma, spirit, he understandeth the intellectual or
   rational part; by psuche, soul, the mere animal or sensitive part, or
   that sensual appetite which we have in common with the beasts; by soma,
   body, that which is commonly understood by it, the body, as it is the
   organ and instrument of the soul; and this is one reason why psu'chikoi
   cometh to signify sensual; the other is because man, being left to
   himself, to mere soul-light or soul-inclinations, can bring forth no
   other fruits than such as are carnal; for whilst men are destitute of
   sanctifying grace, sense and the flesh do reign in their full liberty
   and power. Well, then, these seducers were sensual, given up to brutish
   lusts and practices. They taxed others as carnal, and now none so
   libidinous, impure, and carnal as they.

   3. Not having the Spirit. This is added not only to show that they were
   destitute of true grace and regeneration, but partly to rebuke their
   vain pretences. The Gnostics and other filthy seducers of that time did
   arrogate to themselves a singularity and peculiarity of the Spirit, as
   if all others were carnal, and they only had the Spirit; whereas indeed
   the contrary was true, they, giving up themselves to such filthy
   practices, showed that they had nothing of the Spirit in them; see
   Irenaeus, lib. i. cap. 9, sect. 6, 7; partly to show the
   incompatibleness of the Spirit with a fleshly and carnal life.

   Notes from hence are these:--

   Obs. 1. That separation or dividing ourselves from the fellowship of
   God's church is sinful, or a work of the flesh. The apostle describeth
   carnal persons, and of them he saith, They separate themselves;' and
   accordingly the apostle reckoneth di'chostasi'as, ai'reseis seditions,
   heresies,' or sect-makings in the church, among the works of the flesh,
   Gal. v. 20. And with good reason; to leave the church is to leave God.
   Cain was the first separatist we read of, Gen. iv. 19, He went out from
   the presence of the Lord.' God is everywhere; how from his presence?
   The meaning is, from the church, where is the presence of his grace.
   Why should we run from the shepherds' tents where Christ feedeth at
   noon? Cant. i. 9, 10. And as it is contrary to our love to God, so to
   our love to the saints, to which we are so solemnly engaged. The
   question of separation lieth much in the dark, but obligations to love
   are clear and open; see Eph. iv. 4-6. It is sad that many that pretend
   much to religion make no conscience of schism, and offending the
   brethren by withdrawing from them, as if Christ's precepts of love were
   not to be stood upon, as certainly they are not by them who draw their
   liberty to the highest, and in indifferent matters take that course
   which will offend.

   Obs. 2. Once more, it is little for the honour of Christ that his body
   is crumbled into small bits and portions. He prayed, Let them be one,
   that the world may know that thou hast sent me,' implying that our
   divisions and breaking into sects would breed suspicion of the gospel
   in the hearts of men, as if that great mystery of redemption by him
   were but a well-devised fable. Yet again, this running into parties and
   sects is our great hindrance and disadvantage; partly in spiritual
   things, for all duties of spiritual commerce and communion are forborn.
   It is said here, These separate themselves,' but, beloved, do ye edify
   one another in your holy faith;' implying that though others withdraw
   and omit all duty in this kind, those that continue in the body will
   contribute their mutual help and care to confirm and build up one
   another. A draft of wine is best preserved in the hogshead, and
   Christians in their societies; coals lying together keep in the heat;
   apostasy began in forsaking the assemblies, Heb. x. 23-25, and 1 John
   ii. 19. Partly as to our outward peace and welfare: separation sets
   others against us, and us against them; it exulcerateth men's minds
   against you when you give out as if you were more pure and holy than
   others: Isa. lxv. 5, Stand by thyself; come not near me, for I am
   holier than thou.' Gracious singularity is many times envied and hated,
   but certainly peevish singularity draweth a just scorn upon itself. And
   it setteth you against others; men seldom separate but their hearts are
   much estranged from those from whom they separate; for religious ties,
   being once broken, are hardly made up again. Civil ruptures are not
   carried on with such vehemency, and are sooner closed again; but
   religion, being the highest bond and ligament, when it is once
   violated, the breach is the more irreconcileable.

   Thus you see the evils of schism or separation; but because this is
   many times perversely charged, we must look a little more into the
   nature of it: the spouse had her veil rent, and God's own people have
   been burdened with the imputation of schism and faction. It will
   concern us to state what separation is sinful. In general, such as
   dissolveth that union and love which should be among Christians, or an
   unnecessary, unjust, or rash departure from fellowship and communion
   with one another in the ordinances of Christ. This separation--

   1. Supposeth that there was once a union. We cannot be said to separate
   from the world of infidels, as Pagans, Turks, Jews, with whom we were
   never united; as water, when the ice is dissolved, cannot be said to be
   separated, in the sense we now take it, from bodies heterogeneal, as
   straws, wood, &c., because never united with them but by accident;
   aggregation there is, but not properly a separation. Separation is a
   dissolution of union, as when one church separateth from another who
   are united in the same body as parts of the church universal, or one or
   more persons from the same particular congregations of which they are
   members. I only add to this proposition, that this union is to be
   understood not only of what it is, de facto, but what ought to be, de
   jure. Thus persons that ought to join themselves, but out of
   schismatical principles do not, nor never did, join themselves to the
   churches of Christ, may be guilty of this sinful separation, because
   there is a union required.

   2. The fault and crime of the schism is not always in those that do
   actually separate and withdraw, but in those that cause it. A man
   threateneth death to his wife, hereupon she separateth; not she. but he
   maketh the separation. Borne obstinately continuing her corruptions,
   and threatening death to those that warn her, the cause of separation
   is in Rome, not in us. Strings in tune must not be brought down to
   strings out of tune, but the other set up to them: Go not thou to them
   (saith God to the prophet), but let them return to thee.'

   3. Though those that separate be the fewer, yet that nothing varieth
   the case. Noah and eight persons went into the ark, and left the world
   in infidelity; Lot got out of Sodom with one family; Elijah was left
   alone to contest with Baal's priests. Not the greater, but the better
   part is to be regarded. Jacob's family was fewer than the Canaanites,
   and Israel less than the rest of the world. God's witnesses at the
   first may be but a very handful.

   4. A separation from corruptions, and a separation from those that are
   corrupt, are two distinct things. A separation from corruptions is
   always enjoined, but not always from those that are corrupted. Those
   scriptures, Isa. liii. 11, and 2 Cor. vi. 17, speak of a fellowship
   with men in evil works; but now a separation from men that are corrupt
   is sometimes lawful: Rev. xviii. 4, Come out of her, my people,' &c.;
   and Jer. li. 9, She would not be healed,' &c. We may separate from such
   as separate from Christ, and continue obstinate in their corruptions.
   And sometimes it is not lawful, as when a church is reforming and
   purging out these corruptions, or they are not of such moment as that
   such a desperate remedy should be used. A limb is not to be cut off as
   soon as it acheth, but when it is rotten and likely to endanger the
   whole body; when evils are incurable, deadly, and contagious, and we
   can no longer maintain communion without sin. At first it is good to
   try all things.

   5. There are several sorts of separation, as these distinctions will
   manifest. Separation is either partial or total, negative or positive,
   universal or particular.

   For the first distinction, there is a partial separation, when we with
   draw from the communion of the church in some ordinances and not in
   others, as in the supper, but not in praying and hearing of the word.

   The second distinction beareth thus:--There is a negative separation,
   as when men do not hold communion with some church, but yet do not join
   elsewhere, but continue waiting for the amendment of that church.
   Positive separation is when they embody in another church way, setting
   up altar against altar, and threshold against threshold.

   The third distinction is to be understood thus:--There is a particular
   separation, whereby men renounce communion with the churches of such a
   kind and constitution, catholic or universal separation, by which men
   disclaim all churches extant in the world, as Seekers, and many loose
   and vagrant persons that are as yet to choose religion, or look for new
   messengers from heaven to resolve the questions that are now on foot.

   Now the more unjust the ground is, the more aggravated is the sin by
   the degrees of it. If our separation be total and positive, and to deny
   all churches, of what constitution soever, argueth a high degree of
   pride and schism.

   6. Faulty separation is that which is rash, sinful, and unjust; rash,
   without any real cause, merely for our better accommodation, or when we
   require that of the church which the scripture doth not require;
   unjust, without any sufficient cause, occasioning so many scandals and
   contentions for a trifle, and aggravating every discontent and
   dissatisfaction to the highest; sinful I call it, when the grounds are
   as carnal as the practice, as revenge, personal discontent--as many in
   the primitive times went over to the sects in stomach and discontent:
   so Tertullian is reported by some to do to the Montanists--or else
   corrupt aims to be in the head of a train or troop, Acts xx. 28. It is
   easy to abuse the innocent credulity of the people, and therefore some
   wicked spirits make it their work to draw disciples after them;' or it
   may be carnal fear of the severity of discipline or the censures of the
   church, or out of love of gain, 2 Tim. iv. 10, or affectation of
   novelty, or a higher way than ordinary Christians, or out of faction;
   in Corinth, some of Paul, some of Apollos, some of Cephas,' 1 Cor. iii.
   22.

   7. The only lawful grounds of separation are three:--(1.) Intolerable
   persecution; (2.) Damnable heresy; (3.) Gross idolatry.

   (1.) Intolerable persecution. [164] When we are thrust out, Christ
   biddeth us to flee into another city. (2.) Damnable heresy. We cannot
   bid them God-speed, lest we be partakers of their evil deeds, 2 John
   11. (3.) Gross idolatry, when we cannot communicate in their worship
   without sin.

   8. The scandals of professors are ground of mourning, but not ground of
   separation, 1 Cor. v. 2. Church guides must do their office, discern
   between the precious and the vile, that the hearts of the righteous be
   not made sad; yet if not, you have no ground to separate, be cause God
   may own them for a church though they have many scandals among them; as
   in Corinth there was incest, heresy, profaneness, many that never had
   repented,' 2 Cor. xii. 21; yet to the saints at Corinth.' We may
   communicate with a church without sin when we have done our duty, that
   is, informed, warned, mourned. If the word and ordinances be kept pure
   for substance, though the persons be corrupt, you may communicate
   without sin. The Pharisees held the degree of doctors and expositors of
   the law, and so far were to be owned, though guilty of much personal
   wickedness, Mat. xxiii. 2, 3. The prophets lived in corrupt times, yet
   did they not separate from the assemblies of the church. Usually
   laziness is the ground of separation; they are loath to discharge their
   duty, to take pains, to convince, exhort, and warn their fellow
   members, or to call upon their pastors to take heed to their ministry;'
   and some pastors are loath to be at the labour to gain a rugged people
   to the obedience of the gospel, to use that frequent admonition and
   those serious ad dresses which are necessary for such a purpose, and to
   expose themselves to encounter those exasperations which the discharge
   of their duty will necessarily draw upon them, and therefore run into
   separate assemblies, where all things may be carried on more easily.

   9. Lawful separation must not be sudden, till all due courses be tried:
   1 Cor. xiii. 7, Love beareth all things, endureth all things, hopeth
   all things.' Certainly we should do much, endure much, ere we go off
   from the communion of any church. It must be with grief. When
   physicians cut off an arm or leg, they do not delight in it, but are
   driven to it of necessity. So when a judge condemneth a malefactor, he
   delighteth not in the punishment; in a civil war, though the cause be
   just, yet to delight in the executions that are done upon the enemy is
   not without sin: 1 Cor. xiii. 5, Charity rejoiceth not in evil, but
   rejoiceth in the truth.' Again, it must be with a mind to return when
   the evil is taken away. [165]

   10. For the degrees of separation take these rules:--If a few separated
   for a weighty cause, they should only withdraw, tarrying for the
   reformation of the church; but numerous bodies may go on to positive
   separation, for they ought not to be without ordinances, but boldly to
   profess the right way. Again, as long as a lower degree of separation
   will serve the turn, we should not go to a higher; it is a great
   weakening to the interest of Christ when we presently draw things to an
   extremity. In smaller differences we must observe the apostle's rule,
   Phil. iii. 16. But enough of this matter.

   Obs. 2. The next point is taken from the second sin mentioned in this
   verse, sensual. He chargeth it upon those that separate themselves.
   Those that separate from the assemblies of the faithful are usually
   sensual. Discipline is too strait for them that would live according to
   their own lusts. The raven that was sent out of the ark, finding
   carrion floating abroad, had no mind to be cooped up there, and
   therefore returned not; so these, finding more liberty abroad than in
   the congregations of the faithful, separate and inhaunt with such among
   whom they may have room for their lusts. Moreover, they lose the
   benefit of those that should watch over them; church communion is a
   good preservative against lusts: Woe to him that is alone,' Eccles. iv.
   10. Stragglers are more easily surprised; they were scattered and
   became meat to the beasts of the field, Ezek. xxxiv. 5, 6. They that
   separate are the more easily perverted both in judgment and practice;
   they turn familists; now familism is but painted atheism; or
   antinomists, and antinomism is but sin licensed and privileged. Again,
   it is just with God to punish that pride wherewith separation is
   accompanied with brutish lusts. Usually unsanctified knowledge runneth
   into pride, and then the affections are not governed. Well, then, ob
   serve the providence of God in setting a mark upon those that separate;
   they are men of unbridled affections, and without yoke, and are usually
   given up to carnal pleasures; and wonder not if sensual persons cast
   off communion with the church, when they cast off communion with God
   himself; those that spent their days in mirth said unto God depart from
   us,' Job xxi. 14. Many now that are come to the height of pride and sin
   pretend to live to the height of the creature.

   Obs. 3. The next note is, that sensual persons are evil persons. There
   are three ranks of sinners--those that are given to fleshly lusts, and
   they are the sensual; those that are given to the lusts of the eyes,
   and they are the worldly; those that are given to pride of life, and
   those are the proud, the great spirits of the world.' See 1 John ii.
   16, and James iii. 15, with my comment there. Our work now lieth with
   the sensual, who seem to be the worst sort of sinners, and altogether
   unfit for any worthy action and exploit. To find them out, let us
   consider what sensuality is. It is an inordinate desire and delight in
   soft and delicate living; there is a due care of the body to keep it
   serviceable, and an allowed delight in the creature. He that created
   water created wine, creatures for our delight as well as our necessity,
   and false teachers have often set off themselves with the show of a
   severer abstinence: Col. ii. 21. It is possible that, by an undue
   rigour, the body may be used a little too hardly and disabled for
   better services, but yet we are more usually guilty of the excess than
   of the defect; pleasure is born and bred with us, and therefore hath a
   mighty force and enchantment upon the soul. The first years of human
   life are merely governed by sense, and for a great while all our
   business is to live and grow, and therefore most men miscarry by
   appetite and an undue liberty in meats, drinks, and sports. Now, to
   state the due bounds and limits which reason and religion hath set is
   very hard; different tempers and constitutions of body make rules
   uncertain. In the general, it is good to watch, lest pleasure become a
   master, and reason a slave. The two general limits are:--(1.) The
   health of the body; (2.) The welfare of the soul.

   1. The health of the body must be regarded. Too much care for the body
   destroyeth it, as too much oil puts out the lamp: Wine and women take
   away the heart,' Hosea iv. 11; that is, the generousness and
   sprightliness of a man. The vigour of nature is abated, gallant and
   active spirits effeminated, and brave hopes drowned and quenched in the
   puddle of excess, and masculine agility and vivacity melted away in
   ease and pleasure. The Romans were wont to have their funerals at the
   gates of Venus' temple.

   2. The soul's welfare is of chief consideration. We must take heed that
   the soul be not either disfitted for duty or disposed for sin.

   [1.] Disfitted for duty; when the soul cannot lift up itself to God and
   divine things, and findeth less aptitude for his service, you are
   inordinate: Luke xxi. 34, Let not your hearts be over-charged with
   surfeiting and drunkenness,' fec. The heart may be overcharged when the
   stomach is not. When we are warned of surfeiting and drunkenness, we
   think of vomiting, staggering, reeling, faltering in speech or gait. O
   Christians! you are guilty of it when the heart is over charged, and
   driveth on heavily in holy things. When we are warned of adultery, we
   think only of defiling other men's wives, or scattering our lusts
   promiscuously, as the beasts do; but alas! we are guilty of it when the
   inordinate use of a lawful wife doth quench our vigour and alacrity in
   our heavenly calling; si vinum ex apotheca tua, &c.--a man may drink
   too freely of his hogshead.

   [2.] We must take care that the soul be not more disposed to sin.
   Divers lusts and pleasures' are fitly joined by the apostle, Titus iii.
   3. If we do not watch over pleasures, the heart groweth more wanton and
   libidinous, the restraints of grace are weaker, and carnal motions more
   urgent and violent; the heart is nourished,' &c., James v. 5, the enemy
   put in strength and heart, 1 Peter ii. 11.

   Well, then, let us beware of sensuality; other things defile a part, as
   covetousness the soul, but sensual lusts defile the soul and body too;
   they leave guilt upon the soul and dishonour upon the body, while it is
   made a strainer for meats and drink, and a channel for lusts to run in.
   Other lusts seem to gratify the ambition of man and to exalt him, but
   these debase him, and turn him out among the beasts. To renounce
   pleasures is the first thing you must do if you mean to do anything in
   religion, otherwise you lie open to every temptation. The water of the
   sanctuary could not heal the miry places, Ezek. xlvii. 11; which is
   usually applied to sensual hearts. Pleasures bring a brawn and a
   deadness upon the conscience, and a cloud upon the understanding.
   Daniel, that had the high visions of God, lived by pulse. John the
   Baptist, that had the most eminent gospel dispensation, Mat. xi., fed
   upon locusts and wild honey. Among the heathens he was counted the most
   accomplished man that spent more oil in the lamp than wine in the
   bottle. [166] Certainly the baser a man is the more he affects carnal
   delights: Eccles. vii. 4, The heart of a fool is in the house of
   mirth.' That which wise men prefer is better than that which fools make
   choice of. Pleasures are the choice of fools; wise men know them to be
   baits and snares, that, if they be not watched, they soon put us out of
   frame, and unfit us for communion with God, Eccles. ii. 2. Once more,
   this sort of sins enslaveth, and by custom gaineth upon the heart more
   than others do, and bringeth us under a power which we cannot easily
   break, 1 Cor. vi. 12. Therefore use pleasures with care and caution,
   that when we take them they may not take us. God's people, I suppose,
   are not so easily tempted to adultery and drunkenness, but beware of
   gluttony; [167] the throat is a slippery place, and instead of
   supplying nature we feed lust. Be not too much in the use of carnal
   delights, lest you suffer this distemper of spirit to take root. Dives
   fared deliciously every day. There are times of abstinence, as well as
   liberal enjoyment in the creature. When our lives are but a diversion
   from one pleasure to another, nature groweth wanton and unsatisfied,
   and men live as if they were born to eat, drink, play, sport, and
   sleep, Luke xvii. 27. Lastly, take heed of soliciting lusts when you
   should quench them, Rom. xiii. 14.

   Obs. 4. The next thing that we may observe is, that sensual persons
   have not the Spirit. These two are contrary, flesh and spirit,' Gal. v.
   17; and they that cherish the one do necessarily banish the other, and
   as they enlarge the one they straiten the other. The Spirit is a free
   spirit, and sensual persons are very slaves; the Spirit is a pure
   spirit, and they are unclean; the Spirit is active, and they are gross
   and muddy, of a dull and and stupid nature; the Spirit worketh
   intellectual and chaste delights, and they are altogether for base and
   dreggy pleasures: such a perfect contrariety is there between them.
   More distinctly take it thus:--

   1. Sensual men have little of the enlightening of the Spirit; their
   palate is better than their understanding: Eph. v. 18, Be not drunken
   with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled with the Spirit;' where the
   fumes of wine and the motions of the Spirit are compared as things
   incompatible. In marshy countries we do not expect a clear air; so
   sensual persons have seldom any clear and raised thoughts of God: men
   given to pleasures can taste meats and drinks, but not doctrines.

   2. Sensual men have little of the quickenings and efficacy of the
   Spirit; the more they dissolve and melt away their precious hours and
   spirits in pleasures, the more do they grow sapless, dead, and
   careless, and lose all tenderness of conscience and liveliness of
   affection: they quench the vigour of nature, much more do they quench
   the Spirit; voluptuaries are said to be past feeling,' Eph. iv. 19.

   3. They have little of the comforts of the Spirit. The comforts of the
   Spirit arise from meditating on the works of God, Ps. civ. 34; or
   tasting his love, 1 Peter ii. 3; or contemplating our great hopes, 2
   Cor. iv. 18. Now carnal men can relish none of this; they cannot
   exercise love, or faith, or hope, that they may delight themselves in
   God, and have some lively tastes of eternal life. When the soul lieth
   under the dominion of carnal and dreggy pleasures, it is incapable of
   thinking upon God and his works, or relishing inward consolation; love
   is preoccupied.

   Well, then, we should the more take heed that we be not sensual. Never
   had any sensual person any great measure and portion of the Holy Ghost
   in gifts or graces. The devil easily entereth into swine, but the Holy
   Spirit of God will not dwell there. A man is put to his choice which he
   will have--pleasures or the Spirit. It will be sad for you, if you love
   pleasures more than God,' 2 Tim. iii. 4, and prefer these dreggy
   delights before those masculine joys which will accrue to you by
   communion with God. If we were altogether to renounce delight, it would
   be more irksome. No; you are only called to exchange it. Which will you
   choose, then? to live at large and wallow in carnal contentments, or be
   employed in the serious and grave exercises of religion? Surely, one
   moment's communion with God is better than all the mirth we can get by
   the pastime of an age.

   Ver. 20. But ye, beloved, build up yourselves in your most holy faith,
   praying in the Holy Ghost.

   Here the apostle cometh to exhort; as all along, with the description
   of seducers, he intermingleth exhortation. The sum of the exhortation
   is to quicken them to the use of the means of perseverance and
   constancy. Build up yourselves, epoikodomountes; the word signifieth
   the going on with a building already begun, and fitly noteth that care
   they should take for the growth of their spiritual estate. Yourselves,
   heautous; some translate invicem, build up one another; that I confess
   is the apostle's intent, but first to press them to a care of their own
   salvation, and then mutually to care for one another: see 1 Thes. v.
   11, Comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, as ye also do;'
   and possibly this is spoken here by way of opposition to those that
   separate themselves. In your most holy faith. By faith may be meant
   either the grace of faith or the doctrine of faith. I rather suppose
   the latter, that true and pure religion which they had learned from the
   apostles, which was the foundation already laid, unto which they should
   keep close. If it be meant of faith, the grace, then he persuadeth them
   to progress, and to lay hold on the superstructure of good works and
   final perseverance, Mat. vii. 24. This faith is called most holy, in
   opposition to the profane mysteries of the Gnostics and Valentinians.
   It is a holy rule, and maketh us holy: John xvii. 17, Sanctify them by
   thy truth, thy word is truth.' Praying in the Holy Ghost, en pneu'mati
   agi'o, may be rendered, in, with, or by the Holy Ghost; that is, by his
   motion and inspiration, and gifts and graces received from him.
   Elsewhere the Holy Ghost is said to pray in us, Rom. viii. 26; and here
   we pray in the Holy Ghost. He prayeth in us so as we pray in him; he
   prayeth in us, to note the excitations of his grace; we pray in him, to
   imply the concurrence of our faculties; which is to be noted against
   the familists, who make the Spirit to be the immediate formal cause of
   all our actions, as if in the productions of grace the Spirit did only
   make use of us as Bilhah did of Rachel, to bring forth upon her knees,'
   Gen. xxx. 3, and the action were wholly his own.

   The notes are these:--

   Obs. 1. It is not sufficient to be established or grounded in the
   faith, but we must daily increase and grow more and more therein. When
   the foundation is laid, the building must go on piece by piece; they
   that are contented with a little faith have no faith; graces though
   imperfect are always growing, Luke xvii. 5. It is the holy ambition of
   Christians to be more like God every day; certainly their temper is
   contrary to the temper of God's people, that think they have learned
   enough, know enough, are holy enough; none are so knowing but they may
   know more, so established but they may be more. Here we are in a state
   of progress, not of rest and perfection; the corn in the field groweth,
   though in the barn it doth not, Eph. iv. 12, 13, Phil, iii. 13. A
   Christian is always reaching forth and pressing onward, and the nearer
   he cometh to heaven his motions and tendencies are the more earnest, as
   a stone moveth faster the nearer it cometh to the centre; the more he
   enjoyeth, still he hath new motives to seek more: Prov. i. 5, A wise
   man will hear and will increase learning;' a good man would go to
   heaven as fast as he can, not make a hard shift, but enter abundantly,'
   2 Peter i. 11.

   Obs. 2. To grow in faith is a means to persevere in faith. Man is of an
   active nature; either he groweth better or worse. We shall not keep
   what we have received if we do not labour to increase in it, as a house
   begun to be built goeth to decay, and droppeth down more and more, if
   we do not go on to finish it. Do we grow, then, or decline? Did we
   observe our first coolings, the mischief would not be so great; but we,
   like the hen, as long as there is one egg in the nest, observe not how
   many are taken away; as long as we have any tolerable affections to the
   things of God, or somewhat to keep us alive, we do not consider how
   many degrees of grace we have lost.

   Obs. 3. Faith--take it for the grace--is the proper foundation of
   holiness and good works. Works without faith are but a roof without a
   foundation, and faith without works is a foundation without a building;
   good fruit supposeth a good tree, Mat. vii.

   Obs. 4. The faith of Christians is a most holy' faith; no doctrine hath
   such pure precepts, such high examples, such raised motives, such
   mysterious enforcements, such blessed rewards, and all to encourage
   holiness. If ever anything were exactly fitted to its purpose, surely
   the word is fitted to promote holiness. The precepts of the law require
   it; the doctrine of the gospel showeth where virtue and power is to be
   had to perform it; the promises encourage it; the examples of God and
   Christ show the height and exactness of it; the examples of the saints
   show it is possible; the word and ordinances work it, as being
   instituted by God for such a purpose, and accompanied with the power of
   his grace, Eph. v. 26. God hath reserved this honour of sanctifying the
   heart to the doctrine of the scriptures, to evidence their divine
   original: James i. 18, He hath begotten us to himself by the word of
   truth.' This great change which is wrought in the heart of man is by
   the word. A moral lecture may a little fashion the outward man, and
   reduce him to a civil course, as Xenocrates' moral lecture made Polemo
   leave his vicious and sensual course of life; but regeneration is only
   found in the school of Christ. Well, then, if you will know the best
   religion, observe where there is most holiness discovered and wrought,
   Ps. xix. 7-9, John xvii. 17. In the word of God you have the copy of
   his holiness; there is somewhat of good life and moral behaviour among
   heathens, but nothing of regeneration and genuine holiness. Once more,
   an impure life will not suit with a holy faith; you dishonour God and
   disparage your religion when you walk as heathens. This holy faith is
   best kept in a pure conscience,' 1 Tim. iii. 9.

   Obs. 5. From that building up yourselves. In building up, that is, in
   growth and perseverance, there is a. concurrence of our own endeavours;
   we are living stones,' 1 Peter ii. 4, after we are converted, and are
   not altogether dead and passive, as in conversion. After we have
   received Christ' we may walk with him,' Col. ii. 6. Motion and
   operation followeth life: he that made thee without thee will not save
   thee without thee.

   Obs. 6. From the other interpretation of the word yourselves--that is,
   one another--observe, that mutual conference is a means of
   perseverance. Solomon saith, Eccles. iv. 10, When two lie together they
   have heat.' Surely good company preserveth and keepeth up our warmth
   and vigour, as a remedy against apostasy. Spiritual communion and
   conference is often pressed; see Heb. iii. 13, and x. 24, 25. When
   God's people did oftener meet and confer together, there was more life
   in them.

   Obs. 7. Next to conference, prayer is required. Note thence, that
   prayer is a means of establishment. We are kept by God's power, and
   God's power is set a-work by prayer; this is the breath that keepeth in
   the fire. Men that neglect prayer find sensible decays. When they
   suspected some distemper upon Job's spirit, they charge him with the
   neglect of prayer: Job xv. 4, Surely thou restrainest prayer.' No
   wonder if men grow unsavoury, worldly, voluptuous, when they let days
   go, and weeks go, and God never heareth from them.

   Obs. 8. Then we pray aright when we pray in the Holy Ghost;' this
   concurrence is necessary, both with respect to acceptance and
   assistance.

   1. With respect to acceptance. God will own nothing in prayer but what
   cometh from his Spirit; any other voice is strange and barbarous to
   him: Rom. viii. 27, He knoweth the mind of the Spirit, because he
   maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.' The
   Lord delighteth not in the flaunting of pates and the unsavoury belches
   and eructations of a human spirit; the tuneable cadency of words is but
   an empty ring in God's ears. The psalmist saith, Ps. cxli. 2, Let my
   prayer be set forth before thee as incense.' Now the censers were to be
   kindled with holy fire before the smoke went up; the coal wherewith we
   are kindled must be taken from the altar, not from a common hearth, and
   then our prayer goeth up as incense: God's course is to prepare the
   heart,' and then to grant the request: Ps. x. 17, Thou wilt prepare
   their hearts, and cause thine ear to hear.' Surely God's ear will be
   opened if our hearts be opened; when he himself sets us a-work we need
   not doubt of audience. Fire from heaven to consume the sacrifice was
   the solemn token of acceptance heretofore; fire from heaven is the
   token still, even a holy ardour wrought in us by the Spirit.

   2. In point of assistance. Prayer is a work too hard for us; we can
   babble of ourselves, but we cannot pray without the Holy Ghost; we can
   put words into prayer, but it is the Spirit puts affections, without
   which it is but a little cold prattle and spiritless talk. Our
   necessities may sharpen our prayers, but they cannot enliven our
   prayers. A carnal man may feel the impulsions of a natural fervency,
   and so cry unto God as the young ravens cry unto him, and in all
   creatures there is a desire of relief: the rude mariners in the tempest
   were very earnest, Jonah i. 6. But now gracious affection is quite
   another thing than this natural fervency. There may be cold and raw
   wishes after grace, but not serious volitions and spiritual desires;
   these we must have from the Holy Ghost. Surely if we did consider what
   prayer is we should see the need of this assistance. It is a work which
   will cost us travail of heart, Acts i, 14, proskarterountes en te
   proseu'che, and James v. 16, dee'sis energoume'ne. It is expressed by
   striving.' Rom. xv. 30, Strive with me in prayers,' and Col. iv. 12,
   Labouring for you fervently in prayers,' &c., agonizo'menos. It is a
   striving with God himself, and then there is no setting upon God but by
   his own strength. This was figured in Jacob's wrestling, Gen. xxxii.
   25, to the end; which is explained Hosea xii. 4, Yea, he had power over
   the angel, and prevailed; yea, he wept and made supplication.' The
   party that Jacob wrestled with is called a man, an angel, and God; a
   man, for the shape and form assumed; an angel, to note the second
   person, who is the messenger of the covenant; and God, Gen. xxxii. 30.
   It was such an angel as blessed him, which is proper to God. Now in the
   assumed body Jacob wrestled with him, which was symbolical; the prophet
   referreth it to his prayers. But how is it said he could not prevail
   against Jacob? With a blast of his mouth he might have confounded him,
   and it had been as easy for him to maim and destroy every joint as to
   make him halt and lame of one thigh. I answer--He could not because he
   would not; he gave out but such a measure of strength to the body
   assumed, and the Lord did wrestle both in and against Jacob, in Jacobo,
   Deus est seipso fortior--he wrestleth against us with his left hand,
   and strengtheneth us with his right, so that God's power prevaileth
   over himself. All this is spoken to show what need we have of a divine
   power when we strive with God.

   But now what is it to pray in the Holy Ghost? I shall answer it in a
   word. The Spirit helpeth us in prayer in a way of gifts or graces. In a
   way of gifts, that the heart may riot be bound up, and that we may have
   necessary words to give vent to affections. Adam maimed us both as to
   gifts as well as graces; and therefore, that our supplies in Christ may
   be answerable, the Spirit bestoweth upon us the gift of prayer, that we
   may enlarge ourselves to God on all occasions. This gift was either
   extraordinary and proper to the first times of the gospel, when they
   were able of a. sudden to dictate a prayer in a strange language which
   they had never learned; so it is said 1 Cor. xiv. 15, I will pray with
   the Spirit, and with understanding also.' Many did pray with the
   Spirit, that is, made use of this gift, but to the neglect of edifying;
   they did not pray so as they might be under stood by the hearers. Now
   saith the apostle, I would use the gift but to edification, so as the
   understanding of the auditory may go along with me.

   [1.] The ordinary gift of the Spirit is that special dexterity whereby
   men are able to put their meaning into apt words. It is not of such a
   miraculous infusion, and so wonderful in itself, as the former, because
   it dependeth much upon the temper and suitable constitution of the
   body, and is much bettered by industry, hearing, reading, meditation,
   conference, &c., as all other ordinary habits are. But such a gift
   there is in the church, as we find by plain experience, many men's
   tongues being as the pen of a ready writer,' Ps. xlv. 1. All miraculous
   gifts are now turned into ordinary gifts somewhat like them, as
   discerning of spirits into a sagacity and cautelous prudence, gifts of
   tongues into a special dexterity that way, and gifts of healing into
   skill in physic; so praying with the Spirit into readiness of utterance
   and freedom of speech. Now, though we are to covet the best gifts and
   strive after them, yet we must be contented with our measure. Sometimes
   this gift is given to carnal men because of their service in the
   church. Gifts are for the body; they may have great abilities to pray
   and preach, and may be carried on with full gales of outward
   assistance. Usually it is given unto men according to their
   constitution and natural receptivity; all cannot expect a like
   quickness and enlargement of speech. In the penmen of scripture you may
   observe a difference of character and style according to their temper
   and education, though their assistance as to words was also infallible.
   Isaiah writeth in a courtly style, and Jeremiah in a priestly, and
   Amos' manner of speech relisheth of his calling. In the New Testament,
   John is seraphical, Paul argumentative, and Peter writeth in a milky,
   sweet, middle way, &c.

   [2.] There is the gracious assistance of the Holy Ghost. Now, this is
   either habitual or actual.

   (1.) Habitual grace is necessary to prayer: Zech. xii. 10, I will pour
   upon them a spirit of grace and supplication.' Where there is grace
   there will be supplication. As soon as we are new born we fall
   a-crying; Behold, he prayeth,' Acts ix. 11, is the first news we hear
   of Paul after his conversion. Prayer is a kindly duty to the new
   creature. Things of an airy and fiery nature, a little thing will carry
   them upward, it is their natural motion and tendency; the regenerate
   are easily drawn into God's presence, it is the vent and utterance by
   which we discover the impression that is upon us. The priests were to
   wash in the great laver before they went to the altar; we are washed in
   the laver of regeneration, and renewed by the Holy Ghost,' Titus iii.
   5, and so made fit to offer spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by
   Jesus Christ.

   (2.) There is actual help and assistance which we have from the Spirit.
   Though a man be regenerate, yet he cannot pray as he ought, unless he
   be still moved and assisted by the Holy Ghost. This is continual, for
   we soon work out the strength which we have received. Now, these actual
   motions do either concern the time of prayer or the matter and the
   manner of it.

   First, The time of prayer, the Spirit suggesteth the fittest seasons;
   he that searcheth out the deep things of God, knoweth the acceptable
   times, Ps. xxxii. 6, and accordingly giveth notice to the heart by set
   ting it a-work in serious addresses to God: Ps. xxvii. 8, Thou saidst,
   Seek ye my face, and my heart said, Thy face, Lord, will I seek.' God
   speaketh to us by holy motions and the impulsions of his grace, and we
   answer God by a ready obedience. It is the worst scorn we can put upon
   one whom we hate when we deny to speak with him when he sendeth for us.
   By these motions we are invited to come and confer with God; do not
   say, I am not at leisure. I would not have this interpreted as if every
   motion to prayer were from the Spirit. It is possible Satan may oppress
   an anxious soul with the tyranny of un reasonable impulsions to duty; I
   only understand such motions as are regular and according to the word.
   Neither would I again be so understood as if God were never to be
   called upon, or we were never to pray, but when the Spirit moveth us;
   that is one of the carnal fancies of many wretches now. No, no; God
   must have his daily acknowledgment, Give us this day our daily bread;'
   but my meaning is, that such a season, when we are so strongly moved by
   the Spirit of God, should not be neglected.

   Secondly, The matter of prayer is suggested by the Holy Ghost. Let a
   man alone and he will soon run into a temptation, and cry for that
   which it were cruelty in God to give him; therefore the direction of
   the Holy Ghost is necessary, that we may not ask a scorpion instead of
   a fish, and a stone instead of bread: Rom. viii. 27, He maketh
   intercession for the saints, according to the will of God.' We take
   counsel of our lusts and interests when we are left to our own private
   spirit, and so would have God to be a minister of our carnal desires,
   and would engage him in our quarrels and private revenges; or else ask
   meat for our lusts. Now, the Holy Ghost teacheth us to ask not only
   what is lawful, but what is expedient for us, that so the will of God
   may take place before our inclinations.

   Thirdly, For the manner. In every moral action the manner of working is
   a chief circumstance. A man may sin in doing good, but not in doing
   well. Now, in prayer, where we have immediately to do with God, we
   should take great heed in what manner we come to him. The right manner
   is when we come with affection, with confidence, with reverence.

   First, With affection. It is the Holy Ghost sets us a-groaning: Rom.
   viii. 26, He maketh intercession for the saints with such sighs and
   groans as cannot be uttered.' Words are but the outside of prayer;
   sighs and groans are the language which God will understand, and these
   are the prayers which the Holy Ghost maketh for us, and in us. We learn
   to mourn from the turtle, from him that descended in the form of a
   dove; he draweth sighs from the heart, and tears from the eyes. Parts
   may furnish us with eloquence, but the Spirit giveth affection, that
   earnest reaching forth of soul, that holy importunity, that spiritual
   violence. It is all of his working. Many a prayer is neatly ordered,
   and tunably delivered, but this artifice of words smelleth of the man;
   then it savoureth of the Holy Ghost when there is life and power in it,
   and the poor supplicant sets himself to wrestle with God, as if he
   would overcome him by his own strength.

   Secondly, With confidence. When we come in a childlike manner, and call
   God Father, Rom. viii. 16, We have received the Spirit of adoption,
   whereby we cry, Abba, Father.' Usually, we do not mind this part of the
   Spirit's help in prayer; we look to gifts and enlargements, but not to
   this childlike confidence, that we may be able to call God Father
   without blasphemy and reproach. It is an easy matter to language it
   with our mouths, but to have the sense of our adoption in our hearts is
   a difficult thing. Sometimes the Spirit witnesseth it more explicitly
   by expressions; as if it were said when we go to prayer, Be of good
   cheer, thy sins are pardoned, God is thy God. At other times, by
   impressions or more secret instincts; if not by working child like
   confidence, yet childlike affection, optando, si non affirmando, that
   we may call God Father by option and choice, if not by direct
   affirmation, or a clear sense of our adoption.

   Thirdly, With reverence. That we may be serious and awe-full, God is
   best seen in the light of his own Spirit. The heathens could say, Non
   loquendum de Deo sine lumine--we need light from God when we come to
   speak of or to God. That sense of the Lord's greatness, and those fresh
   and awful thoughts that we have of his majesty in prayer, they are
   stirred up in us by the Holy Ghost; he uniteth and gathereth our hearts
   together, that they may not be ravelled and flittered abroad by
   impertinent and vain thoughts, Ps. lxxxvi. 11. Leave men to themselves,
   and they will do as foolishly as a man that is to gather a posy for his
   friend, and filleth it fuller of stinking weeds than flowers. We shall
   mingle many unsavoury worldly thoughts, or deal as basely and
   affrontingly with God as if a man under the law should mingle sulphur
   and brimstone with the sweet perfumes that were in the censer. Lust
   will be interposing in prayer, and out-talking grace; therefore, that
   we may be reverent and heedful, we must use the help of the Spirit,
   praying in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance,'
   Eph. vi. 18.

   1. Well, then, when thou goest to prayer, look upon the Holy Ghost as
   appointed by the Father and purchased by the Son to help thee in this
   sweet and comfortable service: Rom. viii. 26, The Spirit helpeth our
   infirmities,' sunantila'mbanetai, goeth to the other end of the staff
   and beareth a part of the burden. We are tugging and wrestling at it,
   and can make no work of it, but the Spirit cometh, and puts under his
   shoulder, and then it cometh off kindly.

   2. It informeth us how much they sin that are so far from praying with
   the Holy Ghost, that they do not pray with their own spirit. Alas! this
   is but babbling, when the heart doth not go along with the lips.

   3. It informeth us of the privileges of the saints. God is their
   father, willing to hear prayers; Christ is their advocate, willing to
   present their requests in court; and the Spirit a notary to indite and
   draw up their requests for them. Oh! what encouragement have we to go
   to the throne of grace! Surely we do not improve our privileges, or
   else we might have more comfortable access to the Father through Christ
   by the Spirit, Eph. ii. 18.

   Ver. 21. Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of
   our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

   The apostle goeth on directing to the means of perseverance. As before
   he mentioned two duties, conference and prayer, so here two graces,
   love and hope.

   Keep yourselves; that is, use the means: We are kept by the power of
   God unto salvation;' but because of the concurrence of our endeavours,
   it is ascribed to us, yourselves. Some interpret it as before, alii
   alios, keep one another. In the love of God. It may be taken for that
   love which God beareth to us, or else for the love wherewith we love
   God, which is fitly called the love of God, partly because God is the
   object of it, partly because the author of it, he commandeth or
   begetteth it, increaseth it, perfecteth it in the soul. In this second
   sense I take the love of God here, namely, for that grace wrought in
   us; and the great work committed to our care is to keep it, increase
   it, and discover it in all the operations of it. Looking, the formal
   act of hope; for the mercy. The cause is put for the effect. For all
   that good which we shall receive at Christ's coming, it is called
   mercy, because his proceeding with the elect at the last day will be
   upon terms of grace. Of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is so called because
   it is purchased by Christ, and dispensed by him: John xvii. 2, he hath
   power to give eternal life;' and at his coining he introduceth his
   people into their happy estate, John xiv. 3. Unto everlasting life. Our
   happiness in heaven is sometimes called everlasting life,' at other
   times everlasting glory.' Observe hence:--

   Obs. I. In perseverance there is a concurrence of our care and
   diligence: Phil. ii. 12, 13, Work out your own salvation with fear and
   trembling,' &c. The main work is God's: He that hath begun a good work
   must perfect it,' Phil. i. 6; and the same Jesus that is 4 author is
   also finisher,' Heb. xii. 2. The deeper radication of the habit, the
   defence of it, the growth and perfection of it, the ability to act, is
   all from God: 1 Peter v. 10, The God of all grace make you perfect,
   stablish, strengthen, and settle you;' but yet a concurrence there is
   of our care and endeavours. A child in the womb is nourished by the
   mother, liveth by the life of the mother, feedeth by the food of the
   mother; but a child born liveth a more distinct and separate life of
   its own, though it still be under the mother's care and provision. So
   it is with us after grace received. We have a power to act and do what
   is necessary for the preservation of the spiritual life. Well, then,
   let us not neglect the means. You must not lie upon the bed of ease,
   and think that God must do all. He doth all indeed, but in us and by
   us. Idle wishes will do us no good as long as our hands refuse to
   labour.

   Obs. 2. Again, men that have grace had need look to the keeping of it.
   Why?

   1. We ourselves are prone to revolt: This people loveth to wander,'
   Jer. xiv. 10, and they err in their hearts,' though under the immediate
   conduct of God, Ps. xcv. 10. It is notable in scripture that we read of
   a decay both of faith, love, and obedience, which are the three main
   graces; some that left their first faith,' 1 Tim. v. 12; others that
   left their first love,' Rev. ii. 4; and as to obedience, we read of the
   first ways' of David, as distinguished from his latter: 2 Chron. xvii.
   3, He walked in the first ways of his father David.' David, in his
   latter time, fell into scandalous crimes.

   2. We are assaulted with continual temptations. An importunate suitor,
   by perseverance in his suit, may at length prevail. Satan will lose
   nothing for want of asking. Those that refused at first may yield
   afterward. Long conversing with the world may taint the spirit. A
   deformed object, when we are used to it, seemeth less deformed. In
   dwelling lust, though long restrained, breaketh out afterward with the
   more violence. Rose-trees nipped in June bear in the winter. Many that
   in youth have held a hard hand over sin, in their very old age have
   found their lusts more violent.

   3. A man of long standing is apt to grow secure and negligent, as if he
   were now past danger; when his condition was doubtful, he seemed to be
   more diligent and serious, but when the labours and difficulties of our
   first entering into favour with God are well over, and a man hath
   gotten some freedom from the terrors of the law, and some peace and
   confidence, he is in danger of security, by which all runneth to waste
   in the soul. See Rev. iii. 17-19. Well, then, this life is never
   exempted from care; either to get grace or to keep it, w r e need to be
   watchful and diligent to the very last. Man is a changeable creature,
   and Satan is restless, either he continueth the old suit or altereth
   the course of temptations. It is his subtlety in that he doth not
   always play the same game; a man may stand one brunt and fail in
   another: Joab turned after Adonijah, though not after Absalom,' 1 Kings
   ii. 28. Every new condition bringeth new snares: Ephraim is a cake not
   turned,' Hosea vii. 8. A man may be well baked of one side, and yet
   quite dough of another; the children of God prosperous differ from the
   children of God afflicted, Phil. iv. 12. We had need to learn how to
   walk up-hill and down-hill, that we may keep with God upon all grounds.
   Again, corruptions may be disguised; a man may withstand open enemies,
   and yet fail by the insinuations of those that have a show of goodness.
   The young prophet withstood the king stoutly, but yet was perverted by
   the insinuations of the old prophet, 1 Kings xiii. 4, with 19th verse.
   Meletius, a sufferer under pagans, but went over to the Arians.

   Again, where there seemeth to be least danger there is most cause of
   fear. Lot, that was chaste in Sodom, miscarried in the mountains, where
   there were none but his own family. Conscience, that is now tender, may
   be strangely deadened and laid by for a time. Who would have thought
   that he whose heart smote him for cutting off the lap of Saul's
   garment, should afterwards fall into uncleanness and blood, and He
   asleep in it for a long time? Confidence is sure to be dismounted.
   Peter is a sad instance. He told his master, If all men deny thee, yet
   not I,' and he meant as he spoke. He ventureth on a band of men with a
   rusty blade, followeth Christ into the high priest's hall, who more
   secure than Peter? But all this confidence failed, though it met with
   but a weak trial, the soft words of a damsel's question; such feathers
   are we when the blast of a temptation is let loose upon us. Upon all
   these considerations now let us make it our care to keep what graces we
   have gotten, which will never be done without watchfulness and
   diligence to quicken us further to it.

   1. Unless you keep it, all is in vain; if so be it be in vain, Gal.
   iii. 4. It is in vain as to the final reward. It is not in vain as to
   the increase of punishment. You will lose all your cost you have been
   at for Christ, Ezek. xviii. 24, 2 John 8. Your watchings, strivings,
   prayings, sufferings, come to nothing. The Nazarite was to begin all
   anew if the days of his separation were defiled, Num. vi. 12. Nay, it
   is not in vain as to punishment, 2 Peter ii. 20-22.

   2. To lose any degrees of grace is a great loss; it is the most
   precious gift, 2 Peter i. 1, conduceth to the highest ends--eternal
   happiness, fitteth us for communion with God; all the world cannot
   repair this loss, or purchase a supply for us. We are to be accountable
   for degrees, as well as for the grace itself. They that had five
   talents reckoned for five; a factor that giveth an account only for a
   part of the estate received is not accounted faithful. We may not be
   intrusted with so much again. A man that hath fallen may recover his
   peace and joy, but in a lower degree; a prodigal that hath once broken
   is not trusted with a like stock again, and a man after a great disease
   may never come to the same degree and pitch of health. So Christians
   may not recover that largeness of spirit after their foul falls and
   fulness of inward strength and comfort.

   3. Those that have made profession of love to God, and yet afterwards
   break with him, bring an ill report upon the Lord, as if he were an ill
   master. I am persuaded that the devil in policy lets many men alone for
   a while to make a strict profession, and seem to be full of zeal and
   holiness, that they may afterwards do religion a mischief. Whilst they
   act for God, though they do some things excellently, Satan never
   troubleth them; he is at truce with them till they have gotten a name
   for the profession of godliness and strictness of conversation, and
   when once they have gotten a name, their fall will be more scandalous,
   more ignominious to themselves, and disgraceful to religion. Verily,
   this is a common experience, we see many forward, hot, and carried out
   with great impulsions of zeal, and all this while Satan lets them
   alone, he knoweth how mutable men are, and how soon they begin to tire
   in the ways of God, therefore lets them alone till they have run
   themselves out of breath, that afterward, by a more notable defection,
   they may shame themselves and harden others. If Judas will be a
   disciple, he lets him alone; if Simon Magus will be baptized, and
   Nicolas [168] bear office in the church, he lets them alone; he knoweth
   the best are mutable; that many take up their religion out of interest,
   that men are soon weary of their own scrupulousness and rigid
   observances, that they first make conscience of all things, and then of
   nothing; and therefore he lets them go on without any notable defect or
   failing, to fly some youthful lusts, to renounce some interests, till
   they have gotten credit enough to discredit religion. See 2 Tim. ii.
   18. O Christians! if you are not moved with respect to God, yet for
   your own cause; after a blaze will you go out in a stench? A house
   begun and not finished is a habitation for screech-owls; but, on the
   contrary, what an honour is it to hold out to the last, to be like
   Mnason, an old disciple!'

   4. The worst is past, we have but a few years' service more, and we
   shall be happy for ever: Your salvation is nearer than it was when you
   first believed.' Rom. xiii. 11; a little more and you will land safe at
   the expected haven; if we have a rough passage, it is a short one.
   What! will you not watch with me one hour?' saith Christ to his
   apostles. The longest life is no more in comparison of eternity. Enoch
   lived longer than most men do, he lived three hundred and sixty-five
   years, Gen. v. 22, but all that while he walked with God;' and is it so
   tedious to us to tell over a few summers and winters before we come to
   heaven?

   Obs. 3. The next point is more particular and express. That of all
   graces, love needeth keeping. Why? (1.) Because of all graces it is
   most decaying, Mat. xxiv. 12, Rev. ii. 4. Flame is soon spent, graces
   that act most strongly require most influence, as being most subject to
   abatement; we sooner lose our affections than anything else. (2.)
   Because love is a grace that we can ill spare; it is the spring and
   rise of all duties to God and man. (1st.) To God. Love is the first
   affection corrupted and renewed. The schoolmen dispute whether there be
   anything a man doth that hath not its first rise from love. It is love
   maketh us angry, and it is love maketh us hate, Ps. xcvii. 10, and love
   maketh us grieve, John xi. 35, 36, much more is it love that maketh us
   hope, and desire, and delight; so it is gracious love that sets us
   a-mourning for sin, Luke vii. 47, puts us upon hatred of evil,
   delighting in God and in his laws; see 2 Cor. v. 14, 1 John v. 3, Gal.
   v. 6: Faith worketh by love,' faith receiveth grace, and love
   exerciseth it. If we would do anything in the resistance of sin, in
   keeping the commandments, we cannot spare our love. (2d.) As to man.
   Love is a grace that will make us industrious for the good of others,
   and therefore we read of the labour of love,' 1 Thes. i. 3. It is
   gluten animarum, the glue of souls, the cement and solder of the
   church; the jointing that runneth throughout all the living and squared
   stones, Col. iii. 14; by this souls are mingled, and all mutual offices
   done cheerfully. Want of love to the saints is the cause of apostasy,
   for the less we love them the more we associate to the wicked, and then
   zeal is damnified and abated.

   Well, then, watch the more earnestly against the decays and abatements
   of love;' leaving our first love is a disease not only incident to
   hypocrites, but sometimes to God's own children. Christians go back
   ward in the heat and light of their graces ten degrees, either through
   the badness of the times, Mat. xxiv. 12, or through a cursed satiety
   that is apt to creep upon us. Affections are deadened to things to
   which we are accustomed. The Israelites cried out, Nothing but this
   manna!' Our desires are not so fresh and lively after long
   acquaintance. Some times it cometh from negligence, or a sluggish
   carelessness, we do not take pains to keep graces alive, nor
   anazopurein, stir up the gift that is in us,' 2 Tim. i. 6: as the
   priests in the temple were to keep in the holy fire, so are we, by
   prayers and meditation and constant work, to keep our love alive; but
   when these exercises are neglected, it decreaseth. Sometimes it falleth
   out through freeness in sinning. Neglect is like not blowing up the
   coals; sinning is like pouring on waters, a very quenching of the
   Spirit, 1 Thes. v. 19. Again, through secure dalliance with the
   pleasures of sin, or cumbering the soul with the cares of the world;
   when the heart runneth out too much upon the creature, God is
   neglected. Thus it may fall out.

   But now the decay of love is seen in two things:--(1.) The remission of
   the degrees of love; (2.) The intermission of the acts of love.

   1. A remission of the degrees, when the heart groweth cold, list less,
   and loose; when there is not such a strong tendency and bent of soul
   towards God as formerly, not such a sense of unkindness, such an awful
   respect to God, a care to please him, and desire to enjoy him, nor such
   complacency and delight in the thoughts of God. But now every loss or
   abatement of degree doth not mount to a leaving of our first love;
   there are certain ravishments and transports of soul which we feel upon
   the first evidence of our being reconciled to God, or are stirred up
   upon other special occasions. These are accidental overflowings, which
   may come and go; we cannot always bear up under them; new things
   strangely affect us; love is afterward more settled and diffused in the
   channels of obedience, and therefore no wonder if it do not run with so
   full a tide and current. This remission of degrees, then, must be
   understood with respect to these constant dispositions of love, as care
   to please, fear to offend, desire of and delight in God; when these
   fail us to any degree, love is a-chilling or growing cold.

   2. An intermission of the acts and exercise of love, when God is
   forgotten, duty neglected, sin unmortified, no care of or frequency in
   private communion with God, no sweet thoughts of him, Ps. lxiii. 6;
   civ. 34. Where we love there will be musing on the object beloved,
   there will be familiarity and intimateness of converse. There is not a
   day can pass but love will find some errand and occasion to confer with
   God, either to implore his help or ask his counsel. But now, when men
   can pass over whole days and weeks, and never give God a visit, such
   strangeness argueth little love. Again, when there is no care of
   glorifying God, no plottings and contrivings how we may be most useful
   for him, when we do not mourn over sin as we were wont to do, are not
   so sensible of offences, have not these meltings of heart, are not so
   careful to avoid all occasions of offending God, are not so watchful,
   so zealous, as we were wont to be, do not rise up in arms against
   temptations and carnal thoughts, love is decayed. Certainly when the
   sense of our obligations to Christ is warm upon the heart, sin doth not
   escape so freely; love will not endure it to live and act in the heart,
   Titus ii. 11, 12, Gen. xxxix. 9. But now, as this is worn off, the
   heart is not watched, the tongue is not bridled, speeches are idle,
   yea, rotten and profane; wrath and envy tyrannise over the soul, all
   runneth to riot in the poor neglected heart; yea, further, God's public
   worship is performed perfunctorily, and in a careless, stupid manner;
   sin confessed without remorse and sense of the wrong done to God;
   prayer made for spiritual blessings without desire of obtaining; wrath
   deprecated without any fear of the danger; intercession for others
   without any sympathy or brotherly love; thanks given without any esteem
   of the benefits or affection to God in the remembrance of them;
   conference of holy things is either none at all, or very slight and
   care less; hearing without attention; reading without a desire of
   profit; singing without any delight or melody of heart. All this is but
   the just account of a heart declining in the love of God.

   Now as you love your souls beware of this great evil. To this end--

   1. Be rooted and grounded in love,' Eph. iii. 17. Do not content
   yourselves with flashes and good moods and meltings at a sermon, but
   get solid grace and thorough experiences: glances and sudden affections
   will come to nothing, Mat. xiii. 4, 5, with xx. 21. A tree that hath
   taken root is in less danger of withering.

   2. Increase and grow in love, 1 Thes. iv. 10. Nothing conduceth to a
   decay more than contentment with what we have received; every day you
   should love sin less, self less, world less, but Christ more and more.

   3. Observe the first declinings, for these are the causes of all the
   rest. Evil is best stopped in the beginning; if, when we first began to
   grow careless, we had taken heed, then it would never have come to
   this. A heavy body moving downward, vires acquirit eundo, it gathers
   strength by running, and still moveth faster and faster. Look then to
   your first breaking off from God, and remitting your watch and
   spiritual fervour; it is easier to crush the egg than to kill the
   serpent. He that keepeth a house in constant repair prevents the ruin
   and fall of it; stop every hole and chink before the mischief spread
   further.

   4. Plead with thy heart. The highest degree of love doth not answer the
   dignity of Christ, nor the duty that we owe to him; he is to be loved
   with all the soul, and all the heart, and all the might.' It is a
   disgrace to him to give him less; surely he looketh to be much loved
   again who hath loved us so entirely, and translated us out of darkness
   into marvellous light,'

   5. In case of decay, take the advice the Holy Ghost hath given you,
   Rev. ii. 5, where three things are required--(1.) Consideration; (2.)
   Humiliation; (3.) Reformation.

   [1.] Consideration: Remember whence thou art fallen,' ponder the case.
   In examination we compare ourselves and the law together, but in this
   recollection ourselves and ourselves together. Sadly consider then what
   a difference there is between thee and thyself, recall former
   experiences, and say as Job, chap. xxix. 2, 3, Oh! that I were as in
   months past, in the days when God preserved me, when his candle shined
   on my head.' Or as the church, Hosea ii. 7, It was better with me than
   now.' In our serious sequestration and retirements we should have such
   thoughts as these are:--I was wont to spend some time every day with
   God; I remember when it was a delight to me to think of him; now I have
   no heart to pray or meditate, no relish of communion with his blessed
   majesty; it was the joy of my soul to be at an ordinance, the returns
   of the Sabbath were welcome to me; but now what a weariness is it! Time
   was when I had sweet experiences, and the graces of God's Spirit were
   more lively in me, but now all is dead and inefficacious; time was when
   a vain thought was burdensome unto me, but now I can away with sinful
   actions; time was when the mispence of ordinary time was a grief unto
   my soul, now I can spend the Sabbath unprofitably and never be
   troubled, &c. Thus should you consider your estate.

   [2.] Humiliation, intimated in the word repent.' It is not enough to
   know yourselves fallen; many are convinced of their collapsed and
   decayed estate, but do not judge themselves for it in God's presence.
   Go, bewail it to God, smite upon the thigh, praying for pardon. That is
   the notion of the word repent here. It is not enough to repent of gross
   whoredom, theft, drunkenness; we must repent also of the decays of
   love. The blind world thinketh we are to repent of nothing but what is
   publicly odious. In friendship, coldness is taken for a great injury.
   Go, arraign thyself before God for growing cold in his love and
   service.

   [3.] Reformation: Do thy first works.' We must not spend the time in
   idle complaints. Many are sensible that do not repent; some may repent
   that do not reform; you must not be quiet till you recover your former
   station. Christ puts Peter upon a treble profession, because of his
   treble denial, John xxi. 17.

   Obs. 4. The next note is from the coupling of these two: The love of
   God,' and looking for the mercy of Christ unto eternal life.' Thence
   observe, that love to God will put us upon looking for Christ's second
   coming, when this mercy is to be dispensed to us. See the like
   connection elsewhere, 2 Thes. iii. 5, The Lord direct your hearts to
   the love of God and the patient waiting for Christ.' Two reasons may be
   given of it:--

   1. Love allayeth fear, 1 John iv. 18. Of whom should a Christian be
   afraid at that day? Of the devil? He is held in chains of darkness, and
   judged by the saints together with Christ. Of Christ? Shall the members
   be afraid of their head? the ransomed of their Redeemer? the beloved of
   their Saviour? Oh! but then he cometh as a judge. But it is to plead
   their cause, to right their wrongs, to revenge their enemies, to reward
   their services. If he be then your judge, he hath ever been your
   advocate hitherto, and surely he that hath interceded for you will not
   condemn you.

   2. Love quickeneth desire: 2 Peter iii. 12, Looking for and hastening
   to the coming of the Lord;' see Cant. viii. 14, Rev. xxii. 20. A harlot
   would have her husband defer his coming, but a chaste spouse thinketh
   he can never come soon enough. They that go a-whoring after the world,
   neither desire Christ's coming, nor love his appearing; but the Spirit
   of the bride saith, Come.' They that love God look for it, Phil. iii.
   20, long for it, 2 Tim. iv. 8: they love his appearing.' Corrupt nature
   saith, Depart,' Job xxii. 14; but grace saith, Come.' The children of
   God would fain see him of whom they have heard so often, and so much,
   and of whose sweetness they have tasted. They know him by hearsay and
   by spiritual experience; but they would fain see his person.

   Use 1. This now informeth us what a difference there is between a child
   of God and wicked men. They wish this day would never come, and would
   be glad in their hearts to hear such news. The thought of Christ's
   coming is their burden and torment. They have the spirit of the devil
   in them: Art thou come to torment us before our time'? Mat. viii. 29.
   They cannot endure to hear or think of it. If it might go by voices
   whether Christ should come or no, would they give their voice this way,
   and say, Come, Lord Jesus; yea, come quickly'? If thieves and
   malefactors should have the liberty to choose whether the assizes
   should be kept or no, would they ever fix it, and look for and long for
   the time of its approach? No, no; but a child of God is waiting and
   looking for this happy time.

   Obj. But now here is an objection. Are Christians always in this frame?
   What shall we say then to those weak ones that tremble at the thought
   of it for want of the assurance of God's love, and the best saints that
   do not always feel such an actual inclination and strength of desire?

   Sol. I answer--The meanest saint hath some inclination this way. Can a
   man desire that Christ should come into his heart, and not come to
   judgment? Since comfort and reward is more naturally embraced than
   duty, the first work of grace is to raise us up to this hope, 1 Peter
   i. 3; but yet sometimes there may be a drowsiness and indisposition,
   and then their lamps may not be kept burning, Luke xii. 35. 36. The
   wise virgins slept as well as the foolish, Mat. xxv. Oftentimes they
   find themselves indisposed for his coming by careless carriage,
   remission of their watch, and scattering their love to the creature;
   yea, much of their old bondage may remain through the imperfection of
   their love; for it is perfect love casteth out fear.' A wife desireth
   her husband's coming home, but it may be all things are not ready, and
   in so good order as they should be. All Christians desire the coming of
   Christ, but sometimes they are not so exact and watchful, and therefore
   their affections are not so lively.

   Use 2. Here is a note of trial whether we love God or Christ. How do we
   stand affected towards his appearing? The world cannot satisfy
   Christians; they look beyond it. In things to come we are apt to feign,
   and because we have not a sufficient sense of them, we think we have an
   affection to them when we have them not. If there be looking, there
   will be preparing. When you expect a great estate for your children,
   you breed them accordingly; or rather thus, a man that expecteth the
   coming of a king to his house will make all things ready. Surely you
   look for nobody when you are not fitting and preparing yourselves. What
   have you done against this great day? Do you judge yourselves'? 1 Cor.
   xi. 31. Do you get into Christ, Rom. viii. 1, that you may be
   interested in Christ's righteousness against you come to undergo
   Christ's judgment? What purging of heart and life? 2 Peter iii. 11. Art
   thou in such a case wherein thou wouldst be found of Christ'?

   To exhort those that love God to look earnestly for the coming of
   Christ. To this end:--

   1. Consider our relations to him; he is our master, we are his
   servants, and good servants will wait for their master's coming, Mat.
   xxiv. 45. Here we have our meals, but then our wages. It is but present
   maintenance which we have now; but Behold, I come, and my reward is
   with me.' Christ will not come empty-handed. Again, he is our husband,
   we his spouse: The bride saith, Come,' Rev. xxii. 17. We are now but
   contracted to Christ; then is the day of solemn espousals. The judge is
   the wicked man's enemy, but your redeemer.

   2. Consider the privileges we shall then enjoy. The day of Christ's
   coming is:--

   [1.] A day of manifestation, Rom. xiii. 19. All is now hidden. Christ
   is hidden, the saints are hidden, their life is hidden, Col. iii. 3,
   their glory is hidden, 1 John iii. 2; but then Christ shall appear, and
   we shall appear with him in glory; as Moses told the rebels, Num. xvi.,
   To-morrow the Lord will show who are his.' Christ, as the natural Son,
   shall then appear in all his royalty and glory, as the great God and
   Saviour of the world; so shall the saints put on their best robes. In
   winter the tree appeareth not what it is, the sap and life is hidden in
   the root; but when summer cometh, all is discovered.

   [2.] It is a day of perfection. Everything tendeth to its perfect
   estate: the little seed that is sown in the ground breaketh through the
   clods that it may be in flower and perfection; so a Christian is
   working through, that he may come to an estate of perfect holiness and
   perfect freedom. Here we are very weak; yea, even to glorified spirits
   he is but a saviour in part; there is some fruit of sin continued upon
   the body; but then body and soul are united, and perfectly glorified to
   praise God in heaven. Christ cometh to make an end of what he hath
   begun; he came first to redeem our souls from sin, but then our bodies
   from corruption;' then all privileges are perfect regeneration, Mat.
   xix. 28. When heaven is new, earth new, bodies new, souls new, that is
   a regeneration indeed. So adoption: we are sons, but handled as
   servants, looking for the adoption.' Rom. viii. 23. So justification:
   our pardon shall be proclaimed at the market-cross, published before
   all the world, Acts iii. 19. So for redemption, Luke xxi. 28: the body
   is a captive when the soul is set at liberty; the body is held under
   death till that day.

   [3.] It is a day of congregation, or gathering together. The saints are
   now scattered, they live in divers countries and in divers ages, but
   then all meet in one assembly and congregation, Ps. i. 6; but of these
   things more largely, ver. 6, on these words, the great day.

   Obs. 5. From that looking for the mercy, &c., observe, that looking
   earnestly for eternal life is a good means of perseverance; for to that
   end it is urged by the apostle here. I shall inquire--(1.) What this
   is; looking (2.) What influence it hath upon our perseverance.

   1. What this looking is. It implieth patience, but chiefly hope.

   p.] Patience, in waiting God's leisure in the midst of present
   difficulties, Heb. x. 36, Luke viii. 15, 1 Thes. i. 3, Rom. viii. 25.

   [2.] Hope. Now, because there is a blind hope and a good hope, a
   bastard hope and a genuine hope--good hope through grace,' saith the
   apostle, 2 Thes. ii. 16--let me tell you that this looking or
   expectation is not that blind hope that is found in men ignorant and
   presumptuous, that regard not what they do. Presumption is a child of
   darkness, the fruit of ignorance and inconsideration. When men are once
   serious they find it a hard matter to fix an advised hope on things to
   come, for guilty nature is more inclinable to fear than to hope. This
   blind hope will certainly fail us; it is compared to a spider's web,'
   Job viii. 14. The spider spinneth a web out of his own bowels, which is
   swept away as soon as the besom cometh; so do carnal men conceive a few
   rash and ungrounded hopes; but when death cometh, or a little trouble
   of conscience, these vain conceits are swept away. This hope which I
   press you to is a serious act, arising from grace aiming at its own
   perfection. Again, this looking is not some glances upon heaven, such
   as are found in worldly and sensual persons, who now and then have
   their lucida intervalla, their good moods and sober thoughts, as
   Balaam, Num. xxiii. 10; a taste they may have, Heb. vi. 4, a smatch of
   the sweetness of heaven and spiritual comforts; the most wretched
   worldlings have their wishes and sudden rapts of soul; but alas! these
   sudden motions are not operative, they come but seldom, and leave no
   warmth upon the soul, as fruit is not ripened that hath but a glance of
   the sun, and a sudden light rather blindeth a man than showeth him the
   way. So these sudden indeliberate thoughts vanish, and leave men never
   the better. Again, it is not a loose hope or a probable conjecture;
   this hath no efficacy upon the soul. Men that are under an anxious,
   doubtful posture of spirit will be very un even in their walkings,
   James i. 8. When men are discouraged in a race they begin to slacken
   their pace, to which the apostle alludeth when he saith, I run not as
   one that is uncertain,' 1 Cor. ix. 26; but when they begin sensibly to
   get ground, they hold on their course the more cheerfully.

   Thus negatively I have shown you what it is not, but now positively; it
   is an earnest, well-grounded expectation of blessedness to come. It
   bewrayeth itself--

   [1.] By frequent and serious thoughts. Thoughts are the spies and
   messengers of hope; it sendeth them into the promised land to bring the
   soul tidings from thence; it is impossible a man can hope for a thing,
   but he will be thinking of it; by this means we preoccupy and forestall
   the contentment of what we expect, and feast the soul with images and
   suppositions of what is to come, as if it were already present. If a
   beggar were adopted into the succession of a crown, he would please
   himself in imagining the happiness and honour and pleasure of the
   kingly state; so certainly if we did look upon ourselves as heirs of
   the kingdom of heaven,' and co-heirs with Christ,' we would think of
   that happy state more than we do, and by a serious contemplation our
   hearts would carry us above the clouds, and set us in the midst of the
   glory of the world to come, as if we did see Christ upon his throne,
   and Paul with his crown of righteousness upon his head, and all the
   blessed leaning in Abraham's bosom. A carnal expectation filleth men
   with carnal musings and projects; as Luke xii. 18, dielogi'zetp, he was
   dialoguing and discoursing with himself of pulling down barns and
   building greater, of bestowing his fruits and goods. See the like,
   James iv. 13. It is usual with men to forestall the pleasure of their
   hopes, as young riotous heirs spend upon their estates before they come
   in hand. Now, so it is also in heavenly things; men that expect them
   will be entertaining their spirits with the thoughts of them.

   [2.] By hearty groans, and sighs, and longings: Rom. viii. 23, We groan
   in ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our bodies.'
   They have had a taste of the clusters of Canaan, and therefore long for
   more; they can never be soon enough with Christ: When shall it once
   be?' The nearer enjoyment, the more impatient of the want of his
   company. As the decays of nature do put them in mind of another world,
   they begin to lift up the head and look out, Rom. viii. 19,
   apokaradoki'a kti'seos, the earnest expectation of the creature;' the
   word signifieth the pushing out of the head to see if it can spy a
   thing a great way off, and noteth the extension of the soul towards the
   fruition of things hoped for; they would have a fuller draught of the
   consolations of the Spirit, more freedom from sin, more perfection of
   grace, &c.

   [3.] By lively tastes and feelings. A believer hath eternal life, John
   xvii. 3; he beginneth it here. Hope is called a lively hope,' not only
   living, but lively, 1 Peter i. 3, because it quickeneth the heart, and
   maketh us cheerful and sprightly: Rom. v. 2, We rejoice under the hope
   of the glory of God,' Joy is for enjoyment and possession; but yet that
   prepossession which hope getteth causeth all joy; see 1 Peter i. 8. I
   confess all feel it not in a like degree, because it dependeth upon a
   sense of grace, which believers always have not, yet all find a
   sweetness and some comfort, when they think of what they look for.
   Worldly hope is but the dream of a shadow; there is pain and trouble in
   the expectation, and no satisfaction in the fruition.

   2. Let me show you the influence it hath upon perseverance.

   [1.] It sets us a-work to purge out sin: 1 John iii. 3, Every one that
   hath this hope purifieth himself as Christ is pure.' The things that we
   look for are holy; it is a great part of our portion in heaven to be
   free from sin, and to be consorts of the immaculate Lamb. Can we hope
   for these things and cherish worldly lusts? If we did, we look for a
   sensual paradise; then we might indulge our lusts without any defiance
   of our hopes. But we look for a pure and holy as well as a glorious and
   blessed estate, and therefore we should begin to purify ourselves.

   [2.] It withdraweth our hearts from present things: Phil. iii. 20, Our
   conversation is in heaven, from whence we look for a saviour.' A man
   that hath been looking upon the sun findeth his eyes dazzled that he
   cannot behold an object less glorious; the oftener we look within this
   veil, the more is the glory of the world obscured. Abraham lived as a
   stranger in the promised land. Why? Because he looked for a city,' &c.,
   Heb. xi. 9, 10. Deny worldly lusts,' saith the apostle, looking for the
   blessed hope,' Titus ii. 12, 13. A man who is much in heaven, his
   affections are pre-engaged, and therefore the world doth him little
   hurt. Birds are seldom taken in their flight; the more we are upon the
   wing of heavenly thoughts the more we escape snares. Hope sets the
   wheels a-going: Phil. iii. 13, I press onward because of the high prize
   of our calling.' The thought of the end quickeneth to the use of means;
   we faint because we do not consider it more, 1 Cor. xv. 58. Heaven will
   pay for all.

   [3.] It maketh us upright and sincere; looking asquint on secular
   rewards is the cause of all our declinings: Mat. vi. 2, mi'sthon
   ape'chousi, they have their reward,' [169] Hired servants do not look
   for the inheritance, and therefore must have pay in hand; if they may
   have the world and live in honour and pleasure, they will discharge God
   from all other promises. A sincere man maketh God his paymaster, and
   that chiefly in the other world, Col. iii. 24; we have a master good
   enough in him, we need not look for pay elsewhere.

   [4.] It supporteth us under those difficulties and afflictions which
   are wont to befall us in a course of godliness. We can counterbalance
   what we feel with what we expect; we feel nothing but trouble, and that
   which we expect is life and glory, Rom. viii. 18, 2 Cor. iv. 17, 18. In
   this respect hope is called an anchor,' Heb. vi. 19. In the stormy
   gusts of temptation it stayeth the soul, which hope we have as an
   anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and entereth into that
   which is within the veil.' It is a weighty anchor, that will not bow or
   break; and the ground is good; it entereth into that within the veil,'
   and therefore, though tempests arise, it will keep us from floating and
   dashing against the rocks. Again it is called a helmet: Eph. vi. 17,
   The helmet of salvation;' so 1 Thes. v. 8. The helmet is for the head
   in conflicts. As long as we can lift up our heads and look to heaven,
   we are safe.

   [5.] It helpeth us to resist temptations. Sin maketh many promises, and
   prevaileth by carnal hope. Balaam was enticed by promises to curse
   God's people. Babylon's fornications are presented in a golden cup. Men
   are corrupted with promises of preferment and greatness and present
   accommodations. Now hope sets promise against promise, heaven against
   earth, pleasures at God's right hand against carnal delights and taking
   our fill of loves;' as one nail driveth out another, so doth hope
   defeat the promises of the world by propounding the promises of God.

   Let us now apply this:--

   Use 1. It informeth us that we may look for the reward without sin.
   Those men would be wiser than God that deny us a liberty to make use of
   the Spirit's motives, they begrudge God's bounty, To what end should
   the Lord propound rewards, but that we should close with them by faith?
   Graces may be exercised about their proper objects without sin; it
   requireth some faith to aim at things not seen;' the world is drowned
   in sense and present satisfactions. They are mercenaries that must have
   pay in hand; their souls droop and languish if they do not meet with
   credit, applause, and profit; they make man their paymaster. They have
   the spirit of a servant that prefer present wages before the
   inheritance; but to do all upon the encouragements of the mercy of
   Jesus Christ unto eternal life argueth grace. It was a relief to the
   soul of Christ to think of the reward, Heb. xii. 2. Christ, as man, was
   to have rational comforts and human encouragements. That is sinful
   indeed when we would have the reward but neglect the work; when we
   would be merrcenaii but not operarii, we sever the reward from the
   duty, and, like Ephraim, are willing to tread the corn,' but not break
   the clods,' Hosea x. 11. Again, we look amiss upon the reward when we
   have a carnal notion of heaven; as some Jews looked for a carnal
   Messiah, so do some Christians for a carnal heaven, for base pleasure
   and fleshly delights, for a Turkish paradise. Such kind of hopes debase
   the heart; or else when we look for it as merited by us, as if we could
   challenge it by our works, then we are mercenaries indeed; it is here
   looking for the mercy of Jesus Christ,' &c.

   Again, our own happiness must not be our last end. There is a personal
   happiness that results to us from the enjoyment of God. Now, the glory
   of God must be preferred before it.

   Use 2. If you would persevere in the love of God and a good frame of
   heart, revive your hopes, and set the soul a-looking and a-longing for
   eternal life. If we keep the rejoicing of our hope firm to the end,'
   then we are safe, Heb. iii. 6. Courtiers are more polite in their
   manners than ordinary subjects, because they are more in their prince's
   eye and company. The oftener we are in God's court the more holy. Well,
   then, be as much as you can in actual expectation of this blessedness.
   To this end--

   1. Believe it There is a mist upon eternity to a carnal heart. They are
   led by sense and reason, and believe no more than is evident to a
   natural principle; but now faith is the evidence of things not seen,'
   Heb. xi. 1. Fancy and nature cannot outsee time, and look be yond
   death. Faith holdeth the candle to hope, and then we have a prospect
   into the other world, and can see a happy estate to come.

   2. Apply it. It is a poor, comfortless meditation to think of a blessed
   hope and the certainty of it, unless we have an interest in these
   things. A hungry man taketh little pleasure in gazing upon a feast,
   when he tastes not of it. The reprobate hereafter are lookers-on; and
   David speaketh of a table spread for him in the sight of his enemies.'
   Hope hath never a more lively influence than when we can make out our
   own propriety and interest: Job xix. 25, I know that my Redeemer
   liveth;' 2 Cor. v. 1, We know that if this earthly tabernacle were
   dissolved, we have a building not made with hands, eternal in the
   heavens;' 2 Tim. iv. 8, Henceforth there is laid up for me,' &c. They
   do not only believe there is a heaven, but apply it--for me. You will
   say, Is hope only the fruit of assurance? I answer--It is the fruit of
   faith as well as of assurance or experience; but the sense of our
   interest is very comfortable, and in some sort necessary. Be fore we
   can hope anything for ourselves, our qualification is to be sup posed.
   In a matter of such moment a man should not be at an uncertainty. Canst
   thou be quiet and not sure of heaven? Not to look after it is a bad
   sign. A godly man may want it, but a godly man cannot slight it. It is
   possible a man may make a hard shift to creep to heaven through doubts
   and fears, and may be scarcely saved,' 1 Peter iv. 18, whilst others
   have an abundant entrance;' but then you lose your heaven upon earth,
   which consisteth in peace and joy in the Holy Ghost,' and lose much of
   the efficacy of hope; for uncertain, wavering thoughts work little,
   therefore assurance cannot be slighted. Further, I add; by showing what
   application there must be if we cannot attain to assurance; there are
   three degrees of application beneath assurance: there is acceptation,
   adherence, and affiance.

   [1.] Acceptation of God's offer upon God's terms: Job v. 27, Know thou
   it for thy good;' put in for these hopes, and take God to his word upon
   this confidence; make good thy part of the stipation in the covenant,
   and he will not fail thee. This application there must be in all, in
   answer to the demands of the covenant, 1 Peter iii. 21, Exod. xxiv.
   6-8.

   [2.] Adherence. Stick close to this hope in a course of obedience. If
   we do God's work we shall not fail of wages: 1 Cor. ix. 26, I run not
   as one that is uncertain.'

   [3.] Affiance. Besting, waiting upon God for the accomplishment of this
   blessedness, though not without some doubts and fears as to our own
   interest. Though you cannot say it is yours, yet you will cast yourself
   upon the mercy of God in Christ,' as it is in the text, Looking for the
   mercy of Christ.' You dare venture your soul in that bottom. This is
   that committing yourselves to him as unto a merciful and faithful
   creator,' which the apostle speaketh of, 1 Peter iv. 19. You will go on
   with your work, and put yourselves in God's hand for your eternal
   happiness, because he is merciful, faithful. See also Rom. ii. 7.

   3. Meditate on it often. Meditation is a temperate ecstasy, a survey of
   the land of promise. God biddeth Abraham take a view of Canaan, Gen.
   xiii. 14, 15. Surely the more we lift up our thoughts in the
   contemplation of this blessed estate, the more lively will our hopes
   be. If every morning we spent a thought this way, it would season the
   heart against the love of present things. The morning is an emblem of
   the resurrection, when we awake out of the sleep of death, and the day
   cometh which will never have night more, Ps. xvii. 15. So in time of
   troubles we should be reckoning upon a better estate, Rom. viii. 18.
   So, when you are by bodily sickness summoned to the grave, and you are
   going down to converse with worms and skulls, then think of a blessed
   eternity, Job xix. 26.

   Obs. 6. The next point is from that clause, the mercy. The ground of
   our waiting and looking for eternal life is God's mercy, not for any
   works or merits of ours; we cannot challenge it as a debt: sin and
   death are as work and wages, but eternal life is a donative, Rom. vi.
   23. Eternal life is not the wages of obedience, as damnation is the
   wages of sin. Why, wherein lieth the difference? I answer--Wicked men
   stand upon their own bottom, but Christ hath obtained this privilege
   for us. Wicked works are ours, and they are merely evil, the good that
   we do is imperfect, and God's grace hath the main stroke, so that we
   are rewarded rather according to what we have received than what we
   have done. A servant is under a covenant of obedience, and tradeth with
   his master's estate, he doth but his duty, he deserveth something.
   [170] We are bound to do good and forbidden to sin; when we do what is
   forbidden we deserve punishment, but when we do what is commanded we do
   not deserve the reward, because we are bound, and because we have all
   from God's grace: as you must pray for eternal life, so must you look
   for eternal life.' If you should say, Give me heaven for I deserve it,
   natural conscience would blush at the immodesty of such a request. It
   is as great an absurdity when you make your own works the ground of
   your hope, for in prayer our desires and hopes are put into language,
   and made more explicit; so that which is our plea in prayer must be the
   ground of our claim in point of confidence, unless we mean to
   compliment with God. Well, then--

   1. Let this encourage us to wait with hope, notwithstanding infirmities
   as as well afflictions. What a good master do we serve! He hath
   provided comforts not only against our misery, but against our
   unworthiness; not only glory as a reward, but mercy as the cause of it
   that we may take glory out of the hands of mercy. He looked upon us not
   only as liable to suffering, but sinning; and therefore, as he hath
   provided life and safety for us, so upon terms of grace.

   2. It showeth us how we should ascribe all to mercy, from the beginning
   to the end of our salvation. We were taken into a state of grace at
   first out of mere mercy: 1 Tim. i. 13, elee'then, I was all to [171]
   be-mercied; Titus iii. 5, Not by works of righteousness that we have
   done, but according to his mercy he saved us.' He doth not barely say,
   Not for our works, but Not for our works en dikaiosu'ne, not for our
   best works, those works of righteousness which might be supposed to be
   foreseen as done by us. So also when we are taken into a state of
   glory, it is still mercy, we can merit no more after grace than before:
   2 Tim. i. 18, The Lord grant him that he may find mercy of the Lord in
   that day.'

   Obs. 7. Once more, this mercy is called the mercy of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. Thence observe, that this mercy which we look for is dispensed
   by Jesus Christ; he purchased it, and he hath the managing of it in the
   whole economy of grace: He shall take of mine,' saith he, concerning
   the Holy Ghost; and in the last day he distributeth to some judgment
   without mercy,' to others mercy;' they are judged upon gospel terms.
   Well, then--

   1. Get an interest in Christ, otherwise we cannot look for mercy in
   that great day: 1 John ii. 28, If we abide in him, then shall we have
   boldness.' They that slight Christ in the offers of the gospel have no
   reason to look for benefit by him; you will howl and tremble then, and
   call upon the mountains to hide you from the wrath of him that sitteth
   upon the throne.' They that prize the mercy of Christ now, they find it
   to be the very last; mercy, that planted grace in their hearts, will
   then put the crown upon their heads. Here it was their care to glorify
   Christ and to honour him, though with the loss of all; there will
   Christ glorify them in the presence of all the world.

   2. It maketh for the comfort of Christ's people and members. Our
   blessed hopes are founded upon the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
   in his hands to dispense them. From thence you may collect:--

   [1.] The fulness of this blessedness. An infinite merit purchased it,
   an infinite mercy bestoweth it. Surely the building will be answerable
   to the foundation. It is no small thing that we may expect from
   infinite mercy and infinite merit. Would an emperor give brass
   farthings? Do men that understand themselves give vast sums for
   trifles?

   [2.] The certainty of this blessedness. Christ hath the managing of it.
   He never discovered any backwardness to thy good nor inclination to thy
   ruin; he died for thee before thou wert born; he called thee when thou
   wert unworthy; warned thee of dangers which thou never fearedst;
   instead of deserved wrath, showed thee undeserved mercy; intercedeth
   for thee when thou little thinkest of it; hath been tender of thee in
   the whole conduct of his providence; visited thee in ordinances; is
   mindful of thee at every turn, and will he be harsh to thee at last?

   The last note is from that clause unto eternal life. The great benefit
   which we have by Christ is eternal life.

   1. There is life; all that you labour for is for life, that which you
   prize above other things is life: Skin for skin, all that a man hath
   will he give for his life;' that is, he will part with all things, even
   to his very skin, to save his life.

   2. It is an excellent life. [172] The life of sense, which is the
   beasts', is better than that vegetative life which is in the plants,
   and the rational life which is in men is better than the sensitive, and
   the spiritual exceedeth the rational, and the glorious life the
   spiritual. Vegetative life is the vigour of the sap, sensitive life is
   the vigour of the blood, rational life is the union of the soul with
   the body, spiritual life is the union of the soul with Christ, and the
   life of glory exceedeth that in degree, for it standeth in the
   immediate fruition of God.

   3. It is a happy life, not subjected to the necessities of meat and
   drink. We have then spiritual bodies,' 1 Cor. xv. 45. It is not
   encumbered with miseries as the present life is, Gen. xlvii. 9. It is a
   life which we are never weary of; in deep distress life itself may
   become a burden: Elijah said, Take away my life,' 1 Kings xix. 4. But
   this life cannot be a burden.

   4. It is eternal life. This life is but a flower that is soon withered,
   a vapour that is soon blown over; but this is for ever and ever, as
   eternity increaseth the torment of the wicked, so the blessedness of
   the godly. Well, then, let this press you to keep yourselves in the
   love of God till this happy estate come about.

   Ver. 22, 23. And of some have compassion, making a difference: and
   others save with fear, putting them out of the fire; hating even the
   garment spotted by the flesh.

   Here is the second part of the exhortation, explaining their duty
   towards others, or teaching them how to behave themselves to them that
   were gone astray.

   Of some have compassion. The Vulgar readeth quite to another sense, and
   some being reproved.' Beza saith that in some Greek copies he found it
   ou`s me'n ele'nchete diakrinome'nous; but the reading which we follow
   is to be preferred; the other is but in few copies, is harsh in
   construction, and mangleth the whole context: ou`s me'n eleeite on
   these have mercy.' It is a word that cometh from another word that
   signifieth bowels, and so noteth not only the gentleness of the
   censure, but the inward affection, or, as we render it, the compassion
   which we should have over them. Putting a difference, diakrino'menoi.
   The word hath many significations, judging, discerning; we most fitly
   render it according to its usual sense and the apostle s scope.

   From the 22d verse observe:--

   Obs. 1. That reproofs must be managed with compassion and holy grief;
   our words must have bowels in them. This is like God: He doth not
   afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men,' Lam. iii. 33. There
   are tears in his eyes when he hath a rod in his hand. It is like
   Christ: He wept when he drew near the city,' Luke xix. 41. The Jews
   were his enemies, and that was the day of his solemn triumph, yet he
   wept: Oh! that thou hadst known the things of thy peace.' It is
   suitable to the disposition of God's servants in all ages. Samuel left
   Saul, but wept for him, 1 Sam. xv. 35. Paul speaketh of very wretches
   that made a design of the gospel to gratify their belly concernments: I
   tell you weeping,' saith he, Phil. iii. 18, 19. There are three grounds
   of this holy grief:--

   1. The dishonour done to God, Ps. cxix. 136. Love will be affected with
   the wrong of the party loved. If we see a man kill a friend or child
   whom we love, the sword would pass through our own hearts,' Luke ii.
   35. Shall we see them strike at God and not be troubled?

   2. The harm and destruction men bring upon themselves, that they have
   no care of their own souls, Jer. xiii. 17.

   3. The proneness that is in our nature to the same sin, Gal. vi.-l.
   Bernard's good man would weep ille hodie et ego cras--he to-day and I
   to-morrow: there is no sin in their lives but was in your nature. Well,
   then, it checketh them that speak of others sins by way of reproof or
   censure, but with delight or petulancy of spirit; many reproofs are
   lost, because there is more of passion than compassion in them. It is
   spiritual cruelty when you can turn a finger in your brother's wound
   without grief. Reproofs are delightful sometimes out of the sweetness
   of revenge, or hatred, and ill-will to the persons of men; sometimes
   out of pride, or a desire to vaunt it and insult over others; sometimes
   from self-conceit, and non-consideration of our own faultiness. Oh!
   consider this is not Christian dealing. Paul saith, I am afraid lest,
   when I come among you, my God will humble me, and that I shall bewail
   many,' &c., 2 Cor. xii. 21. Many a proud Pharisee would have blustered,
   and threatened them with the severity of discipline; but Paul was
   afraid he should have a heavy load upon his own soul.

   Obs. 2. Again, and more expressly, observe, that in reproving some must
   be handled gently: but who are those that must be handled gently?

   1. With the most notorious it is good to begin mildly, that they may
   see our good-will and desire of their salvation, 2 Tim. ii. 25. Hasty
   spirits cannot brook the least opposition, and therefore are all a-fire
   presently. How did God deal with us in our natural condition? with what
   lenity and mildness? and spake comfortably' to us, to allure us out of
   the devil's snare, Hosea ii. 14.

   2. The persons whom we should treat with much compassion are these:

   [1.] The ignorant and seduced. Some are of a simple and weak heart: the
   young men that went with Absalom went in the simplicity of their
   hearts, and knew not anything,' 2 Sam. xv. 11. Though swine or dogs be
   driven with violence, yet poor stray lambs must be brought home, as the
   shepherd brought home his lost sheep upon his shoulders rejoicing,'
   Luke xv. Many well-meaning men may err; be not too severe with them,
   lest prejudice make them obstinate, and so from erring brethren,' they
   become heretical. [173]

   [2.] Those that slip of infirmity. Members must be set in joint'
   tenderly, Gal. vi. 1. The carnal world reflects with most sharpness
   upon the infirmities of God's people. The late bishops' courts were
   chiefly bent against the godly; a drunkard and an adulterer found more
   favour than a goodly inconformist. Let us learn to distinguish betwixt
   an evil course and inconsiderate slips, and as long as there is
   anything of Christ, be not too severe, 2 Thes. iii. 15.

   [3.] The afflicted in conscience. We must not speak to the grief of
   those whom God hath wounded.' The apostle would have the incestuous
   person comforted, lest he should be swallowed up of too much grief,' 2
   Cor. ii. 7. When Adam was troubled, though God reproved him, yet he
   made him a coat of skins to cover his nakedness; when Peter was
   weeping, Christ sendeth a comfortable message to him: Go, tell my
   disciples and Peter,' &c., Mark xvi. 7.

   [4.] If they err in smaller matters. We must not deal with motes as
   with beams, and put the wicked and the scrupulous in the same rank, nor
   the gross heretic, and those that mistake in point of church order.
   While the judgment is sound in fundamentals, and the practice is
   reformed, we should use meekness till God reveal the same thing,' Phil.
   iii. 15, 16. God hath given them light in most things, and those which
   are most necessary, and in time will discover those truths to them
   whereof they are yet ignorant.

   [5.] The tractable, and those of whom we have any hopes. Rehoboam would
   deal roughly, and so lost ten tribes. Tertullian was even forced into
   the tents of the Montanists by the indiscreet zeal of some who were too
   forward with censures; and still men are lost that otherwise would be
   reclaimed. Differences are made irreconcileable by the imperious
   sourness and bitterness of those that manage them. Dashing storms wash
   away the seed, whereas gentle showers refresh the earth: men left
   without hope grow desperate.

   Obs. 3. From that putting a difference. In all censures and punishments
   there must be choice used and discretion. Prudence is the queen of
   graces. Different tempers require different remedies. The prophet
   saith, Isa. xxviii. 27, in husbandry the fitches are not thrashed with
   a thrashing instrument, neither is a cart-wheel turned about upon the
   cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin
   with a rod;' so all tempers do not need a like dispensation. God
   himself putteth a difference: some are brought in with violence, others
   gently. Grace forceth open the door of the heart sometimes, and cometh
   in like a mighty rushing wind;' at other times it breatheth upon the
   soul with a gentler blast. Some are caught with guile,' 2 Cor. xii. 16,
   others directly knocked down. This showeth:--

   1. That ministers had need be wise, to know how to suit their doctrine,
   to distinguish between persons, actions, circumstances. Deep learning,
   much godliness, and great prudence make an accomplished minister. It
   was said of Chrysostom, that he was di' aplo'teta euchare`s too easy,
   and so did not many times manage things so wisely; and so of
   Epiphanius, di uperba'llousan eula'beian aplo'ikos on. It is good to be
   well-read in persons, to note circumstances, and times. Paul striketh
   in with Felix, treateth of an apt lesson before him and Brasilia, Acts
   xxv. 25. Felix was a very incontinent person, and very unjust. [174]
   Paul, to give him his due, treateth of righteousness and temperance and
   judgment to come.'

   2. That ministers should give every one their portion. Zuinglius, when
   he had flashed terrors in the face of the hardened sinner, would add,
   Bone Christiane, haec niliil ad te--tender conscience! this is not for
   thee. We must rightly divide the word of truth,' 2 Tim. ii. 15; that
   is, not by crumbling and mincing a text of scripture, but giving every
   one their portion. Terror to whom terror belongeth, and comfort to whom
   comfort belongeth.

   3. It showeth what care we should take to know the state of our flock,'
   Prov. xxvii. 23, that we may know how to apply ourselves to them, Col.
   iv. 8, Tychicus was sent to the Colossians to know their state.' It
   also obligeth private Christians to consider each other's temper,
   gifts, frame of heart, that we may the better suit ourselves to do and
   receive good; see Heb. x. 24, 25.

   In the 23d verse is the other part of that duty which they owed to
   straying brethren. And others; those that are of another strain and
   temper. Save; that is, do your endeavour to be instruments of their
   salvation: see 1 Tim. iv. 16, Thou shalt save thyself, and them that
   hear thee.' With fear; that is, by some more severe course; either
   making the admonition more sharp, or denouncing judgment against them,
   or by the reverent use of church censures, which were then dreadful, as
   being solemnly managed and accompanied with some sensible marks of
   God's vengeance, 1 Cor. v. 5, anguish of spirit, or possibly torments
   of body. Pulling them out of the fire. Some make it an allusion to the
   several ways of purgation, by water or by fire. These latter, like the
   harder metals, are to be pulled out of the fire; but this seemeth to be
   forced. Rather it is an allusion to the snatching of a man whom we
   would save out the fire where he is likely to be burned. We then not
   only nicely reach out the hand, but pluck them out with violence; or it
   may be an allusion to Lot's being plucked out of Sodom by angels, Gen.
   xix. 16. Hating the garment spotted by the flesh. It is a figurative
   speech; some apply it to the avoiding of the appearance of evil.' There
   is a story of Valentinian in Theodoret, [175] who, accompanying Julian
   the Apostate to the temple of fortune, and those that had charge of the
   house sprinkled their holy water upon the emperor; a drop falling upon
   his garment, he beat the officer, memolu'sthai phe'sas, ou
   kekatha'rsai, saying that he was-polluted, not purged, and tore off the
   piece of his garment upon which the drop lighted, hating,' saith the
   historian, the garment spotted by the flesh.' But rather the expression
   alludeth to the old law concerning legal uncleanness: Lev. xv. 4, The
   bed whereon he lieth is unclean;' and ver. 17, Every garment is
   unclean;' and therefore I suppose it noteth their avoiding the society
   of such evil persons, as in the greater excommunication they were wont
   to do, which separation was a solemn profession how much the church did
   detest the wickedness.

   Obs. 1. There is a time when we may use severity; others save with
   fear.' Weak physic doth but stir bad humours, not purge them out;
   nettles, if gently touched, sting the more; fair, plausible lectures do
   hurt to seared hypocrites. There is a time for the trumpet as well as
   the pipe. When we pipe to men in the alluring strains of grace, and
   they dance not, then Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a
   trumpet,' Isa. lviii. 1. But who are these others who must be dealt
   with roughly? I answer:--

   1. The seducers themselves. These must be laid forth in their colours,
   though the seduced must be pitied: see Titus i. 11 with 13, They
   subvert whole houses, teach things which they ought not; them rebuke
   sharply.' The prophet flouteth at Baal's priests, 1 Kings xviii. 27;
   and Christ everywhere giveth the Pharisees their due load: Oh! ye
   generation of vipers,' and Scribes and Pharisees and hypocrites.'

   2. Those that are hardened, and grown perverse and stubborn. When the
   iron is blunt we put to the more strength; softer strains would but
   harden these more.

   3. Those that are secure libertines, wallowing in sin and pleasure. We
   had need put them in fear;' though it be distasteful to the flesh, it
   is healthful for the soul. None hate you worse than those that suffer
   sin upon you.' If physic gripe the bowels, it is for your good. If the
   chirurgeon lance and cut you, yet he doth not hate you.

   Obs. 2. Observe, this severity must arise from zeal, a desire of God's
   glory and their salvation. Save them with fear,' saith the apostle,
   plucking them out of the fire;' see 2 Cor. x. 8, The Lord hath given us
   an authority for your edification, not destruction,' so that either God
   will have us use gentle means, or violent to a gentle purpose: Titus i.
   13, Rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith.' Well,
   then--(1.) Take admonitions in good part it is a sharpness needful and
   profitable; he is not a friend that dealeth mannerly with you when you
   are in the fire. (2.) It reproveth the undue use of church censures;
   weighty ordinances are not to lackey upon trifles, nor to be
   prostituted to carnal ends. The power of the keys' is a great trust,
   and is to be faithfully managed; we read of abuses of this power in
   scripture, John ix. 34, and xvi. 2; 2 John 10. The watch men may take
   away the spouse's veil, Cant. v.

   Obs. 3. Again, observe, that fear is a way to reclaim obstinate
   sinners. It is sweet to use arguments of love, but sometimes we must
   lay before men the terrors of the Lord,' 2 Cor. v. 11: Paul, an elect
   vessel, made use of threatenings, 1 Cor. ix. 27. Surely men have a mind
   to sleep in sin when they would always have us come in the still voice.
   Dives was more charitable than they would have us to be; he would fain
   dismiss a flamy messenger to his brethren, Luke xvi. 27, 28. Sluggish
   creatures need the goad. In innocency God saw it meet to propound a
   threatening, and fenced the forbidden fruit with a curse, Gen. ii. 17.
   If a boisterous lust bear down all milder motives, it is good to scare
   the soul with threatenings of the law. Fear is good, but the servility
   or slavishness of it is sinful; fear itself, or a tender sense of God's
   wrath and displeasure against sin, is so far from being a sin, that it
   is a grace rightly conversant with its object. God's wrath and
   vindicative justice is the proper object of fear, and so it must be
   looked upon by the converted and unconverted. (1.) For the unconverted:
   It is the great fault and security that they do not consider what a
   dreadful thing it is to lie under the wrath and displeasure of God, Ps.
   xc. 11. There is but a step between them and hell, and they mind it
   not. Tell them of their danger, and they scorn it. (2.) The converted
   are to fear God's wrath, Mat. x. 28. It is a duty Christ enjoineth to
   his own disciples. The words do not only contain a description of the
   person who ought to be feared, but of the ground and reason why he
   ought to be feared; Fear him who is able to cast body and soul into
   hell -fire,' is as much as because he is able to cast body and soul
   into hell-fire,' as appeareth by the antithesis, Fear not them that
   kill the body,' that is, because they are able to kill the body; see
   also Heb. xii. 28, 29. Though we are not to fear hell as an evil likely
   to fall upon us, when we are assured of God's favour, yet we must fear
   it, as an evil which God hath power to inflict, and will certainly upon
   those that disobey him. We are to fear it so as to eschew it, with a
   fear of flight and aversation, not with a perplexing and doubting fear.

   Well, then, so far it is good; but now the servility, that is sinful.
   The servility is seen partly in the disingenuity of it, when our own
   smart and torture is more feared than the displeasing of God, as a
   slave careth not how his master's goods go to wreck, so he may avoid
   stripes. Partly because it is accompanied with an enmity against God.
   Slavish fear hateth God for his holiness, and feareth him for his
   wrath; they wish his destruction, that there were no God. Partly
   because it causeth but an incomplete reformation; it makes a man
   forbear sin, but not hate sin. A wolf may be scared from the prey, that
   yet keepeth his preying and devouring nature. Partly because there is
   torment and perplexity in it, 1 John iv. 18. A tender conscience is a
   blessing, but a stormy conscience is a judgment. Slaves are exercised
   with the torture and rack of perplexing fears.

   Obs. 4. Again, from that pulling them out of the fire. A poor, guilty,
   secure sinner is like a drunken man that is fallen into the fire. He is
   so in three respects:--

   1. In point of security. A drunkard is ready to be burned, but he
   feeleth it not; so they are upon the brink of hell, but are not
   sensible of it: Eph. iv. 19, past feeling.'

   2. In point of danger. Sinners are often compared to a brand in the
   burning,' Zech. iii. 2, Amos iv. 11. They are already under the wrath
   of God, as a believer hath eternal life whilst he is here in the world.
   They are in the suburbs of hell, the fire is already kindled.

   3. In point of impotency and inability to help themselves. A sottish
   drunkard, that is overpoised by his own excess, lieth where he falleth,
   and except some friendly hand lift him up, there he perisheth; and just
   so it is with sinners, they are pleased with their condition, and if
   they be not soundly roused up and awakened, they lie and die, and fry
   in their sins. Oh! then, pluck them out of the fire, warn them to flee
   from wrath to come,' Mat. iii. 7. Minister! art thou sensible of the
   danger of souls? Are thy words as burning coals? Do they fret through
   the heart of a sinner? Christian! art thou sensible of the danger of
   thy carnal neighbours? they are burning in their beds, and thou wilt
   not cry, Fire! fire! they are besotted with lust and error, and wilt
   thou let them alone? Oh, unkind!

   Obs. 5. The next point is from the last clause, hating the garment
   spotted by the flesh. Some sinners are so unclean that we cannot keep
   company with them without defilement; see 1 Cor. v. 9-11; 2 Thes. iii.
   14; and 2 Tim. iii. 5, From such turn away.' Now, the reason is partly
   for our own caution. Evils made familiar by a customary converse seem
   less odious. [176] Partly to vindicate the honour of Christ and the
   societies of his people. The blemishes of their miscarriages redounds
   to the whole church, Heb. xii. 15, till they be disclaimed. Partly to
   punish the offenders, that it may be a means to reduce them, 2 Thes.
   iii. 14. It is a sad thing to live an outcast from God's people. Let
   obstinate and scandalous sinners think of it, and let others learn to
   bear reverence to church censures.

   Ver. 24. Now unto him that is able to Jceep you from falling, and to
   present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding
   joy.

   The apostle having persuaded them to duty, now commendeth them to the
   divine grace, as it is usual with the apostles to shut up their
   exhortations with prayer, to intimate that the fruit of all must be
   expected from God, without whose blessing exhortations or endeavours
   would be nothing.

   To him that is able to keep you, it may be referred either to God, or
   to Christ as Mediator: from falling, aptai'stous, that is, from total
   apostasy. God is able to keep us altogether from sin, if we speak of
   his absolute power; but he speaketh here of such a power as is engaged
   by promise and office. Christ, who is the guardian of believers, hath
   received a charge concerning them, and is to preserve them from total
   destruction. And to present you faultless. This clause showeth more
   clearly that Christ is intended in these expressions; for it is his
   office to keep the church till it be presented to the Father, and at
   length will present them faultless; it is, Eph. v. 27, Without spot and
   blemish.' Before the presence of his glory; that is, at his glorious
   appearance, Col. iii. 4, when he shall come to judge the world. With
   exceeding joy is meant rather passively on our part than on Christ's,
   though it will be a sweet interview between Christ and believers, and
   he will rejoice to see us, as we to see him.

   The observations are these:--

   Obs. 1. All means without the Lord's grace will not keep us from
   falling. The apostle requireth duty of the faithful, but asketh grace
   of God. He had before said, Keep yourselves in the love of God,' and
   now to him that is able to keep from falling,' &c. We fall not because
   God doth not let go his hold; our necessities and difficulties are so
   great that nothing less than a divine power can support us: 1 Peter i.
   5, Ye are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.' This
   power of God is set a-work to encourage hope, not to check industry;
   use means, but look for his blessing. We cannot stand a moment longer
   than God upholdeth us; we are as a staff in the hand of a man; take
   away the hand, and the staff falleth to the ground; or rather, as a
   little infant in the nurse's hand, Hosea xi. 3; if we are left to our
   own feet we shall soon fall and get a knock; created grace will never
   hold out against so many difficulties. One of the fathers bringeth in
   the flesh, saying, Ego deficiam, I shall fail; the world, Ego decipiam,
   I will deceive them; the devil, Ego eripiam, I will take them away; but
   God saith, Ego custodiam, I will keep them, never fail them, nor
   forsake them; and there lieth our safety. The world is full of snares;
   we are carnal, and there are carnal persons about us, and the devil is
   a restless enemy watching all advantages; and surely having so much
   pride in us, and love of pleasures, and so many worldly desires, we
   give them him but too, too often. Therefore, unless God keep us, we
   shall be tossed to and fro like feathers with the wind of every
   temptation.

   Obs. 2. Observe, that it is a great relief to faith to consider that
   God is able to keep us. Accordingly you find it urged in scripture, see
   John x. 28, 29, 1 Peter i. 5, Rom. xiv. 4, He shall be holden up, for
   God is able to make him stand.' The two pillars of the temple were Boaz
   and Jachin, strength, and he will establish; the power of God and mercy
   of God are the two pillars upon which our confidence standeth. The
   power of God is a relief upon a threefold account:--

   1. Because the great trouble of the soul ariseth from a disbelief of
   God's power. We stumble at his can rather than at his will. One said,
   Mat. viii. 2, Lord, if thou wilt thou canst;' but another said, Mark
   ix. 22, If thou canst do anything, help us.' When we consider our own
   infirmities and corrupt inclinations, and the sundry temptations and
   allurements that we meet with in the world, the many lets and
   discouragements which befall us in our heavenly course, we think we
   shall never hold out to the end, so that want of power is our greatest
   trouble; but when we stay ourselves upon the name of God,' and consider
   how almighty his power is to bear down all created op position, it is a
   great relief to the soul.

   2. Because the power of God is engaged to help us. It doth not simply
   follow that because God can keep us, that therefore he will keep us.
   But God hath promised to keep us, Jer. xxxii. 40; and he hath power
   enough to make good his word, and therefore we cannot miscarry.

   [1.] There is a charge laid upon Christ; we are put into his hands,
   John x. 28. He hath not only leave to save the elect, but a charge to
   save the elect; see John vi. 37, 38, 40. They are under his care, and
   surely he will employ the whole power of the Godhead rather than be
   unfaithful. He is to be answerable for those that are given to him at
   the last day.

   [2.] The invincible power of God is set a-work by his unchangeable
   love, so that we may be confident that what he is able to do he will do
   for us; the power and authority of a relation or friend of ours in
   court is an encouragement whilst the friendship and relation lasteth.

   3. The last reason is because the power of God is many ways exercised
   for our preservation, partly by way of internal influence, swaying the
   heart and inclining it to his fear. If the will of man were exempt from
   the dominion of God, then God had made a creature too hard for himself.
   Partly in overruling and disposing the temptation, that it shall not be
   too great for us: 1 Cor. x. 13, Faithful is God, who will not suffer
   you to be tempted above what you are able to bear.' Partly, in removing
   the temptation, rebuking Satan and his instruments, &c. Well, then,
   commit your souls to Christ with the more confidence: 2 Tim. i. 12, I
   know whom I have believed, and that he is able to keep that which I
   have committed unto him unto that day.' When the difficulties of
   salvation are sufficiently understood, there will need explicit
   thoughts of the divine power before we can with any confidence trust
   ourselves with Christ, and go on with encouragement in well-doing.

   Obs. 3. Jesus Christ will one day make a solemn presentation of his
   people to God; the apostle saith here he will present you.' There is a
   threefold presentation spoken of in scripture:--

   1. One made by believers themselves, Rom. xii. 1, I beseech you by the
   mercies of God that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice,' and
   Rom. vi. 13, Yield yourselves unto God.' paraste'sate eautou`s to Theo.
   When we consent to set apart ourselves for God's use, to be his in all
   estates, to act for him in all his businesses, then we are said to
   yield up or present ourselves to God.

   2. By Christ's messengers; they have a charge, and when they have done
   their work they present us to God: 2 Cor. xi. 2, That I may present you
   a chaste virgin to Christ.' It is sweet when ministers can say, Here
   are the fruits of my labours, the pledges of my faithfulness.

   3. This presentation is applied to Christ himself. Now two ways is
   Christ said to present us:--(1.) To himself; (2.) To God.

   [1.] To himself, Eph. v. 27, That he might present it to himself a
   glorious church.' In that place our interest in Christ and his interest
   in us is represented by marriage; in the world we are contracted, but
   there presented, actually brought to him when fitted for his use, as
   Esther when she was chosen out from among the virgins to be wife to the
   king, she was first purified and supplied with garments, odours, and
   sweet ointments out of the king's house, and then when the months of
   her purification were accomplished, was presented to him, Esther ii.
   9-12, so we are chosen,' elected to grace,' and-then purified and
   prepared, but at the king's cost; we have garments of salvation out of
   Christ's wardrobe, and odours and sweet ointments out of his store
   house, and then when spot and wrinkle is done away, we are presented to
   him; he is said to do it, because he hath the main stroke in this work.

   [2.] To God; so it is said, Col. i. 22, That he may present you in his
   sight;' that is, in the sight of God the Father; for the antecedent you
   find in ver. 19, It pleased the Father,' &c. Thus Christ is said to
   give up the kingdom to the Father,' 1 Cor. xv. 24-28; that is, the
   church, the kingdom is put for the subjects governed. Now Christ's
   presenting us to God may be looked upon either--

   (1.) As an account of his charge. In effect he saith, I have done the
   work for which thou hast sent me. Christ is under an office and
   obligation of faithfulness, he hath a trust of which he must give an
   account; he is to take care of the persons of the elect, to justify,
   sanctify, and glorify them in his own day. Now that it may appear that
   he is not unfaithful in his trust, he doth present them to God, as
   having fully done his work, so that to doubt of his willingness to
   pardon, or sanctify, or glorify, is in effect to charge unfaithfulness
   and disobedience upon him; for Christ, as Mediator, is subordinate, he
   is God's:' 1 Cor. iii. 23, xi. 3, The head of Christ is God,'--namely,
   with respect to this office and charge; so he is under God and to give
   an account to him. He hath under taken to make up all breaches between
   God and us. As to the merit and satisfaction, he gave an account a
   little before his going to heaven, John xvii. 4; but as to the
   application to every party concerned, he will give an account in the
   last day, when he will present himself and all his flock, saying,
   Behold I and all the little ones which thou hast given me,' Heb. ii.
   13, when all the elect are gathered into one troop and company, and not
   one wanting.

   (2.) As an act of delight and rejoicing in his own success, that all
   that were given to him are now fit to be settled in their blessed and
   glorious estate. Christ taketh a great deal of delight to see the proof
   and virtue of his death, and that his blood is not shed in vain, as a
   minister taketh delight in those whom he hath gained to God: What is
   our hope, our joy, our crown of rejoicing? are not ye in the day of the
   Lord?' 1 Thes. ii. 19. If we rejoice thus in the fruit of our
   ministerial labours, surely Christ much more; we have not such an
   interest in them as Christ hath, and the main virtue came from his
   death and Spirit. It is said Isa. liii. 11, He shall see of the travail
   of his soul, and be satisfied;' that may be understood either of his
   foreseeing from all eternity, or of his actual seeing when the whole is
   accomplished. If you understand it of his foreseeing, the expression is
   not altogether alien from the point in hand. When Christ foresaw the
   good success of the gospel, and what a company he should gain to
   himself in all ages, he rejoiced at the thought of it. Well, saith he,
   I will go down and suffer for poor creatures upon these terms. But
   rather I understand it of his sight of the thing when it is
   accomplished, when he shall see his whole family together, met in one
   congregation. Now, saith he, I count my blood well bestowed, my bitter
   agony well recompensed; these are my crown and my rejoicing. Look, as
   the first person delighted in the fruits of his personal operation, for
   so it is said, Exod. xxxi. 17, In six days God made heaven, and on the
   seventh day he rested, and was refreshed;' he was refreshed, not in
   point of weariness, but delectation; he rejoiced in the product of his
   wisdom, power, and goodness; so Christ in the work of redemption, when
   his death turneth to good account, he will delightfully present you to
   God as the proof of it. These are those whom I have redeemed,
   sanctified, and kept, &c.

   (3.) It is an act of his love and recompense to the faithful; they have
   owned him in the world, and Christ will own them before God, men, and
   angels; there is no saint so mean but Christ will own him: Luke xii. 8,
   The Son of man shall confess him,' &c. Father, this is one of mine. As
   for his enemies, Christ will see execution done upon them: Slay them
   before my face,' Luke xix. 27. To his friends he will own them
   publicly, and that they be honoured before the presence of his glory.'

   Well, then, see that you be of the number of those whom Christ will
   present to God. If he hath purified you to himself,' Titus ii. 14, he
   will present you to himself. If you be set apart for God, Ps. iv. 3,
   you shall be brought to God. The work is begun here; privately it is
   done at our deaths, when the soul, as soon as it is out of the body, is
   conveyed by angels to Christ, and by Christ to God; and publicly and
   solemnly at the day of his coming; then he presents the elect as a prey
   snatched out of the teeth of lions; but spiritually the foundation is
   laid when you dedicate yourselves to God.' Rom. xii. 1, and walk so as
   Christ may own you with honour and credit in that great day. If you be
   the scandal of his ordinances, the reproach of your profession, can
   Christ glory in you then as a sample of the virtue of his death? Surely
   no.

   Obs. 4. Again observe, that when Christ presenteth the elect he will
   present them faultless,' that is, both in respect of justification and
   sanctification. This was intended before the world was: Eph. i. 4, He
   hath chosen us before the foundation of the world, that we should be
   holy and without blame before him in love;' but is not accomplished
   till then. Now we are humbled with many infirmities and sins, but then
   presented holy, unblamable, and unreprovable in his sight,' Col. i. 22.
   The work is undertaken by Christ, and he will carry it on till it be
   complete: here the wedding garments are making, but then put on.

   1. The work must be begun here; the foundation is laid as soon as we
   are converted unto God, 1 Cor. vi. 11.

   2. This work increaseth daily more and more, 1 Thes. v. 23, 24. We are
   not faultless; but Christ will not rest till we be faultless, he is
   sanctifying further and further, that we may be blameless at his
   coming; he will pursue the work close till it be done.

   3. It is so carried on for the present that our justification and
   sanctification may help one another; the benefit of justification would
   be much lessened if our sanctification were complete, and our
   sanctification is carried on the more kindly because the benefit of
   justification needeth so often to be renewed and applied to us; if our
   inherent righteousness were more perfect, imputed righteousness would
   be less set by. In this great imperfection under which we now are, we
   are too apt to fetch all our peace and comfort from our own works, to
   the great neglect of Christ and his righteousness; therefore doth the
   Lord by little and little carry on the work of grace, that by the
   continual sense of our defects, and the often making use of
   justification, we may have the higher apprehensions of God's love in
   accepting us in Christ. The relics of sin trouble us as long as we are
   in the world, and so the benefit is made new to us, which otherwise
   would wax old and out of date; and the benefit being made new,
   increaseth our love to God, Luke vii. 47, and putteth us upon the study
   of holiness.

   4. At the last day all is fully accomplished, Col. i. 22. Well, then,
   let us wait upon God with encouragement, and press on to perfection
   upon these hopes. Surely we shall be faultless; Christ would never have
   given us earnest, 2 Cor. i. 22, if he meant not to stand to his
   bargain.

   Obs. 5. The next clause is before the presence of his glory. Note
   thence that Christ's presence at the day of judgment will be exceeding
   glorious; for he will then appear not only as the Son of man, but as
   the Son of God, Mat. xvi. 27; he will then appear not only as the
   saviour but as the judge of the world, both for the terror of the
   wicked, 2 Thes. i. 8, and as a pattern of that glory which shall be put
   upon the godly, Col. iii. 4, and Phil. iii. 21. Well, then, let us not
   despise Christ, now he lieth hid under the veil of the gospel, but with
   comfort let us expect his coming; for when he is glorious we shall
   share with him, and appear also in glory.' And let us not think shame
   of his service, whatever disreputation the world shall put upon it.

   Obs. 6. The last particle in the words is that, with exceeding joy.
   From thence note the day of Christ to the godly is a joyful day. When
   others howl, you shall triumph; when others are dejected, and call upon
   the mountains to cover them,' Rev. vi. 16, you shall lift up the head,
   for your redemption draweth nigh,' Luke xxi. 28. Christ will be glad to
   see you whom he hath carried in his heart from all eternity, for whose
   sake he came into the world and died, and for whom he went back again
   into heaven, that he might negotiate with God in your behalf, and whom
   he now cometh to receive unto himself, that you may be for ever there
   where he is. And surely you that have received Christ into your hearts,
   and loved him though unseen, and served him though with the loss and
   hazard of all, will be glad to see him in all his glory and royalty,
   especially when you shall hear him calling upon you, Come, ye blessed
   of my Father, enter into the kingdom prepared for you.' Oh! that we
   could act over this joy aforehand. Faith is a bird that can sing in
   winter. Before Christ came in the flesh the patriarchs got a sight of
   him by the eagle-eye of faith, and rejoiced at the thought of it: John
   via. 56, Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it and
   was glad.' Oh! surely our hearts should be warmed with the thought of
   that blessed day when we shall be able to say, Yonder, even there, is
   our great Lord I
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ver. 25. To the only wise God, our Saviour, be glory and majesty,
   dominion and power, now and ever. Amen.

   The apostle in this verse goeth on with that doxology which he had
   begun in the former. Here you may take notice of--

   1. The description of the person to whom the praise is given. He is
   described--(1.) By his excellency, the only wise God; (2.) By our
   interest and the benefit we receive by him, and our Saviour.

   2. The ascription of praise, be glory, &c. There is--

   [1.] What is ascribed, glory, majesty, dominion, and power.

   [2.] The duration, how long he would have this ascribed, now and ever.

   [3.] Manner, in what fashion it is ascribed, in the particle amen, with
   which all is sealed and closed up. This particle implieth--(1.) Our
   confidence that it shall be so; (2.) Our hearty affection that it might
   be so. Love saith, Let it be, and faith, It shall be; for faith is a
   prophetic grace. In prayer it answereth itself.

   But let us go over these particulars more fully and distinctly. From
   the description of the person, to the only wise God our Saviour. That
   Christ is God we proved before on ver. 4, and that Christ is a Saviour,
   and how, on the same verse. I shall only now observe:--

   Obs. 1. (1.) That God is wise; (2.) That God is only wise; (3.) That
   Jesus Christ, as Mediator, hath a right to this attribute.

   I begin with the first, that wisdom is ascribed to God. God's wisdom is
   a distinct notion from his knowledge. He doth not only know all things,
   but hath ordered and disposed them with much counsel. The wisdom of God
   is asserted in the word, Job ix. 4, and xii. 13, and proved there by
   what he hath bestowed upon man: He that teacheth man knowledge, shall
   not he know?' Ps. xciv. 10. Whatever man hath from God, God hath it in
   himself in a more eminent degree; and it is also evidenced by the works
   of God, as in the works of creation, providence, and the methods of his
   graces.

   1. Much of his wisdom is seen in creation. There his wisdom is
   discovered in the excellent order of all his works, Ps. civ. 24, 1 Cor.
   i. 21. Their mutual correspondence and fitness for the several ends and
   services for which they were appointed. The order of the world showeth
   the wisdom of God, the order of placing the creatures: see Prov. iii.
   19, 20, The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth, by understanding
   hath he established the heavens, by his knowledge the depths are broken
   up, and the clouds drop down the dew.' The earth is set lowermost as
   the foundation of all the rest, the sea pent up within its channels,
   the air above them both, and the heavens higher than all, the stars and
   planets placed in the firmament, and the fishes in the sea. The order
   of making, God proceeding from things imperfect to perfect; first the
   rude mass, then the heavens and the vast earth and glorious creatures,
   but without life; then the herbs and plants, that have life, but not
   sense and motion; then the brute creatures, that have sense and motion,
   but not reason; then man, with a reasonable soul, after his own image.
   In this order you may observe, first, the dwelling-place is appointed,
   then the food, then the creature that feedeth upon it, the beasts upon
   the herbs, and man upon the beasts. The Queen of Sheba was astonished
   at Solomon's wisdom, when she perceived the well-ordering of his
   family. Certainly, if we did observe the order of nature, we would
   stand wondering more at the wisdom of God. Next observe the
   correspondence that is between all the parts of the world, compared
   sometimes to a building, wherefore God is called techni'tes, an
   artificial builder,' Heb. xi. 10. In this great house every part
   conspireth to the beauty, service, and decency of the whole. The roof
   is heaven; and therefore the spheres are called chambers and storeys in
   the heavens,' Amos ix. 6. The foundation is earth, Job xxxviii. 5, 6.
   The stars and glorious luminaries are the windows, the sea the
   water-course, &c. Sometimes it is compared to the frame and structure
   of man's body Heb. xi. 3, The worlds were framed.' It is in the
   original, katerti'sthai, set in joint, as all the members of the body
   are tied together by several ligaments, &c. Sometimes to an army: Gen.
   ii. 1, The heavens were finished, and all the host of them.' Order is
   necessary everywhere, but especially in a host. There every one must
   keep in his rank and station. Thus the stars have their courses, Judges
   v. 20, and the clouds their courses, Job xxxvii. 12, yea, the
   grasshoppers march in an army, Joel ii. 15. The next thing that showeth
   the wisdom of God is their fitness for use and service. The workman's
   skill is as much commended in the use of an instrument as in the making
   and framing of it. The upper heavens fitted to be the everlasting
   mansion of the saints, the middle heaven to give us light and heat and
   influence, the air, the lower heaven for breath, the earth for
   habitation, the seas for navigation, the herbs and plants for food and
   medicine, &c. Look upon the bodies of living creatures, and tell me if
   there be not a wise God. Galen saith there are six hundred muscles in
   the body of man, and every one fitted for ten uses; so for bones,
   nerves, arteries, and veins. Whosoever observeth their use, situation,
   and correspondence of them, cannot but fall into admiration of the
   wisdom of the maker, who hath thus exactly framed all things at first
   out of nothing, and still out of the froth of the blood. The wisdom of
   men and angels cannot mend the least thing in a fly. The figure,
   colour, quality, quantity of every worm and every flower, with what
   exactness is it ordered! as if God had nothing else to do but to bring
   forth such a creature into the world as the product of his infinite
   wisdom.

   2. Providence; God's wisdom is much seen in the sustentation and
   governing of all things, Eph. i. 11. He worketh all things according to
   the counsel of his will.' Do but observe a little how all things are
   put into a subserviency to God's purpose; sometimes the smallest things
   occasion events of the highest concernment. The occasion of Joseph's
   greatness in Egypt was a dream; a lie cast him into prison, and a dream
   fetched him out. Sometimes the most casual things to us are the most
   necessary means to accomplish that which God aimeth at: A certain man
   drew a bow at peradventure, and smote the king of Israel between the
   joints of the harness,' 1 Kings xxii. 34. Contingencies to us are
   infallible events as to the purposes of God. Voluntary things that
   depend upon the will of man, fall under the ordination of the will of
   God; there is more wisdom shown in ruling a skittish horse than in
   rolling a stone or dead thing. God showeth his wisdom in guiding the
   courses of the stars, but much more in disposing the heart of man,
   Prov. xxi. 1. There is nothing so confused but if you look upon it in
   its result and final tendency, there is beauty and order in it; the
   tumults of the world, the prosperity of the wicked, carnal men think
   them the disgrace and blemish of providence, whereas they are the
   ornament of it: Ps. xcii. 5, Lord, how glorious are thy works! thy
   thoughts are very deep.' Man is discontented because he cannot fathom
   the deep thoughts of providence. Nothing so opposite, so bad, but God
   can bring good out of it; the sins of men set forth the beauty of
   providence, as shadows and black lines in a picture set it off the
   more; see Acts iv. 28, and Job v. 12, 13. Christ hath been beholden to
   his enemies as much as to his friends; their potent opposition hath
   occasioned the further increase of his kingdom.

   3. In the methods of his grace; so I call all the transactions of God
   about the salvation of sinners from first to last; the rejection of the
   Jews, and calling of the Gentiles: Rom. xi. 33, Oh! the depth of the
   riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God;' the various dispensations
   used in the church, before the law, under the law, and time of the
   gospel, these are called polupoi'kilos sophi'a, the manifold wisdom of
   God,' Eph. iii. 10. Redemption by Christ, the great plots of heaven,
   called the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery,' and without controversy
   a great mystery,' 1 Tim. iii. 16; that which angels desire to pry
   into;' God's masterpiece, wherein all things by a rare contrivance are
   ordered for God's glory and man's good, the wonder of it will take up
   our hearts to all eternity; to see the ruins of the fall so exactly
   repaired, the glory of God salved, the comfort of man provided for. O
   ba'thos--oh! the depths of this glorious mystery.

   Again, the various acts of love whereby God subdueth sinners to
   himself; this taking sinners in their month, and disposing of
   unthought-of circumstances and passages of providence in order to their
   conversion. Once more, the overruling of all events to further the
   eternal blessedness of the saints, Rom. viii, 28. In all these I have
   foreborne particular illustrations, that the discourse may not swell up
   into too great a bulk.

   Now, whosoever shall seriously consider these things, will certainly
   conclude God is wise. But further, consider the usual concomitants of
   God's wisdom, and then we may come to make some use of this meditation.

   Wisdom in God is accompanied with immaculate holiness and in finite
   power. In the devils there is great cunning, great power, and much
   wickedness; in man there is much shame, little power, and less wisdom.
   God's power and wisdom are often counted [177] in the expressions of
   scripture: Job ix. 4, He is wise in heart, and mighty in power;' so Job
   xxxvi. 5, He is mighty in strength and wisdom,' the two formidable
   properties in an adversary, [178] and the desirable properties in a
   friend; so see 1 Cor. i. 25. Again, it is joined with holiness; he is
   most wise, and most holy, glorious in holiness,' and rich in wisdom.

   Use 1. Well, then, let us often admire the wisdom of God; look up to
   the heavens, and what do you find there? The work of a wise God, Jer.
   x. 12. Look to the structure of all things round about you, and what
   offereth itself to your thoughts? By his wisdom he hath established the
   world.' Look within you, and you cannot choose but say, O God! I will
   praise thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made,' Ps. cxxxix. 14.
   Look into the scriptures, and consider the stupendous mysteries that
   are revealed there; of the Trinity in unity, God manifested in our
   flesh, a virgin conceiving, Christ dying; and can you hold from crying
   out, Oh! the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of
   God!' Rom. xi. 33. View these things again and again; we cannot take up
   all of God in one or many or all our meditations.

   Use 2. Let not it be a bare speculation, but improve it. (1.) To
   quicken you to prayer; where should we go for wisdom when we need it,
   but to the wise God? See Job xxviii. 12, James i. 5, Job. xxxii. 9.
   Solomon asked wisdom and had it. (2.) Improve it to thanks, when you
   are able to discern your way and your work, Prov. ii. 6. (3.) Improve
   it to waiting: Isa. xxx. 18, He is a God of judgment; blessed are all
   they that wait for him.' When things grow cross, let the wise God alone
   till you see the end of his work; will you be his counsellor, and teach
   him how to manage his affairs? He knoweth how to deliver the godly,'
   &c., 2 Peter ii. 9. (4.) Improve it to patience and contentation; the
   wise God knoweth how to make use of thee in every condition; wherever
   thou art, say, I am there where God hath set me. God knoweth what is
   better for me than I do myself. He that hath put all things in their
   places hath put me in this place, and here I will glorify him, 1 Cor.
   xii. 20. Every cross is chosen and elected as well as your persons.
   There are secrets of wisdom' in providence, that are not always to be
   found in the surface and outside of it, Job xi. 6. Though it appear in
   a way of rigour, yet God may have a design in it of mercy to me and
   glory to himself.

   Obs. 2. The next point is, that God is only wise: see the same
   expression, 1 Tim. i. 17, and Rom. xvi. 27. Why, you will say, this is
   a communicable attribute; God hath endowed man with a spirit of wisdom,
   and human prudence is an emblem and resemblance of divine providence,
   how then is God only wise? I answer--Wisdom in God is in such an
   infiniteness and excess that wisdom in man is but folly in comparison
   of it: there is none wise as he, there is none wise but from him; in
   short, God in three respects is only wise:--

   1. Originally and independently wise, not by communication from
   another, but of himself. Our wisdom is but a ray communicated from the
   father of lights,' James i. 17, a drop from the ocean, a beam from the
   sun; the whole knowledge of the angels is but a spark of this light.

   2. God is essentially wise, and so only wise. Do not understand God to
   be wise as if wisdom had made him wise, as it happeneth among the
   creatures; in them wisdom is a separable quality, distinct from their
   essence. Now God's wisdom is himself, and himself is his wisdom. The
   perfections of the creature are like the gilding which may be laid on
   upon vessels of wood or stone, the matter is one thing and the varnish
   or ornament is another; but the perfections of God are like a vessel
   made of pure beaten gold, where the matter and the splendour or
   adorning is the same.

   3. God is infinitely wise, and so only wise. As the candle giveth no
   light when the sun shineth, our wisdom is bounded within narrow limits,
   and extendeth but to a few things, but God's to all things. We count
   them fools that can only manage petty matters, buy and sell and keep
   out of harm's way. Such fools are all creatures to God, whose wisdom is
   unlimited and incomprehensible. They that can manage a small
   commonwealth with advice and counsel are cried up for wise men; but now
   God manageth the affairs of the whole world, both visible and
   invisible. He careth for all things, from the ant to the angels,
   nothing so small as to escape his knowledge, nothing so great as to
   burden his mind. The sun doth with the same easiness shine upon the
   whole world as upon one field, so doth God manage the government of the
   whole world as of one person or creature. Our wisdom is gotten by
   learning, but who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord?' Isa. xl. 13.
   Our wisdom is bettered by experience, therefore old men are most
   prudent; but God's wisdom is incapable of increase, as being in an
   infinite fulness. We are often deceived. Men of the greatest sagacity
   and cunning fail in their plots and enterprises, and so their wisdom is
   turned into folly;' but it is not so with God, his counsel shall
   stand,' Ps. xxxiii. 11. There can no difficulty occur but what is
   foreseen. He goeth not upon probability and conjecture, but certain
   foreknowledge. Man can attend but upon one care at once; various
   thoughts scatter the mind, and weaken it; but God in one moment of
   understanding seeth all things, and wisely disposeth of all things.
   God's wisdom doth not deliberate with hesitancy, or consult with doubt;
   his thoughts are simple, and not successive, and in the way of
   discourse. Thus you see what good reason there is why God should be
   said to be only wise.

   Well, then, let not the creature seem wiser than God, and cavil at what
   he hath revealed, because we understand it not. We cannot know the
   nature of an ant, we are puzzled in the least creature; no wonder,
   then, if human reason grow giddy when it pryeth into the depths of God.
   There should be upakoe` pi'steos, the obedience of faith,' to all that
   is revealed; and divine truth, like pills, must be swallowed rather
   than chewed, received upon God's single authority, when we see no
   reason for them, for God is only wise.' Again, when you think of the
   perfections of God, you must raise your thoughts above the law and
   manner of all created beings.

   Obs. 3. The next point is, that Christ Jesus our Saviour is worthy to
   be accounted the only wise God. Christ is wise as he is God, and as he
   is man.

   1. As he is God, so he is called the wisdom of the Father,' 1 Cor. i.
   24, and represented to the ancient church under this title; as Prov. i.
   20, and Prov. viii., per totum. Wisdom is there spoken of as a person,
   and the descriptions there used are proper to Jesus Christ. Some
   suppose the heathens had some traditional knowledge of this mystery and
   appellation; for as Christ, the wisdom of the Father, was eternally and
   ineffectably begotten in the divine essence, so they worshipped a
   goddess, whom they called the goddess of wisdom, and feigned that she
   was begotten by Jupiter, of his own brain, and they called her Athene,
   which word is much like in sound with the Hebrew word, Adonai, Lord,

   2. As he is man, he received the habits of all created knowledge and
   wisdom, as all other graces, without measure, John iii.; and so it is
   said, Col. ii. 3, In him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
   knowledge.' Well, then, since Christ hath brought down wisdom to us in
   our own nature, let us be more studious to get it into our hearts. As
   Mediator, he is fitted to make us wise to salvation, and appointed by
   God to be wisdom to us, 1 Cor. i. 30.

   Obs. 4. Once more note, from the other title that is here given to
   Christ, our Saviour. Those that have had any benefit by Christ will be
   very much affected with his praise. There is a double ground of
   exalting Christ--a sight of his excellency, and a sense of his
   benefits; and there is a double notion by which our honouring of Christ
   is set forth--praise and blessing. Praise hath respect to his
   excellency, and blessing to his benefits, Eph. i. 3. We may praise a
   man for his worth, though we have no benefit by him; and so we are
   bound to praise God for the excellency of his nature, though he had
   never done us good. But now, when he is our God and our Saviour,' and
   hath showed us so much of his goodness and mercy in Christ, we should
   be ever praising him: Phil. iv. 20, Now unto God and our Father be
   glory for ever and ever. Amen.' Glory is due to him as God, much more
   as our Father. His worth and excellency, though he were a stranger to
   us, doth deserve an acknowledgment; but when we consider what he is to
   us, and what he hath done for us, then we can hold no longer, the heart
   being affected with a sense of his kindness, breaketh out, To our
   Father, to our Saviour,' be glory for ever and ever. Well, then,
   consider the Lord's excellences more, and observe his benefits, and
   work them upon the heart till you be filled with a deep sense of his
   love, and find such an impulsion in your spirits as you cannot hold
   from breaking out into his praise.

   Obs. 5. I come now from the description to the ascription, to him be
   glory, &c. Can we bestow anything upon God? or wish any real worth and
   excellency to be superadded to him? I answer--No. The meaning is, that
   those which are in God already may be:--

   1. More sensibly manifested: Isa. lxiv. 2, Make thy name known among
   the nations.' It is a great satisfaction to God's people when anything
   of God is discovered; they value it above their own benefit and safety;
   see Ps. cxv. 1. They prefer the glory of mercy and truth before their
   deliverance.

   2. More seriously and frequently acknowledged. It is a great pleasure
   to the saints to see others praise God: Ps. cvii. 8, Oh! that men would
   praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the
   children of men.'

   3. More deeply esteemed, that God may be more in request, more in the
   hearts of men and angels. God's children do not count it enough that
   God is glorified by themselves, but they desire also that God may be
   glorified by others. As fire turneth all things near it into its own
   nature, so is grace diffusive. Good men are loath to go to heaven
   alone, they would travel thither by troops and in company.

   But let us more particularly take a view of this ascription, and so
   first what is ascribed, glory, majesty, dominion, and power. Let us
   open these words. Glory is clara cum laude notitia, excellency
   discovered with praise and approbation, and noteth that high honour and
   esteem that is due to Christ. Majesty is the next word, which implieth
   such greatness and excellency as maketh one honoured and preferred
   above all, therefore a style usually given to kings; but to none so due
   as unto Christ, who is King of kings, and Lord of lords.' The third
   term is dominion, which implieth the sovereignty of Christ over all
   things, especially over the people whom he hath purchased with his
   blood. The last word is power, which signifieth that all-sufficiency in
   God, whereby he is able to do all things according to the good pleasure
   of his will.

   From hence observe:--

   Obs. 6. A gracious heart hath such a sense of God's worth and
   perfection, that it would have all things that are honourable and
   glorious ascribed to him; therefore are divers words here used. When we
   have done our utmost we come short; for God's name is exalted above all
   blessing, and above all praise,' Neh. ix. 5. Yet it is good to do as
   much as we can. Love to God will not be satisfied with a little praise:
   I will praise him yet more and more,' Love enlargeth the heart towards
   God. If there be anything more excellent he shall have it. Well, then,
   it is a sign of a dead heart to be a niggard in praises, to be sparing,
   careless, or cold this way.

   Obs. 7. When we think of God, it is a relief to the soul to consider of
   his glory, majesty, dominion, and power; for this is that which the
   apostle would have to be manifested, acknowledged, and esteemed in God,
   as the ground of our respect to him. It encourageth us in our service.
   We need not think shame of his service, to whom glory, and power, and
   majesty, and dominion belongeth. It hearteneth us against dangers.
   Surely the great and glorious God will bear us out in his work. It
   increaseth our awe and reverence. Shall we serve God in such slight
   fashion as we would not serve the governor? Mal. i. 8. It is a
   lessening of God's majesty. You do not treat him as a great and
   glorious potentate,' Mal. i. 14. It inviteth our prayers. To whom
   should we go in our necessities but to him that hath dominion over all
   things, and power to dispose of them for the glory of his majesty? It
   increaseth our dependence. God is glorious, and will maintain the
   honour of his name, and truth of his promises. When we are daunted by
   earthly potentates, it is a relief to think of the majesty of God, in
   comparison of which all earthly grandeur is but the dream of a shadow.
   Again, God, that hath a sovereignty over all things, and such an
   almighty power to back it, will not be wanting to do that which shall
   make for his glory.

   Obs. 8. The next consideration in this ascription is the duration, now
   and ever. Thence note:--The saints have such large desires for God's
   glory, that they would have him glorified everlastingly, and without
   ceasing. They desire the present age may not only glorify God, but the
   future. When they are dead and gone the Lord remaineth; and they would
   not have him remain without honour. They do not take death so bitterly,
   if there be any hopes that God will have a people to praise him. And
   their great comfort now is the expectation of a great congregation,'
   gathered from the four winds, united to Christ, presented to God, that
   they may remain with him, and glorify him for evermore. It is the
   comfort of their hearts to see this congregation a-making up every day,
   that there are saints and angels to praise God, whilst others grieve
   and dishonour him. They prize their own salvation upon this ground,
   that they shall live for ever to glorify God for ever: see Eph. iii.
   21; Ps. xli. 13, and cvi. 48. Now this they do, partly from their love
   to God's glory, which they prize above their own salvation, Rom. ix. 3;
   partly in thankfulness to God for his everlasting love to them. God is
   from everlasting to everlasting, and his love is from everlasting to
   everlasting, Ps. ciii. 17. He was their God, and will be their God for
   ever and ever, and therefore they purpose to be his people, and to
   praise him for ever and ever. Well, then, get these large desires for
   God's glory, that he may be honoured in all ages, and in all places,
   Ps. cxiii. 2, 3. What have ye done in a tendency hereunto, that
   posterity may praise God? Do you labour to promote the knowledge of
   Christ, and the succession of churches, all the ways that you can? Zeal
   in your place is a good argument that you are well-affected in this
   kind. As a master of a family, hast thou taken care to keep religion
   alive among thy children when thou art dead and gone? Gen. xviii. 19.
   As a merchant, hast thou promoted religion with thy traffic? Deut.
   xxxiii. 18, 19. As a magistrate, dost thou take care to secure the
   interest of Christ to posterity, that the succession of churches may
   not be cut off? Ministers, have you been witnesses for God to the
   present age, and behaved yourselves as trustees for the next age? have
   you taken care that God may be honoured then? that we do not transmit
   prejudices against the ways of God, and corruptions in doctrine and
   worship to posterity? Oh! where is this affection, this wishing, To him
   be glory, now and ever?'

   The last thing in this inscription is the particle, amen, which is
   signaculum fidei et votum desiderii nostri; it signifieth a hearty
   consent to God's promise, and a steady belief that it will continue to
   all generations. This word is often put at the end of prayers and
   doxologies in scripture; see Rev. v. 13, 14, Rom. xvi. 27, Phil. iv.
   20, &c.; and sometimes it is doubled for the greater vehemency, Ps. li.
   13, lxxii. 19, lxxxix. 52; and it seemeth by that passage of the
   apostle that anciently it was audibly pronounced by the people in
   public assemblies at the conclusion of prayers, 1 Cor. xiv. 16, and
   since that Jerome telleth us that amen ecclesiae instar tonitru
   reboabat--that the amen was so heartily sounded out by the church, that
   it seemed like a crack of thunder.

   Obs. 9. Certainly it is good to conclude holy exercises with some
   vigour and warmth. Natural motion is swifter in the end and close; so
   should our spiritual affections be more vehement as we draw to a
   conclusion, and when the prayer is done, put out the efficacy of our
   faith and holy desires in a strong Amen, that it may be to you
   according to the requests of your hearts, and you may come away from
   the throne of grace as those that have had some feeling of God's love
   in your consciences, and are persuaded that he will accept you, and do
   you good in Jesus Christ.

   Obs. 10. Again observe, there should be an amen to our praises as well
   as to our prayers, that we may express our zeal and affection to God's
   glory as well as to our own profit. Many with the lepers will say amen
   to Jesus, master, have mercy upon us;' but we are not as ready to say
   amen to this, To whom be glory,' &c. Our hallelujahs should sound as
   loud as our supplications, and we should as heartily consent to God's
   praises as to our own requests.

   Obs. 11. Lastly, in desiring the glory of God to all ages, we should
   express both our faith and love--faith in determining that it shall be,
   and love in desiring that it may be so with all our hearts. Both are
   implied in the word amen; it will be so whatever changes happen in the
   world. God will be glorious. The scene is often shifted, and furnished
   with new actors, but still God hath those that praise him, and will
   have to all eternity. Well, then, let your faith subscribe, and put to
   its seal, To the glory of God in Christ; and let earnest love
   interpose: Lord, let it be so; yea, Lord, let it be so. Heartily desire
   it, and with the whole strength of your souls; set to your seals
   without fear, it is a request that cannot miscarry, and follow it with
   your hearty acclamations. The world shall continue no longer when God
   shall have no more glory by it. Here you may be sure you pray according
   to God's will, and therefore may take it for granted; only follow it
   earnestly; say, Lord, whatever become of us and our matters, yet let
   thy name be glorified: Amen, Lord, let it be even so. Now Blessed be
   his glorious name for ever, and let the whole earth be filled with his
   glory: amen, and amen,' Ps. lxxii. 19.

    OR,

HOPES OF UNITY IN AND BY DIVIDED AND DISTRACTED TIMES:

  DISCOVERED IN A SERMON PREACHED BEFORE THE HONOURABLE

  HOUSE OF COMMONS, AT MARGARET'S, WESTMINSTER,

  ON THEIR SOLEMN DAY OF FAST, JUNE 30, 1647.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY.

   To the Honourable House of Commons assembled in Parliament.

   THAT which was preached by your command is now published. When the
   great voice saith, Come up hither, it is an evil modesty to hide among
   the stuff. In these busy times they are happy to whom God hath
   vouchsafed the shelter of an obscure privacy; yet, upon a call, we
   should not consult with our own ease and quiet. The times are violent
   and blasting, and this poor endeavour is likely to undergo several
   misconstructions; but, I thank God, lam learning to pass through good
   report and evil report, 2 Cor. vi. 8, and to disvalue censure when it
   seizeth upon me in the way of duty. I have dealt freely and impartially
   against the miscarriages of both parties, and, happily, [179] my
   liberty may displease some; others may look upon the things offered
   here as too low and trivial, and not weighty enough to reach the end of
   the design. Let them remember the intent of these proposals is only to
   engage to a further consultation about the matter. The entire discourse
   were fitter for a treatise than a sermon; and yet something is offered
   which, by the blessing of God, may be serviceable to reduce men from
   their violences and extremities to some better temper and moderation.
   Some possibly may dislike the whole design; spirits now are very keen
   and exasperated; men think it will be a cooling of their zeal if we
   should a little take off their edge and sharpness: fire will not be
   quenched without hissing. To these I shall only profess, that if I know
   mine heart, I abhor all such moderation and compliances as will not
   stand with Christian zeal, and may disadvantage truth and religion:
   whatever become of my own party, I would be faithful and true to that
   interest. I know that as it is hard to be moderate without danger, so
   also without sin. Men of middle interests do always displease men, and
   they should be careful they do not displease God. There are many
   counterfeits of Christian moderation; a cold, or, at best, a tepid
   indifferency, lukewarm Christians may easily middle it. Carnally-wise
   neutrality; it is no wonder to see men that observe the times neither
   hot nor cold. A doubtful uncertainty; dipsuchoi are akatastatoi,
   double-minded men are unstable, James i. 8, and their compliance is
   promiscuously dispensed. Some possibly may have so much of child and
   self in them as to mind church-peace only as a taking theme, and speak
   for it rather from their brain than their heart; others may (like him
   in Daniel) deal deceitfully, and press a league that they may become
   strong with a small people, mind moderation for their own advantage;
   some, out of a desire of their carnal ease and quiet, may be against
   stirs. I foresaw these rocks, desired grace to avoid them; therefore I
   hope nothing will be found here to occasion any such prejudice and
   suspicion against this endeavour. However it speedeth abroad, you were
   pleased to honour it with acceptance, and to do something upon it,
   which I hope you will revive again when it shall comport with the
   times. I shall desire God to guide you in that and other your great
   affairs. The Wonderful Counsellor be with you in all your straits, make
   you understanding men of the season, careful to apply apt remedies to
   the distempers of it.

   So prayeth your meanest servant in the Lord's work,

   Thomas Manton.

MEAT OUT OF THE EATER.

   In that day there shall be one Lord, and his name one.--Zech. XIV. 9,
   latter part.

   THE whole chapter, but chiefly the context immediately preceding, is
   spent in the description of a wonderful day, which, ver. 7, is said to
   be one day; that is, one entire period and joint of providence; for, in
   the manner of prophetical speech, days are many times put for years, or
   most usually for such whole entire dispensations and periods of
   providence as continue without interruption and eminent alteration,
   though perhaps for many years; for a day, being the natural distinction
   of time (those of years, hours, and months are artificial) most
   observed and used by the Hebrews in their computes, and that only space
   of time which continueth without visible alteration, is very properly
   used in this case. Thus why day. But then, ver. 9, it is called the day
   of the Lord;' it is called so because of the glorious appearances of
   Christ in his power and sovereignty, and because, I suppose, the
   evening of the day here spoken of will end with the coming of the Lord,
   and all his saints with him, in glory to judge the world. This day is
   described, ver. 6, 7:--

   1. By its beginning and progress.

   2. By its end and close.

   1. Its beginning and progress for a long while is dubiously
   interchangeable: The light shall neither be clear nor dark; it shall be
   neither day nor night;' that is, there shall be a sad conflict between
   truth and error, misery and happiness (for they are often expressed by
   light and darkness in scripture), and such a mutual vicissitude and
   alternate succession of each to other, that a man cannot tell which
   shall have the upper hand. All the comfort is, this day is known to the
   Lord;' that is, cometh by his appointment, and hath a special mark and
   seal of providence upon it; and but one day, a providence of the
   shortest size, sad and short, an uncertain day, a day known to the
   Lord--and but one day.

   2. For the evening and close of it, it is said, in the evening it shall
   be light;' that is, peaceably glorious: truth shall gain upon error,
   happiness upon misery, and all former distractions and miseries shall
   be hushed and gone, for it is light as comfortable and as much day as
   you would have it. The comfort and happiness of this glorious evening
   is set forth in three things:--

   [1] The propagation of the gospel.

   [2.] The reign of Christ.

   [3.] The unity of the churches.

   [1.] The gospel shall be propagated and the knowledge of it diffused
   far and near; that is implied in the 8th verse: Living waters shall go
   out from Jerusalem towards the former and latter sea,' &c.; that is,
   gospel refreshments, the doctrine and knowledge of Jesus Christ,
   together with plenty of gifts and graces, shall be diffused and
   scattered abroad among all nations, who are here hinted at in those
   expressions of the former and latter sea, which allude to the watery
   borders of Palestina, which were the Lake of Sodom and the
   Mediterranean. Now it is usual in the scriptures to set out the
   evangelical church by terms proper to the Jewish border.

   [2.] The next privilege of those times is in the beginning of the 9th
   verse, And the Lord shall be king over all the earth.' Why! you will
   say, the Lord is so always; Christ was long since inaugurated into the
   kingdom, and hath for many ages actually administered it in the world.
   But the meaning is, he shall show himself to be king, he shall be known
   to be king; it is not spoken in regard of right or actual
   administration, but in regard of sense and apprehension. He will show
   it partly by his providence and his own dispensations, partly by
   doctrinal discoveries in the church; men shall more distinctly hold of
   the head,' Col. ii. 18; Phil. ii. 10, 11; partly in the adoration and
   acknowledgments of men; every knee shall bow to him, and every tongue
   and language call him Lord;' all shall ascribe to him sovereignty; the
   Lord shall be king,' and, it is added, over all the earth;' not only
   over a few churches, but over all nations. Christ will show himself in
   the largeness of his power, not only as king of saints,' Rev. xv. 3,
   but as king of nations,' Jer. x. 9; as head to the church,' but yet so
   as over all things,' Eph. i. 22; ruling both with his golden sceptre
   and also his iron mace. This will be the state and happiness of those
   times; you will see Christ upon his throne in all his royalty and
   glory.

   [3.] The next privilege is the unity of the churches: in the words of
   the text, The Lord shall be one, and his name one.

   By this view we have found the words to be the third privilege of the
   glorious evening. Observe in them:--

   (1.) The time, in that day.

   (2.) The blessing, which is unity, The Lord shall be one, and his name
   one. Which words do hint--

   (1st.) The cause of this unity, there shall be one Lord, a joint
   subscription and submission to Jesus Christ.

   (2d.) The measure of it, one name, such a unity and conspiring together
   in the worship of Christ, that all names and badges of distinction
   shall be taken away.

   This resolution of the text doth somewhat open it to you. But let us go
   upon the words more expressly and directly.

   In that day; that is, the day spoken of ver. 1, described ver. 6, 7.
   What this day is, is somewhat doubted. Most grant it cannot be taken
   properly, as if all these things could be transacted in the space of
   twenty-four hours, though indeed some be so fond as to interpret all
   these things in the rigour of the letter; but what is intended then? I
   shall only mention the most probable opinions. Some refer it to the
   first times of Christianity and the dawnings of the gospel in the
   world; but sure that is a mistake, for it must be such a day whose
   morning is miserably troublous, whose evening is eminently glorious,
   which will hardly agree to those times. Others refer it to the day of
   judgment; but though the evening of this day hath no end till then, yet
   I conceive that is not intended, for these happinesses here
   mentioned--of the propagation of the gospel, the acknowledgment of
   Christ's sovereignty, and the peace of the churches, &c. though rare
   and high privileges, yet are somewhat lower than those dispensations
   which Christ will give out at the day of judgment. Others refer them to
   the times of the calling of the Jews, and the church's recovery from
   the apostasy and defection of Antichrist; some more yet more
   particularly to the destruction of the last enemies, and those secrets
   about Gog and Magog. For the present, because I drive at other things,
   I shall forbear the thorough disquisition of this matter, and shall
   only generally and safely refer the words to some latter providences,
   probably the times most nearly preceding the day of judgment; for I
   conceive this text is exactly parallel to those promises that are
   everywhere in scripture said to be fulfilled in the latter days, and
   speak of so much glory and sweetness as then shall be exhibited and
   dispensed to the world; therefore, if we will know what this day is,
   let us know what is intended in that expression, the latter days.' It
   is used either:--

   1. More largely, for all that efflux of time and succession of ages
   between Christ's ascension and his second coming to judge the world.
   All that time in scripture is looked upon as the latter days, for so
   the times immediately after Christ are expressly called, Acts ii. 15;
   and I remember the apostle Paul calleth his times the ends of the
   world,' 1 Cor. x. 11; the reason of which expressions is, because after
   Christ's ascension there is no change of dispensations, as there was
   before, from the law natural to the law of tables, and from the law of
   tables to the gospel; but now beyond this time there is nothing but the
   everlasting state: There remaineth no more sacrifice for sin,' Heb. x.
   26, no other ways of salvation to be expected beyond the gospel; this
   is the largest sense, which not being noted, hath occasioned some
   mistakes.

   2. More strictly for that space of time that immediately precedeth the
   world's ruin, and that is to be considered in its morning and evening.

   [1.] In its morning or former part, which is everywhere in scripture
   made to be of a dismal and doubtful appearance, and therefore do we so
   often hear of the evil of the latter times--days full of delusion and
   desolation, a world of delusion and error there is then: 1 Tim. iv. 1,
   The Spirit speaketh expressly that, in the latter days, men shall
   depart from the faith, and give heed to seducing spirits.' God hath
   expressly foretold what will be the fate of those times. So for
   desolation, 2 Tim. iii. 1 In the latter times there shall come hard or
   perilous times,' kairoi cha'lepoi, times of great difficulty and
   distress.

   [2.] In its evening or latter part, which is bright and glorious, and
   therefore do we so much hear of the goodness of the latter days; as
   Hosea iii. 5, They shall make haste to fear the Lord and his goodness
   in the latter days.' So of safety;' no provoking briar,' no pricking
   thorn,' Ezek. xxviii. 24. So also Isa. ii. 1, The mountain of God,
   above all mountains, in the latter days;' that is, above the reach of
   opposition and violence. Look, as there is a morning light that goeth
   before the sunshine, so there are some streaks of glory, and times grow
   better and better as they draw nearer and nearer to the great day of
   the Lord. I have done with that expression, in that day.

   2. The next is there shall be one Lord. Hitherto there have been divers
   lords. The heathens had their several deities, the Turks their Mahomet,
   the Jews their imaginary Messiah, the Papists their lord the Pope. Many
   nations do not as yet call Christ Lord: Other lords have dominion over
   them,' Isa. xxvi. 13. But then Jesus Christ shall be the person
   acknowledged; he shall be acknowledged alone, he shall be acknowledged
   as Lord. All this is included in the expression, that Christ alone
   shall be spoken of, invocated, and adored in all the churches; they
   shall be subjected to him as the only king, and guided by him as the
   only shepherd,' Ezek. xxxiv. 23; hold of him as the only head, and
   stand to his appointment as the only lawgiver, James iv. 12. And,
   indeed, here is the ground of all; for it is unity of religion that
   begetteth unity of affection; the one Lord causeth the one name. When
   men have one king, give themselves up to the will of Christ, and have
   one shepherd, guided by the spirit of Christ, and have one lawgiver,
   are willing their opinions should stand or fall at the appointments of
   Christ, then will there be a sweet and happy agreement.

   3. The last clause to be examined is that, his name one. At first I
   conceived the meaning to be that men should look only at one power and
   dignity whereby to endear themselves to the respects of God, and
   thought the expression parallel to these scriptures: Acts iv. 12, That
   there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved,'
   but only by Jesus Christ, this is the one name; or that, Phil. ii. 10,
   That at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow.' But considering it
   more seriously, I saw the necessity of another sense, for this is but
   the result and effect of the former phrase. Now it seems to be added
   for the greater emphasis and aggravation of the mercy, that there
   should be not only one Lord, but one name; therefore, what is in
   tended? There are divers acceptions of the name of God in scripture.
   That which I conceive most proper is, when it is taken for worship, the
   way of our religion and profession; as Micah iv. 5, All people will
   walk every one in the name of his God, but we will walk in the name of
   the Lord our God for ever and ever;' that is, several people have their
   several distinct ways of worship and profession, and the reason why the
   scripture useth this word in this matter is because men are called and
   named after the way of their worship and profession; thus the holy
   worshippers are called Christians from Christ, and Mahometans from
   Mahomet, &c.; and, among Christians, men are called according to their
   distinct way and chief opinion, as Papists, Socinians, Arminians, &c.
   Well, then, it is promised here that there shall be one name; that is,
   as one Lord, so one way of worship and badge of distinction. We see
   now, and we may bewail it; that among the holy people there are
   distinct names, as Lutherans, Calvinists, Presbyterians, Independents;
   but then all these shall vanish and be no more heard of; the whole
   family shall be named Christians from Christ. And, indeed, this is no
   mean blessing; the devil gets great advantage by names, and, therefore,
   his instruments are busy this way, inventing such as may either tend to
   contempt and derision, [180] as Chrestians of old, Puritans of late; or
   to tumult and division, as those names amongst us under which the
   members of Christ sadly gather into bodies and parties.

   I have done with the explication; I come to the points, they are two:--

   Doct. 1. That in the latter days there shall be great unity in the
   church of God.

   Doct. 2. That this unity shall spring from their acknowledging of the
   right Lord and the right way.

   Purity is the ground of this unity. I shall at this time discuss the
   first point, that in the latter days there shall be great unity and
   agreement. The main confirmation of the point lieth in promises, for
   that is the assurance we have of it; however, I shall forbear to heap
   up scriptures together. You will find many in this discussion reduced
   to their proper place and heads.

   The reasons are these:--

   1. Because this will suit best with the quiet and happy estate of those
   times; God will usher in the glorious and everlasting estate by some
   preparative degrees; the latter times are more blessed times, former
   things are to be done away,' Rev. xxi. That is, the former kind of
   dispensations and providences. Many promises there are which hint the
   great peace and rest that shall then be in the church. Now that could
   not be if there were divisions and distinctions; they would produce
   factions, and factions wars and contentions, and the contentions
   desolations: Amos vii. 4, The fire devoured the great deep;' that is,
   contention brought desolation upon places and countries that are most
   populous. Public differences will end in public disturbances; this is
   all we can look for in such cases; and therefore, if there were not
   unity, how could the other promises be fulfilled?--such as these: Isa.
   xxxiii. 20, Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a
   tabernacle that Cannot be taken down; the stakes thereof shall not be
   removed, nor the cords broken.' It is spoken of the church in the times
   of the gospel, whose state hitherto hath been most disturbed and
   perplexed, like the ark upon the waves. It may be there hath been some
   relaxation and short breathing time, as it is said, Rev. viii. 1, There
   was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour;' a little respite
   given to the church in Constantine's beginning, till Licinius (because
   not equally prayed for and honoured by the Christians with Constantine)
   raised a new persecution then; and so at other times there hath been
   silence for the space of half an hour, but then the miseries returned
   again with violence enough. Only in the latter days is Jerusalem a
   quiet habitation, a fixed tent; then there are not such uncertain
   happiness, and such interchangeable removes. So Ezek. xxviii. 24, And
   there shall be no more any pricking thorn, nor any provoking briar of
   all that are round about her.' God hath promised to take away all
   provocation and molestation, and whatever is grievous; therefore all
   the cause of its difference and disagreement. Differences in religion
   stir up the greatest violences and most deadly hatred; that which
   should restrain and bridle our passions is the fuel of them. As long as
   there is difference in religion and worship there will be disturbances,
   and there cannot be that quiet and happy security which the promises do
   generally annex to those times.

   2. Because God will then make some visible provision against the
   scandal of dissensions: the glory of Christ hath been mightily darkened
   by them; no such stone of stumbling and rock of offence to the world as
   the contrariety of opinions and great differences that have been among
   Christians. Observe and you will find it always to be the great
   prejudice against Christianity in the primitive times. Sozomen saith,
   many would turn Christians, but they were always discouraged by that
   dissonancy of doctrines and opinions that were amongst them. [181] And
   so Chrysostom speaketh of a certain Ethnick that came unto him and told
   him, I would become a Christian, but there is such variety of sects
   among you that I cannot anchor upon anything as certain in your
   religion. [182] Certainly nothing begets atheism so much as this. Men
   have suspected the gospel because there hath been such differences and
   strife about it, it makes them doubt of all to see distinct factions
   making the word of God ductile and pliable to so many several purposes.
   Therefore now a universal unity would much vindicate and recover the
   glory of Christ out of the hands of such a scandal, and be an excellent
   provision for the credit of Christianity. To this end Christ prayeth
   and urgeth this very argument to his Father: John xvii. 23, Let them,
   all be one;' and again, Let them be made perfect in one, that the world
   may know that thou hast sent me;' as if he had said, Father! thou
   knowest how easily the world do take up any prejudice against my
   doctrine; now, if there should be division among my worshippers, they
   will think the gospel. a fable, religion but a device. Oh! let them be
   perfect in one, that the world may know and own me for the true
   Messiah. Should we go to our own experiences, this we find amongst
   ourselves, that religion never lost its awe so much as now. God was
   terrible in his holy places, in the assemblies of his saints, and in
   the lives of his holy people, the gravity and the strictness of their
   conversation had a majesty with it, and did dart reverence and awe into
   the hearts of men; but now all this glory and power is lost, and
   religion is looked upon but as an empty pretence and covert to some
   designs. It is said, Acts iv. 32, 33, The multitude of believers were
   of one heart and one soul,' and then the truths of Christ had power,'
   and great grace fell upon them.' Christianity hath more lustre when
   there is such a common consent and sweet brotherly accord. The truths
   of God have their power, and the servants of God their grace with them.
   Well, then, the scandal being so great, the prayer of Christ so urgent,
   God will at one time or another do somewhat eminently and visibly to
   right the honour of Jesus Christ, and to recover the lustre of
   Christianity and our glorious profession; for I take this for granted,
   that, at some special times, God will roll away the reproach of every
   imminent scandal that hath been cast upon Christ and religion. And
   because God loveth, like the good householder, to bring forth the best
   wine at last, it hath not been done hitherto, but is reserved for the
   latter days; for, indeed, you shall find that all the latter
   providences are but so many vindications and clearings of Christ from
   the former scandals of the world; as for the scandal of meanness
   hitherto, not many noble, not many wise men after the flesh, not many
   mighty are called.' Christ's company hath been despicable and poor, but
   now, in the latter days, it is everywhere promised that kings shall
   bring their glory into the church,' that they shall hold their mouths'
   at Christ, Isa. lii. 15; that is, with silence and reverence receive
   his commands; and the like everywhere. So for the scandal of
   persecution, it is everywhere declared that in the latter days the
   enemies shall be the subjected party, glad to take hold of the skirt of
   a Jew,' Zech. viii.;' Bow to the soles of their feet,' Isa. lx.; the
   magistrates shall call the inhabitants of Jerusalem their strength; and
   the like elsewhere. So, again, the church hath been under the abasure
   of reproaches; but God hath promised a vindication in the latter days,
   that he will establish Zion a praise throughout the earth,' set it as a
   royal diadem,' Isa. lxii. 3, with the 7th; that he will give them
   praise in the land of their shame,' Zeph. iii., proportionably to their
   abasures that they shall have glory. So for paucity and fewness, which
   is another scandal, there are promises of the gospel's being
   propagated, of the flowing out of living waters, of the flying in of
   converts like doves to the windows,' Isa. lx., and the like. So in this
   present case, because of the variance of the people of Christ under
   former dispensations, there are promises of special unity and sweet
   accord in the latter days, of one Lord and one King, of one Shepherd,
   one Head,' Hosea i. 11; of one shoulder,' Zeph. iii. 9; and that God
   will make Jew and Gentile, and all that fear him, to lie down together
   in peace and safety, and to be all called by one name.

   3. The misery of these times doth seem to enforce the greater unity. I
   take this for the mariner and course of heaven, to work one contrary
   out of another, by the greatest distractions to make way for unity and
   order. It is said, Ps. xviii, 11, He hath made darkness his secret
   place.' God's counsels are always carried under the covert of darkness;
   usually, when he intendeth the greatest flourishing, he worketh the
   greatest desolation in the earth; and when unity, he suffereth the
   greatest distraction (for what grounds I shall tell you by and by);
   hence is it that we do so often hear of the misery of the latter times,
   and yet again of the blessedness of the latter times; hard times, and
   happy times, miserable in the beginning, happy in the end and issue.
   Hell is let loose in the latter times: they shall give heed to seducing
   spirits;' and heaven is opened in the latter times: there shall be
   great light and rare love. When there is such a conflict and
   contestation between light and darkness, the light will be the clearer
   afterwards, and the more doubtful the day is, the more glorious will
   the evening be; for this, I say, is the law and the course of divine
   dispensations, after the greatest distractions to bring forth the
   greatest harmony, and the most blessed sweetness and accord; therefore,
   there being in the latter days such eminent and visible distraction, by
   the proportions of heaven there will be eminent and visible unity. Of
   this, more by and by.

   To application.

   Use 1, of consolation. For consolation to all them that wait or care
   for the consolation of Israel. Many are ready to faint and stagger at
   the distractions of the times: Judges v. 15, For the divisions or
   breaches of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart,' or, as the
   original will bear it, great impressions.' These things, indeed, do
   sadly work with a gracious spirit; the enemies warm themselves by these
   sparkles, and rejoice over the tire that devoureth the great deep;
   others, whose hearts are bathed and steeped in pleasures, or cumbered
   with worldly cares, have not a due sense of the times, and are not
   enough affected with them; but now, for the people of God, external
   miseries are not so bad to them, and do not so nearly reach a gospel
   spirit as differences in religion. Oh! it is very sad to see the roses
   of the valleys become pricking thorns, and saints in pretence to be
   devils in practice to one another, the sheep of Christ's own fold to be
   like the bulls of Bashan, goring and wounding each other; and would our
   hearts were more affected with it! But here is comfort; God foresaw how
   troublous and distracted the morning of the latter days would be, and
   therefore, that we might not be dismayed, hath given us many a
   comfortable promise to support our hearts under such providences. When
   God framed the world there was nothing but confusion; you do not know
   what God can extract out of a chaos. Two things I shall urge upon you
   to set home this comfort:--

   1. Consider your hopes.

   2. Know the reason of such providences.

   1. Consider your hopes; your times are not to be measured and valued by
   appearances; it least of all becometh a Christian to observe the
   clouds: Rom. viii. 24, Hope that is seen is not hope;' that is, those
   that would hope are not to judge by the present face of things, but by
   the promises. Teach your faith to see things that cannot be seen,
   beauty in distractions, unity and order in violence and division: faith
   is exercised not when you get water out of the fountain, but out of the
   rock; when you make the eater give you meat, devouring differences
   yield comfort and hope. It is better to look to a sure word than to an
   uncertain providence. See what a promise you have, Isa. xi. 6-8, The
   wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the
   kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together, and a
   little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed,
   their young ones shall lie down together, and the lion shall eat straw
   with the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp,
   and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den,' &c. I
   will not undertake to assign a sense to every particular expression;
   only in the general note, God will effect it, though there be no more
   hopes than to see lion and lamb, leopard and kid come together, and to
   persuade natures that are most fierce and contrary unto a peaceable and
   friendly cohabitation.

   2. Know the reason of such providences. Men are perplexed when they do
   not know the reason of things; fear seizes upon us in the dark: Judges
   vi. 13, If the Lord be with us, why is all this evil befallen us?' They
   did not know the reason of the matter, and therefore were troubled at
   it. If there be such promises of unity, why are there such sad things
   befallen us? such great breaches and distractions, the ball of
   contention bandied from one to another, clouds gathering every day
   thicker and blacker? You will think this is but an ill time to look for
   unity, such general consent and agreement. Alas! you err, not knowing
   the reason of your providences; God useth to bring in unity and order
   by confusions. There are divers reasons for it: I shall name three,
   which may encourage hope in the saddest times:--

   [1.] God doth not love to let the creature look to the end of his
   designs, and skill the way of his providences; therefore, he will try
   them by casting a veil upon his work, and hiding his glory in a cloud:
   Isa. xlv. 15, Verily, thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of
   Israel the Saviour.' He meant to be a Saviour, but they should know no
   such thing, a Saviour under a veil, a hidden Saviour. Providences are
   so disposed as if he meant to do quite otherwise; so Isa. xlviii. 7,
   They are created now, not from the beginning, lest thou shouldst say, I
   knew them.' God speaketh concerning the matter of Babylon and the ruin
   of that empire, which should be effected so strangely that none should
   see which way providence tended, or say, Now I know what God will do.
   God loveth to hide the particular way and path of his providence, so
   that your times shall seem not to have the least connection or respect
   to your hopes; it is so in all his dealings; see John xi. 6. Jesus
   loved Lazarus, and when he heard he was sick, he abode two days; little
   love in that, to stand still when there was need of help; yet that stay
   was for the advantage of the miracle and commendation of his love. So
   John ii.; when Christ meant to give them wine he calleth for
   water-pots; for God will not have you look to the way and end of his
   counsels; Deus sum non sequax, as Luther seemed to hear God speak to
   him when he complained of some cross providences. The creatures are not
   to teach God how to effectuate his promises; there is encouragement
   enough to wait, even when the face of things doth most lour upon your
   expectations.

   [2.] Because God will show you a point of divine skill, to make poison
   become your preservative, and your ruin your establishment; he will
   unite you by your divisions, gather you by your own scatterings.
   Judas's treason was called felix scelus, a happy wickedness, because it
   occasioned Christ's death. Many times God maketh contentions happy in
   their issue and result, and though for the present their influence is
   very deadly to religion, yet their effect is confirmation to the truth,
   and, in the end, God's people are brought more firmly and sweetly to
   close with one another and their God. The noise of axe and hammers doth
   but square stones for the temple, that they may lie the more evenly in
   the buildings. Usually we find that religious controversies (like the
   knocking of flints) yield more light, and, by the providence of God,
   occasion more sincere love. Before we had but a negative affection to
   truth, and might rather be said not to hate than to love it. Every
   vulgar and low spirit will love truth when it is honoured and
   advantaged with common consent: true affections are ravished with the
   beauty of truth, and have some positive ground for which they can love
   truths; yea, and the more when they are suspected and questioned, for
   then they shine with the greater lustre, as being able to endure
   contradiction, and as being more strongly vindicated and asserted.
   Thus, you know, trees shaken are the more firmly rooted, and dislocated
   joints, if well set again, prove the stronger, as in the point of
   assurance. After doubtings, the soul doth most sweetly and closely
   repose itself in the bosom of Christ, so outwardly the more smoke there
   is in the temple, the greater glory afterward. In times of common
   consent men keep together as those that are bound with a chain; but in
   times of difference and dissenting, God's people are at one with God
   and one another upon higher motives, and love truth for its own sake,
   it being, as I said, more cleared and vindicated. I have often wondered
   at that inference of the people of God, Micah iv. 5, All people will
   every one of them walk in the name of his God, and we will walk in the
   name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.' That which is a scandal to
   the world, is to them a motive and engagement to firmness in the truth
   and union with one another. There are different ways and persuasions in
   the world, therefore let us the more cleave together in the right way;
   the variety that was abroad made them more at one. So at that of David,
   Ps. cxix. 126, 127, They have made void thy law, therefore do I love
   thy commandments above gold.' When the ways of God are questioned, nay,
   disannulled, exploded with contempt and scorn, the more precious to a
   gracious heart: therefore do I love them, saith David; that was the
   very motive of his affection, ver. 127.

   [3.] Because God loveth to bestow blessings when the creatures most
   want them, to give them the greatest unity after the greatest
   distractions, that their blessings may be according to the rate and
   degree of their miseries and abasement. God, I say, loveth to make
   consolations abound,' 2 Cor. i. 5, in the very degree of sufferings,
   and therefore you may bear up in the greatest breaches. When God meant
   them Canaan, he would first give them enough of the wilderness, enough
   to carry some proportion with the future happiness: Deut. ii. 3, Ye
   have compassed this mountain long enough, turn you northward.' They had
   been thirty-nine years compassing Mount Seir; it might have been done
   in so many weeks or days, but the pillar of the cloud never went before
   them till now. God may make you fetch compass enough about this
   mountain, keep you in the wilderness of distractions, ere you can see
   providence before you leading of you into better times. You shall see
   the people of God in the wilderness did plead the equity of this rule
   and course of heaven: Ps. xc. 15, Make us glad according to the days
   wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen
   evil.' It was the prayer of Moses in the desert, let Canaan countervail
   the wilderness. The longer in the distractions, the more abundance of
   honey and milk shall we find in that good land, more Sowings of grace,
   larger discoveries of the mind of God.

   Well, then, be sensible of the evil of the times, but with comfort in
   the Lord, and hope in the promises.

   Object. But you will say, These are generals that concern the whole
   church: especially at such a season, what do you say to our distempers
   and distractions?

   Sol. Though the part followeth the reason of the whole, and God's
   dispensations are alike to both the catholic and particular churches,
   so that what is said of the whole may be applied to a part, as many
   times, on the contrary, promises made to particular persons are reputed
   as catholic and of a more universal use, and so applied to the whole,
   yet I shall speak a little more expressly to our own case.

   Much may be spoken in this matter about the cause and cure of our
   distempers, the danger of the times and the hopes. But because this
   would engage to too large a digression, and the discourse will rather
   be managed and carried on by rational conjectures than sure and
   theological grounds, therefore I shall wait for a more convenient
   season, and but a little touch upon matters that otherwise would
   challenge an accurate discussion.

   None can be ignorant of the state of the times,--that a spirit of
   division and delusion is let loose and gone abroad amongst us, so that
   the pillars of religion are shaken, the most concerning truths
   questioned, nay, exploded with scorn and contempt; great agitations
   there are everywhere, and God only knoweth whereunto they will grow. It
   is a thing of great advantage and benefit to us to consider the ground
   and rise of our distempers, and what is the special genius of that
   spirit of error that worketh amongst us, and so possibly we may come to
   conceive some hope of the allaying and removal of it. Divers concurring
   causes there are that help to beget, conceive, bring forth, and midwife
   such foul productions into the world, and therefore, before I touch
   upon the hopes, I shall a little reflect upon the rise and growth of
   our dissentiency and division, and how it came to be thus with us as
   now it is. We may let pass the general causes, viz., God's providence,
   who usually maketh the morning of a glorious day misty and dark;
   Satan's malice, who, when his own holds are shaken, loveth to ruin all
   the world together with himself; the corruptions of embased nature, by
   which the heart is either weak, and so apt to prostitute itself to the
   grossest fancies if left by God, or wicked, and so naturally opposite
   to the truths of God, very willing to blot out those impressions and
   that sense that we have of them. I say, if we let pass these general
   causes, we shall find upon an inquiry that thus our evils grew upon us:
   First, they were hatched by the ignorance, iniquity, and violence of
   the former times (when things are very bad, men are apt to fly out into
   the contrary extremities), and began to break out upon this great
   change, which the former corruptions did even necessitate and enforce;
   as usually, you know, great and violent changes occasion great tumults,
   ill humours in the body discover themselves upon a strain. When God
   changed his own ordinances, erroneous spirits were busy; I mean, in the
   first times of the gospel. When a people begin to innovate, it is a
   hard matter to keep them within the bounds of any moderation; and,
   therefore, it is the policy of the church of Rome to change nothing, ne
   videatur errasse; reformations are very perilous, especially to corrupt
   bodies. Here, then, was the occasion, and indeed a sad occasion to
   many, who, in the extremity of opposition to antichristian ways,
   obtruded themselves upon as sad or worse in conveniences, going off not
   only from vain rites, but religion itself; and instead of leaving
   corruptions, left worship; and, indeed, any other thing could not be
   expected, if we consider how loose and slack the reins of government
   have been of late, with what violence and tumult this change was
   managed, not in the solemn, grave way of conviction and humiliation.
   Buildings stand whose foundations are laid in those deeps; but
   otherwise it will be hard to settle things; partly because till the
   error be rightly stated the truth is not found out; partly be cause
   such changes make men lose all awe and reverence in the matter of
   religion, and so every man digresseth into his own way, and adoreth the
   idol of his own brain. Usually you will find whatever is carried on by
   scoffs and popular tumults seldom succeedeth well. I confess God loveth
   to pour contempt upon the sons of Levi that are partial in the
   covenant,' Mal. ii. 9; and, it is his way many times to cause the voice
   of many waters (id est, of the confused multitude) to go before the
   voice of mighty thunderings, Rev. xix. 6 (id est, the regular act of
   the magistrate, whose sentences and decrees are terrible as thunder);
   and therefore I do adore the justice of divine providence in causing
   the former ministry to become base and contemptible before all the
   people. But, however, I cannot but sadly bewail the mischiefs that
   abound amongst us by the neglect of men. Though the corruptions of
   Episcopacy made it justly odious, yet it would have been better it had
   been disputed down rather than jested down; arguments would have done
   more good than scoffs, besides the danger of returning to folly. Do but
   consider the present inconveniences of making so great a change without
   more public and rational conviction, when things that before were of
   reverend esteem are of a sudden decried. What is the effect? Why!
   religion itself is of less esteem; men suspect all can as well scoff
   out truth as error. Calvin's observation is excellent: he saith that in
   times of changes there are lucianici homines qui jocose etper ludibrium
   garriunt adversus superstitiones papatus, interim nullo tanguntur
   timore Dei, &c.--many that are of Lucian's temper, who, by jesting
   against received rites, insensibly lose all sense and awe of religion,
   and by scoffing at false gods, come the less to dread the true.
   Consider and see if the former liberty of tongues and pens hath not
   begotten that present irreverence and fearlessness that is in the
   spirits of men against things that undoubtedly are of God. But this is
   not all; do but consider how many are hardened in their old ways, and
   prejudiced against the reformers, as if they were men that did
   procedere non ad perfectionem sed ad permutationem, were men given to
   changes, Prov. xxiv. 21, merely to leave things out of passion and
   present dislike, or, which is worse, out of self-aims, and are ready to
   say of them, as Austin said of some one who appeared against the
   pagans, non pietate everterunt idola, sed avaritia--only to divide the
   spoil; and all this because the grounds, reasons, and necessity of the
   change have not been publicly enough discovered. And truly it were very
   well if the loose principles and in direct practices of some did not
   give occasion to these slanders. All that I shall further say is this,
   that to leap out of one way into another, either out of base aims or
   without due shame and sense of former miscarriages, will but make our
   own station the more questionable, for, certainly, self-respects have
   no majesty with them; and though we be in the right, yet having a wrong
   heart, God recompenseth into our own bosoms the very measure of our
   dealing with others. We now have found the great occasion of the
   spreading of those evils amongst us which were hatched under the
   iniquity of the former times, and possibly let alone as the last
   reserve against endeavours of reformation, and now meeting with a
   people capable of such impressions, who love to wander, Jer. xiv. 10,
   they are the more easily diffused and propagated. Some are ensnared by
   their own pride and foolish singularity; others by discontent, base
   aims, unworthy reflections upon their honour, profits, &c.; most by a
   spirit of opposition against the ministry: God hath set us out to be
   men of contention to the whole earth, Jer. xv. 10. Those that are
   censores morum, whose office is to tax public abuses, will be looked
   upon as men of strife. We might justly suspect ourselves if this were
   not the portion of our cup. This spirit certainly acteth many: enemies
   will snarl when the great voice biddeth the witnesses come up hither,
   Rev. xi. 12. Surely some do behold their late ascension and glory with
   envy and indignation, others possibly may be led by a desire of being
   somebody in the world. Simon Magus would be ti`s me'gas, Acts viii. 9;
   there is a natural itch and desire after mastership in Israel. James
   checketh it, James iii. 1, My brethren, be not many masters:' we
   naturally affect the honour of this chair: some bottles will burst if
   they have not vent, Job xxxii. 19. Tertullian observeth that this was
   the reason why divers went over to the Gnostics and the opposite
   parties in his time: [183] young men, and men otherwise unfit,
   presently commenced into some esteem and mastership. Thus you see
   different menaced by different spirits, and all one way or another
   increasing the distractions of the times, which, being thus occasioned
   and diffused, are supported and kept up by factions and parties, men
   severally prosecuting their cross designs without any regard to the
   truth and advantage of religion; and if any party be opposed and
   discountenanced, their delusion is the more strong by a supposal of
   persecution; for, by comparing their state with the state of the people
   of God, who suffered under the fury of former times, their prejudices
   are increased, and they think it can be no less than religion, and
   truth of zeal for the glory of God, to expose themselves to so many
   hazards; and they do the more confidently believe it, because God's
   witnesses have mostly prophesied in sackcloth; and hitherto Christ hath
   appeared for the most part against the worship and customs of nations.
   John saith Christ came into the world, 1 John iii. 8, i`na analu'se, to
   unravel Satan's webs: he hath been indeed acting the demolishing rather
   than the adstructive part; but therefore they go away with erroneous
   mistakes, as if he would never build, establish, and set up, and as if
   the kings of the earth should never bring in their glory to the church,
   and martyrs were made so more by the blood and suffering than by the
   cause. [184]

   Thus I have touched upon the causes and state of the present
   distempers. Much more might be said upon this subject, but now I was
   only willing to point at the heads of things. But you will say, Then
   what hopes? I answer--Our wound is grievous, but not incurable; many
   things there are to encourage us to keep silence, and wait upon God
   till he ordain better things for us. Let me speak a word or two on this
   matter. Consider, then, errors usually are not long-lived; the next age
   declareth the folly of them: 1 Cor. iii. 13, The day shall declare it.'
   Time will show what is stubble and hay, though men have high thoughts
   of it for the present. We raise so much dust by the heat of our
   contentions that our eyes are blinded, the glory of truth darkened; but
   things will clear up again: we wonder at the contests of former ages,
   and so will they at ours. When God cometh into his holy temple, all the
   earth will keep silence,' Hab. ii. 20. The nearer we approach to
   Antichrist's ruin, God will give out more light, Rev. xviii. Babylon
   fell when the earth was enlightened with the angel's glory. Light will
   increase towards the perfect day; and as light increaseth, so doth
   love; that great unity, spoken of before, is when there shall be more
   knowledge, for that is the reason rendered, Isa. xi. 9, For the
   knowledge of the Lord shall cover the world as the waters cover the
   sea.' And then, again, the devil usually overacts himself by appearing
   in some odious delusion, no longer as an angel of light, but as a foul
   fiend, in such direct opposition to Christ that all good men loathe
   him. Usually when God maketh any great change, things come to an
   extremity and excess of corruption. The Arians prevailed for a long
   time, but being so detestably vicious and insolently cruel, they ruined
   their own cause. Or else Satan runneth himself out of breath in some
   civil commotions.

   The Remonstrants in the Low Countries quite overturned their cause when
   they began to raise tumults and troubles everywhere; so those under the
   conduct of Munster, in Germany, did. but run themselves violently, like
   the Gadarenes' swine, Mat. viii. 32, upon their own ruin and
   destruction. Usually when Satan hath such great wrath, his time is but
   short, Rev. xii. 12. God delighteth mightily to ruin him by the
   violence of his own endeavours.

   Use 2, for exhortation. It serveth to exhort and press you to has ten
   and set on these hopes. Promises do not exclude action, but engage to
   it. Hope keepeth up endeavours; what you do in this kind will not be in
   vain in the Lord. The promises hold forth unity; strive after it.

   1. By prayers.

   2. By endeavours.

   1. By prayers. When things are otherwise irremediable, here is the last
   refuge: Ps. cxxii. 6, Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; they shall
   prosper that love it.' If you love it, that is the least you can do, to
   mourn over the matter to God; indeed sometimes it is all that we can
   do. Learned Perkins [185] said of his times, Non sunt ista litigandi
   tempora, sed orandi--prayers are fitter for these times than disputes.
   Carnal zeal may put us upon disputes; it is true zeal that puts us upon
   prayer, when we are so tenderly affected for God's glory as that, in
   that respect, we can go and mourn over the matter to him. When Luther
   thought to redress the evils of his times, one told him, Abi in cellam
   et die, Miserere nostri--go and cry, Lord, have mercy upon us. Truly
   things seem past help and cure: I but go and urge the matter to God;
   that which is marvellous in our eyes, Zech. viii. 6, is not so in his;
   a man goeth most cheerfully to the throne of grace when he hath the
   encouragement of a particular promise. Here is a promise not only to
   the case but to the times, In that day there shall be one Lord, and one
   name;' and that you may not think it a casual promise and comfortable
   word that dropped out of the mouth of God unawares, you shall see it is
   a blessing full in the eye of the general covenant; for it is very
   observable that when the tenor of the covenant is expressed, unity is
   made one of the chief blessings of it: Jer. xxxii. 39, I will give them
   one heart and one way for the good of them, and of their children after
   them.' Mark, he saith in the former verse that he will be their God,
   and they shall be his people, which is the form of the covenant; and
   then he undertaketh to give them one heart and one way, union in
   opinion and union in affections: so Ezek. xix. 11, I will give them one
   heart, and I will put a new spirit within them.' It is a main branch of
   the covenant to give them one heart, a heart united to God, and so to
   one another. Urge God then with his own promise and covenant; be
   instant and earnest with him: 2 Thes. iii. 16, The Lord of peace give
   you peace always, by all means;' the Lord of peace, God that loveth it,
   God that worketh it; and the latter phrases, always and by all means,
   note the vehemency and intentness of his desires. One way or another,
   let God find out a means to ordain peace for you. For your
   encouragement consider, you do not only pray, but Christ prayeth with
   you; Christ intercedeth with the Father for the same thing: John xvii.
   21, That they may be all one, and that they may be perfect in one, that
   the world may know that thou hast sent me.' That prayer is but the copy
   of his continual intercession. He knoweth what a scandal it is to his
   name, &c., and therefore he saith, Let them be one. Now, this is a
   great comfort when Christ prayeth for the same thing for which you
   pray; he is worthy to be heard though you be not; God will not refuse
   him that speaketh in heaven, however he dealeth with poor crawling
   worms on earth.

   2. By endeavours. Follow hard after it. I shall speak here to the
   people in general, then to the ministry, and then shall be bold to lay
   two or three considerations at the feet of this honourable assembly to
   help on this work.

   First, To the people. Oh! that all of us would now mind the things of
   peace and holiness in these distracted times: The great house is
   smitten with clefts, and the little house with breaches,' Amos vi. 11.
   There are divisions in cities, divisions in families, divisions in
   councils, divisions in the kingdom, and yet few healers of the
   breaches. We are already at a great distance, and yet we do in alia
   omnia ire, seek to go farther off from one another. Some make it a
   piece of their religion and zeal to dissent and be otherwise minded.
   Christ saith love shall wax cold in the latter days, Mat. xxiv. 12; the
   context showeth it is meant of this dispensative love. Ludolfus said,
   the world was at first destroyed with water for the heat of lusts; but
   it will be destroyed with fire for the coldness of love. [186] Oh! that
   we could stir you up to endeavour peace and reconciliation. The first
   work is the people's; things are most managed according to your love
   and hatred. Herod could do nothing to John for fear of the people, and
   it is said of others they could not do what they would because of the
   people. Oh! therefore, come, as the people did to John, and say, What
   shall we do?

   Truly much is to be done by you. I shall touch upon a few things.
   Besides reconciling yourselves to God, which is the best way to make
   others be at peace with you, and is to be heeded in a chief place; for
   when you are at one with God, he will give you the one heart, and one
   way with other of his people: all agreement ariseth from that oneness
   with God and Christ; but, I say, besides this general rule, let me
   entreat you to mind these things.

   [1.] Let every one of us mortify such ill affections as may any way
   engage us to a disturbance and vexatious bitterness. Ill affections do
   as often divide us as ill opinions; wars come from our lusts, James iv.
   1; distempered spirits occasion distracted times. It is observed that
   when there was strife among the Philippians, the apostle doth not state
   the controversies, but giveth rules against pride and vainglory and
   self-seeking, Phil. ii. 3, 4. There are many evils in the heart of man.
   I shall instance in these: There is an itch of novelty; naturally we
   adore things that are new; they flocked about Paul because they
   supposed him a setter forth of new gods, Acts xvii. Seneca observeth
   right, Homini ingenitum est magis nova quam magna mirari--men admire a
   glaring meteor and comet more than they do the glorious sun. So pride;
   that will make a man singular. There is a holy singularity: Prov. xxx.
   31, the going of the he-goat is comely; that is, as he walketh before
   the flock. Thus to be a leading man in religion is honourable, but
   pride puts a man upon an evil singularity, Col. ii. 18, intruding
   himself into things not seen, being puffed up with his own fleshly
   mind.' It puts men upon ungrounded conceits, quintessential extracts,
   foolish niceties. So envy; that begets an evil eye upon each others'
   renown and esteem: therefore, when God would reconcile Ephraim and
   Judah, he would take away their envy: And Ephraim shall not envy Judah,
   nor Judah vex Ephraim,' Isa. xi. 13. So revenge and discontent.
   Porphyry and Julian, two bitter enemies, receiving injuries from the
   church, became atheists. The devil worketh upon stomach and discontent,
   thoughts of disrespect. So there is self-seeking: men care not what
   they do so they may accommodate their own ends; they speak perverse
   things to draw disciples after them,' Acts xx. 30. Some men love to be
   in the head of a train, and therefore, if God's truths will not serve
   their ends, they can easily baulk them. So self-conceit; men make idols
   of their own conceptions, love an opinion non quia veram sed quia suam,
   not because it is true, but theirs; they are angry because others
   dissent from them, not from Christ; as appeareth plainly, because those
   that know little or nothing of the mind of Christ make most bitter and
   loud outcries against errors. Men are passionate in their own cause,
   and would have every one embrace their fancies: pray, what is the
   spring of all your disputes? Self, or Christ's glory? I cannot go over
   all the corruptions; only you see from small sparkles a great fire is
   kindled; that which goeth up in thin exhalations descendeth in great
   showers; that which is at first but a lust, a vain desire, a corrupt
   working in your own hearts, is at length a tumult and combustion in a
   church or state. Therefore, in the general, note that a mortified
   spirit is the most peaceable.

   [2.] Keep yourselves pure from ill opinions. You must as carefully
   avoid an error in judgment as a vice in conversation; many dally with
   errors, not considering the danger of them. Oh! consider, God hateth
   filthiness of the spirit as well as filthiness of the flesh, and a vain
   mind is as great a judgment as vile affections, Rom. i. 26, 28: Yea,
   certainly, to the public, errors are more dangerous than vices, for
   vices and gross sins are more against natural awe and shame, and so
   less spreading, and though we yield to sin in ourselves, yet we do not
   love it in others; and so among persons openly vicious there is nothing
   to allure and draw into a faction or party. Therefore be cautious and
   wary, if not for your own soul, yet for the common peace; as Tertullian
   said to Scapula, Si non vis tibi parcere, parce Carthagini. So, if you
   will not pity yourselves, pity England; a man would be careful of being
   accessary to a kingdom's or a church's ruin; where the influence of an
   action is so public, you had need proceed with good deliberation and
   advice. However, that I may not in this point seem to press too hard
   upon any one party, let me discover the extremities on both hands.
   There are two evils abroad--easy credulity and stubborn prejudice,
   [187] and both of them increase the differences, whilst some men's
   judgments are forestalled by a tradition, others seduced by an
   invention; therefore it is good to take the mean between both, which is
   the course the apostle prescribeth, 1 Thes. v. 21, Prove all things,
   hold fast that which is good;' prove all things, that we reject not
   truth by over-much prejudice; hold fast that which is good, that we
   close not with error by over-much credulity. You owe so much to
   everything that pretendeth to God as to consider it. When Ehud told
   Eglon, I have a message from God, he arose out of his seat,' Judges
   iii. 20. I say, you owe so much reverence to everything that
   challengeth descent from heaven as to weigh the claim. I do the rather
   urge this, because the adversaries of Christianity have been always
   those that have least inquired into it. Tertullian observeth it of the
   enemies of the truth in his days, nolentes audire quod auditum damnare
   non possent--they would not hear that which they had a mind to hate.
   [188] God, that gave man reason, never intended that he should take up
   love or hatred by chance; therefore it is good to try things. Sometimes
   a man may meet with an angel unawares, Heb. xiii. 2; only, on the other
   hand, remember I persuade you to a serious search, not to an easy
   credulity, not to play with opinions as if there were no hurt in them,
   but to examine them in the fear of God, to call in the help of the
   Spirit, and to use all the outward helps God hath left to the church.
   The priest's lips are to preserve knowledge; and the apostle saith,
   Eph. iv. 12, 14, that God hath given pastors and teachers, that we be
   no more tossed about with every wind of doctrine.' That is a help which
   God hath provided against this evil, and it is presumptuous arrogance
   to despise it.

   [3.] Do not impropriate Christ to any one party or sort of professors.
   The apostle reproveth those that said, I am of Christ,' as well as
   those that said, I am of Paul,' 1 Cor. i. 13. Those that spake as if
   Christ were only theirs, they were accounted a faction too. Jude wrote
   in times of division and delusion, and he calleth the salvation a
   common salvation,' Jude's Epistle, ver. 3; mine, and yours, and theirs
   too. Men should not speak as if they only were holy, they only were
   saints, and all others but the world at the best, but civil and
   convinced men. Nothing enrageth more than to confine Christ to an
   opinion, as if all religion did begin and end with it Naturally we are
   apt to do so; we envy the commonness of Christian privileges; but it
   should not be so among the Lord's people. There were differences at
   Corinth, but how doth Paul write to them? 1 Cor. i. 2, To the saints at
   Corinth, and to all that call on the name of Jesus Christ, theirs and
   ours.' Mark that clause, theirs and ours;' he checketh this natural
   envy in us which would impale and inclose the free Christ, the common
   salvation. It was an expression Tertullian used of some in his time,
   illic ipsum esse est promereri--it was religion enough to be one of
   them. [189] Oh! certainly this is not Christian. We must own that of
   God that we see in them, though they do not every way come up to our
   mind. We prize a jewel in a toad's head; how much more should we love
   grace in brethren whose blemish is only some petty dissent. Christ
   loved the young man, Mark x. 21, for the moral good that was in him;
   and I remember, in another place, he checketh his disciples for
   prohibiting one to do miracles in his name, because he did not follow
   them. It is in Mark ix. 38-40, where he speaketh expressly to this very
   case; it is most Christian to own the work of the Spirit everywhere,
   wheresoever we find it.

   [4.] Never serve a faction or party to the prejudice and detriment of
   truth and religion. Men cry up badges of distinction, and so divide
   Christ into different bodies and parties: 1 Cor. iii. 4, I am of Paul,
   and I am of Apollos, and I am of Cephas;' and so every one serveth the
   party upon which his interest hangeth, and hence come state broils and
   divisions, and discontent and quarrelling with one another, even to the
   apparent prejudice of religion; all acts of communion and brotherhood
   are forborne, and men merely condemn and oppose things because asserted
   or agitated by the opposite faction, blindly admire all that their own
   party doth, yea, and will rather give up religion and all for a prey to
   the enemy than lay aside their mutual animosities. Thus Eusebius
   witnesseth that there was great siding one against another, pastor
   against pastor, and people against people, some engaged in this
   faction, some in that, till the brethren of the camp brought in
   Diocletian's persecution, which devoured them all. Nay, when it cometh
   to this, they are so sworn to their own faction and party, that they
   will defend the apparent and open enemies of Jesus Christ, and so as
   they may strengthen themselves in the lesser differences, they will
   hazard the main principles; as Meletius, who formerly suffered for
   religion, being discontented with Petrus Alexandrinus (though his
   difference with the church was but small), joined with the Arians, and
   his Meletians with him. Oh! it is sad when men, to support their own
   interest and faction, will call in the open enemies of Christ to their
   aid, and cover them under their buckler. We have an eminent instance in
   scripture of this matter in Acts xxiii. 6, &c.; they looked upon Paul
   as a damnable blasphemer, but when once he pretended to the Pharisees,
   as, indeed, in the point of the resurrection he held with them, then We
   find no fault in this man; but if a spirit or angel have spoken to
   him,' &c. Many things might be spoken under this head, for, indeed, it
   proveth fatal to religion when once we cry up names, and those names
   beget parties, for then men look only to the accommodating of their own
   faction, though it be to the hazard of religion and public welfare.

   [5.] As far as truth and conscience will give leave, there should be a
   profession of brotherhood, a condescension and yielding to one another
   in love, a walking together, or, at least, a Christian forbearance:
   Eph. iv. 2, With long-suffering forbearing one another in love;' the
   strong are to forbear the weak, and the weak the strong, to suffer them
   a little to walk up to their measures of knowledge; so Phil. iii. 15,
   16, Let us, as many as be perfect, be thus minded, and if in anything
   ye be otherwise minded, God will reveal even the same to you;
   nevertheless, whereunto we have obtained, let us walk together by the
   same rule, mind the same thing.' Every one hath not the same measure of
   grace nor degree of light; as long as they hold of the head we cannot
   forsake their communion. The apostle speaketh those words last quoted
   in reference to the controversies of those times; every one could not
   see so far into them as others could, as how far the law was to be left
   and the Mosaical rites discontinued; therefore, the apostle's rule is,
   that they should walk together, go sweetly together as far as they
   could, and those that were grown and had most light (whom he calleth
   perfect) he wisheth to be thus minded, to act according to their light,
   but not to discourage others in their weak beginnings; and for the
   other sort he wisheth them to wait upon God without murmuring and
   contention, and they would find their hearts directed into the same
   truths and ways. This is the rule, you see, in such cases; but now the
   misery amongst us is, we keep a proud and contemptuous distance, and do
   not yield, not only as far as religion, but as far as our own private
   principles would give leave. We do not walk together in the Lord, and
   therefore doth Christianity suffer such loss everywhere, for we cannot
   be helpful to one another's faith.

   [6.] Abstain from reproaches and undue provocations, and dispense all
   civil respects with meekness. I put two rules together: our differences
   do not only unchristian us, but unman us many times: Gal. v. 15, If ye
   bite and devour one another, take heed ye do not consume one another.'
   The apostle useth such words as are proper to beasts, for indeed such
   violence is brutish: God hath armed the beasts with teeth and claws,
   but man with reason and judgment; to smite with the hand is beneath a
   man, and to smite with the tongue beneath a Christian; and yet how
   often is it found that Christians are guilty of both! The controversies
   between them degenerate into carnal strifes and debates, and are no
   more religious but personal, because of those mutual revilings, base
   and low reflections upon the name and credit of each other; every one
   will excuse himself for not being first in the transgression. But
   revenge doth not differ from injury, but only in the order; one is
   first, the other second. [190] It was no excuse to Adam that Eve was
   first in the transgression: Christ being reviled, reviled not again,' 1
   Peter ii. 23. It is no shame to be overcome in such an act; patient
   sufferings carry more majesty with them than carnal replies and
   defences; and therefore, though provoked, forbear reproaches. The other
   part of the rule is, that all civil respects must be dispensed with all
   meekness and sweetness. Strangeness, and distance, and incivilities do
   enrage; we are bid to have peace with all men, if possible.' Rom. xii.
   18. To pursue all honest ways and means, if possible, noteth it must
   not be by any indirect course, otherwise we may try the utmost; for
   damnable heretics, and such as raze the foundation, there are other
   rules; we cannot, with safety, bid them God speed: 2 John 10, If he do
   not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house, nor bid
   him God speed,' John, the disciple of love, persuadeth to such
   strangeness in such a case; so the prophet telleth Jehoram, that were
   it not for Jehoshaphat, he would not look towards him, nor see him,' 2
   Kings iii. 14. So when Cerinthus came into the bath at Ephesus, John
   went away: Let us go hence. Hic est Cerinthus, hostis veritatis--here
   is Cerinthus, the enemy of the truth,' he having denied the Godhead of
   Christ. So Marcion, who denied Christ, the resurrection, in effect the
   whole New Testament, when he came glavering to Polycarpus with a Non
   agnoscis nos?--Dost thou not know me? It was answered by him--Agnosco
   te primogenitum diaboli--I know thee to be the devil's first-born. In
   these extreme cases, the servants of God have been thus austere; but in
   errors besides the foundation, and of a lesser consequence, the other
   rule taketh place, and you will find that meekness and sweetness of
   converse gaineth much.

   More might be said, but I forbear. Oh! that that which is spoken were a
   little considered. None have more engagements to love than Christians;
   none have been more exemplary in love than Christians. Once it was
   said, Aspice ut se mutuo diligunt Christiani--see how the Christians
   love one another [191] ; but, alas! a little after it was said by a
   heathen: There are no beasts so mischievous to men as Christians are to
   one another. [192] Oh! it is too often too true.

   Secondly, Because of the publicness of the auditory I shall be bold to
   speak a word or two to my brethren in the ministry, and those who are
   to deal publicly in these matters; they may do much to the calming of
   the times. We are ambassadors of the Prince of peace; it will ill
   become us to be men of violence. Oh! that the Lord would dispose of our
   hearts to think of healing the breaches; the reproaches cast upon us
   are a hint from God to press us to the more care. I hope I shall not
   take too much upon me if I commend something out of the scriptures to
   myself and brethren. Admonitions are not accusations, and when God
   giveth a call, it is not too much peremptoriness to admonish: by the
   bowels of Christ let me entreat you to mind a few things.

   1. Beware of passion in your own interests; though they may be much
   shaken and endamaged in the present controversies, yet self-denying
   patience will be the best way to settle them: the injury to us may be
   great, but the injury to truth is greater; we must approve our
   faithfulness in afflictions as well as doctrine. It is an excellent
   place that of the apostle Paul, 2 Cor. vi. 3, Giving no offence, but
   approving ourselves as the ministers of Christ in necessities and
   distresses,' Mark, that we are to show ourselves ministers of Christ in
   furthering the gospel by our necessities; and sometimes it is a duty to
   depart from our just rights. Therefore be not too passionate in and for
   your own interests. The hint is not needless: Christ's disciples, being
   too sensible of their own contempt, called for fire from heaven, Luke
   ix. 54, 55. A tenderness of our own interests may soon raise us into an
   undue heat and rage, and in a mistake of our spirits, we may think that
   a coal from the altar which indeed is but taken from some common
   hearth. The false church hath been more zealous for interests than
   truths. Luther might have been more quiet, if he had not declaimed
   against the triple crown and the monks' bellies. Our conveniences
   should learn to give place to the advantage of truth. It is said of our
   Lord and Master Jesus Christ, Mat. xii. 19, that he shall not strive,
   nor cry, neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets,' i.e., he
   shall not keep a-bustling and astir for worldly glory and great matters
   in this life; and truly we should learn of him. Paul would not take
   maintenance, because the false teachers pretended they would preach the
   gospel freely: 2 Cor. xi. 12, But what I do, that I will do, that I may
   cut off occasion from them which desire occasion, that wherein they
   glory they may be found even as we.' It seemeth that some, as now, to
   get credit and entrance, would take no relief from the churches; now,
   saith Paul, though I have a right, I will not make use of it, that I
   may not, through their glorying in this matter, disadvantage my
   endeavours in the gospel. Our esteem, credit, authority, must all be
   sacrificed upon the interest and advantage of truth. Nazianzen, in his
   orations and verses, doth often profess his desires of laying down his
   bishopric and all his church honours for the peace of the church. In
   one place, I remember, above all, he tells them of Constantinople, that
   rather than he would any way be guilty of the least concurrence to
   their distractions, he should count it a high mercy to go aside and
   spend the rest of his days in obscure silence, for he had learned to
   prefer Christ above all:--

   Ou ga`r ies' geno'men moi'res thra'sus aspidio'tes,
   oud' e'thelon Christou allo' ti` pro'sthe phe'rein,
   Alla` ta7` me`n le'thes keu'thoi butho's, autar e'goge
   Enthen aphormethei`s, te'rpsomai atremi'e.' [193]

   A good resolution and worthy to be imitated.

   2. Press doctrines of Christ, and the main things of religion. Some men
   love to live in the fire, and to handle the red-hot questions of the
   age with passion and acrimony; but, alas! this doth no good. Zuinglius
   was once asked by a friend, Cur non contra pontificios?--why he was not
   more keen against the Papists, and preached not oftener against them?
   He answered, he would first plant the fear of God, and then men would
   be for the cause of God. To gain men to a party before they be gained
   to God is not so warrantable, and to press zeal in some particular ways
   doth but produce blind fury, which undoeth all. Tertullian [194] noteth
   it as a miscarriage of the heretics in his time, that they were more
   for gaining men to a party than Christianity. Suppose you press the
   truth, yet Christ telleth us that wisdom is justified of her children,'
   Mat. xi. 19. God's own people are most zealous for God's truths: Jude
   4, They turn the grace of our God into wantonness.' Sense of interest
   begetteth the purest, freest zeal for God. The intent of our ministry
   is riot that we should gain men to the support of our faction and
   party, but to Christ and Christianity. Other differences would be
   allayed were it not that we do so often revive them by unseasonable
   agitations; and, indeed, for the lesser differences, they were better
   wholly laid aside than so often stirred. Calvin, after his return to
   Geneva, would never contend about the business of wafer-cakes, for
   which he was at first cast out; though he altered not his mind in it,
   yet would never publicly contend in that matter, only many times
   modestly suggested what he thought was the better way. [195]

   3. When you deal with the errors of the time (for certainly that is
   necessary; we must stablish our hearers in the present truth,' 2 Peter
   i. 12), do it with a great deal of caution and wariness. Though I would
   not prescribe, yet give me leave humbly to offer three things, which
   possibly may prevent some abuses:--

   [1.] Beware of loose flings and general declamations against errors
   heresies; these do but exulcerate minds, prejudice our testimony, and
   much hinder it from being received. This is a miscarriage on both
   sides: men urge their ways in loose flings, conceited nicks, and
   implications, general outcries of one side against superstitious
   antichristianism and the men of the world (words soon spoken); on the
   other side, against errors, new lights, and new opinions. The word
   worketh most when it is most particular and demonstrative: thunder at a
   distance doth not so much startle me as a clap in my own zenith. It is
   good to go by way of particular proof and argument against opinions;
   prove them to be errors, and then call them so; otherwise loose and
   general invectives will make but superficial impressions. It is very
   observable that when James had proved that conceit of God's being the
   author of sin to be an error, then he said, James i. 16, Err not, my
   beloved brethren;' he first disputeth and then dissuadeth. It is very
   observable too, Mat. xxiii. from the 13th to the 33d ver., that our
   Saviour never denounceth a woe against the Pharisees, but he presently
   rendereth a reason for it: Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees,
   hypocrites, for ye devour widows' houses,' &c.; Woe, for ye shut the
   kingdom of God,' &c. Usually ungrounded zeal stayeth in generals, and
   ordinarily it is out of deceit or weakness.

   [2.] Deal herein with all soberness and meekness. We should do what we
   can to remove prejudices; men drink in truths when they are sweetly
   propounded; God was in the still voice; the small rain falleth sweetly
   upon the tender grass; men presently engage themselves to a fervour and
   heat, and that marreth all; it is but as oil to the flames. I remember
   a speech of Darius, when one of the soldiers of the camp railed against
   Alexander, he telleth him, I kept you to fight against Alexander, not
   to rail against him: those arrows of bitter words are not the weapons
   of our warfare. Passion showeth we are angry more against the person
   than the error; too often it maketh us forsake the main controversy and
   go on upon a wrong scent. One saith, He that speaketh to kings must
   speak pe'masi bussi'nois, with silken words: he that speaketh to
   dissenters had need make his speech as smooth and soft as may be. I am
   sure it is agreeable to the apostle's advice, In meekness instruct
   those that oppose themselves,' 2 Tim. ii. 25. And in the same place he
   showeth that the servants of God must be gentle and patient.

   [3.] Take heed of aggravating and greatening matters, making them of
   more importance than indeed they are; former ages were possessed with
   this spirit, every lesser dissent and mistake was made a heresy or
   error in the faith, as appeareth by their catalogues.

   Tertullian had but spoken two or three words in favour of Montanus, and
   the priests of Home presently cried him up for a Montanist, and
   accordingly dealt with him, quo protinus offensus (saith he that wrote
   his life) [196] prorsus in Montani paries transivit. I confess it is
   good to be watchful to dash Babylon's brats, and take the little foxes,
   Cant, ii. 15, i.e., to oppose the first and modest appearances of
   error: the party last amongst us began with words, and would have
   brought in things. Therefore, I say, it is good to be watchful; however
   this will not justify rough dealing with those that vary from us but in
   an expression, and straining everything to the worst sense and most
   odious consequences, that it may appear to be heretical. Christ's own
   words were mistaken and wrested into a sense which he would not own; he
   said he would destroy the temple in three days, John ii. 19. He meant
   it of his body, they accused him of the same words; and yet they are
   called false witnesses, Mat. xxvi. 61, who accused him of it, because
   they wrested it to another sense, applying it to the material temple.
   Many have a faculty of turning Eloi into Elias, molehills into
   mountains, making men offenders for a word, and by false glosses
   causing innocent things to seem odious.

   [4.] Let me entreat you to improve your interests for brotherly and
   friendly collations; public conferences cannot be had without tumult,
   and there is a prejudice against public sermons; and, again, private
   disputes are more for victory than truth; usually there is more of
   strife than love in them. Tertullian [197] saith of his private
   disputation with a Jew, Both drew out their reasonings, and, through
   the heat of contention, both went away unsatisfied. But now, if there
   were meetings instituted for the propounding of things rather by way of
   case than controversy, and matters were carried not so much in a
   disputative way, but by way of friendly collation and loving discourse,
   it would much conduce to the ending of our differences; certainly,
   where such meetings have been set up and wisely ordered, much good hath
   come by them. If we could allure Christians, the lot of whose dwellings
   is disposed among our churches, into these conferences, we should find
   them of much avail. I conceive much might be said out of scripture for
   them; certainly we do not come together so often as we should, to
   comfort ourselves with the mutual faith of one another.' Rom. i. 11,
   12. I believe that episunagoge`n spoken of Heb. x. 25, will infer some
   other meeting besides the public assembly. This benefit you would find
   by such a course, that your own would be stablished, others would be
   less violent. If brought to these friendly consultations, haply it may
   be a business that may engage you to much labour and self-denial; but
   that should not sway with a Christian minister, whose work is not ended
   with an hour's discourse in the pulpit. We are very often calling for
   power to punish heretics; but let us sadly smite upon the thigh, and
   consider if any of us in private have improved those loving courses to
   gain them that have been in our power. Luther hath a pretty saying:
   Igne caritatis comburendi sunt haeretici--you talk of burning heretics,
   burn them first in the fire of love, or, at least, burn them with the
   fire of the Spirit. The apostle speaketh of trying the work by fire,' 1
   Cor. iii. 13. Rational and friendly conviction will do much, at least
   it will beget a sweet and brotherly correspondence, and it is to be
   hoped we shall find more meekness where things are not carried in the
   way of a set disputation.

   I have done with my address to the ministry.

   Thirdly, Give me leave to speak a word to yourselves, not as if I would
   prescribe to you, but only humbly offer two or three considerations to
   your thoughts. It may be I may not show so much discretion in it, yet,
   if I do affection, I have my aim, which is not so much to direct you,
   as to draw you into a consultation about these matters; and therefore I
   humbly propose the business to your care. Think of the church's unity;
   you have covenanted to endeavour that the Lord be one, and his name
   one.' Consider, civil peace depends much upon church peace; religion is
   called so a religando, it being the greatest bond to link men together;
   contrary opinions in religion usually cause much alienation of
   affection, and great disturbances in the common wealth. Therefore this
   matter appertaineth to you in reference to unity. I humbly desire:--

   1. That you would seriously do your utmost to draw things to an
   agreement. You have appointed a committee of accommodation already: we
   do not know what is done; suppose you tried once again. When the
   Remonstrants troubled the churches of the Low Countries, there were
   often collations, and they did select men once and again and again to
   consider how to compose the differences. [198] It is true, those
   endeavours did not succeed, because those meetings were made up of the
   most violent sticklers; and the Arminians, by the means of
   Utenbogardus, had the secret encouragement and countenance of some of
   the magistrates, that nothing should be done to their disservice and
   disadvantage, and so both parties strove to make the best of their
   opinion and faction. But now, if you would be pleased to try once
   again, God knows what will be the success. I suppose there can be no
   danger in trying. Call some men together, whose eminency for the power
   of godliness will make the matter the more venerable, entertained with
   the more reverence and awe. When the people smell self and interest in
   any endeavours, they have the less majesty with them. Call men through
   age and experience versed in such a work, men of a moderate and sober
   spirit, who prefer the interest of religion before that of a party.
   Blessed be God, England doth not want such! Call them together to think
   of ways of reconciliation. Though many thirst and pant after it, yet
   cannot effect it, being but private men, and so not so much regarded,
   and in bodies and assemblies they cannot so well drive it on. Men of
   middle interests, being always suspected, have a prejudice upon their
   endeavours; and, indeed, good men cannot be imagined to be so without
   all touch and sense of their own particular opinion, as not to dispute,
   stickle, and engage for it in such bodies and assemblies. But now, if
   such were called together by your authority, to make it their only work
   to provide for the advantage of religion, and to compose the
   differences, possibly, and by the blessing of God, much good might be
   done. However, you will manifest that you have not been wanting to your
   duty; and therefore weigh it in your thoughts.

   2. That you would quicken your ministers and elders, in their
   provincial and classical meetings, by some charge and command to think
   of ways how best to gain and deal with dissensions. The matter is not
   below the care of a Christian magistrate. Histories tell us how
   Constantine did beseech his bishops to an agreement, oversee their
   counsels, travail in the peace of the churches. Socrates saith he was
   affected with the schisms of the church as his own calamity. [199]
   Well, then, if you would be pleased to quicken them by your command,
   and enable them by your authority to find out and to act in such ways
   as may tend to the ending of the differences and controversies, much
   good might be done. I humbly conceive the true nature and intent of
   such meetings is not altogether or chiefly to give laws authoritatively
   to the particular churches, as to consider how to compose differences
   that do arise in them; and it were sad if the mint and cummin were
   preferred above the weighty works, and the chief of their care were
   spent either in trivial disputes, or in making rules for their own
   rather than in studying all brotherly ways of gaining those that
   differ, and healing the breaches of the church. This, I say, were sad
   indeed; the true intent and nature of these meetings being to give
   satisfaction, and to carry things with more clearness of demonstration,
   and to give out the sense of the church in matters of difficulty: for,
   indeed, the less of a court and the more of a council they have in them
   the better; therefore, if you would command and chiefly commend these
   things of unity to their care and debates, some hope might arise that
   way.

   3. That you would take care that ministers put out for scandal may not
   be so easily taken in again. Against those that are humbly penitent and
   modestly ingenuous, no man would open his mouth; but for the others, I
   am persuaded they are, and will be, a great means of our troubles;
   partly as they occasion no small offence to the godly; the dead body of
   Amasa in the way to discourage the people of the Lord from going on to
   union and accord; the sons of Eli, that cause many to abhor the
   offering of the Lord: partly as those that are very apt to be the
   cinifloes that will blow up the coals of strife amongst us. The first
   stirs about religion in the Low Countries were occasioned by the
   ministers of the old leaven, whom they were fain to take in out of
   necessity in that scarcity of ministers, and to allow some of them,
   because of their parts, in eminent places. The story nameth Wiggerus,
   Coelhaasius, and others, who kindled those sparks of trouble, which
   afterwards were blown up by James Arminius into a great flame. [200]
   Many observe that the Jesuits go over to the Lutherans and foment
   differences between them and the Reformed; and truly we may fear their
   influence; men that have the old malice and a new irritation will stir
   in a way of revenge. The Lord guide you! I am sorry to hear the
   complaints that are abroad.

   4. In the liberty that you give, use great caution. Some things you may
   be forced to bear with for a time; take heed of endangering the truth
   of God; you ought to be tender of Christ's little ones; woe to those
   that offend them, Mat. xviii. But you ought to be more tender of
   Christ's truths; you owe somewhat to Christ's saints and servants, but,
   I say again, more to his truths. It is somewhat un heard of that these
   two should come in contest and competition. However, you will find
   Christ more jealous of his ways than of his servants, of his truths
   than of his saints. It is truth makes saints: John xvii. 27, Sanctify
   them by thy truth, thy word is truth;' and husbandmen are ever more
   careful of their seed-corn than of the increase; and, besides, we may
   be deceived in saints--we do not know hearts; but we cannot so easily
   in truths, because there is a sure standard to measure them by.
   Therefore, take heed of doing any thing against truth. It is a good old
   caution, In veste varietas sit scissura non sit--though there be divers
   colours, yet let there be no rent in the church's coat. I will not take
   upon me to state the matter; what liberty you may give, and how far.
   Perhaps that may be un seasonable. However it will not, I hope, be too
   much presumption to present you with the most obvious miscarriages of
   magistrates in this matter. Three sorts of men there are in the world,
   and concerning every one of them we may say, The way of peace they have
   not known.' Rom. iii. 17.

   [1.] Some are of a preposterous zeal in lesser differences, and are all
   for extremity and violence towards those from whom they differ in the
   least degree and circumstances. Most of the censures inflicted by the
   late bishops were because of ceremonies, things not weighty in any
   regard, no, not in their own esteem. Some men breathe out nothing but
   rage and threatenings upon the least dissent.

   I remember I have read of Joab, David's general, that when his teacher
   had falsely vowelled one word in the Hebrew, he slew him; the place was
   that charge to destroy Zechar. He read it Zachar, the males of Amalek.
   [201] It is good to preserve truth, but small distempers will not need
   so violent a cure. It is as if a man should fire a house to destroy the
   mice in it. Union is good, but rigorous enforcements, especially in
   trifles, and things that lie far from the heart of religion, are not so
   warrantable. Paul is everywhere most zealous against errors; there is
   never an epistle of his but hath somewhat against them; however, none
   more earnest than he to bring circumcision and uncircumcision to a
   profession of brotherhood.

   [2.] Some are for medleys and compounds of religion, as if that would
   be peace. Thus Charles V. thought to please all by that wicked book
   called the Interim; it did a great deal of harm, and did not any way
   heal the difference. Many of late amongst us, and in other reformed
   churches, endeavoured to blend us and Rome, Babylon and Zion, together.
   God hateth those iniquos syncretismos, profane mixtures and
   intermistical designs. Unity consists in an agreement in the truth, not
   in a coagulation of errors. Strings that are in tune must not be
   stirred, others must be set up to them. The disobedient must be brought
   up to the wisdom of the just, not that brought down to them, Luke i.
   17. When the language is pure' the shoulder is one, Zeph. iii. 9.
   Little hopes of agreement till you set up pure doctrine, unmixed
   discipline. The new cloth set upon the old will make the rent the
   greater. The world thinks the less purity the more unity, but it is
   otherwise. All the troubles are because iron will not mix with clay,
   God's ways with man's inventions.

   [3.] Some drive at a promiscuous leave and toleration of all opinions
   and differences, though never so contrary to truth, as if this were the
   best way to bring things to any peace and quiet. Oh! consider how great
   a prejudice this is to religion. This is the very way that Julian, the
   apostate, took to destroy it. Socrates Scholasticus, Ammianus
   Marcellinus, and others that write of him, say that, to ruin religion,
   he would equally tolerate and countenance all parties. I shall but take
   notice of what one saith, [202] that he was thoroughly set upon this,
   as knowing it to be the ready way to bring all to naught; and, indeed,
   it was not only the policy of this subtle adversary, but of all the
   enemies of truth, as the margin will inform you. [203] And, in deed,
   where it doth not destroy religion, it doth embase it, partly because
   men content themselves in having made a better choice than others about
   them; partly because men spend all the heat and first born of their
   strength and zeal in the contentions, and let practice go. Certainly
   there would be but little security to truth and its followers where
   there is such a promiscuous toleration. Where men are godly they cannot
   be so easily amassed into one body and confederacy with persons
   erroneous; they being bound up by conscience, and having religion on
   their sides, are not so flexible, and then the others cannot so well
   agree with them, for two different errors can better agree and cotton
   among themselves than one error and the nearest truth. Darkness and
   darkness can better agree than light and darkness: always you will find
   it, men hate the nearest truth as being that light by which their deeds
   are reproved. The Eunomians and the Arians, though they held different
   errors (the one denied the Godhead of the Son, the other of the
   Spirit), could better agree with one an other than with the orthodox.
   The Pharisees and Herodians, though of different principles (the one
   being for, the other against the liberty of the Jews), yet both could
   conspire together to entrap Christ. Gebal and Ammon and Amalek could
   better accord with one another than with Zion. In such a case truth
   would be worst provided for; always under fears of some Sicilian
   vespers or a Saint Bartholomew's matins, some sudden eruption of
   violent counsels and dangers hatched against it.

   Thus I have been bold to commend a few things unto you. God direct your
   hearts to all seasonable counsels, for his glory and the church's good!

   Object. But you will say, This a work of time. What is to be done to
   avoid the danger of the present distractions?

   Sol. I answer--That question is to be put to God, not man: Ps. xi. 3,
   If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do,' i.e., if
   religion, laws, authority, and all have lost their awe, what can they
   do? The answer is in the next verse: God is in the holy temple,' i.e.,
   there is a God above, one in heaven, go to him. I suppose you are met
   this day, as those at Ahava, to seek a right way, Ezra. viii. 21; when
   we are at a loss and past the help of means, the address may be the
   better made to God.

   2. If you go to God, you must go to him in his own way. How is that?
   You shall see Job xxxiv. 31, Surely it is meet to be said to God, I
   have borne the chastisement of mine iniquity; I will offend no more.'
   This is meet for you to be said to God, to come before him with
   humiliation and reformation.

   [1.] With humiliation. Sadly reflect upon your miscarriages. I would
   not willingly declaim upon that theme; too many do. It is natural to us
   to speak evil of dignities: envy would blast eminency. Some are mad
   upon idols; they will blemish you, for you have vexed them. Others are
   burdened with payments, and they will say, The former times were better
   than these,' Eccles. vii. 10. Haply Solomon relateth to his own times.
   They complain of Solomon's yokes, though occasioned by the temple work
   in those days. Some affect the repute of bold men; it feeds the humour
   of the times to lay things to your charge. The Lord make others more
   sober, and you more humble! It is your duty to smite upon the thigh.
   Surely there is a cause, when there were such great distractions that
   they groped like a blind man, and could not find the way. They said,
   Our iniquities are with us; as for our transgressions, we know them,'
   Isa. lix. 10-12. When those that speak tremblings are little feared,
   surely there is some offence, Hosea xiii. 1. Commune with your own
   hearts; guilt works best when it results from your own consciences;
   being represented from without; it irritateth; sweetly arising from
   within, it humbleth. What is the matter then? Have you dealt with God
   so faithfully, with the people so kindly, as you should? Have
   grievances been redressed, justice executed, the glory of God's house
   provided for? I remember a story in Plutarch of Demetrius, king of
   Macedonia, [204] who, when his subjects tendered their petitions to him
   of having their grievances redressed, he cast them into a river:
   afterward Seleucus the Great came with an army against him; not a man
   would stir; he was taken prisoner, and deprived of his kingdom. People
   will bear any thing rather than neglects of justice. Consider these
   things. Come with humiliation.

   [2.] Come with purposes of reformation: I will do so no more.' Do your
   first works if you would recover your lost glory. You know by what
   insinuations Absalom stole away the hearts of the people; by those of
   justice and kindness. He kissed them. He did perjicere oscula, adorare
   vulgus, as the historian saith of Otho; and you know he said, 2 Sam.
   xv. 4, Oh! that I were a judge in the land, then I would do them
   justice; and it would be sad if corruptions be found in you when
   distractions are upon you. It is said of the assembly of the gods,'
   that had not done justice to the afflicted, nor defended the poor widow
   and fatherless, Ps. lxxxii. 5, That they know not, neither will they
   understand; they walk on in darkness, though the foundations of the
   land be out of course;' they continued in perverting justice and right,
   though God ruined the commonwealth and plucked it asunder. Oh! let it
   be never said of you; it shall be my prayer to God for you.

                        ENGLAND'S SPIRITUAL LANGUISHING;

    WITH

THE CAUSES AND CURE:

  DISCOVERED IN A SERMON PREACHED BEFORE THE HONOURABLE
  HOUSE OF COMMONS, ON THEIR SOLEMN DAY OF FAST,
  AT MARGARET'S, WESTMINSTER, JUNE 28, 1648.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY.

   To the Honourable House of Commons now assembled in Parliament.

   YOU were pleased to require my service on your late day of fast, as you
   had done on the same occasion just a twelvemonth before. I desired to
   speak seasonably then, and now too. The Lord directed my thoughts then
   to a subject of peace,--our distractions were great, and now to treat
   of zeal,--our destruction, we fear, draweth nigh. These two things may
   well stand together, love and zeal; and if men were wise, James iii.
   18, the fruit of righteousness might be sown in peace, and such concord
   effected between brethren, wherein religion may not suffer. I know
   there are two parties that will never be accorded the seed of the
   woman, and the seed of the serpent; there will be enmity. But is not
   there a wise man among us? not one that shall be able to judge between
   brethren? 1 Cor. vi. 5. I speak not this to flatter with a general
   offer; I have always disliked general invectives against error, and
   general proposals of peace. [205] This were to deal in names rather
   than things, and to seduce the soul into a hope of that which is far
   enough from being accomplished. Neither do I speak it to cool any man's
   zeal; the drift of this sermon is to kindle it. Godliness cannot be
   without a holy heat. Those that suffer under persecution will contend
   against delusion, that is but a duty; and it were to be wished it were
   more done, and more regularly. Certainly some have been too silent
   whilst the truths of God have been made void; [206] therefore, we are
   far from condemning any such vigorous opposition of the present errors.
   I only mention it as an expression of my desires and hopes.

   For the present discourse, the style of it, I confess, is too turbid,
   and hath too much of inculcation in it to be fit for the press, and
   therefore I should have adjudged it to keep company with some other
   neglected papers, but that, in obedience to your order, and
   condescension to the requests of some friends, I have now made it
   public; and, my employment being much, am forced to send it forth
   without refining. I do not know what blessing the Lord, whose power is
   usually perfected in weakness, 2 Cor. xii. 9, may ordain by it. I
   desire to wait upon him, commending it to his grace.

   In many things I have freely expressed myself, and possibly some may
   think, uncovered our own nakedness. The mouth of iniquity is soon
   opened; and it is hard to speak against the sins of religious persons
   without giving some advantage to religious enemies. All that I shall
   say to this is, that offenders give the scandal, not the reprover. I
   confess, I like rolling in the dust at Aphrah, Micah i. 10, that Gath
   may not know it; but when offences are public, it were an injury to
   religion to be silent. We cannot do it a greater right than to declare
   and witness against such miscarriages; and, therefore, when the house
   of Jacob offendeth, it must be told its own with a full throat. [207]
   It will be our honour to shake off the vipers upon a discovery, though
   they would still stick on. But for the enemies;--

   Nullane habent vitia? immo alia haud foriasse minora: [208]

   are they so innocent as to be able to cast the stone at us? John viii.
   7. Shall they that have wounds upbraid us with scars? [209] and they
   that halt downright, charge us with tripping? or the blackamore object
   spots to a fair woman? Let them first pluck out their own beam, and
   then possibly they may understand what an injury it is, and a wicked
   malice, to throw personal guilt in religion's face, and out of a
   dislike to one Mordecai, to seek the destruction of all the Jews,
   Esther iii. 6, and to charge that upon the order which is but the just
   blemish of some persons sheltered under the name and pretence of it. As
   Nazianzen speaketh of some: Oi kataitiontai to`n no'mon auto`n os
   kaki'as dida'skalon, kai` malisth' o'tan pollois entu'chosi ponerois
   ton prostasi'as exiome'non: that for some bishops' sake accuse
   Christianity itself as an evil law. [210]

   For yourselves, right honourable, I beseech you, remember religion
   flourishing will be your defence; and that it is better to trust God
   with your protection, than to fly to ill counsels, [211] or
   condescensions, whereby you may gain the respects of men. The Lord
   grant that you may live up to such a principle; and in these times of
   violence, do nothing unworthy of God, or of his oath that is upon you.

   So prayeth your meanest servant in the Lord's work,

   Tho. Manton.

ENGLAND'S SPIRITUAL LANGUISHING;

    WITH

THE CAUSES AND CURE.

   Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to
   die; for I have not found thy works perfect before God.--Rev. III. 2.

   IN scriptures wherein the expression is anything more difficult, wits
   are most rank and luxuriant, every one taking a liberty to affix his
   own sense there, where the true and genuine sense is not so obvious and
   easily found out; and because two or three false interpretations may be
   asserted with equal probability, the scriptures have suffered as an
   uncertain rule, or nose of wax (it is the blasphemy of the Papists),
   which is ductile and pliable to every fancy and purpose. The truth is,
   we are more happy in discovering falsehood than in clearing truth, and
   those which come after can more easily discern wherein others have
   halted and are defective, than reach the truth themselves. I have
   always looked upon that as a grave observation, [212] Facilius est
   aliorum convellere sententias quam stabilire propriam--men are always
   better at confuting than confirming; in which, though I am strengthened
   by the censure of Jerome on Lactantius, [213] who observed that his
   arguments were more valid and strong which he brought against false
   worships, than those other by which he confirmed the true; and Tully
   wished he could as easily find out the true God as disprove the false.
   [214] Whether it be through that natural desire that is in us to
   blemish others, or from the weakness and imperfection of our
   apprehensions, or from an obstinate prejudice against divine truths, or
   from God's hiding and reserving many things till the age next their
   accomplishment, I will not now dispute. I only hint it to show that
   therefore it is why men have disputed so unhappily, and with such
   variety, about some difficult places of scripture, always acquitting
   themselves with more honour, success, and satisfaction in disproving
   the opinion of others, than in vindicating and clearing their own.

   As this hath been the fate of other scriptures, so especially of this
   book of the Revelation, wherein there are as many mysteries as words;
   and all matters, as is usual in prophecies, veiled under expressions
   which are of a mystic sense and interpretation. [215] Above all other
   parts of the book, the three first chapters are most plain and easy to
   be understood, though here also difficulties want not. For my part, I
   shall not trouble you with the several thoughts of men about these
   chapters. The noise of axe and hammer should not be heard in the
   temple; these discussions better become the study than the pulpit.

   Let it suffice to note that the main contents of them are several
   epistles sent from Jesus Christ by John to the seven churches of Asia.
   But here a doubt ariseth, why a Catholic prophecy, such as is
   calculated for the church in general, and all ages of it, should begin
   with epistles to these particular churches. What may be the reason of
   this? Ans. It is so, partly because the gospel did here first eminently
   flourish, and the Spirit of God foresaw that the malice of Satan would
   also first powerfully invade and overrun these churches, and so engage
   them to the wrath of God; [216] partly because of John's particular
   relation and apostolical presidency over these churches, wherein the
   Spirit of God condescendeth to that natural inquisitiveness and desire
   that we have to know what shall become of our own; and therefore being
   about to reveal to him the state of all the churches, he beginneth with
   those to whom he stood in particular bond and relation.

   But why to the seven churches in Asia, since there were more planted in
   that tract and country? [217] I answer--again--It may be partly because
   of the prophetical perfection of this number, which is every where in
   scripture solemn and sacred, and with which the Spirit of God seemeth
   most delighted in this prophecy; and, therefore, we hear of seven
   stars, seven spirits, seven candlesticks, seven lamps, seven seals,
   seven angels, seven trumpets, seven vials, seven thunders of the dragon
   with seven heads, the city with seven hills, the beast with seven
   horns; and, therefore, that the beginning of the prophecy might carry
   proportion with the rest of it, wherein all things are set forth under
   the typical figure of this number, he writeth to the seven churches of
   Asia. And partly because in these seven churches, which were the most
   eminent, there was found enough to represent the state, graces, evils
   of all churches in all ages; and indeed the pattern and type is so
   complete and perfect, that by an easy and fair accommodation it may be
   applied to all other churches that are not named here, for in them God
   was pleased to give the world a document and experience of all those
   judgments and dispensations which he would exercise towards other
   churches offending and declining in the same manner.

   One question more, and we have done with this general view, and that
   is, Why all these epistles are directed to the several angels, or
   respective ministries of the churches, since the drift of them
   concerneth the whole body of the people? I answer--Either because they
   were notoriously guilty of the offences charged, and so by example
   propagated their own taint and profaneness among the people; or through
   oscitancy and carelessness suffered corruptions to creep in upon
   others; or else because all dispensations from Christ were to pass
   through their hands to the church; and so the regular way of
   transmitting these epistles was by means of the angel or eldership.

   Other general observations there are, but I quit them, desiring to fall
   upon the epistle we have in hand. The text is a part of the epistle to
   the church of Sardis, which was a flourishing and rich city, the seat
   of the kings of Lydia. In it you have:--

   1. An inscription: To the angel of the church of Sardis,' write. You
   see it is inscribed, as all the rest are, to the angel of the church;'
   that is, to the ministry, who, because of their subserviency to the
   salvation of the elect, and that resemblance that is between their
   function and the angel's office, are expressed by that term, and though
   they were many, yet they are expressed in the singular number, angel,
   to note their union and combination in a body and society. To this
   angel write, in which word he produceth his warrant and authority. We
   cannot threaten churches in our own name; Christ must first say, Write.
   The priests under the law were to have their ears tipped with blood,
   Exod. xxix. 20. Christ must command and inspire, as he doth John here,
   Write. [218]

   2. A description of Christ, the author of this epistle, These things
   saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars.' The
   seven Spirits, that is, the Holy Ghost, who is called so because of the
   plenty, perfection, and variety of his gracious operations and
   influences; and, therefore, in the old hymn of the church, it was said
   to the Holy Ghost, Tu septiformis munere; and it is said Christ hath
   these seven Spirits, that is, hath power to send the Holy Ghost, who
   always acteth as Christ's Spirit, with reference to his merit and
   intercession; therefore it is said, John xiv. 15, He shall take of mine
   and show it you.' Christ taketh this title upon him now to show that he
   had Spirit enough to quicken dead Sardis, seven Spirits, when he
   writeth to a languishing church. The next part of the description is
   and the seven stars;' these are expounded Rev. i. 20. And the seven
   stars are the angels of the seven churches;' so that the stars note the
   subordinate ministries which Christ is said to have, because he
   appointeth them, gifteth them, assists them in their office and
   functions.

   3. The occasion of the epistle, which is taken from the state of the
   church, which was well enough known to God, and therefore it is
   prefaced thus, I know thy works,' a phrase that is used to all the rest
   of the churches, but is most proper to Sardis, whose crime objected is,
   hypocrisy and pretence. Oh! how should it startle hypocrites to hear
   God say, I know thy works.' It implieth Christ's strict and severe
   observation of what is done among his people; his eyes are every where,
   but he observeth the church: Cant. vi. 11, He goeth down into the
   gardens to see the fruits of the valleys; to see whether the vines
   flourished, and the pomegranates budded;' phrases which imply a narrow
   inspection.

   The state of the church is described two ways:--

   [1.] By its repute and renown among other churches, they did judge and
   speak well of her: Thou hast a name that thou livest'--i.e., thou art
   reputed to be eminent for faith, piety, and the power of godliness, and
   goest for an excellent church in thine own conceit and the opinion of
   others; a church is then said to live when it receiveth the grace of
   life, and expresseth the life of grace, and name is taken for repute
   and renown.

   [2.] By the judgment of Jesus Christ--but art dead.' Thy condition is
   not correspondent to the report that goeth of thee. The churches that
   judge well of thee are deceived; for though there be much profession,
   yet very little of the power of truth and godliness is found in thee,
   which is here expressed by death.

   4. The next things observable is the counsel of Christ, and direction
   to this languishing church, and that is in the verse read: Be watchful,
   and strengthen the things that are ready to die,' &c.

   In which counsel of Christ to his church you may observe:--

   [1.] An excitation, Be watchful.'

   [2.] A direction, Strengthen the things which remain, which are ready
   to die.'

   [3.] A conviction to set on both the former parts, For I have not found
   thy works perfect before God.'

   The main duty is in the middle, the first part being laid down by way
   of preparative to it, and the third by way of reason and enforcement.
   Therefore, though I shall explain the whole verse, yet I shall single
   out the middle clause for larger and more special discussion.

   [1.] I begin with the excitation, which, as I said, was laid down by
   way of preparation for the other duty: Be watchful,'--i.e., look to it,
   see whereunto these things will grow. Such sad beginnings should make
   you consider and observe your sins, and provide against your judgments.
   Holy watchfulness and observation is the first step to amendment; and
   when people begin to understand the approaches of wrath, they are in a
   fair way to prevent them. There cannot be such a grey hair, or a sadder
   intimation of swift destruction, than a secure and careless
   inadvertency. The first thing pressed is, Be watchful.'

   [2.] You may look upon the conviction, which is brought as a reason why
   they should watch, or recover their former height in godliness: For I
   have not found thy works perfect before God.' Whatever men think of
   them, they are not so holy and entire as to be able to endure my trial.
   Things in a scripture sense are said to be pepkerome'na, full and
   perfect, when they are sincere and sound, without hypocrisy and guile;
   and therefore Caleb's integrity is expressed by fulfilling after God,
   or following of God fully, Num. xiv. 24; he understandeth such a
   perfect and full growth as keepeth things from languishing or dying
   away.

   [3.] The next thing now is the direction or main duty pressed:
   Strengthen the things that remain, which are ready to die.' There were
   ta` loipa`, some sorry remains of religion and godliness, to quicken or
   strengthen which he addeth a reason, a' me'llei apothanein, which shall
   die. The same kind of Greek expression is used concerning the
   centurion's servant, when he was at the point of death, which is
   expressed by e'melle teleutan, Luke vii. 2. They are even languishing
   and expiring; unless you strengthen and repair them, they are utterly
   lost and gone. The word that expresseth their duty is ste'rixon, settle
   or establish them, which implieth not only a care to keep them from
   expiration, but to recover them to their former height and radiancy;
   and, therefore, a like matter is expressed by the apostle Paul in
   another word, for he biddeth Timothy anazopurein, stir or blow up the
   gift of God in him, 2 Tim. i. 6.

   There is nothing of difficulty in the clause, only it doth not so
   easily appear, since they are not specified in the text, what are those
   ta` loipa`, those remains of religion, which he urgeth them to
   strengthen.

   How shall we know what they are? Ans. It cannot be meant of persons, as
   some would have it, understanding it of the weak of the flock, for it
   is ta` loipa`, things, not persons; and truly it must be something
   concerning the vitals of religion; such, which, if revived, would make
   them live and flourish again in the sight of God and of the churches.
   Now, doctrinals it cannot be, for the reason rendered in the latter
   part of the text, For I have not found thy works perfect before God.'
   It is some decay in practicals, thy works, ta` e'rga; and if they had
   decayed in doctrinals, they could not have so much as a name that they
   lived. And then mere discipline it cannot be, for howsoever that be a
   great preservation to godliness, and a considerable stake in religion's
   hedge, yet the corruption or intermission of discipline cannot so
   properly be termed the death of the church. It is, I remember, if some
   expound the place right, called the sleep of the church, Cant. vi. 2, I
   sleep, but my heart waketh.' Brightman [219] applieth it to the church
   about the third century, which was watchful over doctrine; the heart
   waked, but carelessly digested the corruption and degeneration of
   discipline, and therefore she is said to sleep, but it is nowhere
   called death; and it cannot be mere discipline, though some regard may
   be had thereunto. And therefore principally it is meant of some few
   poor relics of languishing godliness, like sparks under the ashes which
   needed blowing up. [220] The sum of all is, I hope you will be stirred
   up by this admonition to prevent your death, and utter languishing in
   religion, that decayed godliness may have its former power, efficacy,
   and glory. I look upon the text as a counsel to a church, not to
   private Christians. I confess it is applied to them by most, because it
   yieldeth conceptus praedicabiles, as they call them, much preaching
   matter concerning the languishing and decay of grace in Christians.

   I cannot say this is excluded, because the part followeth the reason of
   the whole, but I rather look upon it, and so shall handle it, in a
   public regard.

   The point is:--

   Doct. That a special way to save a church and people from immi nent and
   speedy ruin is the repairing of decayed godliness.

   It is Christ's counsel to Sardis, lest he should come upon them as a
   thief, that is, bring a sudden and unthought-of destruction. Give me
   leave to parallel it but with one place, and then I shall proceed to
   the reasons. It is the counsel to Ephesus, Rev. ii. 5, Do thy first
   works, or else I will come to thee quickly and remove thy candlestick,'
   &c. Recovering religion to its former height is made a means of
   preventing God's coming in judgment; and it is there expressed by first
   works.' because religion at the first coming is entertained with more
   genuine simplicity, and zealous earnestness, as stuffs in their first
   making are strongly wrought, and is full of life and power; therefore
   do thy first works.

   Reason 1. Because by this means you take away that which will be the
   cause of ruin. God delighteth to make the outward estate to carry
   proportion with the inward; as we decay in godliness, so our outward
   happiness languisheth, and the hand of mercy is slackened. How easily
   may a wise Christian read his guilt in his condition, and from his
   outward decays understand his inward! And truly it is so in
   commonwealths too, their fate followeth the state of religion. God
   meteth to us in our own measure; instances want not: Ye have forsaken
   me, and therefore I have left you,' 2 Chron. xii. 5. Rulers rebel
   against God, and their people rebel against them, therefore is there a
   tumult among thy people,' Hosea xiv. 10. Friends are alienated and
   estranged from them, because their hearts are first estranged from God;
   there are confusions in the church, and then what followeth?
   distractions in the state. It was grave advice which the English
   divines gave the Dutch magistrates in the Synod of Dort, [221] that
   they should take heed lest, by their connivance at church disorders
   which they could help, they did not draw on state tumults and factions,
   which, when they would, they could not help. Truly this is God's
   course, to retaliate with the creature; and, as I said before, to make
   their outward condition answer their inward. Religion is, as it were,
   the soul of the commonwealth. Now, the state of the body dependeth much
   upon the good temper of the soul, it being linked to it by the
   affections, as so many pins and nails. A troubled soul discomposeth the
   body, but a cheerful mind cureth it; so religion and godliness, as it
   thriveth, maketh us thrive. God challengeth his people to avouch one
   instance when ever they lost by it, Jer. ii. 5, What iniquity have your
   fathers found in me?' and ver. 13. O ye generation! have I been a
   wilderness or a land of darkness to you?' Did ever godliness do you
   hurt? If you can, do but produce one experience! If you will believe
   Polycarp upon his own trial--and let me tell you he was an old Mnason,
   and had much trial of God--he will inform you, ogdoe'konta kai` e`x
   e'te douleu'o auto, kai` oude'n me edi'kesen, &c. For my part, saith
   he, I can speak of eighty-six years; I have been his servant so long,
   and he never did me harm. And truly, notwithstanding the prejudices
   that are abroad, we may come in with the like attestation, godliness
   never did us harm; when it thrived and was vigorous, we thrived, and
   sensibly felt the benefits of the power of it. See how God appealeth to
   men in this matter, Micah ii. 7, Are these his doings? do not my words
   do good to him that walketh uprightly?' See the meaning of that place a
   little: Are these his doings?' Speaking of the troubles, do you think
   these are the fruits of religion? or of your endeavours for the
   advancement of it? No; your own souls know that my words have done you
   good, yielded you much comfort and deliverance; you were happy as long
   as you kept in that way. And therefore, now, if you would take away the
   cause of ruin, and redress the disorders of the commonwealth, repair
   the decays of religion, do what you can to restore that to its former
   power and efficacy.

   Reason 2. Because, by outward success, God will visibly declare his
   delight in such eminent works as these are, and therefore setteth his
   heart to bless and prosper such a people, who set their hearts to
   repair decayed religion. And God doth it the rather, partly because of
   the prejudice that is upon godliness; as men cast most honour upon the
   parts most uncomely, so doth God most blessing and comfort upon a
   despised grace. Men accuse it as the only makebate, and in the world's
   eye it is the cause of want, and sword, and famine, Jer. xliv. 18; and
   therefore God attesteth and witnesseth from heaven that it is the only
   pledge of a blessing; the more we are prejudiced, the more free is God
   in honouring it; and partly because of his own delight in it; it is a
   grace that giveth all to God, and therefore God doth all for it. He
   dealeth with it as Caleb with his dear daughter Achsah; he giveth her
   the upper and the nether springs, Josh. xv. 19, the blessings of this
   life and that to come, 1 Tim. iv. 8; for as all the motions and
   tendencies of godliness are to exalt God, so all God's aims and
   dispensations are to exalt godliness, and therefore is it that we do so
   often hear of a blessing upon all endeavours, especially such as are
   eminent and public, that look that way: see Hag, ii. 19, From this day
   forward will I bless you;' that is, from the day that they took care of
   the temple, God would have them observe if their hopes and happiness
   did not thrive from that day forward. So 2 Chron. vii. 11, All that
   came into Solomon's heart to make in his own house, and the house of
   the Lord, he prosperously effected.' Those two cares thrive the better
   for one another; the Lord's house made him prosper the better in
   building his own, for God is resolutely engaged to let the world know
   what shall be done to the grace which he will honour. So see Isa. iv.
   4, Upon the glory there shall be a defence.' By the glory is meant the
   church reformed or made more holy, for that is the excellency and glory
   of it; God and his people being both glorious in holiness.' Compare
   Exod. xv. 9, with Eph. v. 27. Now upon this glory there will be a
   covering or defensive shelter, as there was of badgers' skins over the
   glory of the tabernacle.

   Reason 3. Because this is the straightest and most direct way to
   safety. In all other policies there are a great many serpentine
   windings and intricacies, whereby the event is not half so sure and
   easy. In desperate cases it is best to take the ready way; and that is,
   the repairing of religion. It is ill when religion is but policy; but
   it is as it should be when our policy is religion. Though the troubles
   are by men, yet our work doth not so much lie with man as with God. We
   begin at the right end, when we begin with him; for by making God a
   friend you may the better get in with men. To set on this reason, take
   a few considerations.

   1. Without God men can do you no good; dependence on the Lord is the
   best security, and the surest policy is trusting God rather than men.
   They are weak and faithless, and so will fail you when there is most
   need. The people are unstable as waters, and their respects are
   dispensed with much uncertainty: to-day they cry up, and to-morrow they
   cry down things; to secure themselves they will desert those that have
   done them most good: as the Keilites were ready to give up David after
   he had delivered them, as soon as Saul had any force in Israel, 1 Sam.
   xxiii. 11. If they keep true, their power to help may be gone. God
   kindleth courage and quencheth it at pleasure:. Ezek. vii. 14, They
   have blown the trumpet to make all ready, but none goeth to the battle,
   for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.' There were great
   preparations, but their hearts failed them. Truly there is nothing
   preserveth states so much as God's power over the spirits of men, and
   nothing which you ought to regard and heed so much as that. Bodies
   without hearts are a disadvantage, and their hearts are in God's hands.
   All outward strength and support lieth in the movable respects of the
   people; for so they are in themselves, it is God only that can fix and
   make them sure.

   2. With God men can do you no harm; he is with them that are careful to
   establish and set up his worship, and then they need not care who are
   against them: see 2 Chron. xxviii. There is a story of Sennacherib's
   coming up against Jerusalem in the first verse; the time is specially
   noted: After these things and the establishment thereof;' that is,
   after Hezekiah had established the worship of God, which circumstance
   is mentioned chiefly to note the occasion of Hezekiah's confidence; for
   see how he disvalues him upon this: ver. 8, With him is an arm of
   flesh, but with us is the Lord our God.' When ye are thus for God, God
   will be with you, and then what is dust to the wind, briars and thorns
   to a devouring burning, an arm of flesh to the Lord our God? All the
   discouragements of the creature come from these things: want of care to
   get interest in God. and want of skill to improve it. Your grand design
   should be to get God with you, and truly then you may slight the most
   daring attempts: Isa. viii. 9, 10, Associate yourselves, O ye people,
   and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far
   countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces, gird
   yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces: take counsel together and
   it shall come to nought. Speak the word and it shall not stand, for God
   is with us.' In a triumph of faith the prophet laugheth at their vain
   attempts. He challengeth not only single adversaries that might sooner
   be dissipated, but such as were strengthened by a combination of
   interests, and twisted into a league and association, but all will not
   do. Ye shall be broken in pieces.' Again he speaketh to them, Call in
   more strength, come with advised care, yet ye shall be broken to
   pieces. If you will adventure once more, and try the other fifty, as
   that wretched king did, 2 Kings 1, and see if heaven will smile on a
   third endeavour, yet still the event shall be the same, Ye shall be
   broken in pieces.' He addeth again, Take counsel together;' that is,
   recollect yourselves; summon your best wits, that you may know wherein
   you have failed, and play your game the more wisely the next time; yet,
   saith the prophet, it shall come to nought. Your deliberate and mature
   consultations shall have the same event with your rash and heady
   enterprises; that is, all shall be disappointed. The prophet goeth on,
   speak the word, and it shall not stand;' that is, when you have
   prepared the business, so that you think all the devils in hell cannot
   disappoint you, yet God can, for he supposeth their presumption grown
   so confident, as that they speak the word; that is, give out threats
   and boasts, and yet then it shall not stand. The reason is rendered in
   the close of all; for Emmanuel, for God is with us. Indeed, there is
   the ground of all. God never made a creature, or any combination of
   creatures, that, should be too hard for him; God with us, is enough.
   You do but spit against the wind when you oppose those with whom he is.
   The drivel will be returned upon your own face: Isa. liv. 18, Surely
   they shall gather together, but not by me. Whosoever shall gather
   together against thee, shall fall for thy sake.' There may be tumults
   and confusions, but being without God there is little hope, and against
   God there is certain ruin. The heathens were convinced of this; they
   would not war against a nation till they had called out their gods from
   them. Macrobius, in his Saturnalia, hath a chapter, De Ritu Evocandi
   Deos. It was upon this errand that Balaam went to Balak, to get away
   the God of Israel, Num. xxiii. Certainly nothing goes so near to the
   hearts of God's people as the insultations of their adversaries, when
   they have lost their shadow and the defensive presence of their God; as
   when David had fallen scandalously in the matter of Uriah, his
   adversaries boasted, Now there is no help from him in God. Selah,' Ps.
   iii. 2; and this went to his soul. So still our scandalous miscarriages
   give the adversaries hope that our shadow is gone, &c.

   3. In having God, you have men too; he can preserve friends, or awe
   enemies; and therefore, still I say, to gain the respects of men, the
   best way is to get in with God: Prov. xvi. 7, When a man's ways please
   the Lord, his enemies shall be at peace with him,' Remember God's power
   over the spirits of men, and then you will see that your main work
   lieth with him. Jacob's hardest task was with God; he wrestleth with
   God, and findeth embraces from Esau. Reconcile yourselves to God, and
   take hold of his strength, and then he can take away the enmity of the
   creature. God can recover lost hearts, preserve the respects of
   subjects entire to the supreme powers. It is very notable that in Gen.
   xxxiv. 30, compared with Gen. xxxv. 1, when the miscarriages of Simeon
   and Levi had made Jacob stink among the inhabitants of the land, and he
   was afraid the Canaanites and Perizzites would combine against him to
   slay him, God biddeth him go to Bethel and pay his vows. Such disasters
   should put him in mind of his covenant; the performing of which was the
   best way to support him against his present fears. Oh! consider, if any
   have made you stink in the land, your business is to go to Bethel and
   pay your vows. Force will not be so great a security as godliness.
   Armies make long work, but God can soon still the rage of the people;
   and when he doth it, it is done in a more kindly way. The door is more
   easily opened by a key than an iron bar, and men's hearts sooner gained
   by the power of God than men. God can clear up your renown, recover
   your glory and esteem again, calm the people, and cause all to be
   still. There are two things that are of great difficulty, and they are
   joined in one verse, Ps. lxv. 7, He stilleth the noise of the seas, and
   the tumult of the people.' In the accomplishing of either of these
   things, man is at the greatest loss, either in assuaging the natural or
   the metaphorical waves; and therefore it was well done of that king
   who, to disprove his flatterers that had soothed him with the greatness
   of his command and empire, both by sea and land, caused his chair to be
   set near the sea-side, and the waves beating upon it without any
   reverence, said, Lo! as great a king; as I am, I cannot rebuke one
   wave. Truly no more can princes of themselves still the tumult of the
   people, for they are both of an equal difficulty, and must be left to
   the overruling power of God, the noise of the seas, and the rage of the
   people.

   I come now to apply the point. We have found that getting in with God,
   by establishing religion, and repairing the decays of godliness, is a
   special means of preservation.

   Oh! then let us consider this with reflection upon ourselves; we are
   concerned in it. England heretofore was compared to Laodicea for its
   lukewarmness, [222] it may be compared to Sardis for its languishing.

   We have a name that we live. Our renown is gone into all lands, for
   savoury and practical truths; but, alas! our crown is like to be taken
   from us, and our glory laid in the dust. Religion of late seemeth to
   have lost all life and spirit, and godliness to degenerate into a cold
   form. The ordinances that erstwhile were wont to open heaven and break
   hearts, through the abundance of spirit that was in them, seem now to
   have lost all their converting power. Visions are open and few gained;
   Christ is crucified before our eyes, but some fatal enchantment and
   fascination seemeth to abide upon our congregations, for few hearts are
   broken, few brought into the obedience of the truth. The English
   Christians heretofore were famous for their severe innocency, strict
   walking, constant communion with God, undaunted zeal, sweet
   experiences, holy conferences and communications, whereas now we meet
   with few but such as are, like the vain men of Israel, of a light
   spirit, loose conversation; given to vain wranglings and disputes more
   than to practice and holy life, and measuring religion not so much by
   the power of godliness, as by form and faction, and siding with
   parties. God knoweth how unwilling I am to lay open our own nakedness,
   and to declaim against the times to which he hath disposed me. I know
   the nature of man is querulous and complaining; the unthankful good one
   will always be commending the former times, and accusing his own; it is
   often the voice of discontent and peevishness, The former times were
   better than these,' Eccles. vii. 10. Besides, every trifling zeal vents
   itself in loose invectives and flings. It is easy to rake in this
   puddle, and to reproach our times with such crimes and allegations,
   quae quisque suis temporibus objicit, as Tacitus observed, with which
   every one upbraideth his own age; therefore I shall endeavour to make
   out the conviction more particularly for our humiliation and
   instruction. My method is this:--

   First, I will show you wherein godliness is decayed.

   Secondly, How it came to pass, what may be the occasions or causes of
   such a languishing.

   Thirdly, What we shall do to repair it; every one in his place, the
   people in their way, the ministry in theirs, and you in that orb and
   sphere that is proper to you.

   First, My first work is to show that godliness is decayed, and wherein.
   I shall do that the rather, partly that it may help us to put our
   mouths in the dust, and to lie low in the sense of our shame this day;
   partly because we are all apt to call our design godliness, every party
   like the old Rogatians, ingross it to themselves. For my part, I look
   upon it as the highest sacrilege and peevishness in the world for men
   to do so, to measure religion by their private interest and opinion,
   and as they thrive more or less in the world, so to judge or cry out of
   the rising or fall of religion. Private conceits do not deserve so
   glorious a name, and the godly party is of a larger extent than to be
   appropriated or confined within any one sect and faction. Alas! how
   often do we mistake self-love for zeal, and out of a blind dotage to
   our own opinions, think Christ standeth or falleth with our private
   misconceits and interests. It was but a presumptuous arrogance in
   Nestorius, to promise heaven and victory so lavishly to Theodosius the
   Emperor, if he would do as he suggested. [223] Therefore to prevent all
   partial claims, and to waive the suspicion of any such drift, I shall
   first show wherein the power of godliness is found to decay and
   languish, even unto death; I mean that godliness which is commended to
   us in the word, and is the glory of our religion and profession. The
   gasping of it is many ways discovered, but especially by these things.

   1. By the languishing of zeal, and the neglect of public duties. Zeal
   is a grace so rare, that we scarce know the nature and working of it;
   for, alas! to what a stupidness and cold indifferency in religion are
   we come. Though God be dishonoured, truth violated, the Sabbath
   profaned, yet men are neither hot nor cold, Rev. iii. 15. We content
   ourselves with a lukewarmness and mumbling of profession, middling it
   between Christ and the world; neither suffering nor doing any further
   than will suit with our interests, as if in hazardous cases we should
   look on rather than interpose. Where are those that do eTraja)v%ecr0ai,
   contend earnestly for the faith of the saints, the glory of God, that
   mind religion for religion's sake? Jude 3. If we had more love, we
   would have more zeal; [224] if the heart were gained to religion, we
   would have more heat and power, and not give up ourselves to such a
   secure oscitancy. The iniquity of the times should put us forward, not
   make us worse. A godly man should be like fountain water, hottest in
   coldest weather. Dead fishes may swim with the stream, and every carnal
   heart walk according to the trade of Israel. It deserveth no thanks to
   be earnest in duties, when there is no opposition against them; but,
   alas! as soon as danger cometh, how are men discouraged! It should not
   be so. When the wicked prevail, it is said of the godly man: Job xvii.
   9, That he shall hold on his way; and he that is righteous grow
   stronger and stronger.' True grace and true zeal by an antiperistasis
   is best in the worst times; but it is otherwise with us, for our
   magistrates, some of them, when the day of God is profaned, his name
   dishonoured, his truth questioned, are like careless Gallios, troubled
   with none of these things, do not come forth to the help of Christ. For
   our ministry, many act no further than they are encouraged, and put on
   by an outward power, and will not engage till all difficulties be first
   removed by a secular arm; others leave themselves at a loose liberty
   and indifferency to comply with all parties, and launch forth no
   further, than they may get to shore again if a storm arise. Our people
   are in an unsettled hesitation, ready to draw back upon every trouble,
   pleading for the stumps of Dagon, and revolting in their hearts to the
   old ways. And truly as yet the evil days are not fully come, so that
   this grace is not thoroughly exercised. However, a cold indifferency in
   such times will in very evil times be a flat apostasy. Certainly this
   is clear already, that we are much gone off from our first love. At the
   first breaking out of reformation, what heat and violence was there
   offered to the kingdom of God! what zeal against the little foxes,
   every modest appearance of error! what a holy forwardness! whereas now
   we are at a stand; the old world, like old men, every day losing more
   of its heat and fervour. Melancthon's prophecy is almost verified; for
   he, though he were a sober and meek man--and indeed his fault was too
   much connivance, for, by his silence, consubstantiation prevailed--was
   so sensible of the decay of zeal in his time, that he feared the world
   would come to account religion a matter of nothing, or a word-strife,
   not worthy men's regard and engagement; and truly it is even brought to
   that pass. [225]

   2. By the insipid formality and dead-heartedness that is found
   everywhere. We are without life in the ways of God, little beauty of
   holiness, little circumspection and strictness in life and
   conversation. Religion is like a river; it loseth in strength what it
   getteth in breadth. Now many come in to profess, their walkings are not
   so awful and severe. When it is a shame not to have some form in
   religion, many have but a form, and so debase the holy profession by
   mingling it with their pride, lust, and avarice, so that it is not so
   daunting, and hath no such majesty with it as formerly it had. A truly
   godly man is to be the world's wonder, the world's reproof, the world's
   conviction. The world's wonder: 1 Peter iv. 4, They think it strange,'
   &c. You are to hold forth such mortification and self-denial that the
   world may wonder. You are to wean yourselves, and bind up your
   affections from such objects as do so pleasantly and powerfully
   insinuate with them, and ravish their affections. He should be also the
   world's reproof: Heb. xi. 7, by building an ark Noah condemned the
   world. You should be mirrors to kill basilisks; and in the innocency of
   your lives, show them their own filthiness; in short, your lives should
   be a real reproof and upbraiding to them. And then the world's
   conviction: 1 Cor. xiv. 25, you should walk so that they may see God in
   you of a truth. Your conversation should be nothing else but a walking
   rule, and religion exemplified. But, alas! how vain, carnal, sensual,
   are most men, discovering nothing of the power of grace, the beauty of
   holiness, and the efficacy of the new nature; we may see much of man,
   but nothing of God in them. It is even our description: 2 Tim. iii. 5,
   Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.' Denying the
   power; that is, refusing and resisting that inward virtue and force of
   godliness, by which the heart should be renewed or the conversation
   rectified. Possibly there may be more light, but less heat. What Seneca
   observed of his times is true of ours, Boni esse desierunt, sicubi
   docti evaserint--they were less good when they were more learned; for
   now we rather dispute away duties than practise them. Oh! it is sad
   this, when knowledge shall devour good life, and notion spoil
   knowledge. That of Hugo is but too just a character of us, Amant
   lectionem, non religionem, immo amore lectionis in odium incidunt
   religionis, multos video studiosos, paucos religiosos, &c. [226] Many
   desire to know, few to live; yea, knowledge seemeth to make men less
   strict and holy, for they dispute away religion the more they
   understand of it.

   3. Loathing of heavenly manna. There cannot be a more proper discovery
   of spiritual languishing. Sick persons loathe their food, and feed upon
   ashes. Surely godliness is in the wane when a people are
   Christ-glutted, and gospel-glutted, and are all for ungrounded
   subtleties, quintessential extracts, and distillations. [227] Oh! how
   welcome were the first appearances of light. It is a blessing we know
   by the want of it. When we came newly out of darkness, whose heart did
   not say within him, chaire, phos, welcome, sweet light? When it was a
   new thing, how strangely did it affect us? But it is the unhappy fate
   of the word to be despised upon acquaintance: John xv. 35, Ye rejoiced
   in his light.' pro`s o'ran, for a season,' some small time, when he
   first began to shine in their borders, Cant. i. 26. To a gracious eye
   truth's bed is always green; as fresh and flourishing at the last as at
   the beginning; but most look upon it with an adulterous eye and heart;
   love it whilst it is new, nauseate it after some acquaintance and
   knowledge of it. With what fastidious disdain do men despise sacred
   truths, if discovered in their own native beauty and simplicity! 1 Cor.
   ii. 6, We speak wisdom among those that are perfect,' saith the
   apostle; that is, among grown Christians, who can discern beauty in a
   plain ordinance. Wisdom in an evangelic simplicity, though there be no
   enticing words, sublime speculations, and exotic conceits. But now
   carnal men are all for ta` ba'the, depths, as they say, Rev. ii. 24;
   that is, they account them great and deep mysteries, whereas the Spirit
   of God accounteth them illusions of Satan. Surely God will meet with
   such a wanton people. The continuator of Sleidan showeth, that before
   the great massacre in France, the Protestants were for a luscious,
   wanton kind of preaching. Truly we cannot absolutely determine what
   will become of us, only we have cause to fear that conscientious
   sermons, as much despised as they are, may be a commodity dear enough
   in England ere long; and visions may be less open, that they may be the
   more precious, 1 Sam. iii. 4.

   4. Plain apostasy, and turning round to those things which we hated in
   others before. As for instance, to Arminian, antisabbatarian doctrines,
   &c., which heretofore were made the charactistic note to distinguish
   good persons and bad. I would not be understood as if I did think a
   thing simply evil because held by such men: opposition of image worship
   was never the worse because the Monothelites first stirred in it; [228]
   nor is the cross the more holy because the Messalians despised it;
   neither is everything evil because taught by persons whom religion
   maketh justly odious. I only speak now, as supposing other grounds by
   way of aggravation, and to show how inexcusable it is for us to judge
   others for the same things which we now do ourselves, Rom. ii. 3. And
   truly it is observable, that many, when these corruptions were set on
   by violence, did stubbornly enough bear up against the heat of
   opposition; whereas now, by erroneous insinuations, their revolt is
   made facile, so as they may come off from truth with the less shame and
   regret, and therefore do now allow in themselves those errors which
   formerly, with so much heat and sharpness, they opposed in others,
   Deut. xii. 29, 30. You shall see there, of all sins the Jews were to
   beware of the way of the heathens, whom God had cast out before them.
   Hear the words: When the Lord thy God shall cut off the nations from
   before thee, and thou goest and dwellest in their land, take heed thou
   be not ensnared by following them, after they be destroyed before
   thee.' Truly we have the same nature, and having the same possessions,
   may be easily tempted to the same sins, as pride, looseness, ease, and
   error, &c. You see that is brought as a great aggravation, 2 Kings
   xvii. 8, They walked in the way of the heathen, whom the Lord had cast
   out before them.' These opinions and practices have proved destructive
   to others, and they will be fatal to us too. Such apostasy is a sin of
   a double dye, as being against former experience of God's judgments on
   others, and the former judgment of our own consciences. Why were we so
   keen against that in them, to which we are now revolted ourselves?

   5. By the wounds religion hath received in the house of her friends.
   Many have acted of late under the name and colour of religion, as if
   they went on purpose to make godliness odious, and religion stink in.
   the land, engaging themselves in all unwarrantable practices, odious
   and gross heresies, prostituting the holy profession to all kinds of
   impurities and injuries, whereby the mouth of iniquity is opened, the
   hatred of enemies justified, their reproaches made good, and a great
   occasion and advantage given to wicked men to speak evil of this way.
   It was the glory of Christianity heretofore to be hated unjustly, and
   that only of the worst men, which was an argument of the goodness and
   purity of it. That which Nero hateth must needs be excellent, [229] and
   the only fault that could be charged upon the primitive Christians was
   their Christianity, they were just and honest, good subjects, and good
   neighbours, saith Pliny the younger; only they had their hymnos
   antelucanos, their morning meetings to praise their God; and Tertullian
   saith, the heathens were wont to say, Caius Sejus vir bonus nisi quod
   Christianus,--Caius Sejus was a good man, all his fault was that he was
   a Christian. You see still their profession was their only crime; nay,
   to come nearer home, the Bishop of Aliffe, in the Council of Trent,
   confessed that we had orthodoxos mores, but haereticam fidem, a good
   life, but a bad belief; and truly this was our glory when no evil could
   be charged upon us but our private opinion and profession. But alas!
   now it is otherwise;. many of those that profess religion, have done
   that which a moral heathen would scarce do. Oh! what a dishonour to
   Christ is this, that those that pretend to him should be less civil,
   just, discreet, &c.! Oh! how is the holy profession exposed to the
   shame and reproach of the adversaries! How is Christ crucified and put
   to shame again in your scandals! How will the Hams of the world laugh
   to discover this nakedness! Thus it hath been of old. [230] The apostle
   Peter speaketh of some impure deceivers by whom the way of truth was
   evil spoken of,' 2 Peter ii. 1. Thus the ancient Christians were loaded
   with all kinds of scorn and contempt, and hated for the heretics' sake,
   because of the Gnostics; they were called luminum extinctores, putters
   out of the candles, and doers of obscene things in the dark. [231] The
   unclean conversation of the Priscillianists made Pagans detest all
   Christians, and by the rage of Maximus they fared all alike; malice
   will know no distinction. Alas! what a sad thing is this, that
   religion's own friends should betray her; that you that are called
   Christians should be called so to the disgrace of Jesus Christ, [232]
   that you should give occasion to them that desire occasion, and make
   good all their reproaches!

   6. By religion's being made the stalking-horse to every self-seeking
   design. Many hold it forth only out of a desire to advance some private
   ends, to get preferment and honour in the world, or some opportunity to
   enrich themselves with the public spoils. And truly this is very sad,
   that every malicious, covetous, or ambitious project should be clothed
   with this glorious pretence. Thus the apostle Peter speaketh of some in
   his days that abused their profession by making it a cloak of
   maliciousness,' 1 Peter ii. 6. And Lactantius observeth the same also
   of many in his time, who wounded the Christian name and honour by using
   it as a cover to their sinful and corrupt practices. [233] And others
   show what prejudice was done to religion by the pride, desire of
   greatness, and contention, that was between the pastors and professors
   of it; insomuch that Diocletian thought that Christianity was nothing
   else but a wretched device of wicked men, [234] set afoot out of some
   private aims. Thus, also, Ignatius speaketh of some that were ou
   christi'anoi alla` christe'mporoi, not Christians so much as
   Christ-sellers, [235] like Judas, that followed Christ only to make
   gain of him. I have brought these instances because they do but give us
   the description of many in our age, who make God to serve with their
   sins,' Isa. xliii. 24, and godliness to be only the specious outside of
   every unclean intent and worldly design. Thus poor religion, that
   delighteth to breathe in the air of self-denial, is made the usual
   stale to self-seeking; and godliness, that checketh carnal projects, by
   a vile submission is forced to serve them.

   7. By the want of endeavours to propagate religion, and to diffuse it
   amongst others. True godliness, where it is powerful, is of a diffusive
   and spreading nature, like leaven, till it hath pierced the whole lump.
   Now what have we done in this, either Christians among their
   neighbours, magistrates in the kingdom, or masters in their families?
   For private Christians, they spend the heat and strength of their
   spirits in lesser matters, and let the weightier go; through division
   and strife, forget edification. Many renounce all care of them without;
   and whereas they might have strengthened the hands of their brethren
   that have acted in a public reformation, what have they done? Have they
   joined as far as their private principles would give leave? endeavoured
   to bring the kingdom onward to the way and will of Christ? And then for
   magistrates, have they been so zealous as they should be to propagate a
   religious ministry throughout the kingdom, to enlighten dark corners?
   There is not a better work, nor more for your safety. Austin observed
   [236] that the Christians tasted the violence of the Goths and Vandals,
   for that they were not careful to bring off the heathens from their
   idolatry. Such endeavours would be your defence, and in the business of
   religion nothing concerneth you more than this; but my chief aim under
   this head is to speak of the neglect of family duties, which is the
   great reason why religion is decayed abroad. These are the springs and
   fountains of the country. Churches were first in families, where the
   master of the house was the priest, and the beauty and power of
   religion is still preserved there; and therefore, next to churches,
   they require a chief care. Oh! how excellent is it when churches are
   like to heaven, the assembly below like the great congregation above,
   and families like churches for their religion, order, and comeliness!
   Heb. xii. 29. You read of a church in Philemon's house, Philem. ver. 1.
   Melancthon said of George, Prince of Anhalt, Cubiculum ejus templum,
   academia, curia, [237] that his chamber was a university, a court, and
   a church; the latter because of the instructions, prayer, and worship
   that were there. Religion first decayeth in families before in
   churches; therefore when the order of houses is subverted, duties
   neglected there, how soon doth godliness decay abroad! I do not know
   any one thing that God expecteth more from a religious householder--I
   mean in that capacity and relation than the establishment of religion
   in his family: Gen. xviii. 19, I know Abraham that he will command his
   children and his house hold after him to keep the way of the Lord.'
   Mark, God reckoneth upon it as a duty that the godly will perform, I
   know,' &c.; and remember disappointment is the worst vexation.

   8. By opposition and snarling at piety and purity, as the purity of
   reformation. Men are afraid to be too heavenly, and reject government
   because it would cross their licentiousness; and so the purity that
   shineth forth in the lives of God's servants. You heard in the morning
   [238] how apt an English spirit is to hate godliness under some other
   name, and how men that have but a form are wont to snarl at the power;
   and indeed the apostle Paul observeth the same thing, 2 Tim. iii. 3,
   with ver. 5, Having a form of godliness, despisers of those that are
   good.' These two descriptions are usually coupled. Cain and Abel both
   sacrificed, only Abel's offering was the better, and therefore Cain
   maliced him, 1 John iii. 12. Men do not love to be upbraided by others'
   righteousness; they would fain have their laziness justified by the
   common defects, i'na en to koi'no to` kat' autou's krupte'tai, as
   Nazianzen speaketh, [239] they would have none zealous and excelling;
   therefore those that are contented with a form will hate those that
   have the power. We can look for no other: Gal. iv. 27, He that was born
   after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit; even so
   it is now.' We may also add, And so it is now, and so it will be.
   Carnal Christians will have some pretence or other to persecute those
   that are more godly. One great design is, as you heard in the morning,
   to cry up a name under which this hatred may be carried on the more
   covertly and secretly; and usually it is taken from the party most
   discountenanced, or which is most publicly odious, or which hath most
   dishonoured their profession. Thus when the Priscillianists were
   generally hated, and indeed they deserved it, other Christians shared
   in their miseries, Sulpicius Severus speaketh of one Ithacius, a bishop
   whose hatred against the Priscillianists did so far transport him, that
   if any were of good life, studious of the scriptures, he would suspect
   and blast him as a Priscillianist. I have read of one Sanpaulinus, a
   French martyr, who, when he reproved one for swearing, was presently
   suspected of Lutheranism; and Bonner, if any did but mention the name
   of God with reverence, took it for ground enough to call him Lollard.
   And truly it is even thus among us. The world hath gotten some names
   and pretences under which they carry on their hatred against the power
   of godliness the more securely and with the less dread, so that it is
   to be feared that if any be of godly conversation, it will be enough to
   make him a sectary, and an enemy of the kingdom's peace and quiet. When
   the name is once gotten up, mischief and malice, as I said, will make
   no distinction.

   9. The late great increase of scandalous sins. Times of trouble are
   usually licentious, and when penal laws are suspended by force,
   wickedness groweth impudent; and truly it is even so among us, to the
   confronting of authority; whoring, and swearing, and drunkenness and
   Sabbath profanations abounding everywhere; yea, more than formerly. We
   looked for purging the land, and it is more defiled. When the pot
   boileth, the scum is discovered. Baths bring forth corruption, if it be
   in the body, into the skin. God hath been reforming the land, and our
   wickedness appeareth the more: Hosea vii. 1, When I would have healed
   Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness
   of Samaria.' God hath been correcting and amending us, and we have been
   the more vile and sinful. Oh! then how may the kingdom sit down like
   the church in Micah, and mourn: Micah vii. 1, 2, I am as when they have
   gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage. The
   good man is perished out of the earth. There is none upright upon the
   earth. They all lie in wait for blood, and hunt every man his brother
   by a net,' Zeal is decayed, the power of godliness gone, the word
   despised, and we are even grown as the people whom God hath cast out
   before us. Religion hath received wounds in the house of her friends,
   and is made a pretence to every base design. Few seek to propagate it,
   and it meets with much snarling and opposition everywhere, and iniquity
   is now grown impudent.

   And thus I have done with my first work, which was to show wherein
   religion is decayed.

   Secondly, My next business is to show you the occasions and causes, how
   we came thus to languish and decrease, that so the guilt may lie at the
   right door. And truly we need not contend about that, but may every one
   of us smite upon the thigh, and bear the shame of our own iniquity.

   Briefly then--

   1. For the occasions; the knowledge of them may serve to shame us with
   our unthankfulness. They are two:--

   [1.] One is the late prosperity which God of his mercy had given to his
   people. The church, which is the heir of the cross, [240] is seldom
   able to manage and wield an outward happy condition. I remember,
   Nazianzen observeth, [241] that it hath ever with more honour endured
   misery than with safety improved happiness and success; that maketh us
   always degenerate or divide: sometimes degenerate. When Constantine
   favoured religion, poison was sown in the church; Christians began to
   lose their ancient severity, and to look after ease and honours and
   pleasures in the world. When we have anything in the world, we neglect
   our high hopes; and so by little and little holiness decayeth and
   degenerateth into a mere pretence, which is only retained the better to
   colour over some carnal pursuits and projects; whereas those Christians
   that meet with nothing but hard things in the world and from the world
   are more heavenly and holy; for the inward exercises of mortification
   are much advantaged by their outward condition, and the world being
   crucified to them, they are the better crucified to the world, as Paul
   speaketh, Gal. vi. 14, i.e., it neither smileth upon them nor they upon
   it. And as success maketh us to degenerate, so to divide, rosthe'ntes
   dielu'samen, [242] as he said, as soon as the church grew prosperous it
   grew factious; like timber in the sunshine, we are apt to warp and
   divide from one another, or like elephants returning from the heat of
   the battle, we tread down our own troops. [243] Prosperity begets
   wantonness, and wantonness novelties, and so the people of God come to
   be scattered, and to go into distinct herds and divisions, an evil ever
   fatal to religion, and yet it seemeth connatural. The apostles
   themselves, though oracles infallible, could not wholly prevent it in
   their days; outward prosperity then was a great occasion.

   [2.] Another may be openness of vision. Carnal hearts are soon cloyed.
   I cannot tell how it cometh to pass, but so it is; the word hath less
   power when openly preached. A gospel-glutted stomach doth often force
   God to provide sharp remedies, either some great outward misery,
   accompanied with the want and famine of the word, and then any little
   thing is precious, as see two places: one is Zech. vii. 7, Ye should
   have hearkened to the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and
   in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, and men
   inhabited the south of the plain.' Mark, there is their full condition
   described; the temple stood, the city flourished, the suburbs were
   great; but then they hearkened not, but despised the former prophets,
   that is, the prophets that prophesied before the captivity. But now
   look upon them in their emptiness: the other place for that is Ezra ix.
   8, And now that the Lord hath showed us such grace, to give us a nail
   in the holy place,' &c. Mark how welcome every little thing is to them
   then; a nail in the holy place is such a mercy; that is, to see one pin
   or nail driven into the rafters of the temple; whereas before they
   would not know their own mercies, while that stately edifice stood in
   all its glory and beauty. Times may come when these dews will be
   precious, and sermon showers sweet to thirsty souls; or if this be not,
   God may send a dark Ezekiel, when a plain Jeremiah is despised.
   Ordinances may be carried in such an obscure, notional, airy way as to
   yield no efficacy and comfort. These are the occasions, but--

   2. What are the causes of the languishing and decay of godliness? I
   answer:--

   [1.] That great division and dissentiency that is among God's own
   people. When the language was divided, the building ceased; when
   religion is controverted, it loseth its awe and force. It is observable
   that, Acts iv. 32, 33, when the people were of one heart and of one
   mind, then with great power gave the apostles witness to the
   resurrection of Jesus Christ,' Mark that, with power; the word came
   with command and authority upon the hearts of men. The world easily
   stumbleth at this rock of offence; the assent is more loose and
   doubtful when things are committed to the uncertainty of disputes, and
   so doth not commandingly check vicious inclinations. When the ways of
   flesh and blood are backed with wit and parts, and made to seem a
   valuable opinion, men are hardly gained.

   Besides, godly men themselves, while they engage with too much heat and
   zeal in their particular opinions, grow cool in piety and practical
   duties, the strength of their spirits being diverted and carried out so
   disproportionably to the lesser matters. God placed the flaming sword
   about paradise, and the gospel calleth for violence in the matters of
   the kingdom, Mat. xi. 12. But we usually mistake our object, and
   misplace our zeal upon such matters as have more of interest in them
   than godliness, and are rather busied in disputing much, than doing
   much.

   [2.] The embasing and emasculating the ordinance of preaching. Hunger
   seeketh food, but lust dainties and quails. When preachers provide for
   men's lusts rather than their consciences, religion is embased and
   loseth power. A ministry that stayeth in the paint of words will beget
   but painted grace. When we come in the demonstration of the Spirit, we
   come in power, 1 Cor. ii. 6, en apodei'xei, with plain and solid
   conviction; this is the sin, this the curse and misery. When the thread
   of the gospel is so fine spun, it will not clothe a naked soul; notion
   eateth out all saving knowledge. The apostle speaks of a pseudo'numos
   gnosis, 1 Tim. vi. 20, Oppositions of science falsely so called,' by
   which they thought to better the gospel, but did indeed debase it. Such
   niceties enervate godliness, make it weak and less in power. We must
   take heed then of debasing this ordinance to an effeminate delicacy. It
   should still be masculine and generous, full of spirit and power from
   on high. I would not be mistaken, as if I did plead for a lazy
   carelessness in managing the word. I know that God concurreth with
   man's diligence; and if we would not have the people loathe the word,
   we should painfully provide it for them. Every scribe that is
   instructed for the kingdom of God, that is, that would do service in
   the church of God, must bring forth out of his treasuries things both
   new and old,' Mat. xiii. 52, that is, although not new truths, yet
   koina' kai'nos, old truths in a new way, otherwise represented to the
   imagination or fancy, to take off that tedium or natural satiety that
   is in us, that we may not loathe them as coleworts twice sod, but that
   truths may still have a fresh look upon the conscience and affections.
   This may be done, but we must take heed of ungrounded niceties, subtle
   notions, that beget only speculation, and do not stir up to practice.

   [3.] An undue preaching of the gospel. Poison conveyed in so sweet a
   wine maketh the cup the more deadly. By this means religion itself is
   made to be of sin's side, and the grace of God pliable to carnal
   conclusions; and indeed, when the truths of God, that should convince
   of sin, are debauched to so vile a purpose as to countenance sin, men
   can the better overcome remorse of conscience, and do sin with the less
   regret, out of a presumption that the gospel is of their side, Jude,
   ver. 3, They turn the grace of our God into wantonness;' they debauch
   the grace of God, that is, the doctrine of grace, make that yield
   countenance to their lusts; and so men father their bastards upon the
   Spirit, and sin cum privilegio, by a license from heaven. When those
   that should have been prophets cried, Peace, peace! see what Jeremiah
   saith, chap. iv. 10, Ah! Lord God, surely thou hast greatly deceived
   this people,' in saying they shall have peace. It was done in God's
   name by the false prophets, and they were as secure as if God himself
   had said so. We would willingly have the gospel over-gospelled, and
   hear in the ear of liberty; therefore I am persuaded there is no one
   thing hath hindered the power of godliness, care of duty, humbling of
   souls, so much as this undue preaching of the gospel.

   [4.] Public liberty and connivance, that maketh sin more common, and so
   less odious. Outward restraints keep men that are evil from discovering
   of it: and though it be the privilege of divine precepts to convert the
   soul, Ps. xix. 7, yet the commands and authority of men may much hinder
   the diffusion and dissemination of sin and error. It is good to observe
   the several guards that God hath put upon a man to keep him from sin,
   so prone are we to it. There are inward guards Spirit, word, and
   conscience; there are outward guards--the ministry, the church, and the
   magistrate--all which are as in his stead to be an awe to sinners; more
   especially it is said of the magistrate that he is the minister of God,
   to be a terror to evil-doers.' Rom. xiii. 3, 4. Now, when their sword
   is sheathed up, and nothing is settled, wicked men lose all awe and
   restraint, and do what is right in their own eyes,' Judges xxi. 25, as
   it is said there they did when there was no king of Israel; that is, no
   exercise of government to restrain public disorders, for as yet their
   government was not monarchical; then all goeth to wreck, iniquity
   groweth impudent, and religion is borne down. Solomon saith, Prov. xx.
   8, A king that sitteth upon the throne of judgment scattereth away all
   evil with his eyes;' that is, when magistrates employ and draw out
   their power, they scatter evil as the sun scattereth mists.

   [5.] Another cause may be want of catechising, by which means truths
   would be more revived, and kept fresh and savoury in the thoughts, and
   so have the more awe upon us. Martyrology and catechising were two of
   the most successful engines against Popery. Truths work most when we
   discern that cognation and kin, by which they touch and respect one
   another; indistinct knowledge doth but dispose to error or looseness.
   Sermon hints, a hint here, and a hint there, doth not so much good, for
   men of weaker conceits cannot so easily discern how one truth is
   inferred from another, and what analogy and proportion there is between
   them, and so are easily overcome by more subtle and stronger wits; or
   else, not discerning that fair compliance that is between practical and
   comfortable truths, grow loose. Certainly religion would be more
   propagated if this exercise were revived. We are debtors to wise and
   unwise, Rom. i. 14; and Christ, that bade Peter feed pro'bata, his
   sheep, bade him also feed arni'a, his lambs, John xxi. 15, 16. For want
   of this pattern of sound words, and these condescensions to weak ones
   by this exercise, many mischiefs have abounded amongst us, to the great
   damage of religion and godliness.

   These are part of the causes; others might be mentioned, but I shall
   forbear. You will say then, What remedy? Therefore I shall proceed to
   the next thing, which is to show you:--

   Thirdly, What we should do to strengthen the things that are ready to
   die,' or to repair decayed godliness. Give me leave to speak a word:--

   First, To all in general, as we are Christians. Several things are
   necessary. Let me point at a few.

   1. Oh! that we would all join together, quasi manu factâ--it is
   Tertullian's word--in a holy conspiracy to besiege heaven by prayers,
   until more spirit and life be poured out, and in greater abundance. God
   hath said that he will pour out his Spirit upon all flesh,'' Acts ii.
   15. Oh! beg it for England; go to him that hath the seven Spirits, to
   look upon another dead Sardis. God must offer violence to us ere we can
   offer violence to the kingdom. It is the mighty quickening Spirit, that
   must revive us in our languishings. That which carrieth the soul to
   God, must come from God. Waters can arise no higher than their spring.
   Religion is like the pure vestal flame, which, if it went out, was to
   be kindled only by a sunbeam. Oh! then let us go and wait before God
   for those seven Spirits, those mighty and quickening operations. The
   Spirit came upon Christ in the appearance of a clove, to show his
   meekness; but upon the apostles in cloven tongues of fire, to show the
   might and force that is in his operations.

   2. Let us study how we may more honour and adorn religion by a godly
   and peaceable walking before God and men. Every Christian should be the
   gospel's ornament, as a hypocrite is the gospel's disgrace: Titus ii.
   10, Adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour.' Let the world know there is
   more in religion than pretence and policy. While hypocrites and such as
   seek themselves betray the honour of religion, do you advance it; let
   them see there are true stars as well glaring meteors. Your lives
   should make God glorious: 1 Peter ii. 9, hold forth the praises, ta`s
   areta`s, of him that hath called you; let them read God in you of a
   truth, and be not distinguished so much by a party and profession as by
   holiness. Tertullian saith of the ancient Christians, Non aliunde
   noscibiles quam de emendatione vitiorum--their distinction was their
   innocency. When divers libertines had dishonoured religion, and walked
   unworthily in their relations, Peter pressed the true Christians to
   good conscience and more honest walking, 1 Peter ii. 12, and iii. 16;
   indeed, both those chapters are to this purpose. This will be a real
   confutation, and then God will give you praise in the land of your
   shame, Zeph. iii. 19. Hair cut will grow again if the roots remain; and
   though the razor of censure hath brought baldness and reproach upon the
   head of religion, yet its good name will grow and flourish again, and
   they will be ashamed that falsely accuse your godly conversation. O
   brethren! at such times we should walk with more care. It is a smart
   question that, Neh. v. 9, Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God,
   because of the reproach of the heathen our adversaries?' When your
   lives are thus sleek and innocent, this dirt will not stick.

   3. Stir up yourselves, and provoke one another to more forwardness in
   dead times. We should strive who should be first, and exceed in
   godliness. You know that noted place, Heb. x. 24, Let us consider one
   another, to provoke unto love and good works.' This is agathe` e'ris,
   an holy contention, when we contend who shall be most forward in the
   matters of God. We often provoke one another to carnal strife, to
   excess in vanity. Oh! when do we sharpen and whet each other's graces?
   The sons of the coal, how do they enkindle one another, and strengthen
   each other's hands in wickedness. See how the idolaters are described:
   Isa. xli. 6, 7, They helped every one his neighbour; every one said to
   his brother, Be of good courage. So the carpenter encouraged the
   goldsmith, and he that smootheth with the hammer, him that smiteth on
   the anvil,' &c. The prophet speaketh of the time when the gospel was
   sent to the isles, ver. 1; that is, to the European countries, which
   are usually expressed by isles in Isaiah. Now, as soon as they listened
   to this doctrine, down went the pictures and images, but there being
   some hope offered of their re-erection, they came and strengthened one
   another's hands: Be of good courage.' They hoped to bring up their
   craft and way again with pomp and triumph. Oh! when they strengthen one
   another, will not you? Nazianzen was wont to call the enemies of the
   church koinou`s diallakta`s, [244] the common reconcilers, because when
   they unite and support one another against the church, it doth but
   invite the people of God to a more close union, and free communion with
   one another. This would be an excellent way to prevent the decays of
   love and piety.

   4. Delight in and wait upon the powerful ministry of the word: The
   prophets prophesy lies, and the people love to have it so,' Jer. v. 31.
   A vain people do but encourage a vain ministry. Do not delight, then,
   in a glozing dispensation, it will be successless. Frothy speculations,
   moral strains, do no good; the people begin to grow weary of savoury
   and sound knowledge: the testimony of the witnesses was a torment to
   the dwellers on the earth, Rev. xi. 10; powerful preaching is their
   burden. The lazy world would fain lie upon the bed of ease, draw the
   curtains and rest, and therefore light is trouble some; men begin to
   thirst and pant for the old unsavoury moral strains, which remain in
   wary generals, and do not irritate. The Lord may give you your desire;
   but remember that is a carnal itch that must be clawed, and the times
   will be sad when men cannot endure sound doctrine, 2 Tim. iv. 3.

   I have done with my address to the people.

   Secondly, I shall speak a word to the ministry. I am the worst of a
   thousand to direct others, only I shall take the liberty, in all
   humility, to suggest my thoughts. Much may be done by you to the
   repairing of decayed godliness.

   1. Christ must still be preached. That is the main truth that keepeth
   in the life of Christianity. The more evangelical dispensations are,
   the more powerful; our beloved must still be kept as a bundle of myrrh
   next our hearts, Cant. i. 13, still fresh and fragrant in the thoughts;
   all the comfort and support of a Christian dependeth upon that; this is
   the very spirit and flower of any ministry; and therefore it is said,
   Rev. xix. 10, The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.' It is
   not only the beauty, but the life of any dispensation. I know many
   think this needless, for, as I said before, the indistinct and undue
   preaching of Christ is the cause of all the looseness and vanity into
   which religion is degenerated. Ay! but I add here, that this
   dispensation is still needful. The foolish world is apt to fly into
   extremes; some are all for doctrines of Christ, others will hear
   nothing of him, because these sweet truths have been so much
   misapplied. Popery got up by this pretence; they would not open that
   gap of free grace to the people. Paul would preach the righteousness of
   Christ though many did abuse it: Rom. iii. 8, Some slanderously report
   that we say, Let us do evil that good may come thereof; whose damnation
   is just.' The meaning is, some gave out that Paul taught that they
   might sin freely, that God might have the more glory in pardoning;
   which is expressed there by doing evil that good may come of it. Now,
   saith the apostle, their damnation is just, that is, if they undo
   themselves with such a vile conceit, they may thank themselves; they
   never learned it from me. If poison be sucked out of the flower, thank
   the spider; and if precious liquor be soured, it is because of the
   uncleanness of the vessel. Musculus in one of his books had said, that
   no places were so profane and irreligious as those where the gospel had
   been preached, or words to that effect. And Contzen, a Jesuit, crieth
   out upon this, hi sunt evangelici doctores--see the fruit of
   Protestantism and gospel-preaching. [245] Many are of his spirit,
   malign and slander a gospel dispensation. Alas! we are not in the place
   of God, to prevent misapprehensions; it is our duty to keep this truth
   fresh in the thoughts, to offer it as a bundle of myrrh to the spouse's
   bosom.

   2. Humbling doctrines must be duly pressed. John the Baptist levelled
   mountains, and in his days much violence was offered to the kingdom,
   Mat. xi. 12; and indeed, still John must go before Jesus, like the
   day-star before the sun. Moses led the people in the wilderness, before
   Joshua led them into the land of Canaan. We must awaken first by a
   sense of wrath, or else they will not care for a sight of mercy. The
   people did not desire a mediator till they heard the thundering, Exod.
   xx. 18, 19; and it is God's usual method to suffer us to be dead to one
   law, ere we are alive to another, Gal. ii. 19; first to make us
   understand the severe obligation that is upon us by the covenant of
   works, ere we are brought into a better hope by Jesus Christ. God is
   never truly exalted in the soul till man be humbled; Dagon must fall
   and be broken if the ark be set up. The Lord diggeth deep when he
   meaneth to raise the building high, and when he will bring off the soul
   to Christ powerfully, he bringeth them out of themselves by godly
   sorrow. This is the drift and scope of the whole scriptures, and
   therefore I use the less of argument in this matter.

   3. Among other parts of godliness, it seemeth to be most necessary now
   to press the duties of relations. I say, to press Christians to carry
   themselves holily in their civil relations. No way provideth for the
   discharge of the duties of relations so much as Christianity or
   religion; and none have failed in them so much as religious persons of
   late, so that a great deal of dishonour hath come to God, and a great
   deal of prejudice to religion, by our unworthy walking in our civil
   relations. The gospel or law of Christ requireth that these civil
   respects which we owe to men should be discharged as in and to the
   Lord, and that we should turn duties of the second table into duties of
   the first; that is, perform civil respects upon a religious ground, so
   that it hath been the glory and honour of religion heretofore to yield
   the best children, the best subjects, the best kings, the best husbands
   and wives in the world. Therefore Augustine maketh a challenge to all
   the world, dent exercitum talem qualem doctrina Cliristi milites esse
   jussit, [246] --let all the world, saith he, yield such children, such
   subjects, such soldiers, such servants, such an army, such provincials,
   judges, kings; such faithful ones, when they have been intrusted with
   the public monies. But alas! the case is quite otherwise. Of late, none
   worse than they, none more apt to dishonour God in relations, to
   disturb civil peace, to resist magistracy upon every dissatisfaction,
   and to make every discontent the ground of commotion and disobedience.
   Therefore to teach men to improve their relations for the glory of God
   and good of religion must needs be seasonable, that, if it be possible,
   we may repair that incomparable loss which religion hath sustained this
   way.

   4. Learn that holy art of compounding peace with purity, that neither
   may lose its due respect, that we may neither hazard religion by
   silence nor eager contention. Holiness and peace are daughters of the
   same Spirit, and may be reconciled. You find them often coupled in
   scripture: James iii. 17, The wisdom that is from above is first pure,
   and then peaceable.' Purity must have the precedence in. your
   endeavours, but peaceableness must not altogether be shut out. So Mark
   ix. 30. Have salt in yourselves and peace one with another.' Salt and
   peace; be savoury, but not too tart and austere. I will not direct my
   brethren, I do only suggest it.

   Thirdly, One word now to the magistrate, and I have done. Oh! consider,
   this matter appertaineth to you, to strengthen things that are ready to
   die,' to repair decayed godliness; this challengeth a chief care; yea,
   the first place in your debates, as in the commandments spiritual
   duties have the precedency of moral. In the name of Christ, then, let
   me beseech you:--

   1. To be holy and godly in your own persons. Oh! how sad will it be for
   your souls in the day of the Lord, if you should be employed in the
   reformation of others, and not be reformed yourselves; that you should
   be like Noah's shipwrights, that frame an ark for others, and perish in
   the waters yourselves; or like the Jews, that directed the wise men to
   Bethlehem, but went not themselves thither to worship Christ. Oh!
   consider, you are the first sheets of the kingdom; others are printed
   after your copy. If the first sheet be well set, a thousand more are
   stamped with ease. See then that the power of religion prevail over
   your own souls, that, after you have done good to others, you may not
   be cast away. How can men think that you are sincere in establishing of
   religion, if it hath made no impression on your own hearts? Scandalous
   ministers and wicked magistrates do but pull down with one hand what
   they set up with the other.

   2. If you would repair religion, and promote godliness, give
   encouragement to a godly ministry. You see, when Christ writeth to the
   church to repair godliness, he directeth it to the angel. Oh! let there
   be an angel in every church. Christ's strength lieth in his mouth, Isa.
   xlix. 2; that is the sword by which he overcometh the world. It is the
   weapon he useth against Antichrist, the spirit of his mouth, 2 Thes.
   ii. 11. As Gideon overcame the Midianites by lamps and pitchers, so
   doth Christ by lamps and pitchers; and therefore the apostle calleth it
   light, or treasure, in an earthen vessel. Oh! then maintain the lamps,
   that they may be a means in the hand of God of maintaining godliness in
   the kingdom. Let there be, as I said, an angel in every church, a light
   in every socket, a star in every orb. If you look abroad you will find
   many continued through favour and mediation of friends, qui nihil
   habent in vita angelicum, aut in doctrina evangelicum, [247] that have
   nothing angelical in their life, or evangelical in their doctrine.

   3. Heartily establish a holy government in the church. Order and
   discipline is the fence of religion, and a church well-governed is
   terrible as an army with banners,' Cant. vi. 4; that is, full of beauty
   and strength. Armies ordered are comely and in a capacity to fight. The
   present decays are by confusion. It is said, Ps. lxviii. 35, Thou art
   terrible out of thy holy places.' In the order and beauty of the
   church, God is most terrible. When worship is pure and regular, it
   impresseth a dread and a reverence upon men.

   4. Countenance godly persons. They are a kingdom's best security, Zech.
   xii. 5;' And the governors of Judah shall say in their hearts, The
   inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in the Lord of hosts, their
   God.' Mark, you should call them your strength; they engage a blessing.
   When Lot was in Sodom, Sodom was in lot. This is one of your chief
   duties, to see that godliness live peaceably. We are bound to pray for
   you upon this ground: Pray for them that are in authority, that we may
   lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty,' 1 Tim.
   ii. 4. Oh! look to it, then, that religion may have a quiet abode, or
   else you will not.

   5. Honour and sweeten religion by some release of the people's burdens.
   Belly arguments do work much upon them: Jer. xliv. 17, We will burn
   incense to the queen of heaven, for then we had plenty of victuals, and
   were well, and saw no evil.' They measure religion by their outward
   concernments, and judge of ways by their burdens and troubles. The
   oppression of some Protestant princes in Germany was a scandal to the
   Reformation. Nothing stirreth up vulgar hatred and introduceth violent
   changes so much as this. The people are like the reed of Egypt; if we
   lean too hard, they do not support, but pierce; and oppression is like
   an iron in the fire, it will burn their fingers that hold it. I confess
   this is somewhat out of my way, therefore I was the more loath to speak
   in it; but it being for religion's sake, I hope you will pardon a
   humble motion.

   I shall but hint two motives to set on all, and conclude.

   1. Is that in the 3d verse of this chapter: Lest I come as a thief.'
   Oh! consider Christ may steal upon you. When he taketh off his
   restraint from a people, and they break out into tumults, it is a
   shrewd sign. You know what faction was ruined by tumults; it is an
   unhappy presage.

   2. The next is taken from the 4th verse: Thou hast a few names that
   have not defiled their garments.' God taketh notice of those few names
   that are zealous for him in dead times, that mind the advancement of
   piety whilst others debase it; they shall walk with me in white.'
   Either God will provide an ark of safety for you for the present, or
   give you heaven, which shall make amends for all.

                          HOW MAY WE CURE DISTRACTIONS
                                IN HOLY DUTIES?

HOW MAY WE CURE DISTRACTIONS
IN HOLY DUTIES?

   Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, This people
   draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their
   lips; but their heart is far from me.--Mat. XV. 7, 8.

   IN this chapter you will find a contest between Christ and the
   Pharisees, about their traditions and old customs, which they valued
   above the commandments of God; as it is usual with formal men to love
   chains of their own making, and to make conscience of a tradition, when
   yet they can dispense with a commandment; and thereby discovering
   themselves to be very hypocrites, who are more in externals than in
   internals, in show than substance, minding the formality rather than
   the spirit and life of service to God. Our Lord confirms his censure by
   the testimony of the prophet Isaiah, Ye hypocrites,' &c.

   I shall not stand explaining the words. Drawing nigh is a phrase
   peculiar to worship, especially to invocation. Mouth and lips are put
   for all external gestures, and that bodily exercise which is necessary
   to the worship of God, especially for words. But their heart is far
   from me; it chiefly intendeth their habitual averseness from God, but
   may also comprise the wandering and roving of the mind in duty, which
   is a degree and spice of it: of that I shall treat at this time, and my
   note will be:--

   That distraction of thoughts, or the removing of the heart from God in
   worship, is a great sin, and degree of hypocrisy.

   The text speaketh of gross hypocrisy, or a zealous pretence of outward
   worship without any serious bent of heart towards God; but any removal
   of the heart from him in times necessary to think of him is a degree of
   it; for though distractions in worship are incident to the people of
   God, yet they are culpable, and do so far argue the relics of hypocrisy
   in them. I shall show:--

   1. The greatness of the sin.

   2. The causes.

   3. The remedies.

   First, That there is such a sin, sad experience witnesseth; vain
   thoughts intrude importunately upon the soul in every duty; in hearing
   the word we are not free (Ezek. xxxiii. 31), nor in singing; but
   chiefly they haunt us in prayer, and of all kinds of prayer, in mental
   prayer, when our addresses to God are managed by thoughts alone; there
   we are more easily disturbed. Words bound the thoughts, and the
   inconvenience of an interruption is more sensible, as occasioning a
   pause in our speech; and as in mental prayer, so when we join with
   others, to keep time and pace with the words, unless the Lord quicken
   them to an extraordinary liveliness, we find it very hard; but how
   great a sin this is, is my first task to show. I shall do it:--

   1. By three general considerations.

   2. By speaking particularly to the present case.

   First, Generally.

   1. Consider how tender God is of his worship: Lev. x. 3, he hath said
   that he will be sanctified in all that draw nigh unto him.' To sanctify
   is to set apart from common use. Now, God will be sanctified, that is,
   not treated with as an ordinary person, but with special needfulness of
   soul and affection, becoming so great a majesty; when you think to put
   him off with anything, you lessen his excellency and greatness, and do
   not sanctify him, or glorify him as God, and therefore God pleadeth his
   majesty when they would put a sorry sacrifice upon him, as if
   everything were good enough for him: Mal. i. 14, Cursed be the deceiver
   which hath in his flock a male, and voweth and sacrificeth to the Lord
   a corrupt thing: for I am a great king, saith the Lord of hosts.' To be
   slight in his service, argueth mean thoughts of God: Eccles. v. 2, Be
   not rash with thy mouth, nor hasty to utter anything before God, for
   God is in heaven, and thou upon earth.' We forget our distance, and by
   a bold profaneness are too fellow-like and familiar with God, when we
   are not deeply serious and exact in what we do and say in his presence,
   but only babble over a few impertinent words without attention and
   affection. Certainly, God is very sensible of the wrong and contempt we
   put upon him, for he noteth all: Heb. iv. 13, All things are naked and
   open to him with whom we have to do.' And he will not put it up, for he
   telleth us, Exod. xx. 7, that he will not hold him guiltless that
   taketh his name in vain;' and he will be as good as his word; for the
   least disorders in worship have been sorely punished; witness the
   stroke from heaven upon Aaron's sons, Lev. x. 2; the breach made upon
   Uzzah, 2 Sam. vi. 6; and the havoc made of the Bethshemites, 1 Sam. vi.
   19.; the diseases that raged at Corinth, 1 Cor. xi. 30. And though
   judgments be not so rife and visible now upon our unhallowed approaches
   to God, yet he smiteth us with deadness, where he doth not smite us
   with death; for a man is punished otherwise than a boy, and judgments
   are now spiritual, which in the infancy of the church were temporal and
   bodily. Certainly, we have all cause to tremble when we come before the
   Lord.

   2. The more sincere any one is, the more he maketh conscience of his
   thoughts, is more observant of them, and more troubled about them: Isa.
   lv. 7, Let the unrighteous man forsake his thoughts;' then he beginneth
   to be serious, and to have a conscience indeed, when his thoughts
   trouble him. So David: Ps. cxix. 113, I hate vain thoughts: but thy law
   do I love.' We think thoughts are free, and subject to no tribunal; if
   there be any error in them, we think it is a very venial one; they
   betray us to no shame in the world, and therefore we let them go
   without dislike and remorse. But a child of God cannot pass over the
   matter so: he knoweth that thoughts are the immediate births of the
   soul, and do much discover the temper of it; that there actions begin,
   and if vain thoughts be suffered to lodge in him, he will soon fall
   into further mischief, and therefore he considereth what he thinketh,
   as well as what he speaketh and doeth; and if at all times, especially
   in worship, where the workings of the inward man are of chief regard,
   and the acts of the outward only required, as a help to our serving God
   in the spirit,' Phil. iii. 3.

   3. Carelessness in duties is the high way to atheism; for every formal
   and slight prayer doth harden the heart, and make way for contempt of
   God; men that have made bold with God in duty, and it succeeds well
   with them, their awe of God is lessened, and the lively sense of his
   glory and majesty abated, till it be quite lost; by degrees they
   outgrow all feelings and tenderness of conscience; every time you come
   to God slightly, you lose ground by coming, till at length you look
   upon worship as a mere custom, or something done for fashion's sake.

   Secondly, Particularly:--1. It is an affront to God, and a kind of
   mockery. We wrong his omnisciency, as if he saw not the heart, and
   could not tell man his thought. It is God's essential glory in worship
   to be acknowledged an all-seeing spirit, and accordingly to be
   worshipped in spirit and in truth,' John iv. 24. Thoughts are as
   audible with him as words; therefore when you prattle words, and do not
   make conscience of thoughts, you do not worship him as a spirit. We
   wrong his majesty when we speak to him in prayer, and do not give heed
   to what we say. Surely we are not to prattle, like jays, or parrots,
   words without affection and feeling, or to chatter like cranes,' or be
   like Ephraim, whom the prophet calls a silly dove without an heart.' A
   mean man taketh it ill when you have business to talk with him about,
   and your minds are elsewhere; you would all judge it to be an affront
   to the majesty of God if a man should send his clothes stuffed with
   straw, or a puppet dressed up in stead of himself, into the assemblies
   of God's people, and think this should supply his personal presence;
   yet our clothes stuffed with straw, or an image dressed up instead of
   us, such as Michal put into David's bed, 1 Sam. xix. 12, 13, would be
   less offensive to God than our bodies without our souls; the absence of
   the spirit is the absence of the more noble part. We pretend to speak
   to God, and do not hear ourselves, nor can give any account of what we
   pray for; or rather let me give you Chrysostom's comparison: a man
   would have been thought to have profaned the mysteries of the Levitical
   worship, if instead of sweet incense he should have put into the censer
   sulphur or brimstone, or mingled the one with the other. [248] Surely
   our prayers should be set forth as incense,' Ps. cxli. 2. And do not we
   affront God to his face, that mingle so many vain, sinful, proud,
   filthy, blasphemous thoughts? What is this but to mingle sulphur with
   our incense? Again, when God speaketh to us, and knocks at the heart,
   and there is none within to hear him, is it not an affront to his
   majesty? Put it in a temporal case. If a great person should talk to
   us, and we should neglect him, and entertain ourselves with his
   servants, he would take it as a despite and contempt done to him. The
   great God of heaven and earth doth often call you together to speak to
   you; now if you think so slightly of his speeches as not to attend, but
   set your minds adrift to be carried hither and thither with every wave,
   where is that reverence you owe to him?

   It is a wrong to his goodness, and the comforts of his holy presence;
   for in effect you say that you do not find that sweetness in God which
   you expect, and therefore are weary of his company before your business
   be over with him. It is said of the Israelites, when they were going
   for Canaan, that in their hearts they turned back again into Egypt,'
   Acts vii. 39. They had more mind to be in Egypt than under Moses'
   government; and their thoughts ever ran upon the flesh-pots and
   belly-cheer they enjoyed there. We are offended with their impatience
   and murmurings, and the affronts they put upon their guides; and do not
   we even the same and worse in our careless manner of worshipping? When
   God hath brought us into his presence, we do in effect say, Give us the
   world again; this is better entertainment for our thoughts than God and
   holy things. If Christians would but interpret their actions, they
   would be ashamed of them; is anything more worthy to be thought of than
   God? The Israelites' hearts were upon Egypt in the wilderness, and our
   hearts are upon the world, nay, every toy, even when we are at the
   throne of grace, and conversing with him who is the centre of our rest,
   and the fountain of our blessedness.

   2. It grieveth the Spirit of God: he is grieved with our vain thoughts
   as well as our scandalous actions; other sins may shame us more, but
   these are a grief to the Spirit, because they are conceived in the
   heart, which is his presence-chamber, and place of special residence;
   and he is most grieved with these vain thoughts which haunt us in the
   time of our special addresses to God, because his peculiar operations
   are hindered, and the heart is set open to God's adversary in God's
   presence, and the world and Satan are suffered to interpose in the very
   time of the reign of grace, then when it shall be in solio, in its
   royalty, commanding all our faculties to serve it; this is to steal
   away the soul from under Christ's own arm, as a captain of a garrison
   is troubled, when the enemies come to prey under the very walls, in the
   face of all his forces and strength; so certainly it is a grief to the
   Spirit when our lusts have power to disturb us in holy duties, and the
   heart is taken up with unclean glances, and worldly thoughts, then when
   we present ourselves before the Lord. God looks upon his people's sins
   as aggravated because committed in his own house: Jer. xxiii. 11, In my
   house I have found their wickedness;' what is this but to dare God to
   his very face? Solomon saith, A king sitting upon his throne scattereth
   away evil with his eyes,' Prov. xx. 8. They are bold men that dare
   break the laws when a magistrate is upon the throne, and actually
   exercising judgment against offenders; so it argueth much impudence
   that when we come to deal with God, as sitting upon the throne, and
   observing and looking upon us, that we can yet lend our hearts to our
   lusts, and suffer every vain thought to divert us. There is more of
   modesty, though little of sincerity, in them that say to their lusts,
   as Abraham to his servants: Gen. xii. 5, Tarry here while I go yonder
   and worship;' or, as they say, the serpent layeth aside her poison when
   she goeth to drink. When a man goeth to God he should leave his lusts
   behind him, not for a while, and with an intent to entertain them
   again, but for ever. However this argueth some reverence to God, and
   sense of the weight of holy duties; but when we bring them along with
   us, it is a sign we little mind the work we go about.

   3. It is a spiritual disease. The soul hath its diseases as well as the
   body; the unsteady roving of the mind, or the disturbance of vain and
   impertinent thoughts, is one of those diseases,--shall I call it a
   spiritual madness, or fever, or shaking palsy, or all these? You know
   madmen make several relations, and rove from one thing to another, and
   are gone off from a sentence ere they have well begun it; our thoughts
   are as slippery and inconsistent as their speeches, therefore what is
   this but the frenzy of the soul? What mad creatures would we seem to
   be, if all our thoughts were patent, or an invisible notary were
   lurking in our hearts to write them down! We run from object to object
   in a moment, and one thought looks like a mere stranger upon another;
   we wander and run through all the world in an instant. Oh, who can
   count the numberless operations and working of our mind in one duty!
   What impertinent excursions have we from things good to lawful; from
   lawful to sinful, from ordinarily sinful to downright blasphemous!
   Should any one of us, after he hath been some time exercised in duty,
   go aside and write down his thoughts, and the many interlinings of his
   own prayers, he would stand amazed at the madness and light discurrency
   of his own imaginations.

   Or shall I call it the feverish distemper of their soul? Ægri somnia is
   a proverb; in fevers men have a thousand fancies and swimming toys in
   their dreams, and just so it is with our souls in God's worship. We
   bring that curse upon us spiritually, which corporally God threatened
   to bring upon the Jews: I will scatter you to the end of the earth.' We
   scatter our thoughts hither and thither without any consistency; the
   heart, in regard of this roving madness, is like a runagate servant,
   who, when he hath left his master, wandereth up and down, and knoweth
   not where to fix; or like those that are full of distracting business,
   that cannot make a set meal, but take their diet by snatches.

   4. It argueth the loss and non-acceptance of our prayers. You are in
   danger to lose your worship, at least so much of it as you do not
   attend upon; and truly to a man that knows the value of that kind of
   traffic, this is a very great loss. You that are tradesmen are troubled
   if you happen to be abroad when a good customer cometh to deal with
   you; the ordinances of God are the market for your souls; if you had
   not been abroad with Esau, you might have received the blessing, and
   gone away richly laden from a prayer, from the word, and the Lord's
   Supper; but you lose your advantages for want of attention; allowed
   distractions turn your prayers into sin, and make them no prayers. When
   the soul departeth from the body it is no longer a man, but a carcase;
   so when the thoughts are gone from prayer, it is no longer a prayer,
   the essence of the duty is wanting. What is prayer? Ana'basis tou nou,
   as Damascene defined it, the lifting up of the heart to God. Many have
   prayed without words, but never any prayed without lifting up, or
   pouring out the heart. If a man should kneel, and use a gesture of
   worship, and fall asleep, no doubt that man doth not pray. This is to
   sleep with the heart, and the words uttered are but like a dream, have
   but a slight touch of reason in them, a mere drowsy inattentive
   devotion; the soul is asleep though the eyes be not closed, and the
   senses locked up. Can we expect that God should hear us, and bless us,
   because of our mere outward presence? We are ashamed of those that
   sleep at a duty, and this is as bad or worse; they may sleep out of
   natural infirmity, as weakness, age, sickness, &c., but this doth more
   directly proceed from some slightness or irreverence. Well, then, with
   what face can we expect the fruit of that prayer to which we have not
   attended? It is a great presumption to desire God to hear those
   requests, a great part whereof we have not heard ourselves; if they be
   not worthy of our attention they are far more unworthy of God's.
   Cyprian, [249] or Ruffinus, or whoever was the author of the
   explication of the Lord's Prayer in Cyprian's works, hath a notable
   passage to this purpose: Quomodo te a Deo exaudiri postulas, cum te
   ipse non audias? Vis Deum esse memorem tui cum rogas, cum ipse tui
   memor non sis? Thou art unmindful of thyself; thou dost not hear thy
   self; and how canst thou with reason desire the blessing and comfort of
   the duty which thou thoughtest not worthy thine own attention and
   regard?

   I would not willingly grate too hard upon a tender conscience. It is a
   question that is often propounded, whether wandering thoughts do
   altogether frustrate a duty, and make it of none effect? and whether,
   in some cases, a virtual attention doth not suffice? There is an actual
   intension, and a virtual intension. The actual intension is when a soul
   doth distinctly and constantly regard everything that is said and done
   in a duty; and a virtual intension is when we keep only a disposition
   and purpose to attend, though many times we fail and are carried aside.
   This Aquinas calleth priorem intensionem; out of the Scripture we may
   call it, the setting of the heart to seek the Lord,' 1 Chron. xxii. 19.
   Now, what shall we say in this case? On the one side, we must not be
   too strict, lest we prejudice the comfort and expectation of God's
   people. When did they ever manage a duty, but they are guilty of some
   wanderings? It is much to keep up our hearts to the main and solid
   requests that are made to God in prayer. But, on the other side, we
   must not be too remiss, lest we encourage indiligence and careless
   devotion. Briefly, then, by way of answer, there is a threefold
   distraction in prayer--distractio invita, negligens, et voluntaria.

   1. There is distractio invita, an unwilling distraction, when the heart
   is seriously and solemnly set to seek God, and yet we are carried
   besides our purpose; for it is impossible so to shut doors and win dows
   but that some wind will get in--so to guard the heart as to be wholly
   free from vain thoughts; but they are not constant, frequent, allowed,
   but resisted, prayed against, striven against, bewailed; and then they
   are not iniquities, but infirmities, which the Lord will pardon; he
   will gather up the broken part of our prayers, and in mercy give us an
   answer; I say, where this distraction is retracted with grief, resisted
   with care, as Abraham drove away the fowls when they came to pitch upon
   his sacrifice, Gen. xv. 11, it is to be reckoned among the infirmities
   of the saints, which do not hinder their consolation.

   2. There is distractio negligens, a negligent distraction, when a man
   hath an intention to pray, and express his desires to God; but he prays
   carelessly, and doth not guard his thoughts, so that some times he
   wanders, and sometimes recovers himself again, and then strays again,
   and is in and out, off and on with God, as a spaniel roveth up and
   down, and is still crossing the ways, sometimes losing the company he
   goes with, and then retiring to them again. I cannot say, this man
   prayeth not at all, or that God doth not hear him, but he will have
   little comfort in his prayers; yea, if he be serious, they will
   minister more matter of grief to him than comfort; and therefore he
   ought to be more earnest and sedulous in resisting this infirmity, that
   he may be assured of audience; otherwise, if his heart be not affected
   with it in time, by degrees all those motions and dispositions of heart
   that are necessary to prayer will be eaten out and lost.

   3. There is distractio voluntaria, a voluntary distraction, when men
   mind no more than the task or work wrought, and only go round in a
   track of accustomed duties, without considering with what heart they
   perform them: this is such a vanity of mind as turneth the whole prayer
   into sin.

   Secondly, The causes of this roving and impertinent intrusion of vain
   thoughts.

   1. Satan is one cause, who doth maxime insidiari orationibus (as
   Cassian speaketh), lie in wait to hinder the prayers of the saints;
   whenever we minister before the Lord, he is at our right hand ready to
   resist us, Zech. iii. 1. And therefore the apostle James, when he
   biddeth us draw nigh to God,' biddeth us also to resist the devil,'
   James iv. 7, 8; implying thereby that there is no drawing nigh to God
   without resisting Satan. When a tale is told, and you are going about
   the affairs of the world, he doth not trouble you; for these things do
   not trouble him, or do any prejudice to his kingdom; but when you are
   going to God, and that in a warm, lively, affectionate manner, he will
   be sure to disturb you, seeking to abate the edge of your affections,
   or divert your minds. Formal prayers pattered over, Jo him no harm; but
   when you seriously set yourselves to call upon God, he saith within
   himself, This man will pray for God's glory, and then I am at a loss;
   for the coming of Christ's kingdom, and then mine goeth to wreck; that
   God's will may be done upon earth as it is in heaven, and that minds me
   of my old fall, and my business is to cross the will of God; he will
   pray for daily bread, and that strengthened dependence; for pardon and
   comfort, and then I lose ground (for the devils are the rulers of the
   darkness of this world,' Eph. vi. 12); he will pray to be kept from sin
   and temptation, and that is against me. Thus Satan is afraid of the
   prayers of the saints; he is concerned in every request you make to
   God; and therefore he will hinder or cheat you of your prayers; if you
   will needs be praying, he will carry away your hearts. Now, much he can
   do if you be not watchful; he can present objects to the senses which
   stir up thoughts, yea, pursue his temptations, and cast in one fiery
   dart after another, therefore we had need stand upon our guard.

   2. The natural levity of our spirits. Man is a restless creature. We
   have much ado to stay our hearts for any space of time in one state,
   much more in holy things, from which we are naturally averse: Rom. vii.
   21, When I would do good, evil is present with me.' to` kako`n
   para'keitai. Oh! consider this natural feebleness of mind, whereby we
   are unable to keep long to any employment, but are light, feathery,
   tossed up and down like a dried leaf before the wind, or as an empty
   vessel upon the waves. It is so with us in most businesses, especially
   in those which are sacred. The apostle biddeth us pray without
   ceasing,' and we cannot do it whilst we pray; he is a stranger to God
   and his own heart who finds it not daily. This is an incurable vanity;
   though we often repent of it, yet it is not amended; a misery that God
   would leave upon our natures, to humble us while we are in the world,
   and that we may long for heaven; the angels and blessed spirits there
   are not troubled with those things; in heaven there is no complaining
   of wandering thoughts--there God is all in all; they that are there
   have but one object to fill their understandings, one object to give
   contentment to their desires, their hearts cleave to God inseparably by
   a perfect love; but here we are cumbered with much serving, and much
   work begets a multitude of thoughts in us: Ps. xciv. 11, The Lord knows
   the thoughts of man, that they are but vanity.' When we have summed up
   all the traverses, reasonings, and discourses of the mind, we may write
   at the bottom this, as the total sum--Here is nothing but vanity.

   3. Another cause is practical atheism. We have little sense of things
   that are unseen, and lie within the veil, in the world of spirits;
   things that are seen have a great force upon us. Offer it now to thy
   governor,' saith the prophet, Mal. i. 8. God is afar off, both from our
   sight and apprehension; senses bind attention. If you speak to a man,
   your thoughts are settled, and you think of nothing else; but in
   speaking to God, you have not like attention, because you see him not:
   Exod. xxxii. 1, Make us gods to go before us.' Ay! we would have a
   visible god, whom we may see and hear; but the true God being a spirit,
   and an invisible power, all the service that we do him is a task
   performed more out of custom than affection, in a slight, perfunctory
   way.

   1. Strong and unmortified lusts, which being rooted in us, and having
   the soul at most command, will trouble us, and distract us when we go
   about any duty. Each man hath a mind, and can spend it unweariedly as
   he is inclined, either to covetousness, ambition, or sensuality; for
   where the treasure is, there will the heart be,' Mat. vi. 20. Set but
   the covetous man about the world, the voluptuous man about his
   pleasures, and the ambitious man about his honours and preferments, and
   will they suffer their thoughts to be taken off? surely no; but set
   either of these about holy things, and presently these lusts will be
   interposing: Ezek. xxxiii. 31, Their heart goeth after their
   covetousness.' The sins to which a man is most addicted will engross
   the thought; so that this is one sign by which a man may know his
   reigning sin, that which interrupts him most in holy duties; for when
   all other lusts are kept out, Satan will be sure to set the darling sin
   a-work to plead for him. If a man be addicted to the world, so will his
   musings be; if to mirth, and good cheer, and vain sports, his thoughts
   will be taken up about them; if to the inordinate love of women, his
   fancy will be rolling upon carnal beauty, and he will be firing his
   heart with unclean thoughts.

   5. Want of love to God and holy things. Men are loath to come into
   God's presence for want of faith, and to keep there for want of love;
   love fixeth the thoughts, and drieth up those swimming toys and fancies
   that do distract us; we ponder and muse upon that in which we delight.
   Were our natural hatred of God and of the means of grace changed into a
   perfect love, we should adhere to him without distraction. We see where
   men love strongly, they are deaf and blind to all other objects--they
   can think and speak of no other thing; but because our love to God is
   weak, every vain occasion carrieth away our minds from him. You find
   this by daily experience; when your affections flag in an ordinance,
   your thoughts are soon scattered, weariness maketh way for wandering,
   your hearts are first gone, and then your minds. You complain you have
   not a settled mind; the fault is, you have not a settled love, for that
   would cause you to pause upon things without weariness: Ps. i. 2, His
   delight is in the law of the Lord, and in that law doth he meditate day
   and night;' Ps. cxix. 97, O how I love thy law, it is my meditation all
   the day.' David's mind would never run upon the word so much if his
   heart were not there. Thoughts are at the command and beck of love;
   where love biddeth them go, they go; and where love biddeth them tarry,
   they tarry: the saints first delight, and then meditate.

   6. Slightness and irreverence, or want of a sense of God's presence. A
   careless spirit will surely wander; but one deeply affected is fixed
   and intent. Jonah, when he prayed in the whale s belly, could he have
   an heart to forget his work? Daniel, when he prayed among the lions,
   could he mind anything else? When we are serious and pray in good
   earnest, we will call in all our thoughts, and hold them under command.
   This question was put to Basil, how a man should keep the mind free
   from distraction? His answer was--gi'gnetai o meteo'rismos apo` tes
   argi'as tou nou, kai` ex apisti'as me` pareinai to`n Theo`n exeta'zonta
   kardi'as kai` ne'phrous. [250] That is, that this evil came from
   slightness of heart, and unbelief of God's presence; for if a man did
   believe that God were before his eyes, searching the heart, and trying
   the reins, he would be serious: All things are naked and open to him
   with whom we have to do;' God looketh on, and so do the angels; he
   looketh on the heart, and will not you be serious? Scholars that have a
   truant mind, yet the presence of their masters forceth them to their
   books; the great God who telleth man his thought, he seeth our desires;
   and thoughts speak louder in his ears than our words; therefore possess
   the heart with a dread of his glorious presence, and with the weight
   and importance of the works we are about: were we to deal with man in a
   case of life and death, we would weigh our words and not rove like
   madmen.

   7. The curiosity of the senses, these occasion a diversion. It is the
   office of the fancy to present, as in a glass, whatsoever is received
   by the external senses, or offered by the memory, and so the
   understanding taketh notice of it; the wandering eye causeth a
   wandering heart. Solomon saith, Prov. xvii. 24, The fool's eyes are to
   the ends of the earth;' first, his eyes rove, and then his heart. The
   apostle Peter saith of unclean persons, that they have eyes full of
   adultery,' 2 Pet. ii. 14, moichali'dos, of the adulteress (as the word
   signifieth); the eye is rolled upon the object, and then the dart is by
   the fancy transmitted to the heart. Senses are the windows and doors of
   the soul; keep the senses if you would keep the heart. Job was at a
   severe appointment with his eyes, Job xxxi. 1. It is good when we go to
   God to renew these covenants, to agree with the heart that we will not
   go to God without it; with the eyes and ears, that we will not see and
   hear anything but what concerns our work. It was a strange consistency
   and fixedness which Josephus speaketh of, [251] when Faustus,
   Cornelius, and Furius, and Fabius with their troops had broken into the
   city of Jerusalem, and some fled one way and some another, yet the
   priests went on with their sacrifices and the holy rites of the temple,
   as if they heard nothing; though they rushed on them with their swords,
   yet they preferred the duty of their religion, before their own safety;
   and strange is that other instance of the Spartan youth in Plutarch,
   that held the censer to Alexander whilst he was sacrificing, and though
   a coal lighted upon his flesh, he suffered it to burn there, rather
   than by any crying out he would disturb the rites of their heathenish
   superstition. Certainly these instances should shame us Christians,
   that do not hold the senses under a more severe restraint, but upon
   every light occasion suffer them to trouble and distract us in worship.

   8. Carking and distrustful cares. When we are torn in pieces with the
   cares of the world, we cannot have a composed heart, but our minds will
   waver, and our dangers will recur to our thoughts, and hinder the
   exercise of our faith. God took special care of the Jews, when they
   went up to worship, that they might have nothing to trouble them; and
   therefore he saith, Exod. xxxiv. 24, None of the nations shall desire
   the land when thou shalt go up to appear before the Lord thy God thrice
   in the year; and Augustine [252] gives the reason of it, lest they
   should be distracted with thoughts about their own preservation--Vult
   Deus intelligi ut securus quisque ascender et, nec de terrâ suâ
   sollicitus esset, Deo promittente custodiam: and one of the arguments
   by which Paul commendeth single life is freedom from the incumbrances
   of the world: That we may serve the Lord without distraction,' 1 Cor.
   vii. 35.

   Thirdly, Remedies. I might speak many things by way of mere counsel
   about guarding the senses, the use and abuse of a form, &c.; but all
   these are but like external applications in physic, or topical
   medicines, as the binding of things to the wrists of the hands, &c.,
   which work no perfect cure of a disease, unless the distemper be purged
   away; therefore I shall speak to those things that are most effectual.

   1. Go to God and wait for the power of his grace. David speaketh of it
   as his work: Ps. lxxxvi. 11, Unite my heart to the fear of thy name,'
   fix it, gather it together, enoson te`n ka'rdi'an mou (saith the
   Septuagint [253] ), make it one. The heart is multiplied when it is
   distracted by several thoughts. God hath our hearts in his own hand,
   and when we can keep them up no longer, then he holds them up; when he
   withdraws his grace, we lose our life and seriousness; as meteors hang
   in the air as long as the heat of the sun is great, but when the sun is
   gone down they fall; as long as the love of God and the work of his
   grace are powerful in us, we are kept in a lively heavenly frame; but
   as that abateth, the soul swerveth and returneth to vanity and sin. We
   read, Acts xvi. 14, 15, that The Lord opened the heart of Lydia, so
   that she attended to the things that were spoken of Paul.' Attention
   there beareth somewhat a larger sense than we now consider it in,
   namely, a deep regard to the doctrine of life; yet this sense of
   fixedness of spirit cannot be excluded. Go to God, then, pray him to
   keep thy heart together; he that hath set bounds to the sea, and can
   bind up the waves in a heap, and stop the sun in its flight, certainly
   he can fasten and establish thy heart, and keep it from running out.

   2. Meditate on the greatness of him before whom we are. It is of great
   consequence in duties to consider whom we take to be our party with
   whom we have to do, Heb. iv. 13. In the word, God is the party that
   speaketh to us: Thou shalt be as my mouth,' Jer. xv. 16; As if God
   spake by us,' 2 Cor. v. 20. It is God speaketh; and the heathen king of
   Moab showeth such reverence, that when Ehud said, I have a message to
   thee from God,' he arose out of his seat, Judges iii. 20. So in prayer
   you have to do with God; you do as really minister before him as the
   angels that abide in his presence. Oh, if you could see him that is
   invisible, you would have more reverence. A man that is praying or
   worshipping should behave himself as if he were in heaven immediately
   before God, in the midst of all the blessed angels, those ten thousand
   times ten thousand that stand before God. [254] Oh, with what
   reverence, with what fear, should a poor worm creep into his presence!
   Think then of that glorious all-seeing God, with, whom thou canst
   converse in thoughts as freely as with men in words; he knoweth all
   that is in thy heart, and seeth thee through and through. If you had
   spoken all those things you have thoughts upon, you would be odious to
   men; if all the blasphemy, uncleanness, worldly projects, were known to
   those that join with us, should we be able to hold up our heads for
   blushing? And doth not the Lord see all this? Could we believe his
   inspection of the heart, there would be a greater awe upon us.

   3. Mortify those lusts that are apt to withdraw our minds. He that
   indulgeth any one vile affection will never be able to pray aright.
   Every duty will give you experience what corruption to resist, what
   thoughts we are haunted and pestered with, when we come to God. God
   requireth prayer, that we may be weary of our lusts, and that the
   trouble that we find from them in holy exercises may exasperate our
   souls against them. We are angry with an importunate beggar that will
   not be satisfied with any reasonable terms, but is always obtruding
   upon us. Every experience in this kind should give us an advantage to
   free our hearts from this disturbance. The whole work of grace tendeth
   to prayer; and the great exercise and employment of the spiritual life
   is watching unto prayer, Eph. vi. 18; and that prayer be not
   interrupted, 1 Peter iii. 2.

   4. Before the duty there must be an actual preparation, or a solemn,
   discharge of all impediments, that we may not bring the world along
   with us. Put off thy shoes off thy feet,' saith God to Moses, for the
   place whereon thou standest is holy ground.' Surely we should put off
   our carnal distractions when we go about holy duties. Gird up the loins
   of your minds,' saith the apostle Peter, 1 Peter i. 13, an allusion to
   long garments worn in that country: it is dangerous to come to prayer
   with a loose heart. My heart is fixed saith David, O God, my heart is
   fixed,' Ps. lvii. 7; that is, fitted, prepared, bended to God's
   worship: the soul must be set, put into a dexterous ready posture.
   Claudatur contra adversarium pectus, et soli Deo pateat, ne ad se
   hostem Dei accedere tempore orationis patiatur.--(Cyp. lib. De Oratione
   Domini.) There must be a resolved shutting of the heart against God's
   enemy, lest he insinuate with us, and withdraw our minds.

   5. Be severe to your purpose, and see that you regard nothing but what
   the duty leadeth you unto. It is the devil's policy to cheat us of the
   present duty by an unseasonable interposition. Satan beginneth with us
   in good things, that he may draw us to worse. What is unseasonable is
   naught; watch against the first diversion, how plausible soever; it is
   an intruding thought that breaketh a rank. In this case say as the
   spouse, Cant, iii., I charge you that you awake not my beloved till he
   please;' such a rigid severity should you use against the starting of
   the heart. If Satan should at first cast in a thought of blasphemy,
   that would make thee quake and shake; therefore he beginneth with
   plausible thoughts; but be careful to observe the first stragglings;
   yea, be not diverted by thy very strivings against diversions, and
   therefore do not dispute with suggestions, but despise them; nor stand
   examining temptations, but reject them, [255] as blind Bartimeus
   regarded not the rebukes of the people, but cried the more after
   Christ; or as travellers do not stand beating back the dogs that bark
   at them, but hold on their course; this is to be religiously obstinate
   and severe to our purpose. Satan contemned, hath the less advantage
   against you; when he is writing images upon the fancy, do not vouchsafe
   to look upon them. A crier in the court that is often commanding
   silence, disturbeth the court more than they that make the noise; so
   disputing with our distractions, increaseth them. They better are
   avoided by a severe contempt.

   6. Bring with you to every holy service strong spiritual affections;
   our thoughts would not be at such a distance from our work if our
   affections were more ready and more earnestly set. It is the unwilling
   servant that is loath to stay long at his work, but is soon gone; could
   we bring ourselves more delightfully to converse with God, our hearts
   would hold our minds close, and we would not straggle so often as we
   do; therefore see you do this, or you do nothing. I was glad,' saith
   David, when they said unto me, Come let us go into the house of the
   Lord,' Ps. cxxii. 1. Were we of this frame of spirit, many directions
   would not need. Now what should hinder us from, being thus affected?
   Are not the ordinances of God the special means of our communion with
   him? and the throne of grace the very porch of heaven? Can we be better
   than in God's company, pleading with him for our soul's good, and
   waiting for his blessing? Therefore let us be glad, and rejoice in his.
   presence, and you will not easily find such outstrayings of mind and
   thought.

   7. Remember the weight and consequence of the duties of religion, that
   is a cure for slightness; you are dealing with God in a case of life
   and death, and will you not be serious? With what diligence and
   earnestness doth an advocate plead with a man in a case wherein he
   himself is not concerned, either for the life of another, or the
   inheritance or goods of another! [256] And wilt not thou plead
   earnestly with God when thy soul is in danger, when it is a case of
   eternal life and death, as all matters that pass between God and us
   are? Certainly, if we did consider the weight of the business, the
   heart would be freed from this garish wantonness. If Christ had taken
   thee aside into the garden, as he took Peter, James, and John, and thou
   hadst seen him praying and trembling under his agonies, thou wouldst
   have seen that it is no light matter to go to God in a case of the
   salvation of souls, though thou hast never so much assurance of the
   issue, for so Christ had: the frequent return of Christian duties
   maketh us to forget the consequence of them. In hearing the word, be
   serious, it is your life: Deut. xxxii. 46, Hearken unto the words of
   the law, for this is not a vain thing, because it is your life;' thy
   everlasting estate is upon trial, and the things that are spoken
   concern your souls; every act of communion with God, every
   participation of his grace, hath an influence upon eternity. Say,
   therefore, as Nehemiah in another case, Neh. vi. 3, I am doing a great
   work, I cannot come down.' Can you have an heart to mind other things,
   when you are about so great a work as the saving of your souls?

   8. Let every experimental wandering make you more humble and careful.
   If men did lay their wanderings to heart, and retract them, even every
   glance with a sigh, the mind would not so boldly, so constantly digress
   and step aside; all actions displeasing are not done so readily;
   therefore it is good to bewail these distractions. Do not count them as
   light things. Cassianus, speaking of these wandering thoughts, saith,
   The most that come to worship, being involved in greater sins, scarce
   count distraction of thoughts an evil, and so the mischief is increased
   upon them. [257] It is a sad thing to be given up to a vain mind, and
   such a frothy spirit as cannot be serious; therefore if we do soundly
   humble ourselves for these offences, and they did once become our
   burden, they would not be our practice. One saith, [258] that huntsmen
   observe of young dogs, that if a fresh game come in view, they leave
   their old scent, but if soundly beaten off from it, they kindly take to
   their first pursuit; the application is easy,--did we rate our hearts
   for this vanity, and pray against the sins of our prayers with deep
   remorse, this evil would not be so familiar with us.

   9. A constant heavenliness and holiness of heart. If men were as they
   should be, holy, en pase anastrophe--1 Peter i. 14, In all manner of
   conversation,' in solemn duties, good and proper thoughts would be more
   natural and kindly to us. They that live in a constant communion with
   God do not find it such a tedious business to converse with him; if
   they have any excursion of thoughts, it is in their daily work, and the
   offices of the common life, which they are ever seasoning with some
   gracious meditations and short ejaculations; when they are in duty,
   they are where they would be; constant gravity and seriousness is a
   great help to them. Men allow themselves a lawless liberty in their
   ordinary conversations, and then in prayer they know not how to gather
   up their hearts. Such as men are out of prayer, such they will be in
   prayer; we cannot expect that pangs of devotion should come upon us all
   of a sudden, and that when we come reeking into the world, we should
   presently leap into a heavenly frame.

   10. The next remedy is frequent solemn meditation. If the understanding
   were oftener taken up with the things of God, and our thoughts were
   kept in more frequent exercise, they would the better come to hand.
   There is a double advantage comes to us by meditation:--

   1. The soul gets more abundance of heart-warming knowledge, and
   therefore will not be so barren and dry, which certainly is a cause of
   wandering: Ps. xlv. 1, My heart inditeth a good matter, and then my
   tongue is as the pen of a ready writer.' A man that boileth and
   concocts truths in his heart, hath a great readiness of words and
   affections. There is a good treasure within him, Mat. xii. 35, out of
   which he may spend freely. One expresseth it thus: [259] He that hath
   store of gold and silver in his pocket, and but a few brass farthings,
   will more readily, upon every draught, come out with gold and silver
   than brass farthings; so he that hath stocked his heart with holy
   thoughts will not find carnal musings so rife and frequent.'

   2. By use a man gets a greater command over himself. When we constantly
   leave the thoughts at random, and never lay restraints upon them, it is
   in vain to think we shall keep them in order when we please. Fierce
   creatures are tame to those that use to command them; every art is
   difficult at first, as writing, singing, playing upon an instrument;
   but we get a facility by use and exercise; yea, not only a facility,
   but a delight in them; and those things that at first we thought
   impossible, by a little practice grow easy. Certainly, the way of the
   Lord is strength to the upright,' Prov. xi. 29, and the more we set
   ourselves to any good thing, the more readily and prepared are we for
   it.

                          HOW OUGHT WE TO IMPROVE OUR
                                    BAPTISM?

HOW OUGHT WE TO IMPROVE OUR BAPTISM?

   Be baptized every one of you m the name of Jesus Christ, for the
   remission of sins.--Acts II. 38.

   THIS chapter gives us an account of the pouring out of the Spirit,
   according to promise, presently after Christ's ascension. As soon as
   the Spirit was poured out, the apostles were enabled to speak in
   various languages, to the astonishment and wonder of the hearers. This
   was for the glory of God, the confirmation of the gospel, and to
   authorise them as special messengers sent by Christ.

   At the sight of this miracle some wonder, others mock, as if this
   speaking with divers tongues had been a confused jabbering that
   proceeded from the fumes of wine, rather than the gift and operation of
   the Holy Spirit.

   To satisfy both, Peter declares in a sermon the effect and intent of
   the miracle, proving Jesus, whom they had crucified, to be Lord and
   Christ. When they heard this, many of the most obstinate among them
   were pricked at the heart,' and relented A happy sermon it was that
   Peter preached, it brought in thousands of souls to Christ; the first
   handsel of the power of the Spirit and success of the gospel.

   It is good to observe what course they took for ease and relief after
   this piercing and brokenness of heart; they said to Peter, and the rest
   of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?' This is the usual
   question of men under a sound and thorough conviction.

   To their serious question Peter makes a seasonable answer, ver. 38. It
   is the part of a good physician not only to discover the disease, but
   also to prescribe a remedy; especially should spiritual physicians be
   tender of broken-hearted sinners, and willing and ready to give them
   counsel.

   In Peter's direction and counsel to them, observe--(1.) What he
   persuades them to do. (2.) By what motive and argument; what they
   should do, and what they should receive.

   In the advice, he persuades them to repentance, and to be baptized in
   the name of Christ. The latter we are upon.

   For explaining it, we may inquire:--

   Quest. 1. Why is baptism mentioned, rather than faith and other things
   more internal and necessary to salvation?

   I answer--(1.) Certainly faith is implied; for, Mark xvi. 16, He that
   believeth and is baptized shall be saved.' Baptism is an open and real
   profession of Christ crucified; so that, Be baptized in the name of
   Jesus Christ' is as much as be Baptized, believing on the name of the
   Lord Jesus, for the remission of sins,' (2.) Baptism is mentioned
   because it was the visible rite of receiving proselytes to Christ. Now,
   it imported them who were convinced as persecutors to turn professors,
   if they would have ease for their consciences; and therefore not only
   to believe with the heart, but to make open profession of faith in
   Christ, Rom. x. 10.

   Quest. 2. Why in the name of Christ only? The Father and the Holy Ghost
   are not mentioned, according to the prescript form, Mat. xxviii. 19. I
   answer--He speaks not of the form of baptism, but the use and end
   thereof. Now, the great use of baptism is that we may have benefit by
   the mystery of redemption by Christ; therefore, else where we are said
   to be baptized into Jesus Christ.' Rom. vi. 3; and to put on Christ,'
   Gal. iii. 27. He is the head of the church, and by baptism we are
   planted into his mystical body.

   This being premised, my work shall be to show what use and respect
   baptism has unto this benefit of obtaining remission of sins by Jesus
   Christ. I shall do it in these considerations:--

   1. That God hath ever delighted to deal with his creatures in the way
   of a covenant, that we might know what to expect from him, and might
   look upon ourselves as under the firmer bonds of obedience to his
   blessed majesty. In a covenant, which is the most solemn transaction
   between man and man, both parties are engaged--God to us, and we to
   God. It is not meet that one party should be bound and the other free;
   therefore both are bound to each other, God to bless and we to obey.
   Indeed, in the first covenant, the debitum poenae is only mentioned,
   because that only took place: Gen. ii. 17, In the day that thou eatest
   thereof, thou shalt surely die.' But the other part is implied, and it
   doth in effect speak thus much, Do and live, sin and die.'

   2. Because the first covenant was broken on our part, God was pleased
   to enter into a second, wherein he would manifest the glory of his
   redeeming grace and pardoning mercy to fallen man; this was brought
   about in Christ: 2 Cor. v. 19, God was in Christ reconciling the world
   to himself;' and therefore this second covenant is called a covenant of
   peace,' as being made with us after the breach, and when man was
   obnoxious to the wrath of God: Isa. liv. 10, The covenant of my peace
   shall not be removed,' Man needeth such a covenant, and God, appeased
   by Christ, offereth it to us.

   3. In this covenant of peace, the privileges and duties are suited to
   the state in which man was when God invited him into covenant with
   himself. Man was fallen from his duty, and obnoxious to the wrath and
   displeasure of God; and therefore the new covenant is a doctrine of
   repentance and remission of sins. What is preach the gospel to every
   creature,' Mark xvi. 16, is in Luke xxiv. 47, that repentance and
   remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations;' for
   that is the gospel, or the new remedial law of our Lord Jesus:
   repentance to heal us and set us in joint again as to our duty;
   remission of sins; to recover us into God's favour. Both these benefits
   we have by the Redeemer: Acts v. 31, Him hath God exalted to give
   repentance and remission of sins to Israel;' he giveth the one simply,
   and both giveth and requireth the other; so that, by the new covenant,
   remission of sins is conveyed to all true penitents.

   4. More distinctly to understand the tenor of this new and second
   covenant, we must consider both the duties and the privileges thereof;
   for in every covenant there is ratio dati et accepti--there is some
   thing promised and given, and something required; and usually the
   promise consists of somewhat which the party is willing of, and the
   duty or condition required of that to which he is more backward and
   loath to submit. So in the covenant of grace, in the promise God
   respects man's want, in the duty his own honour. Every man would have
   pardon and be saved from hell, but God will have subjection; even
   corrupt nature is not against desires of happiness; these God makes use
   of to gain us to holiness. All men readily catch at felicity, and would
   have impunity, peace, comfort, glory, but are unwilling to deny the
   flesh, to renounce the credit, profit, or pleasure of sin, or to grow
   dead to the world and worldly things. Now God promiseth what we desire,
   on condition that we will submit to those things that we are against:
   as we sweeten bitter pills to children, that they may swallow them the
   better; they love the sugar though they loathe the aloes. So doth God
   invite us to our duty by our interest. Therefore whosoever would enter
   into the gospel-state must resolve to take the blessings and benefits
   offered for his happiness, and the duties required for his work.
   Indeed, accepting of the benefits is a part of the condition, because
   we treat with an invisible God about a happiness that lieth in another
   world; but it is but part, there are other terms, and therefore we must
   draw nigh with a true heart, in full assurance of faith,' Heb. x. 22.
   With a true heart, resolving upon the duties of the covenant, in full
   assurance of faith, depending upon God's word that he will give us the
   blessings.

   5. The privileges are two--pardon and life. These are the great
   blessings offered in the new covenant; you have them both together,
   Acts xxvi. 18, To turn them from darkness to light, and from the power
   of Satan unto God; that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and in
   heritance among them that are sanctified by faith.' These two benefits
   are most necessary, the one to allay the fears of the guilty creature,
   and the other to gratify desires of happiness, which are natural to us;
   the one to remedy the misery incurred by sin and the fall of man, the
   other to establish our true and proper felicity in the everlasting
   enjoyment of God; the one to ease our consciences, and support us
   against troubles of mind, the other to comfort us against the outward
   troubles and afflictions which sin hath introduced into the world. In
   short, the one to free us from deserved punishment, the other to assure
   us of undeserved blessedness; the one importeth deliverance from
   eternal death, and the other entrance into eternal life.

   6. The duties thereof do either concern our first entrance into the
   Christian state, or our progress therein. Our Lord represented it under
   the notions of the gate,' and the way,' Mat. vii. 14, Strait is the
   gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life.' Other scriptures
   deliver it under the notions of making covenant, and keeping covenant
   with God: making covenant, Ps. l. 5; keeping covenant, Ps. xxv. 10, Ps.
   ciii. 18. The covenant must not only be made, but kept.

   [1.] As to entering into covenant with God, there is required true
   repentance and faith: Mark i. 15, Eepent, and believe the gospel,'
   Repentance respects God as our end; faith respects Christ as the great
   means or way to the Father: Acts xx. 21, Repentance towards God, and
   faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.' God is our end, for Christ died to
   bring us to God,' 1 Peter iii. 18; and Christ is our way, John xiv. 6;
   and whole of Christianity is a coming to God by Christ, Heb. vii. 25.
   Now, in our first entrance faith and repentance are both mixed; and it
   is hard to sever them, and show what belongs to the one, and what to
   the other; at least it would perplex the discourse. Both together imply
   that a man be turned from a life of sin to God by faith in Christ, or a
   renouncing the devil, the world, and the flesh, and devoting and
   dedicating himself to God.

   (1.) A renouncing of the devil, the world, and the flesh; for these are
   the three great enemies of God and our salvation: Eph. ii. 2, 3, In
   time past ye walked according to the course of this world, after the
   prince of the power of the air, the spirit that works now in the
   children of disobedience, among whom also we had our conversation in
   the lusts of the flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the
   mind.' There all our enemies appear abreast: the devil, as the grand
   deceiver and principle of all wickedness; the world, with its
   pleasures, honours, and profits, as the bait by which it doth deceive
   us, and steal away our hearts from God, and pervert and divert us, that
   we should not look after the one thing necessary; the flesh is that
   corrupt inclination in us which entertains and closeth with these
   temptations, to the neglect of God and the wrong of our own souls; this
   is very importunate to be pleased, and is the proper internal cause of
   all our mischief; for James i. 14, Every man is enticed and drawn away
   by his own lust.' These must be renounced before we can return to God;
   for till we put away our idols we cannot incline our hearts to the true
   God, Josh. xxiv. 23. And these are the great idols by which our hearts
   are estranged from him. When God is laid aside, self interposeth as the
   next heir, and that which we count self is the flesh. Many wrong their
   own souls, but never any man hated his own flesh. That which feeds the
   flesh is the world; and the devil, by proposing the bait, irritateth
   and stirreth up our affections. Therefore we must be turned from Satan
   to God; we must be delivered from the present evil world; we must
   abstain from fleshly lusts, for God will have no copartners and
   competitors in our hearts.

   (2.) A devoting and giving up ourselves to God, Father, Son, and Holy
   Ghost, as our God, 2 Cor. viii. 3, and Rom. vi. 13; as our owner by
   creation, Ps. c. 3; and by redemption, 1 Cor. vi. 19, 20; as our
   sovereign lord, Jer. xxiv. 8, Isa. xxvi. 13, Other lords besides thee
   have had dominion over us,' &c.; as the fountain of our life and
   blessedness: Ps. xxxi. 14, I trusted in the Lord, I said, Thou art my
   God;' Lam. iii. 24, The Lord is my portion, saith my soul, therefore
   will I hope in him;' Ps. cxix. 57, I have said, Thou art my portion,
   therefore I will keep thy precepts.'

   [2.] As to our progress and perseverance, which is our walking in the
   narrow way, and shows the sincerity and heartiness of our consent in
   making the covenant--and besides, this is not the work of a day, but of
   our whole lives--we have continual need of coming to God by Christ.
   Here three things are required:--

   (1.) As to the enemies of God and our souls, there must be a forsaking
   as well as a renouncing: the devil must be forsaken; we must be no more
   of his party and confederacy; we must resist, stand out against all his
   batteries and assaults, 1 Peter v. 8, 9; the world must be overcome, 1
   John v. 4, 5; and the flesh must be subdued and mortified, Gal. v. 24,
   that we be no more governed by the desires thereof, and if we be
   sometimes foiled, we must not go back again, but renew our resolutions;
   and the drift of our lives must still be for God and heaven.

   (2.) As to God, to whom we have devoted ourselves, we must love and
   please and serve him all our days, Luke i. 75. We must make it our work
   to love him, and count it our happiness to be beloved by him, and
   carefully apply ourselves to seek his favour, and cherish a fresh sense
   of it upon our hearts, and continue with patience in well doing, Rom.
   ii. 7, till we come to the complete sight and love of him in heaven, 1
   John iii. 2.

   (3.) You must always live in the hope of the coming of Christ, and
   everlasting glory: Titus ii. 13, Looking for the blessed hope;' and
   Jude 21, Looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus unto eternal life.' As
   we did at first thankfully accept of our recovery by Christ, and at
   first consent to renounce the devil, the world, and the flesh, and
   resolve to follow God's counsel and direction, we must still persevere
   in this mind, and use his appointed means in order to our final
   happiness. The sum, then, of our Christianity is, that we should by
   true repentance and faith forsake the world, the flesh, and the devil,
   and give up ourselves to God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, that he may
   take us for his reconciled children, and, for Christ's sake, forgive
   all our sins; and by his Spirit give us grace to persevere in those
   resolutions, till our full and final happiness come in hand.

   7. This covenant, consisting of such duties and privileges as God hath
   confirmed by certain visible ordinances, commonly called sacraments, as
   baptism and the Lord's Supper; both which, but in a different manner,
   respect the whole tenor of the covenant. For as the covenant bindeth
   mutually on God's part and ours, so these duties have a mutual aspect
   or respect to what God does, and what we must do. On God's part they
   are a sign and a seal, on our part they are a badge and a bond.

   [1.] On God's part they are sealing or confirming signs. As
   circumcision is called, a sign' or seal of the righteousness which is
   by faith.' Rom. iv. 11; that is, of the grace offered to us in Christ;
   so is baptism, which came in the room of circumcision: Col. ii. 11, 12,
   In whom ye are circumcised, buried with him in baptism.' Surely the
   gospel ordinances signify as much grace as the ordinances of the legal
   covenant. If circumcision was a sign and seal of the righteousness
   which is by faith, or a pledge of God's good-will to us in Christ, so
   is baptism, so is the Lord's Supper; they are a sign to signify and a
   seal to confirm, to represent the grace and assure the grant of pardon
   and life. As, for instance, baptism signifies pardon and life, so does
   the Lord's Supper, Mat. xxvi. 28, 29; that for our growth and
   nourishment, this for our initiation. Baptism is under our
   consideration at present, that it hath respect to remission of sins.
   The text is clear for it, and so are many other scriptures. It was
   Ananias' advice to Paul, Acts xxii. 16, Arise and be baptized, and wash
   away thy sins, and call on the name of the Lord.' So Eph. v. 26, That
   he might sanctify and cleanse us by the washing of water through the
   word.' The washing represents the washing away the guilt and filth of
   sin; it signifies also our resurrection to a blessed and eternal life.
   Baptism saveth by the resurrection of Christ, 1 Peter iii. 21. Well,
   then, it is a sealing sign. When God promised longer life to Hezekiah.
   2 Kings xx. 8, he said, What shall be the sign that the Lord will heal
   me?' So when he promiseth pardon and life to us, What shall be the sign
   that the Lord will do this for us? Baptism is this sign; a witness
   between us and God: Gen. xxxi. 48, This heap is a witness between thee
   and me.'

   [2.] On our part they are a badge and a bond to oblige us to the duties
   of the covenant--a badge of the profession, and a bond to engage us to
   the duties which that profession calls for. As the apostle speaks of
   circumcision, that whosoever is circumcised is a debtor to the whole
   law,' Gal. v. 3, binds himself to the observances of Moses; so a
   Christian, by being baptized, becomes a debtor, not to the flesh, to
   live after the flesh, &c., Rom. viii. 12. And it is called an answer
   towards God,' 1 Peter iii. 21; the answer supposes the demands of the
   covenant; and so it is an undertaking faithfully to perform the
   conditions required of us, a vow or an obligation whereby we reckon
   ourselves bound to die unto sin, and live unto righteousness, through
   Jesus Christ our Lord.' Rom. vi. 11. It bindeth us chiefly to the
   duties that belong to our entrance, as the Lord's Supper doth more
   directly to the duties which belong to our progress; it bindeth us to a
   true belief of the gospel, or an acceptance of Christ, and consent to
   the covenant of grace; to renounce the devil, the world, and the flesh,
   and to give up ourselves unto God; and therefore the baptismal
   covenant, by which we are initiated into Christianity, is expressed by
   our being baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Mat.
   xxviii. 19, which implies a giving up ourselves to them in their
   distinct personal relations. To the Father, that we may return to him,
   and obey him as our rightful Lord; that we may love him, and depend
   upon him as the fountain of all our good and all-sufficient happiness,
   and prefer his favour before all the sensual pleasures of the world. We
   are baptized in the name of Christ, that we may believe in him, accept
   him as our Saviour and Redeemer, expecting to be saved by his merits,
   righteousness, and intercession, from the wrath of God, and guilt of
   sin, and eternal death. To the Holy Ghost, as our guide, sanctifier,
   and comforter, that he may free us from sin, change us into the image
   and likeness of Christ, and lead us into all truth and godliness, and
   comfort us with the sense of our present interest in God's love, and
   the hopes of future glory.

   8. These visible confirming ordinances give us great advantages above
   the word and bare proposal of the covenant.

   [1.] As these sealing signs are an expression of God's earnest and
   sincere respect to our salvation. God hath opened his mind in his word
   concerning his love and good-will to sinners in Christ; and he hath
   also added his seal, that the charter of his grace might be more valid
   and authentic. It argueth the goodness and communicativeness of God, to
   give notice in his word; but his solicitousness and anxious care for
   our good, to give visible assurance in the sacraments, as being willing
   ek perissou, over and above to satisfy the heirs of promise.' If a man
   be more than ordinarily cautious to make all sure, it is a sign his
   heart is upon the thing. Surely it is a great condescension that God
   would dispose his grace into a covenant form; but it is a further
   condescension that he would add seals, which needed not on his part;
   but he added them to give us the more strong consolation.' Nudum
   pactum, a naked promise, is not so valid and authentic as when articles
   of agreement are put into a formal instrument and deed of law, and that
   signed and sealed, and interchangeably delivered; this breeds more
   confidence and security on both sides. God's word certifieth us of his
   good-will; but when he is pleased to make a formal indenture of it, and
   to sign it and seal it, it doth breed more assurance in our minds that
   his promises are made with a real intent to perform them, and bindeth
   us the more firmly to God, when, besides our naked promise, there is a
   kind of vow and oath on our part, solemnly entered into by baptism.

   [2.] There is this advantage in the sacraments above the word, that
   they are a closer application. The word speaks to all promiscuously, as
   inviting; the sacrament to every one in particular, as obliging. By the
   word none are excluded from the grace offered upon God's terms: Go
   preach the gospel to every creature;' but by the sacrament, every one
   is expressly admonished of his duty. The object revealed in the word is
   like the brazen serpent, which without difference was exposed to the
   eye of all, that whosoever looked upon it might be healed;' but the
   same object offered in the sacraments is like the blood sprinkled on
   the door-posts, that every man might be assured that his family should
   be in safety. Now the reason of this difference is, because things
   propounded in the word are like a treaty between God and us, or an
   offer and a debating of matters till the parties do agree. But
   sacraments are not of use till both sides have agreed upon the
   conditions of the covenant. In adults, at least, the word conduceth to
   the making of the covenant, but sacraments suppose it made; therefore,
   the word universally propoundeth that which in the seals is
   particularly applied. Now those things do not affect us so much which
   are spoken indifferently to all, as those that are particularly applied
   to ourselves, be cause they stir us up to a more accurate care and
   endeavour to fulfil the duty incumbent upon us. The conditions are
   propounded in the word, Repent and believe, and I will pardon, and give
   thee eternal life. But the sacraments suppose an actual consent, that
   thou hast done, or undertaken to do so; and then God comes and saith,
   Take this as an undoubted pledge, that thou shalt have what I have
   promised; which doth more increase our hope and persuade our duty.

   [3.] By these sealing signs we are solemnly invested into a right to
   the things promised, as when we are put in possession of what we have
   bargained for by due formalities of law: This is my body:' that is our
   solemn investiture into the privileges purchased by Christ's crucified
   body. A believer receiveth Christ in the word, John i. 12, and he
   receiveth Christ in the Lord's Supper. What is the difference? There
   his right is solemnly owned and confirmed in the way which God hath ap
   pointed. As soon as a man consents to a bargain, he hath an interest in
   the thing bargained for, but the right is made more explicit when it is
   delivered to him by some formalities of law, as a house by a key, a
   field by a turf or twig; in such delivery we say, This key is my house,
   this turf or twig is my field. So are we put in possession of Christ by
   these words: This is my body.' Every penitent and believing sinner hath
   a right to Christ and pardon; but his solemn infeoffment is by the
   sacraments: Repent, and be baptized every one of you, for the remission
   of sins;' or, as it is, Acts xxii. 14, Arise and be baptized, for the
   washing away of thy sins.' God gave Abraham the land of promise by word
   of mouth; but, Gen. xiii., he bids him go through the land, and view
   it, and build an altar, and offer sacrifice there; then was he actually
   invested in the gift. God gave Israel a grant of Canaan, but the
   clusters, of Eschol were, as it were, the livery and seisin of it.
   Though the gift be sufficiently made over by the promise, yet it is
   further ratified, and more solemnly conveyed and delivered by the
   sacraments.

   [4.] This is one advantage more, that the great mysteries of godliness
   are laid before our eyes in some visible rites, and so have greater
   force to excite the mind to serious consideration. When God will
   condescend to give us help against our infirmities, it must be by the
   senses, by which all knowledge comes into the soul. Now feeling,
   smelling, tasting, seem not so fit for this, as being more gross, and
   conducing to the welfare of the body; but seeing and hearing convey
   objects to the understanding, and therefore are called the senses of
   discipline and learning. Now the covenant is made by words, which
   strike the ear; but the seals by visible things set it before our eyes,
   and, as the apostle saith, Christ is crucified among us, and evidently
   set forth,' Gal. iii. 1. The sight doth in a more lively manner stir up
   the mind than the bare hearing. Washing from sin doth fitly represent
   to us, and raise thoughts in us about, the sanctification of the
   Spirit, and so in a lively manner excite us to expect this benefit.

   Use. Let us not be slight in the use and improvement of baptism; for it
   implieth a solemn covenanting with God, that we may obtain remission of
   sins, and eternal life. John the Baptist calleth it, Mark i. 4, The
   baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.' Therefore, let us
   reflect upon ourselves, We are all baptized, but what are we the
   better? Have we the more confidence of the pardon of our sins, and a
   greater sense of our covenant vow, to die unto sin and live unto God?
   We cannot have the former without the latter; both must be regarded by
   us. Volateranus reporteth of Lucian, that scoffing atheist, that when
   he revolted from the profession of Christianity, he scoffed at his
   baptism, saying, Se nihil ex eo consecutum quam quod nomen ipsius esset
   corruptum ex Lucio, Lucianus factum--that he got no thing by his
   baptism but a syllable to his name, it being changed from Lucius to
   Lucianus, Alas! what do most get by their baptism but a name? It should
   not be so with you; you may have great advantage by it if you improve
   it to the ends for which it was appointed. To quicken you, consider:--

   1. Baptism is a perpetual bond upon us, obliging us to repentance and
   holy life, Rom. vi. 4, therefore the scripture often reasoneth from it,
   as Rom. vi. 2, How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer
   therein?' He argueth not ab impossibili, but ab incongruo--not from
   what is impossible, but what will misbecome our renewed state, which we
   profess to enter into by baptism, which is a vowed death to sin, and a
   bond wherewith we bind our souls to new obedience. So else where, Col.
   iii. 1, Ye are arisen with Christ,' in the import and signication of
   baptism;' therefore seek the things which are above.' And again, Ye are
   dead, therefore mortify,' &c., ver. 3-5. Once more, ver. 8, 9, Put off
   all these, seeing ye have put off the old man with his deeds.' And in
   many other places the apostle argueth from the baptismal engagement to
   the effect intended and signified thereby.

   2. The improvement of baptism is the best preparation for the Lord's
   Supper: John xiii. 8, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.'
   That washing had a spiritual meaning; and presently after it the
   sacrament of Christ's body and blood was instituted, to the
   participation of which this spiritual washing was necessary. In the
   supposition, if I wash thee not, is implied baptism; in the
   commination, thou hast no part with me, is implied the Lord's Supper,
   which Christ was then about to institute. In foro ecclesiae, before the
   church, none but baptized persons have a right to the Lord's table; in
   foro coeli, before God, none but those who have the fruit of baptism
   have right to the benefits thereof; they that are sanctified by the
   Spirit of Christ have only right to the benefits purchased by his
   blood. Our Lord would remind his disciples of this before he would
   admit them to his table.

   3. If we improve it not, our baptism will be a witness to solicit
   vengeance against us; as the gospel itself is preached either for a
   witness' to us, Mat. xxiv. 14, or for a witness' against us, if we obey
   it not, Mark xiv. 9. So baptism, instead of being a witness to us, will
   be a witness against us if we mind it not. And in the judgment we shall
   fare no better than the heathen; for all the difference between us is,
   that they are uncircumcised in flesh, and we in heart, Jer. ix. 25, 26;
   they are not washed in water, and we are not cleansed from our sins. I
   remember a passage in Victor Uticensis concerning one Elpidophorus, who
   had revolted from Catholicism to the Vandal Arians: the deacon who had
   baptized him showed him the stole, or linen clothes in which he was
   baptized, saying, Hae, te accusabunt cum majestas venerit judicantis,
   &c.--O Elpidophorus! these shall be a witness against thee to all
   eternity, for thy just perdition, when the Judge cometh. What wilt thou
   do, wretch, when the people of God shall be admitted to the joys of
   heaven, and thyself thrust out? &c. If we have been baptized, and lived
   directly contrary to our baptismal vow, as if we were in covenant with
   the devil, the world, and the flesh, rather than with Father, Son, and
   Holy Ghost, what will become of us in the judgment?

   But how shall we improve it?

   First, We must personally and solemnly own the covenant made with God
   in infancy. Every one of us should choose the Lord for our sovereign
   lord and portion; and Christ Jesus for our Redeemer and Saviour; and
   the Holy Ghost for our guide, sanctifier, and comforter. Every one must
   personally thus engage himself to God; it is not enough that Christ
   engage for us as the common surety of all the elect, Heb. vii. 22.
   Something he did for us, and in our names; but every one must take a
   bond upon himself before he can have the benefit of it. You must yield
   up yourselves to the Lord, 2 Chron. xxx. 8. It is not enough that the
   church engage for us as a visible political body, or a community and
   society of men, who are in visible covenant with God and Christ: Ezek.
   xvi. 8, Thou enteredst into covenant with me, and becamest mine;'
   meaning it of the body of the church; but every individual person must
   also enter into covenant with God, and become his: Ezek. xx. 37, I will
   cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of
   the covenant.' Where there is an allusion to the sheep passing out of
   the fold when they were to be tithed for God, Lev. xxvii. 32; they were
   to be told with a rod, one, two, three, &c., and the tenth was the
   Lord's. God will not covenant with us in the lump and body, but every
   one was to be particularly minded of his duty; it is not enough that
   our parents did engage for us in baptism, as the Israelites, in the
   name of their little ones, did avouch God to be their God, Deut. xxix.
   10-12. No man can savingly transact this work for another, we must
   ratify the covenant in our own persons, and make our own professed
   subjection to the gospel of Christ, 2 Cor. ix. 13. This work cannot be
   done by a proxy or assigns; our parents' dedication will not profit us
   without some personal act of our own, if we live to years of
   discretion. Once more, this must be done not only in words, or visible
   external rites, which may signify so much as personal covenanting with
   God, but a man must engage his heart to God, Jer. xxx. 21. Yea, this is
   a business that must be done between God and our own souls, where no
   outward witnesses are conscious to it. God speaketh to the soul in this
   transaction, Ps. xxxv. 3, Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation;' and
   the soul speaketh to God, Lam. iii. 24, Thou art my portion, saith my
   soul;' and Ps. xvi. 2, O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou
   art my God;' thus the covenant is carried on in soul-language. Now upon
   this personal inward covenanting with God our right to all the
   privileges doth depend.

   Secondly, Renew often the sense of your obligation to God, and keep a
   constant reckoning how you lay out yourselves for him: Acts xxvii. 23,
   His I am and him I serve;' Phil. i. 21, To me to live is Christ.' Some
   few renegades renounce their baptism, but most Christians forget their
   baptism: 2 Peter i. 9, He is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has
   forgotten that he was washed from his old sins;' therefore we should be
   continually exciting ourselves both to obedience and dependence, that
   the sincerity of our first vow and consent may be verified by a real
   and constant performance of it.

   Thirdly, You should use frequent self-reflection, that you may come to
   know whether you are indeed washed from the guilt and filth of sin: 1
   Cor. vi. 11, Such were some of you, but now ye are sanctified, but now
   ye are justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of
   our God.' You should observe what further sense you have of the pardon
   of sin, how you get ground upon your bondage of spirit, and grow up
   into some rejoicing of faith, for by these signs God in tended our
   strong consolation, Heb. vi. 18; and the eunuch, when he was baptized,
   went his way rejoicing, Acts viii. 39. Hath God applied his covenant to
   me? taken me into the family? planted me into the mystical body of
   Christ? And shall not I be glad and rejoice in his salvation? So for
   sanctification, see whether God's interest doth prevail in you, or the
   interest of the flesh; what power and strength of will you get against
   corruption easily, Gal. v. 16, 17; whether sin be more subdued, and you
   can govern your passions and appetites better, Gal. v. 24. They that
   are Christ's should find some thing of this in themselves, otherwise
   their baptism is but an empty formality.

   Fourthly and lastly, You must use it as a great help in all
   temptations; as when you are tempted to sin, either by the delights of
   sense: a Christian hath his answer ready, I am no debtor to the flesh;
   or, I am baptized, and dedicated to God in the way of mortification and
   holiness to obtain pardon and life, 1 Cor. vi. 15. Shall I take the
   members of Christ? &c. This soul, this body, this time, this strength
   is Christ's, not to please the flesh, but the Lord. Or by the terrors
   of sense. Dionysia comforted her son Majoricus, an African martyr, when
   he was going to suffer for owning the Godhead of Christ, with this
   speech: Memento, fili, te baptizatum esse in nomine Patris, Filii, et
   Spiritus Sancti--remember, my son, that thou art baptized in the name
   of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and be constant. So when you are
   tempted by the devil, taking advantage of your melancholy and grievous
   afflictions, to question God's love and mercy to penitent believers,
   remember the covenant sealed in baptism, that you may keep up your
   faith in God through Christ, which pardoneth all your sins, and hath
   begotten us to a lively hope. We must expect to be tempted; the devil
   tempted Christ, after his baptism, to question his filiation so
   solemnly attested. Compare Mat. iii. 17, with Mat. iv. 16. Luther saith
   of himself, that when the devil tempted him to despair, or to any
   doubts and fears about the love of God or his mercy to sinners, he
   would always answer, Ecce ego baptizatus sum, et credo in Christum
   crucifixum--Behold, I am baptized, and believe in Christ crucified. And
   he telleth us also of a holy virgin who gave this reply when the devil
   abused her solitudes, and injected any despairing thoughts into her
   mind, Baptizata sum--I am baptized, and entered into God's covenant,
   and will expect the pardon of my sins by Jesus Christ.

   Thus should we all the days of our life improve our baptism, till we
   have the full of that holy and happy estate, for which we were first
   purified and washed in God's laver.

                               OUT OF HIS MISERY.

MAN'S IMPOTENCY TO HELP HIMSELF OUT
OF HIS MISERY.

   For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the
   ungodly.--Rom. V. 6.

   IN this chapter there are two parts: in the first, the apostle lays
   down the comfortable fruits and privileges of a justified estate; in
   the second, he argues the firmness of these comforts, because they are
   so rich that they are scarce credible, and hardly received. The
   firmness and soundness of these comforts the apostle representeth by a
   double comparison:--(1.) By comparing Christ with Christ; and (2.)
   Christ with Adam. Christ with Christ, or one benefit that we have by
   him with another, from the text to ver. 12; then Christ with Adam, the
   second Adam with the first, to the end of the chapter.

   1. In comparing Christ with Christ, three considerations do occur:--

   [1.] The efficacy of his love toward us before justification, with the
   efficacy of his love toward us after justification. The argument
   standeth thus: If Christ had a love to us when sinners, and his love
   prevailed with him to die for us, much more may we expect his love when
   made friends: if when we were in sin and misery, shiftless and
   helpless, Christ had the heart to die for us, and to take us with all
   our faults, will he cast us off after we are justified and accepted
   with God in him? This love of Christ is asserted in ver. 6, amplified
   in ver. 7 and 8, and the conclusion is inferred in ver. 9: Much more
   then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath
   through him.'

   [2.] The second comparison is of the efficacy of the death of Christ,
   and the efficacy of the life of Christ. It is absurd to think that
   Christ rising from the dead, and living in heaven, should not be as
   powerful to save, and bring us to God, as Christ dying was to reconcile
   us to him.

   [3.] The third comparison is the privative mercy, or being saved from
   hell, with the positive mercy, or obtaining a title to heaven: And not
   only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
   we have now received the atonement,' ver. 11.

   2. For the comparison between Christ and Adam, the sum of it is, that
   Christ is more able to save than Adam to destroy, and therefore
   justified persons need to fear nothing. As Adam was a public person,
   and root of mankind, so is Christ a public person; for Adam was tu'pos
   tou me'llontos, the figure of him that was to come,' ver. 14. Adam was
   a public person, but a finite person, having no intrinsic value in
   himself, and only was all us by divine institution; but Christ, beside
   the institution of God, was an infinite person, and therefore there is
   a pollo mallon, a much more,' upon Christ. His sacred virtue exceedeth
   that cursed influence of Adam in many particulars, amply set down in
   the latter end of the chapter by the apostle.

   The words begin the first comparison. In them,--

   1. The condition wherein we are by nature is set forth by two
   notions--ungodly, and without strength: the one noteth that we have no
   worth to move God to help us, for we were ungodly;' the other, that we
   have no power to help ourselves, for we were without strength:' we were
   without strength,' and so need help; ungodly,' and so refused help.

   2. The means of our recovery, Christ died for us.

   3. The seasonableness of our redemption, in due time.

   For the first notion, whereby our natural estate is expressed,
   ungodly,' I shall pass it by; the next notion, without strength,' will
   yield us this point:--

   Doct. That man, fallen, is destitute of all power and means of rising
   again, or helping himself out of that misery into which he hath plunged
   himself by sin.

   This will appear, if you consider his condition with respect to the
   law, or with respect to the gospel, and those terms of grace which God
   offers in Christ. The former more properly falls under the
   consideration of this place; but, because of the method of this
   exercise, you expect the discussion of the latter also, I shall take
   occasion from hence to speak of that.

   First, With respect to the law. That will be understood by a view of
   that scripture that expresseth the tenor of the law: Cursed is every
   one that continueth not in all the words of this law to do them,' Gal.
   iii. 10; where is considerable,--

   1. The duty it exacts.

   2. The penalty it inflicts.

   3. The operation that both these have upon the fallen creature.

   1. The duty it exacts. An innocent nature, that is presupposed; for the
   person must continue.' It doth not say, now begin;' the sentence of the
   law doth not suppose man as lapsed and fallen, or as having already
   broken with God; but as in a good and sound estate. And then universal,
   perpetual, perfect obedience is indispensably required: he must
   continue in all things with all his heart, and that continually; if he
   fails in one point, he is gone. This is personally exacted of all men,
   as long as they abide under Adam's covenant: He that doeth them shall
   live in them;' and the soul that sinneth, it shall die,' Ezek. xviii.
   4, xx. 11. Now if God should call us to an account for the most
   inoffensive day that ever we passed over, what would become of us? If
   thou shouldest mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand?' [260] Ps. cxxx.
   3. Better never born, than to be liable to that judgment, when the law
   shall take the sinner by the throat,' and say, Pay me that thou owest,'
   Mat. xviii. 28. What shall the poor wretch do? So that here we are
   without strength,' altogether un able to come up to the obedience of
   the law of works. The law can make nothing perfect, because it is
   become weak through our flesh.' Rom. viii. 3. To fallen man it
   establisheth a course of punishing sin, not of taking away sin: we may
   increase the debt, but we cannot lessen it. If our obedience were exact
   for the future (let us suppose it), yet the paying of new debts doth
   not quit old scores. They that could not keep themselves when entire
   and innocent, cannot recover themselves when lost and fallen.

   2. The penalty it inflicts: Cursed is every one.' How cursed? Cursed in
   all that he hath, Deut. xxviii. 15-18. All his enjoyments become a
   snare, and temporal comforts do but harden him, and prepare him for a
   greater misery. Cursed in all that he doeth: his prayer is turned into
   sin; his hearing, the savour of death unto death;' all his toil and
   labour in outward service is to no purpose: The sacrifice of the wicked
   is abomination: how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?'
   Prov. xxi. 27. At the best it is but an abomination.' God will not
   accept an offering at his hands; much more when it is polluted with
   sinful and evil aims. But this is not all; he is cursed for evermore:
   the law bindeth him over, body and soul, to everlasting torments; and
   in time he shall hear that dreadful sentence, Depart from me, ye
   cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels,'
   Mat. xxv. 41. There is but the slender thread of a frail life that
   hinders the execution of this sentence upon him: a sinner stands upon
   the very brink of hell, and ever and anon is ready to be cast in; where
   he shall eternally lie under the wrath of God. So that here we are
   without strength,' because we cannot satisfy the justice of God for one
   sin, but are always satisfying, and can never be said to have
   satisfied; like a poor man that pays a debt of a thousand pounds by a
   farthing a week.

   3. Consider how this works with him. An exaction of duty under so
   severe a penalty doth either terrify or stupefy the conscience; he that
   escapeth the one suffereth the other; or else, thirdly, doth irritate
   corruption; or, fourthly, obtrude us upon a sottish despair, so as to
   give over all endeavours and hope of salvation.

   First, Sometimes it terrifieth. That is easily done; the conscience of
   a sinner is a sore place; they are all their lifetime subject to
   bondage,' Heb. ii. 15. There is a hidden fear in the heart of a wicked
   man, not always felt, but soon awakened, either by a sound conviction
   from the word, or some sore judgment, or by the agonies of death, or
   serious thoughts of the world to come. Felix trembled when Paul did but
   mention God's judgment,' Acts xxi v. 25; the prisoner makes the judge
   tremble. A sinner is afraid to think of his condition, if God do but a
   little break in upon his heart: do what he can, he lies under the
   bondage of a wounded spirit, and wherever he goes, like the devils, he
   carrieth his own hell about with him.

   Secondly, If it terrifieth not the conscience, it stupefieth the
   conscience, that they grow senseless of their misery, past feeling,'
   Eph. iv. 19. And that is a dangerous crisis and estate of soul, when
   once a man comes to that, and goeth like a fool to the correction of
   the stocks.

   Thirdly, It irritateth their inbred corruption: The commandment came,'
   that is, in full conviction and power, and sin revived, and I died.'
   Rom. vii. 9. The more we understand of the necessity of our subjection
   to God, the more opposite is the soul to him; as a dam makes a river or
   strong stream the more violent, or as a bullock at the first yoking
   becometh the more unruly. Or,

   Fourthly, It breedeth a sottish despair: There is no hope; therefore we
   will walk after our own devices, and do every one according to the evil
   imaginations of our own heart,' Jer. xviii. 12. It is to no purpose to
   speak to us, or strive further about us; as if they had said, There is
   no hope; and therefore we will live as we list, without any further
   care of turning to God. This is the worst kind of despair, when a man
   is given up to his own heart's lust,' Ps. lxxxi. 12, and runneth
   headlong in the way of destruction, without hope of returning. There is
   more hope of them that are under despairing fears or a terrified
   conscience than there is of those who are under despairing resolutions
   or a stupid and sottish obstinacy. Thus as to the law, man is helpless.

   Secondly, Consider man as to terms of grace offered in the gospel. He
   is still without strength;' not only in a damnable condition by the
   law, but, without grace, unable to accept the gospel. This will appear
   by two considerations:--

   1. By those emphatical terms of scripture by which the case and cure of
   man are set forth.

   2. By those positive assertions whereby all power is denied to man to
   convert himself to God, or to do anything that is spiritually good.

   1. Those emphatical expressions which represent his case and his cure.

   [1.] His case. The scripture sets forth man's condition thus: that he
   is born in sin, Ps. li. 5; and things natural are not easily altered.
   Greedy of sin: He drinketh in iniquity like water,' Job xv. 16; it
   noteth a vehement propension, as greedy to sin as a thirsty man to
   drink. Thirst is the most implacable appetite; hunger is far better
   borne. But this, you will say, is but now and then, in a great
   temptation or vehement passion. No; Every imagination of the thoughts
   of his heart is' evil, only evil,' and that continually,' Gen. vi. 5.
   By how many aggravating and increasing circumstances is man's sin there
   set forth! There is in him a mint always at work: his mind coining evil
   thoughts, his heart evil desires, and carnal motions; and his memory is
   the closet and storehouse wherein they are kept. But may not a man be
   reclaimed? is not this his bondage and trouble? No; his heart is a
   heart of stone, Ezek. xxxvi. 26; that is, inflexible, insensible. When
   God useth the word, some common motions of his Spirit, some rousing
   providences, yet all is in vain; for man's heart is deceitful above all
   things, and desperately wicked,' Jer. xvii. 9; inventing shifts and
   excuses to avoid God, and to cheat itself of its own happiness. But is
   not the New Testament more favourable than the Old? or is not man grown
   better, since there was so much grace discovered? I answer--No; there
   is a perfect harmony between the Testaments; there you will find man
   represented as a child of wrath by nature,' Eph. ii. 3, even the elect
   as well as others to be a servant of sin.' Rom. vi. 17. Never such an
   imperious master, never such a willing servant: sin never leaveth
   commanding, and we love the work. You will find him again expressed as
   one averse from God, alienated from his life,' Eph. iv. 18. It is a
   melancholy thought to a carnal heart to think of the life of God. As an
   enemy to the law, Rom. viii. 7; one that neither can nor will please
   God. As blind,' and knoweth not what to do, 2 Peter i. 9: and this
   blindness spiritual is worse than bodily. A man that is blind in body
   seeketh for a fit guide; as Elymas, when he was stricken blind, sought
   about for one to lead him by the hand,' Acts xiii. 11. As weak and
   without strength,' here in the text; yea, stark dead in trespasses and
   sins,' Eph. ii. 1-5; yea, worse than dead: a dead man doeth no more
   hurt, his evil dieth with him; but there is a life of resistance and
   rebellion against God that goeth along with this death in sin. Now, put
   all this together, and you may spell out man's misery, what a wretched,
   impotent creature he is in his natural estate. The scripture does not
   speak this by glances or short touches; neither is it a hyperbole used
   once or twice, but everywhere, where it professedly speaks of this
   matter. Certainly man contributeth little to his own conversion: he
   cannot hunger and thirst' after Christ that drinks in iniquity like
   water;' there is nothing in nature to carry him to grace who is
   altogether sinful. If the scripture had only said that man had
   accustomed himself to sin, and was not born in sin;' that man was
   somewhat prone to iniquity, and not greedy' of it; and did often think
   evil, and not continually;' that man was somewhat obstinate, and not a
   stone,' an adamant;' if the scripture had only said that man was
   indifferent to God, and not a professed enemy;' if a captive of sin,
   and not a servant;' if only weak, and not dead;' if only a neuter, and
   not a rebel;'--then there might be something in man, and the work of
   conversion not so difficult. But the scripture saith the quite
   contrary.

   [2.] The cure. Certainly to remedy so great an evil requires an
   almighty power, and the all-sufficiency of grace; therefore it is good
   to see how conversion is described in scripture. Sometimes by
   enlightening the mind: And the eyes of your understandings being
   enlightened,' &c., Eph. i. 18. Man, the wisest creature on this side
   heaven, is stark blind in the things of God. Though he hath the light
   of nature, and can put on the spectacles of art, and dress his notions
   of divine things by the glass of the word, yet ere the cure is wrought,
   something must be done upon the faculty: the eyes of our understandings
   must be en lightened, as well as the object revealed. Ay! but this
   infusion of light is not all; the scripture speaks of opening the
   heart: He opened the heart of Lydia,' Acts xvi. 14. God doth not only
   knock at the heart, but open it. He knocks many times by the outward
   means, but finds no entrance. Yea, as one that would open a door,--he
   tries key after key, till he hath tried all the keys in the bunch; so
   does God use means after means; but till he putteth his fingers upon
   the handles of the lock, Cant. v. 4, 5, the door is not opened to him.
   Well, then, the mind must be enlightened, and the heart opened. If
   these words are not emphatical enough, you will find conversion
   expressed by regeneration: Except a man be born again, he cannot see
   the kingdom of God,' John iii. 3. Mark, we must not only be reformed,
   but regenerated. Now because generation is an ordinary work of nature,
   and often falls out in the course of second causes, therefore it is
   expressed by the metaphor of resurrection, Eph. ii. 5. But that which
   hath been may be again; therefore it is called a creation: We are'
   poi'ema autou, his workmanship,' Eph. ii. 10; 2 Cor. iv. 6, v. 17; Ps.
   li. 10. Yea, further it is expressed by victory, 1 John iv. 4; or the
   beating and binding of the strong man,' by one that is stronger than
   he,' Luke xi. 21, 22; by bringing into captivity every proud thought,'
   2 Cor. x. 5. All these expressions doth the scripture use to set out
   the mystery of grace. One expression may not enough be heeded, and
   therefore are many types and figures of it used, that what is wanting
   in one notion may be supplied by another. As let us gather them up a
   little. There must be not only light in the mind, but the heart must be
   moved; and that not a little stirred, but changed, fashioned anew, born
   again. And because generation supposeth a previous disposition in the
   matter, not only is it called regeneration,' but the term resurrection'
   is used, in which the matter is wholly unprepared. But yet because
   still here is matter to work upon, therefore it is called creation,
   which was a making all things out of nothing. God works faith where
   there is no faith, and repentance where was no repentance; and calleth
   the things that are not as though they were.' But now because sin makes
   us worse than nothing, and as in creation, as there was nothing to
   help, so there was nothing to resist and hinder, therefore it is
   expressed by victory; implying the opposition of God's work, and the
   resistance that there is in the heart of man till it be overpowered by
   grace.

   2. The next proof is from those assertions whereby all power is denied
   to man to convert himself to God, or to do anything that is spiritually
   good. As when it is said he cannot know, 1 Cor. ii. 14; he cannot
   believe, John vi. 44; he cannot obey, Rom. viii. 7. Nay, to instance in
   single acts: he cannot think a good thought of himself, 2 Cor. iii. 5;
   he cannot speak a good word: How can ye, being evil, speak good
   things?' Mat. xii. 34. He cannot do anything, John xv. 5. He doth not
   say, nihil magnum, but nihil; not no great thing,' but Without me ye
   can do nothing' Well, then, when man can neither know, nor believe, nor
   obey, nor think, nor speak, nor do anything without grace, surely man
   is without strength,' wholly impotent and unable to turn himself to
   God.

   Obj. 1. But here is an objection: If it be so, how can these things
   stand with the mercy of God, as the Creator of mankind, to require the
   debt of him that is not able to pay? with the justice of God, as the
   judge of the world, to punish him with eternal death for the neglect of
   that which he could not perform? or with the wisdom of the supreme
   lawgiver, to exhort him by promises who hath no power to do what he is
   exhorted unto?

   Ans. 1. I answer--to the first--God doth not lose his right, though man
   hath lost his power; their impotency doth not dissolve their
   obligation; a drunken servant is a servant, and it is against all
   reason that the master should lose his right to command by the
   servant's default. A prodigal debtor, that hath nothing to pay, yet is
   liable to be sued for the debt without any injustice. God contracted
   with us in Adam; and that obedience which he requireth is not only due
   by covenant, but by law; not only by positive law and contract, but by
   immutable right. It is harsh, men think, to suffer for Adam's fault, to
   which they were not conscious and actually consenting; but every man
   will find an Adam in his own heart: the old man is there, wasting away
   the few remains of natural light and strength. And shall not God
   challenge the debt of obedience from a debtor that is both proud and
   prodigal? We are proud; for when we are miserable, we think ourselves
   happy; and when we are poor, we think ourselves rich; and when we are
   blind, we conceit ourselves very seeing; and when we are naked, we
   think ourselves well clad, Rev. iii. 17. And therefore God may admonish
   us of our duty, and demand his right; if for no other reason but to
   show us our impotency, and that we may not pretend that we were not
   called upon for what we owe. And as man is proud, so he is prodigal. We
   spend what is left, and throw away those relics of conscience and moral
   inclinations which escaped out of the ruins of the fall.

   Ans. 2. As to the second, how God can with justice punish him for the
   neglect of what he could not do, I answer--Our natural impotency is
   voluntary. We must not consider man only as impotent to good, but as
   delighting in evil, and loving it with all his heart. As man can not,
   so he will not, come to God, John v. 40. Our impotency lies in our
   obstinacy, and so man is left without excuse. We refuse the grace that
   is offered to us, and by continuing in sin, increase our bondage, our
   inveterate customs turning to another nature.

   Ans. 3. As to the last, how God can exhort and persuade us, for answer,
   suppose we should say--This is only for the elect's sake, who certainly
   are the called according to purpose.' Rom. viii. 28; whereas others are
   called obiter, by the by,' and as they live intermingled with them. If
   the elect did dwell alone, and were a distinct community by themselves,
   the objection were plausible; but they are hidden amongst others, and
   therefore the reprobate have the like favour in the external means with
   them. The world standeth for the elect's sake, yet the sun doth not
   shine upon them alone, nor the showers fall upon their fields alone. Or
   let me illustrate it thus: The sun shineth, though blind men see it
   not; the rain falls upon the rocks and mountains, as well as the
   fruitful valleys: so are exhortations of duty promiscuously tendered to
   good and bad. This might be answer enough; but that which I rather say
   is, that these exhortations have their use; for they carry their own
   blessing with them, to them to whom God means them for good. The word
   has a ministerial subserviency to the power of God; as when Christ
   said, Lazarus, come forth,' it raised him. out of his grave. As for
   others that are not converted by them, it is for their conviction, and
   to bridle their fierceness, and a means to civilise them, and keep them
   from growing worse, whereby many temporal blessings do accrue to them;
   as Pagan Rome flourished in all manner of virtue and success as long as
   moral precepts were in force. But of this more in the next objection.

   Obj. 2. If man be so altogether without strength, why do ye press him
   to the use of means?

   Ans. I answer--Though man cannot change himself, yet he is to use the
   means; and that for several reasons:--

   1. That we may practically see our own weakness. Men think the work of
   grace is easy, till they put themselves upon a trial: the lameness of
   the arm is found in exercise: Apply thy heart to understanding,' then
   cry for knowledge,' Prov. ii. 2, 3. Whosoever sets himself in good
   earnest to get any grace, will be forced to cry for it before he hath
   done. We never seek strength at God's hands in so feeling a manner,
   till our experience convince us of our weakness. When a man goes to
   lift up a piece of timber heavy above his strength, he is forced to
   call in help.

   2. The use of the means we owe to God, as well as the change of the
   heart. We lie under a moral obligation to use them. God, that hath
   required faith and conversion, hath required prayer, hearing, reading,
   meditating; and we are bound to obey, though we know not what good will
   come of it: as Abraham obeyed God, not knowing whither he went,' Heb.
   xi. 8; and Peter, when there was little hope, saith, Howbeit, at thy
   command,' &c., Luke v. 5. Our great rule is, we are to do what he
   commandeth, and let God do what he will.

   3. To lessen our guilt. For when men do not use the means, they have no
   excuse: it is plain laziness and want of will, not want of power, when
   we will not so much as try to come out of our condition; we love our
   bondage, and shut the door upon ourselves; or, as that phrase, judge
   ourselves unworthy of eternal life,' Acts xiii. 46; pass sentence upon
   our own souls. It is a sign we care not whether God show us mercy, yea,
   or no; for you will not so much as bestow a thought upon it; you come
   under the censure of wicked and slothful servants, Mat. xxv. 26.

   4. There is encouragement in the use of means many ways.

   [1.] If we do not something, we shall grow worse. Standing pools are
   apt to putrefy. Man is of an active nature, either growing better or
   worse: when we do not improve nature, we deprave it: They corrupt
   themselves in what they know naturally,' Jude 10. Voluntary neglects
   draw on penal hardness; and so your impotency is in creased. There is
   this benefit of using means--it prevents much sin and hardness of
   heart: it is like the embalming of a dead body; it keeps it from
   stinking, though it does not restore life.

   [2.] Without the use of means they can never hope for anything: How
   shall they believe without a preacher?' Rom. x. 14. If ever I meet with
   God, with Christ, it must be in this way; it is good to lie at the
   pool, as the poor man did who was unable to get in when the angel
   stirred the waters, John v. 3-5. Marriage is instituted for the
   propagation of mankind, yet the soul is of God only. No man abstaineth
   from marriage because he cannot beget a reasonable soul. So grace is of
   God; but hearing, reading, praying, are the instituted means; and we
   must not abstain from these means because grace is not of ourselves,
   but God.

   [3.] It may be God will meet with us. It is the ordinary practice of
   his free grace so to do; and it is good to make trial upon a common
   hope: Pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven
   thee,' Acts viii. 22. There is a great uncertainty, yet pray; it is
   God's usual way to meet with them that seek him: I say unto you, Though
   he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of
   his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth, 3 Luke
   xi. 8: for his importunity's sake.' dia` te`n anai'deian, for his
   impudence,' [261] God is not engaged; but who knows what importunity
   may do? He may, and he may not, give grace; but usually he doth. It is
   God's usual way to bless man's industry; and yet all they that labour
   have not an absolute certainty of success. Who would forbear ploughing,
   because in one year of ten there may happen a dearth or a lean harvest?
   Act; God may come in (for usually he doth) with his influence and
   blessing.

   Let me now give you some reasons why God permits this weakness and want
   of strength to lie upon the fallen creature.

   1. To exalt the freeness and power of his grace. First, The freeness of
   his grace; for God hath shut up all under the curse, that there may be
   no way of escape but by his mercy; their eternal ruin and damnation is
   else certain and inevitable: God hath concluded them all under
   unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.' Rom. xi. 32. Sune'kleise,
   that is the word: the state of unbelief is there compared to a prison,
   made sure and fast with iron bars and bolts; and by God's permission
   man hath shut up' himself in such a prison that mercy alone might open
   the door to him. Jew and Gentile lie fast bound with a chain that can
   be loosened by no hand but God's. So, Gal. iii. 22: The scripture hath
   concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ
   might be given to them that believe:' it is the same word and notion:
   we may mourn and sigh through the grates of the flaming prison, but can
   never get out till God look upon us in mercy through Christ. And so
   also the power of his grace in rescuing us out of this misery: it is a
   mighty power that works in them that believe, Eph. i. 19. When we
   consider it, we may wonder at it that ever such a change should be
   wrought in us that are so carnal, so obstinate: Who hath called us out
   of darkness into his marvellous light,' 1 Peter ii. 9. It is indeed
   marvellous that ever we should get out of the prison of sin; more
   miraculous than Peter's getting out of prison, having so many chains,
   and doors, and keepers upon him, Acts xii.

   2. To humble the creature thoroughly by a sense of his own guilt, un
   worthiness, and nothingness. In our natural state we are ungodly' and
   without strength.' Why has God permitted it? That every mouth may be
   stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God,' upo'dikos to
   Theo, Rom. iii. 19, liable to the process of his revenging justice; and
   so to humble us for our inability and obstinacy, that we may go
   complainingly to God, saying, Lord, I am as a bullock unaccustomed to
   the yoke,' Jer. xxxi. 18. Whosoever hath passed this trial, doth
   sensibly find it.

   Use of all.

   1. To the unconverted,--to be sensible of their condition, and mourn
   over it to God. Acknowledge the debt; confess your impotency; beg
   pardon and grace; and, in a humble sense of your misery, endeavour
   earnestly to come out of it. By such doctrines as these men are either
   cut at heart,' Acts vii. 54, or pricked at heart,' Acts ii. 37, which
   is the far more kindly work. Some men's hearts and lusts are
   exasperated; and they rage and storm when they are warned of their
   danger by a closer application. Oh! it is better to bemoan yourselves,
   than fret against the Lord, and yield to a sottish despair. There is
   some hope when conviction ends in groaning rather than murmuring; and
   you do not fret against the Lord's sovereignty, but complain to him of
   the naughtiness of your hearts, begging his grace for Christ's sake.
   Therefore go and lie at his feet, and say, Lord, I have a blind mind, a
   froward heart; none more. I shall never of myself fly the evil
   forbidden, perform the good commanded, renounce these bewitching lusts,
   take up such a course of service to thy blessed majesty. Oh! take away
   this stony, untractable heart! &c. You are in prison, but you are
   prisoners of hope,' if you do so.

   2. To press the converted to thankfulness. We were once in such a
   pitiful case, till God plucked us as brands out of the burning; we were
   utterly miserable and destitute of all good. Oh! blessed be God, that
   opened the prison-door, and proclaimed deliverance by Christ to poor
   captives; and not only proclaimed it, but wrought it for us: none but
   an Almighty arm could loosen the bolts, and shoot back the many locks
   that were upon us. Peter, when the angel made his chains fall off,
   considered' the matter, Acts xii. 12, and went to give thanks among the
   saints. Oh! when there were so many doors and bolts upon you, such
   difficulties and disadvantages in the way of your conversion, consider
   it, and bless God for your escape: Blessed be the Lord, that gave me
   counsel in my reins,' Ps. xvi. 7.

   3. Let us compassionate others that are in this estate. Poor souls! in
   what a sad condition are they! We have not usually such a deep sense of
   their misery as we should have. Israel was to pity strangers, because
   they were once strangers in the land of Egypt: we ourselves have been
   in the house of bondage. Oh! pity poor captive souls. Especially doth
   this concern the ministry; they that do induere personam Christi, that
   stand in the stead of Christ,' should induere viscera Christi, put on
   the bowels of Christ:' God is my record how greatly I long after you
   all in the bowels of Christ Jesus,' Phil. i. 8. When we were ungodly,'
   and without strength, Christ died for' sinners; and wilt not thou
   labour for them, and employ thy talent to edification? Oh! if we had
   more weighty thoughts about the worth and danger of souls, we would not
   do the Lord's work so sleepily as usually we do; but as co-workers with
   God,' we would beseech you with all earnestness not to receive the
   grace of God in vain,' 2 Cor. vi. 1. Every advantage should be taken
   hold of: as a sinking, perishing man, if it be but a bough in the
   waters, catcheth at it, so should we press you to improve all closer
   applications and ministerial helps, and that with compassion and
   tenderness, as having ourselves been acquainted with the heart of a
   poor, impotent, captive sinner.

THE SCRIPTURE SUFFICIENT WITHOUT
UNWRITTEN TRADITIONS.

   PROPOSITION.--THE SCRIPTURE IS A SUFFICIENT RULE OF CHRISTIAN FAITH, OR
   A RECORD OF ALL NECESSARY CHRISTIAN DOCTRINES, WITHOUT ANY SUPPLEMENT
   OF UNWRITTEN TRADITIONS, AS CONTAINING ANY NECESSARY MATTER OF FAITH,
   AND IS THUS FAR SUFFICIENT FOR THE DECISION OF ALL CONTROVERSIES.

   Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have
   been taught, whether by word or our epistle.--2 Thes. II. 15.

   THE apostle, after he had comforted the Thessalonians, he exhorteth
   them to constancy in the truth, whatever temptations they had to the
   contrary. The comforts he propoundeth to them were taken--(1.) From
   their election, ver. 13; (2.) From their vocation, ver. 14. His
   exhortation is to perseverance, therefore, brethren, &c.

   In the words observe:--

   1. The illative particle therefore, because God hath chosen you and
   called you, and given you such advantages against error and seduction.

   2. The duty inferred, ste'kete, stand fast; it is a military word; you
   have the same in other places: 1 Cor. xvi. 13, Watch ye, stand ye
   fast,' &c; Eph. vi. 14, Stand therefore, having your loins girt about
   with truth.' The word intimateth perseverance.

   3. The means of perseverance, hold the traditions which ye have been
   taught, whether by word or our epistle.

   Where observe:--(1.) The act; (2.) The object.

   [1.] The act, krateite, hold with strong hand; the word implieth a
   forcible, holding against assaults, whether of error or persecution.
   The Thessalonians were assaulted in both kinds; the heathens persecuted
   them, and some were gone abroad that began the mystery of iniquity, and
   were ready to pervert them.

   [2.] The object; which is propounded--(1.) By a common and general
   term, the traditions which ye have been taught. (2.) By a distribution,
   whether by word or our epistle.

   First, The common and general term, the traditions which ye have been
   taught. There are two sorts of traditions--human and divine.

   1. Human traditions are certain external observances instituted by men,
   and delivered from hand to hand, from progenitors to their posterity;
   these may be either beside or contrary to the word of God. (1.) Beside
   the word; as the institutions of the family of the Rechabites, in the
   observance of which, from father to son, they were so exact and
   punctual that God produceth their example to shame the disobedience of
   his people: Jer. xxxv. 6, 7, Jonadab, the son of Rechab, our father,
   commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, nor build houses, nor
   plant vineyards,' &c. (2.) Contrary to the word of God; such as were
   those of the Pharisees, Mat. xv. 2, Why transgress ye the commandment
   of God by your tradition?' Human inventions in religion are contrary
   to, and destructive of, divine laws.

   2. Traditions divine are either heavenly doctrines revealed by God, or
   institutions and ordinances appointed by him for the use of the church.
   These are the rule and ground of our faith, worship, and obedience. The
   whole doctrine of the gospel is a tradition delivered and conveyed to
   us by fit messengers, such as the apostles were: 1 Cor. xi. 2, Now I
   praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the
   ordinances,' marg.--traditions, as I delivered them to you.' So that
   holding the traditions is nothing else but perseverance in apostolical
   doctrine.

   Second, Distribution; that no cheat might be put upon them under any
   pretence, therefore he saith, whether by word or our epistle; that is,
   by word of mouth when present, or by epistle when absent; and he saith
   not epistles, but epistle, as alluding to the former wrote unto them.
   They were bound to yield to both alike credence and obedience, for,
   whether in speaking or writing, the apostolical authority was the same.
   To improve this verse for your benefit, I shall lay down several
   propositions.

   Prop. 1. That whatever assurance we have of God's preserving us in the
   truth, yet we are bound to use diligence and caution; for the apostle
   had said that God had chosen and called them to the belief of the
   truth, and yet saith, therefore, brethren, stand fast. First, reason
   will tell us--(1.) That when we intend an end we must use the means,
   otherwise the bare intention and desire would suffice, and to the
   accomplishing of any effect we need no more than to will it; and then
   the sluggard would be the wisest man in the world, who is full of
   wishings and wouldings, though his hands refuse to labour; but common
   experience showeth that the end cannot be obtained without a diligent
   use of the means: Prov. xiii. 4, The soul of the sluggard desireth and
   hath nothing, but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat;' that is,
   rewarded with the intended benefit. (2.) The business in hand is,
   whether God's election, calling, or promise doth so secure the end to
   us, as that we need not be so careful in the diligent use of means.
   Such a notion or conceit there may be in the hearts of men, therefore
   let us attack it a little by these considerations.

   1. God's decree is both of ends and means, for all his purposes are
   executed by fit means. He that hath chosen us to salvation bringeth it
   about by the belief of the truth and sanctification of the Spirit, 2
   Thes. ii. 13; and without faith and holiness no man shall see God and
   escape condemnation. God had assured Paul, that there should be no loss
   of any man's life among them, except of the ship,' Acts xxvii. 22; and
   yet afterward, ver. 31, Paul telleth them, Except these abide in the
   ship, ye cannot be saved.' How could that assurance given to Paul from
   God, and Paul's caution to the mariners, stand together? Doth the
   purpose of God depend upon the uncertain will and actions of men? I
   answer--Not as a cause, from whence it receiveth its force and
   strength, but as a means, appointed also by God, to the execution of
   his decree, for, by the same decree, God appointeth the event what he
   will do, and the means by which he will have it done; and the Lord
   revealing by his word the conjunction of ends and means, there is a
   necessity of duty lying upon man to use these means, and not to expect
   the end without them. God intended to save all in the ship, and yet the
   mariners must abide in the ship; therefore, what God hath joined
   together let no man separate. If we separate these things God doth not
   change his counsel, but we pervert his order to our own destruction.

   2. God, that hath bidden us to believe his promises, hath forbidden us
   to tempt his providence, Mat. iv. 7. Now we tempt God when we desire
   him to give an extraordinary proof of his care over us, when ordinary
   means will serve the turn or be useful to us.

   3. Though the means seem to have no connection with the end, yet, if
   God hath enjoined them for that end, we must use them. As in the
   instance of Namaan, God was resolved to cure him; but Namaan must take
   his prescribed way, though against his own fancy and conceit: 2 Kings
   v. 10, Wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again unto
   thee, and thou shalt be clean.' Compare ver. 13, If the prophet had
   bidden thee to do some great thing,' &c. So John xiii. 6, 7, Peter must
   submit to be washed, though he could not see the benefit of it. So John
   ix. 6, 7, the blind man must submit to have his eyes anointed with
   clay, and wash in the pool of Siloam; though the clay seemed to put out
   his eyes rather than cure them, and the pool could not wash away his
   blindness: but means appointed by God must be used, whatever
   improbabilities are apprehended by us.

   4. That when God's will is expressly declared concerning the event, yet
   he will have the means used; as, for instance, 2 Kings xx. 5-7, God was
   absolutely resolved to add fifteen years more to Hezekiah's life, yet
   he must take a lump of figs and lay it on the boil;' which plainly
   showeth that no promise on God's part, nor assurance on ours, hindereth
   the use of means; God will work by them, not without them.

   5. In spiritual things assurance of the event is an encouragement to
   industry, not a pretence to sloth: 1 John ii. 27, 28, Ye shall abide in
   him; and now, little children, abide in him.' The promise of
   perseverance doth encourage us to use endeavours, that we may
   persevere, and quicken diligence, rather than nourish security, or open
   a gap to carnal liberty: 1 Cor. ix. 26, I run, not as one that is
   uncertain;' we are the more earnest, because we are assured the means
   shall not be ineffectual.

   Prop. 2. Our duty is to stand fast in the faith of Christ and
   profession of godliness, whatever temptations we have to the contrary.
   Stand fast being a military word, it alludeth to a soldier's keeping
   his ground, and is opposed to two things:--(1.) A cowardly flight; (2.)
   A treacherous revolt,

   1. A cowardly flight implieth our being overcome in the evil day by the
   many afflictions that befall us for the truth's sake: Eph. vi. 13,
   Wherefore take to you the whole armour of God, that you may be able to
   withstand in the evil day, that after you have done all things ye may
   stand.' Their temptation was the many troubles and persecutions that
   befell them, called there the evil day. Their defence lay in the whole
   armour of God, which is there made of six pieces--the girdle of truth
   or sincerity, which is a strength to us as a girdle to the loins; the
   breastplate of righteousness, or a holy inclination and desire to
   perform our duty to God in all things; and the shield of faith, or a
   steadfast adhering to the truths of the gospel, whether delivered in a
   way of command, promise, or threatening; the helmet of hope, or a
   certain and desirous expectation of the promised glory; the shoe of the
   preparation of the gospel of peace, which is a readiness to endure all
   encounters for Christ's sake, who hath made our peace with God; and the
   sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Now, if we take this
   armour and use it in our conflicts, what doth it serve for? To
   withstand and stand; the first is the act of a soldier, the second is
   the posture of a conqueror; here is withstanding till the field be won,
   and then standing when the day of evil is over. Here we make our way to
   heaven by conflict and conquest, and here after we triumph.

   2. A treacherous revolt, or yielding to the enemy by complying with
   those things which are against the interests of Christ and his kingdom
   for advantage sake: 2 Tim. iv. 10, Demas hath forsaken us, and loved
   the present world.' Backsliders in heart are the worst sort of
   apostates, such as lose their affection to God, and delight in his
   ways, and esteem of his glorious recompenses, for a little pleasure,
   profit, or pomp of living;' sell the birthright for one morsel of
   meat,' Heb. xii. 15, 16. Some fail in their understandings, but most
   miscarry by the perverse inclination of their wills; they are carnal,
   worldly hypocrites that never thoroughly mortified the fleshly mind;
   prize things as they are commodious to the flesh, and will save them
   from sufferings. The bias of such men's hearts doth easily prevail
   against the light of their understandings.

   Prop. 3. The means of standing fast is by holding the traditions which
   were taught by the holy apostles. Here I will prove:--(1.) That the
   doctrine of Christianity taught by the apostles is a tradition. (2.)
   That holding this tradition by strong hand when others would wrest it
   from us is the means of. our perseverance.

   1. That the doctrine of Christianity is a tradition. I prove it by two
   arguments.

   [1.] Matters not evident by the light of nature, nor immediately
   revealed to us by God, must be either an invention or a tradition. An
   invention is something in religion not evident by natural light nor
   agreeable to sound reason, but is some cunningly devised fable,
   invented by one or more, and obtruded by various artifices upon the
   belief of the world. Inventions in this kind were man's disease, not
   his remedy: Eccles. vii. 29, God made man upright, but they sought out
   many inventions.' As when the philosophers sat abrood upon religion, a
   goodly chimera it was they hatched and brought forth: Rom. i. 21, 22,
   They became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was
   darkened, and professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.'
   These inventions little became the nature of God; nor were they
   profitable to man, for still the great sore of nature was unhealed,
   which is a fear of death, and the righteous wrath of God, Rom. i. 32,
   so that neither man's comfort nor duty was well provided for. Surely
   the. gospel is none of this sort; not an invention of man, but a
   revelation of God; and a revelation not made to us in person, but
   brought out of the bosom of God by Jesus Christ, and by him manifested
   to chosen witnesses who might publish this mystery and secret to
   others. Well, then, since the gospel is not an invention it is a
   tradition, or a delivery of the truth upon the testimony of one that
   came from God to instruct the world, or reduce it to him; not an
   invention of man, but a secret brought out of the bosom of God by our
   Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore it is said, Heb. ii. 3, 4, How shall we
   escape if we neglect so great salvation; first spoken by the Lord
   himself, and then confirmed to us by them that heard him, the Lord
   bearing them witness?' &c. Christ delivered it to the apostles, and the
   apostles delivered it to others: 2 Tim. ii. 2, Those things which thou
   hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to
   faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.' The apostles
   received the gospel from, Christ, and the churches and ministers from
   the apostles, and then delivered it down to others, until it came to
   us; which is the means of our believing the truth, and confessing the
   name of Christ. This testimony, delivered and conveyed to us by the
   most credible means, and which we have no reason to doubt of, is as
   binding as if we had heard Christ and his apostles in person; for we
   have their word in writing; though we did not hear them preach and
   publish it with the lively voice, their authority is the same delivered
   either way. And that these are their writings appeareth by the constant
   tradition of the church, and the acknowledgment of friends and enemies,
   who still appeal to them as a public authentic record; and, as they
   have been attested by the church, they have been owned by God, and
   blessed by him to the converting and sanctifying of many souls
   throughout all succession of ages. And by this tradition Christianity
   hath held up the head against all encounters of time, and the
   persecutions of adverse powers have not suppressed it, nor the disputes
   of enemies silenced the profession of it; but from age to age it hath
   been received and transmitted to future generations, though sometimes
   at a very dear rate. And this is binding to us, though we saw not the
   persons and miracles by which they confirmed their message, and heard
   not the first report. Yet the universal tradition having handed it to
   us is a sufficient ground of faith, and so we believe through their
   word, and are concerned in Christ's prayers, John xvii. 20, for with
   them and their successors (as to these necessary things) Christ hath
   promised to be to the end of the world, Mat. xxviii. 20.

   [2.] My next argument is, because Christian religion must needs be a
   tradition, partly because matter of fact is the foundation of it, and
   it is in itself matter of faith. (1.) Because it is built upon matter
   of fact, that the Son of God came from God to bring us to God; that is
   to say, appeared in human nature, instructed the world by his doctrine
   and example, and at length died for sinners, confirming both in life
   and death the truth of his mission by such unquestionable miracles as
   showed him to be the Son of God and the Saviour of the world. Now, a
   testimony, tradition, or report is necessary in matters of fact, which
   of necessity must be confined to some determinate time and place. It
   was not fit that Christ should be always working miracles, always
   dying, always rising and ascending, in every place, and in the view of
   every man; but these things were to be once done, in one place of the
   world, in the sight of some particular and competent witnesses; but,
   because the knowledge of them concerned all the rest of the world, they
   were by them to be attested to others; matters of fact can only be
   proved by credible witnesses, and this was the great office put upon
   the apostles, Acts i. 8, xxi. 22, ii. 32, iii. 15, x. 39, 40, 41. (2.)
   As it is matter of faith, or the doctrine built upon this matter of
   fact. We cannot properly be said to believe a thing but upon report and
   testimony. I may know a thing by sense or reason, but I cannot believe
   it but as it is affirmed or brought to me by credible testimony. As we
   are said to see those things which we perceive by the eye, or the sense
   of seeing, and to know those things which we receive by reason, or sure
   demonstration, so we are said to believe those things which are brought
   to us by valuable testimony, tradition, and report. As, for instance,
   if any one ask you, Do you believe the sun shineth at noon day? you
   will answer--I do not believe it, but see it. So if any one ask you--Do
   you believe that twice two make four, and twice three make six? you
   will say--I do not believe it. but know it, because certain and evident
   reason telleth me that two is the half of four, and three of six, and
   every whole consisteth of two halves or moieties. But if he should ask
   you--Do you believe that the sun is bigger than the earth? you will
   say--I believe it; for though your eye doth not discover it, nor doth
   an ignorant man know any certain demonstration of it, yet having the
   authority of learned men, who are competent judges in the case, you
   judge it a rash and foolish obstinacy not to believe it. Apply it now
   to the mysteries of godliness revealed in the gospel: they cannot be
   seen by the eye, for they are invisible; nor found out and comprehended
   by any human understanding, because they exceed the reach of man's
   reason, and depend upon the love and arbitrary will of God, John iii.
   16. Yet you believe them, because God hath revealed them to the
   prophets and apostles; and God, being truth and wisdom itself, cannot
   deceive or be deceived; and, therefore, you believe them with the
   certainty of divine faith, and do no more doubt of them than you do of
   those things which you see with your eyes, and know and understand by a
   sure demonstration. The sense of seeing may be deceived, and human
   reason may err, but it is impossible God should deceive or be deceived.
   It oftentimes falleth out that men do prefer the authority and report
   of a man whom they judge to be wise and good before their own sense and
   reason; as, for instance, that man who by his eye judgeth the sun to be
   less than the earth, yet doth not obstinately stand in his opinion,
   when he heareth a knowing and skilful philosopher assert the contrary.
   Now, if we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater,'
   1 John v. 9. And this testimony of God is brought to us by his
   authorised messengers as the ground of faith, and what is that but
   tradition? We believe in God by hearing of him, and we hear by a
   preacher.' Rom. x. 14. Ordinary preachers declare his mind to us, but
   the extraordinary confirm it; the common preachers give us notice, but
   Christ and his apostles give us assurance; and by their testimony and
   tradition, our faith is ultimately resolved into the veracity of God.

   2. That holding this tradition is the great means of standing fast in
   the faith of Christ, and the confession of his name; for in the word of
   God, delivered by Christ and his apostles, there is sure direction to
   walk by, and sure promises to build upon. For whatever they made known
   of Christ was not a fable, but a certain truth; for they had the
   testimony of sense, 2 Peter i. 16, 17, 1 John i. 1-4, and so could
   plead both the authority of his command and the certainty of his
   promise, and that with uncontrollable evidence; and without this
   revelation there can be neither faith nor obedience, nor sure
   expectation of happiness. For we cannot trust God for what he hath not
   promised, nor obey God in what he hath not commanded; nor in our
   difficulties and distresses expect happiness from him without his war
   rant and assurance. But by this doctrine delivered to us, we have all
   that belongeth to faith, obedience, and happiness, and beyond that the
   creature can desire no more. (1.) There can be no faith till we have a
   sure testimony of God's revelation, for faith is a believing such
   things as God hath revealed because he hath revealed them. It is not
   faith but fancy to believe such things as God hath never revealed, nor
   is it trust and a regular confidence to think that he will certainly
   give us what he hath never promised; this were to lay us open to all
   manner of delusion; and therefore we are never upon sure and stable
   ground but by sticking to such a tradition as may justly entitle itself
   to God. (2.) Nor obedience, for obedience is a doing what God hath
   commanded because he hath commanded it. The fundamental reason of
   obedience is the sight of God's will, 1 Thes. iv. 3, v. 18, 1 Peter ii.
   15. To do what God never commanded, or not to do it upon that account,
   but for other reasons, is not obedience; and in difficult cases the
   soul can never be held to its duty till we are persuaded that so is
   God's will concerning us. Now, to know his will concerning us, we are
   often bidden to search the scriptures, but never bidden to consult with
   the church, to know what unwritten tradition? she hath in her keeping
   to instruct us in our duty. (3.) No certain expectation of happiness.
   We are never safe till we know by what rule Christ will judge us; that
   is, reward or punish men at the last day. Now, he will judge us
   according to the gospel.' Rom. ii. 16, 1 Thes. i. 8. Obey the gospel,
   and you have a perfect rule to guide you to happiness; but if you
   neglect this great salvation, or be unfaithful in the profession of it,
   this word condemneth you, and God will ratify the sentence of it.

   Prop. 4. That whilst the apostles were in being, there were two ways of
   delivering the truth, and that was by word of mouth and writing. So in
   the text, whether by word or our epistle. The apostles went up and down
   and preached Christ everywhere; that needeth no proof, unless you would
   have me to produce the whole book of the Acts of the Apostles. But they
   did not preach only, but write, and both by the instinct of the Holy
   Spirit, who guided their journeys, and moved them to write epistles.
   For being often absent from churches newly planted, and heresies
   arising, or some contentions, which could not be avoided among weak
   Christians, God overruled these occasions for the profit of the church
   in after ages. Upon one occasion or another, they saw a necessity to
   write, ana'nken e'chon: Jude 3, It was needful for me to write unto
   you.' As in the Old Testament, God himself delivered the law with great
   majesty and terror, and afterward caused the same to be written on
   tables of stone for the constant use of his people; and the prophets
   first uttered their prophecies, and then wrote them; so the apostles
   first preached evangelical doctrine, and then consigned it to writing
   for the use of all ages. And though all things delivered by them were
   not delivered in one sermon or one epistle, yet, by degrees, the canon
   of the New Testament was constituted, and made perfect by the writings
   of the evangelists and apostles.

   Prop. 5. That now, when they are long since gone to God, and we cannot
   receive from them the doctrine of life by word of mouth, we must stick
   to the scriptures or written word. (1.) Because we are taught to do so
   by Christ and his apostles. Christ always appealeth to the writings of
   the Old Testament, both against traditions, which he condemneth, Mat.
   xv. 2, and against pretended revelations, Luke xvi. 31, If they hear
   not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded to repent if
   one should come from the dead.' And the apostles still have recourse to
   this proof: Acts xxvi. 22, Witnessing no other things than the prophets
   and Moses did say should come to pass.' And when they pleaded they were
   eye and ear witnesses, and so their testimony was valuable, yet they
   say ye have bebaio'teron lo'gon, a surer word of prophecy, whereunto ye
   shall do well to take heed,' 2 Peter i. 19. Now, how can we do better
   than to imitate these great examples? (2.) Because these things were
   written for our sakes: 1 John i. 4, These things write we unto you,
   that your joy may be full.' The apostles being to leave the world, did
   know the slipperiness of man's memory, and the danger of corrupting
   Christian doctrine, if there were not a sure authentic record left;
   therefore they wrote, and so fully that nothing is wanting to complete
   our joy and happiness. (3.) Because the scriptures are perfect. The
   perfection of scripture is known by its end and intended use, which is
   to give us a knowledge of those things which concern our faith, duty,
   and happiness. (1st.) Our faith in Christ. If there be enough written
   for that end, we need not unwritten traditions to complete our rule.
   Now St John telleth us he might have written more things, But these
   things are written that ye might believe in the Son of God, and have
   life through his name,' John xx. 30, 31. Certainly nothing is wanting
   to beget a faith in Christ; the object is sufficiently propounded, the
   warrant or claim is laid down in the new covenant, and the
   encouragements to believe are clear and strong. What would men have
   more? so that here is a perfect rule, perfect in its kind, and for its
   proper use. (2d.) For our duty; that is sufficiently provided for. The
   apostle telleth us that the grace of God, take it objectively for the
   grace of the gospel, or subjectively for grace in our hearts, teacheth
   us: if you mean objective grace, it prescribeth, directeth; if of
   subjective grace, it persuadeth and exciteth what to do, to live
   soberly, righteously, godly, in the present world,' Titus ii. 12. There
   are all the branches of man's duty enumerated: soberly relateth to
   self-government; righteously, to our carriage towards our neighbour;
   godly, to our commerce and communion with God. Now, in the word of God
   what is there wanting that belongeth either to worship, or justice, or
   personal holiness? Therefore certainly we need no other rule, for it
   layeth down whatsoever men are bound to do in all ages and places of
   the world, and in whatsoever circumstances God shall put them. And so
   it is fit to be the law of the universal king and lawgiver; yea, it is
   so perfect, that whatever other way is set up, it presently dasheth
   against those notions that we have or should have of God and his
   service, and worship; or it infringeth or perverteth the liberty and
   nature of man. (3d.) For our happiness, that doctrine and institution
   which is able to make us wise unto salvation is enough for us, but so
   the holy scriptures are said to do: 2 Tim. iii. 15, Thou hast known the
   holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation,
   through the faith which is in Christ Jesus.' Nay, afterward, ver. 17,
   The man of God is by them made perfect, and thoroughly furnished to
   every good work.'

   If the scriptures do thoroughly direct men to know God in Christ, and
   save their own souls, why should we look any further? Now, they do not
   only furnish every private Christian with this knowledge; but the man
   of God, who is to instruct others, he needeth look no further, but is
   furnished out of the scripture with all things necessary to discharge
   his office. Therefore here we fix and rest, we have a sufficient rule,
   and a full record of all necessary Christian doctrine.

   Use 1. The use of all is, let us not seek another rule than the word of
   God. Papists cry up unwritten traditions, to be received with equal
   respect and reverence as we receive the holy scriptures. But you,
   brethren, stand fast, holding the apostolical tradition: you cannot
   have it by word of mouth from them now, therefore you must stick to
   what is written, or else you cannot preserve yourselves from the frauds
   and impostures of antichrist. These apostolical writings have been
   received in all ages and times of the church from the beginning; and
   all disputes among Christians have been tried by them. None were
   allowed good or sincere Christians who doubted of the truth of them.
   But because we have to do with a people that will sacrifice all to the
   honour and interest of their church, and knowing they are not able to
   stand before the light of scriptures, have, to the no little prejudice
   of the Christian cause, done all that they can to weaken the authority,
   sufficiency, and perspicuity of them, that we might have no religion
   without the testimony and recommendation of their church; therefore I
   shall resume the matter and declare it afresh.

   1. Mankind lying in darkness, and in the shadow of death, it was
   necessary that one way or another God should reveal his mind to them,
   that we may know what belongeth to our duty and happiness, for our
   chief good and last end. Being altered by sin, we strangely mistake
   things, and put light for darkness, and darkness for light, good for
   evil, and evil for good; weighing all things in the balance of the
   flesh, which we seek to please. We confound both the names and natures
   of things, and wander in a maze of a thousand perplexities; therefore
   God in pity to mankind hath given us a sure direction in his word,
   which is a lamp unto our feet, and a light unto our path,' Ps. cxix.
   105. Mark the words of light' and lamp;' the use of a lamp is by night,
   and in the day we have the light of the sun; whether it be day or night
   with us, here we are taught how to carry ourselves. Mark again the
   words of path' and feet;' the one signifieth our way and general
   course, the other all our particular actions, so far as religion is
   concerned in them; we have directions in the word about them. Besides,
   man's condition is such that he needeth a supernatural remedy by a
   redeemer, which, depending upon the mere love and free grace of God,
   cannot be found out by natural light left to us; for that only can
   judge of things necessary, but not of such things as depend upon the
   mere pleasure of God. Therefore a divine revelation there must be.

   2. Since it is necessary that God should some way or another reveal his
   mind to his people, it must be done by oracles, visions, dreams, or by
   extraordinary messengers, who by word of mouth might convey it to us;
   or else by writing, and by ordinary teachers, whose lips may preserve
   knowledge in the church. The former ways might suffice, while God saw
   fit to reveal but a few truths, and such as did not burden the memory;
   and men were long-lived and of great simplicity, and the church was
   confined within a small compass of ground, and not liable to so many
   miseries and changes as now in the latter ages. But when once God hath
   spoken to us by his Son, these extraordinary ways ceased, Heb. i. 1, 2,
   God, who at sundry times, and in divers manners, spake in time past
   unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last times spoken unto
   us by his Son.' As formerly God did speak polutro'pos, in divers
   manners, that is to say, by visions, oracles, dreams, &c., so
   polumeros, at sundry times, by several steps and degrees, he acquainted
   the world with the truths necessary for man to know, delivering them
   out by portions, not altogether at once, till he came who had the
   Spirit without measure,' John iii. 34. The prophets, to whom God
   revealed himself before by visions, oracles, dreams, or the coming of
   the Spirit upon them, had the Spirit ek me'trou, by measure, to fit
   them for some particular errand or message on which God sent them. But
   when God sent his Son out of his bosom to reveal the whole doctrine of
   faith at once, and to declare his Father's will with full authority and
   power, he fixed and closed up the rule of faith. So it was not fit that
   after him there should come any extraordinary nuncios and ambassadors
   from heaven, or any other should be owned as infallible messengers, but
   such as he immediately sent abroad in the world to disciple the
   nations. Therefore all former extraordinary ways ceased, and we are
   left to the ordinary rule stated by Christ.

   3. Being left to the ordinary rule, it was necessary it should be
   taught not only by word of mouth, but committed to writing; for Christ
   is ascended into heaven, and the apostles do not live for ever, and we
   have no men now that are immediately and divinely inspired; and
   ordinary pastors and teachers cannot make new articles of faith, but do
   only build on the apostles' foundation, 1 Cor. iii. 10, or that
   divinely inspired doctrine which they delivered to the church. Yea,
   that doctrine cannot well be preserved from oblivion and corruption
   without writing, therefore God accounted this the safest way. Those
   things that are only delivered by word of mouth, or from hand to hand,
   may easily be changed, corrupted, or utterly lost. Certainly if you
   consider man's sloth, treachery, levity, and the many vile affections
   which may easily induce him to extinguish or corrupt the truth, which
   is contrary to them; you will see that it is necessary that there
   should be a sure authentic record, by which truth and error might be
   tried and distinguished. Yea, that the church, which is dispersed
   through out the world, might have truth at hand, and particular
   believers have this doctrine ever by them for their comfort and use; it
   being the property of a blessed man to delight in the law of God, and
   to exercise himself therein day and night,' Ps. i. 2. In short, while
   the apostles were living it was good to take the tradition from their
   mouth; but now they are dead, we take it from their writings. Surely if
   God saw some writing necessary when those extraordinary ways we spoke
   of before were in use, and the church of the Old Testament was in a
   much quieter state than the church of the New,--I say, if some writing
   were necessary then, it is more necessary now; for the Christian church
   is more exposed to dreadful storms of persecution, the deceits of
   heretics of all sorts, especially to the frauds of antichrist, which we
   are forewarned of in this chapter, and are detected and discovered by
   their contrariety to the written word.

   4. This truth being written, it is both a safe and a full rule for us
   to walk by. It is a safe rule, because it is written by the apostles
   and evangelists, holy men moved by the Holy Ghost. The apostles did not
   lose their infallibility when they committed what they preached to
   writing: the same Spirit that assisted them in delivering the doctrine
   by word of mouth assisted them also when they delivered it by writing;
   and it is a full and sufficient rule, because it containeth all things
   which are necessary for men to believe and do in order to eternal life.
   Let them name what is necessary beyond what is recommended there, or
   may be deduced from thence. Yea, it doth contain not only all the
   essential but also the integral parts of the Christian religion; and
   therefore nothing can be any part of our religion which is not there.
   The direction of old was, Isa. viii. 20, To the law and to the
   testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because
   there is no light in them.' Everything was then tried by Moses and the
   prophets, and everything must be now tried by the prophets and
   apostles, which is our foundation of faith, worship, and obedience,
   Eph. ii. 20.

   5. That which we blame in the Papists is, that they cry up a private,
   unproved, unwritten tradition of their own, as of equal authority with
   this safe and full rule which is contained in the written word of God.
   Their crime and fault may be considered partly with respect to the
   object and matter, that these traditions are not indifferent customs,
   but essential points, necessary to faith and Christian practice; and so
   though a Christian be never so thorough and sound in his obedience to
   the word of God, and true to the baptismal covenant, yet if he
   submitteth not to these unwritten traditions, he wants some point
   necessary to faith and practice, and so to life eternal, which is
   contrary to Mark xvi. 16, He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be
   saved; and he that believeth not shall be damned;' and John xvii. 3,
   This is life eternal, to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ
   whom thou hast sent.' Partly as to the subject, as they make their own
   faction to be the only keepers of these things, and that nothing is to
   be owned as apostolical tradition but what is delivered as such by
   their authority; which is to leave the church to the tyranny and
   usurpation of a corrupt faction, to declare for apostolical tradition
   any thing which serveth their ends and interests, and for which no true
   historical evidence is produced. Now the unjust and fraudulent
   practices which they have used to promote this usurpation over the
   churches of Christ rendered them of all men most unfit to be trusted in
   this kind. Partly with respect to the manner; they will have these
   things received pari reverentia et pietatis affectu--with the same
   reverence and pious affection with which we receive the holy
   scriptures; and so man's post is set by God's, and unproved traditions
   equalled with doctrines of faith. Their opinion is bad enough, but
   their practice is worse, for there they show they value these things
   more than the scriptures, as superstition always aboundeth in its own
   things. Did ever any of their doctors say the same things of traditions
   which they take the boldness to say of scripture? Did they ever call
   them pen and inkhorn, or parchment divinity, a nose of wax, a dumb
   rule, an obscure and ambiguous doctrine? These blasphemies they vent
   boldly against the scripture, but did they ever speak thus of
   tradition? And again, their common people are a thousand times better
   instructed in their traditions than in the doctrine of salvation; they
   skill more of Lent, and ember-weeks, &c., than they truly understand
   the doctrine of man's misery and remedy. And call you this equal
   reverence and pious affection to the scriptures and traditions? Partly
   because they would never give us a perfect catalogue of unwritten
   traditions necessary to be observed by all Christians; it may be lest
   they should amaze the people with the multitude of them, or else that
   the people may not know how many of their doctrines are destitute of
   scripture proof and so they plainly be discovered to be imposers on the
   belief of the Christian world.

   6. Though we blame this in Papists, yet we reject not all tradition.

   [1.] Because scripture itself is a tradition, as we proved before, and
   is conveyed to us by the most credible means, which we have no reason
   to doubt of. The scriptures of the Old Testament were preserved by the
   Jews, to whom were committed the oracles of God.' Rom. iii. 2. And
   Protestants receive all the books which they admitted into their canon.
   And for the books of the New Testament, the Christian church hath
   received them as the writings of those whose names they bear, and by
   the constant universal tradition of the church they are transmitted to
   us; and we have no more reason to doubt of them than we do of statutes
   and laws made by kings and parliaments who lived long before we had a
   being. Yea, we may be much more confident, as the matter is of greater
   weight and consequence, and these writings have the signature and stamp
   of God's Spirit on them, and have been blessed by God to the converting
   and sanctifying of many souls; and have been delivered down to us by a
   succession of believers unto this very day: and by them Christianity
   hath been preserved in the world, notwithstanding the wickedness of it;
   and hath held up head against all the encounters of time. The
   persecutions of adverse powers have not suppressed it, nor the disputes
   of enemies silenced the profession of it; but still from age to age
   God's truth is received and transmitted to posterity.

   [2.] Because the proof of Christianity depending upon matters of fact,
   chiefly Christ's rising from the dead, it can only be proved by a
   testimony, which in so extraordinary a case must be made valuable and
   authorised to the world by the miracles accompanying it. Now, the
   notice of these things is brought to us by tradition, which being un
   questionable, giveth us as good ground of faith as it did to them that
   lived in the apostles' time, and heard their doctrine, and saw their
   miracles. God's wonderful works were never intended for the benefit of
   that age only in which they were done, but for the benefit also of
   those that should hear of them by any credible means whatsoever, Ps.
   cxlv. 4, Joel i. 3, Ps. lxx. 3-7. These things were told them that they
   might set their hope in God,' &c.

   [3.] Because there are some doctrines drawn by just consequence from
   scripture, but are the more confirmed to us when they are backed with
   constant church usage and practice; as baptism of infants, Lord's day,
   singing of psalms in our public worship, &c.

   [4.] Because there are certain words which are not found in scripture
   indeed, yet agreeable thereunto, and are very useful to discover the
   frauds of heretics, as trinity, divine providence, consubstantial,
   procession of the Holy Ghost, satisfaction, &c.

   [5.] We reject not all church history, or the records of ancient
   writers concerning the providences of God in their days in owning the
   gospel, which make much for our instruction in manners, and are helps
   to encourage us to put our trust in God.

   [6.] There are certain usages and innocent customs or circumstances,
   common or sacred, and other actions, which we despise not, but
   acknowledge and receive as far as their own variable nature and
   condition requireth; not rejecting them because anciently practised,
   nor regarding them when the general law of edification requireth the
   omission of them. But that which we detest is, that the traditions of
   men should be made equal in dignity and authority with the express
   revelation of God. Yea, that manifest corruptions and usurpations, as
   making Rome the mistress of other churches, and superinducing the Pope
   as the head of the universal visible church, and the vicar of Christ,
   without his leave and appointment, and such like other points, should
   be obtruded upon the world as apostolical traditions, and to be
   received with like religious reverence as we do articles of faith set
   down in scripture. This is that we cannot sufficiently abhor, as
   apparently false and destructive to Christianity.

   The propositions drawn out of the text in this sermon are these:--

   1. Whatever assurance we have of God's preserving us in the truth, yet
   we are bound to use diligence and caution.

   2. Our diligence and caution is to be employed about this, that we may
   stand fast in the faith of Christ, and the profession and practice of
   godliness.

   3. That the means of standing fast in the faith of Christ and the
   profession and practice of godliness is by holding the traditions which
   were taught by the holy apostles.

   4. That while the apostles were in being there were two ways of
   delivering the truth--by word of mouth and writing.

   5. That now when they are long since gone to G-od, and we cannot
   receive from them the doctrine of life by word of mouth, we must stick
   to the scriptures or written word.

                                 EDITORIAL NOTE

    ON

                             SMECTYMNUUS REDIVIVUS.

   ACCORDING to the advertisement which has been long before the public,
   this volume should have contained the treatise called Smectymnuus
   Redivivus. That advertisement was prepared by the late Mr Nichol under
   the impression that that was a treatise by Dr Manton, different from
   the work of the five divines whose initials formed the name
   Smectymnuus. But it was not so. It was simply that work re-issued, with
   a very short preface by Dr Manton. It is not surprising that Mr Nichol
   should have been misled by the title; for certainly it is not usual to
   designate a reprint of a book by the name of its author with the
   adjunct Redivivus, while it is not unusual for an author, professing to
   write in the same spirit in which one of his predecessors had written,
   to adopt his name with that adjunct appended to it. If we saw an
   announcement of the publication of a book with the title Junius
   Redivivus, we should not expect it to be a new edition of the famous
   Letters,' but a new work by one who proposed to treat the political
   topics of the present day in a similar way to that in which Junius
   treated those of his day. Such an expectation would be reasonable; but
   in the present case it would be erroneous.

   It may be noticed that the same mistake was made long ago by Anthony à
   Wood; and, indeed, it is probable that it was he who misled Mr Nichol.

   Being aware, then, that the treatise was not Dr Manton's, the Editor
   has not thought himself entitled to include it among his works. It is
   enough to subjoin the preface, which was all that Manton contributed to
   the treatise as reprinted. The work was originally published in 1641,
   in answer to Bishop Hall's advocacy of the divine right of Episcopacy.
   It authors were Stephen Marshall, Edmund Calamy, Thomas Young, Matthew
   Newcomen, and VVilliam Spurstow, whose initials were combined to form
   the pseudonym Smectymnuus. In 1653 it was reprinted, as we have stated,
   with the following preface by Dr Manton:--

TO THE READER.

   GOOD READER,--Solomon told us long since, that there is no end of many
   books, Eccles, xii. 12. Scripturiency (it seemeth) is no novel humour,
   but abounded then, even when the means of transmitting knowledge was
   more difficult. If there were cause for the complaint then, there is
   much more now, since the press hath helped the pen; every one will be
   scribbling, and so better books are neglected, and lie like a few
   grains of corn under a heap of chaff and dust. Usually books are
   received as fashions; the newest, not the best and most profitable, are
   most in esteem; insomuch that really learned and sober men have been
   afraid to publish their labours, lest they should divert the world from
   reading the useful works of others that wrote before them. I remember
   Dr Altingius, [262] a terse and neat spirit, stood out the battle of
   twenty years' importunity, and would not yield to divulge anything upon
   this fear. Certainly, reader, it is for thy profit some times to look
   back and consult with them that first laboured in the mines of
   knowledge, and not always to take up what cometh next to hand. In this
   controversy of discipline many have written, but not all with a like
   judgment and strength, which I believe hath been no small rock of
   offence, and stone of stumbling to the adversaries, who are hardened
   with nothing so much as a weak defence of the truth; as Austin
   complaineth, [263] that when he was a Manichee, he had had too too
   often the victory put into his hands by the defences of weak and
   unskilful Christians. This work, which the stationer hath now revived
   (that it may not be forgotten, and, like a jewel, after once showing,
   shut in the cabinet of private studies only), was penned by several
   worthy divines of great note and fame in the churches of Christ, under
   the borrowed and covered name of Smectymnuus, [264] which was some
   matter of scorn and exception to the adversaries; as the Papists
   objected to Calvin, his printing his Institutions under the name of
   Alcunius, and to Bucer his naming himself Aretius Felinus, though all
   this without ground and reason, the affixion of the name to any work
   being a thing indifferent, for there we must not consider so much the
   author as the matter, and not who said it, but what; and the assumption
   of another name not being infamous, but where it is done out of deceit,
   and to another's prejudice, or out of shame because of guilt, or fear
   to own the truths which they should establish. I suppose the reverend
   authors were willing to lie hid under this onomastic, partly that their
   work might not be received with prejudice, the faction against which
   they dealt arrogating to themselves a monopoly of learning, and
   condemning all others as ignorants and novices not worthy to be heard;
   and partly that they might not burthen their frontispiece with a
   voluminous nomenclature, it not being usual to affix so many names at
   length to one treatise.

   For the work itself speaketh its own praise, and is now once more
   subjected to thy censure and judgment. This second publication of it
   was occasioned by another book for vindication of the ministry by the
   Provincial Assembly of London, wherein there are frequent appeals to
   Smectymnuus. Though otherwise I should have judged the reprinting
   seasonable; for the Lord hath now returned us to such a juncture of
   time wherein there is greater freedom of debate, without noise and
   vulgar prejudice; and certainly if the quarrel of Episcopacy were once
   cleared and brought to an issue, we should not be so much in the dark
   in other parts of discipline, the conviction of an error by solid
   grounds being the best way to find out the truth. Reformations carried
   on with popular tumults, rather than rational conviction, seldom end
   well; though the judgment of God be to be observed in pouring contempt
   upon those which are partial in His law, yet the improvident leaps
   which a people are wont to make upon such occasions lay the foundation
   of a lasting mischief. I hope, that by the review of these matters we
   shall come to know more of the Lord's counsel for the ordering of his
   house; or at least that, by weighing what may be said on all sides, we
   shall learn more [265] to truth-it in love, which is the unfeigned
   desire of him who is thine in the Lord,

   Tho. Manton.

       millium assistebant ei, quanta ergo cum reverentiâ, quanto timore,
       quanta illuc humilitate accedere debet e palude sua procedens et
       repens ranuncula vilis; quam tremebundus, quam supplex, quam
       denique humilis et sollicitus, et toto intentus animo majestati
       gloriae in praesentia angelorum, in concilio justorum et
       congregatione assistere poterit vilis homuncio.: [4121]1
