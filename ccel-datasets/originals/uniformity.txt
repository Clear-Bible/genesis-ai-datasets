                           Uniformity With God's Will

Saint Alphonsus de Liguori

   "Perfection is founded entirely on the love of God: Charity is the bond
   of perfection;' and perfect love of God means the complete union of our
   will with God's."

   St. Alphonsus

                                    Preface

   In Volume 1, Opere Ascetiche di S. Alfonso M. de Liguori, Roma, 1933,
   "Uniformity with God's Will" is included as one of three works under
   the heading, "Lesser Works on Divine Love." There is no preface in the
   Italian original. However, it has been thought well to provide one
   here.

   Prof. Candido M. Romano [1] says this brochure was written probably in
   1755, as appears from a letter by the Saint, under date of Nov. 2,
   1755, to Sister Giannastasio, at Cava. Romano goes on to say:

   "This (i.e. God's will) was for Alphonsus a theme of predilection, a
   theme dearest to his heart. Just as St. Ignatius stressed the greater
   glory of God,' St. Alphonsus in all his works, gave prominence to the
   greater good pleasure of God.' Most likely the occasion that brought
   forth this treatise was the death, in 1753, of Father Paul Cafaro,
   C.SS.R., St. Alphonsus' confessor and director. The death of this
   worthy priest deeply affected the Saint and he expressed his sentiments
   in a poem on God's will. The wide acclaim it received may have
   suggested to him the thought that a tract on the same subject would be
   helpful to the souls of others. If this be true, his surmise proved
   correct, for the appearance of his subsequent pamphlet was greeted with
   instant favor."

   Cardinal Villecourt, in his Life of St. Alphonsus, quotes long passages
   from this pamphlet and ends by saying: "Our Saint frequently read it
   himself and when his sight had failed he arranged to have it read to
   him by others."

   This brochure bears the stamp of Alphonsian simplicity of style and
   solidity of doctrine. Moreover the instances he cites from the lives of
   the saints have a gentle graciousness and contain a fragrance that is
   redolent of the Fioretti of St. Francis of Assisi.

   Through God's grace and our Lady's prayers may a diligent reading of
   the book bring us far along the way of perfection by the cultivation of
   uniformity with God's holy will!

                         1. Excellence of this Virtue.

   Perfection is founded entirely on the love of God: "Charity is the bond
   of perfection [2] ;" and perfect love of God means the complete union
   of our will with God's: "The principal effect of love is so to unite
   the wills of those who love each other as to make them will the same
   things [3] ." It follows then, that the more one unites his will with
   the divine will, the greater will be his love of God. Mortification,
   meditation, receiving Holy Communion, acts of fraternal charity are all
   certainly pleasing to God--but only when they are in accordance with
   his will. When they do not accord with God's will, he not only finds no
   pleasure in them, but he even rejects them utterly and punishes them.

   To illustrate:--A man has two servants. One works unremittingly all day
   long-- but according to his own devices; the other, conceivably, works
   less, but he does do what he is told. This latter of course is going to
   find favor in the eyes of his master; the other will not. Now, in
   applying this example, we may ask: Why should we perform actions for
   God's glory if they are not going to be acceptable to him? God does not
   want sacrifices, the prophet Samuel told King Saul, but he does want
   obedience to his will: "Doth the Lord desire holocausts and victims,
   and not rather that the voice of the Lord should be obeyed? For
   obedience is better than sacrifices; and to hearken, rather than to
   offer the fat of rams. Because it is like the sin of witchcraft to
   rebel; and like the crime of idolatry to refuse to obey [4] ." The man
   who follows his own will independently of God's, is guilty of a kind of
   idolatry. Instead of adoring God's will, he, in a certain sense, adores
   his own.

   The greatest glory we can give to God is to do his will in everything.
   Our Redeemer came on earth to glorify his heavenly Father and to teach
   us by his example how to do the same. St. Paul represents him saying to
   his eternal Father: "Sacrifice and oblation thou wouldst not: But a
   body thou hast fitted to me . . . Then said I: Behold I come to do thy
   will, O God [5] ." Thou hast refused the victims offered thee by man;
   thou dost will that I sacrifice my body to thee. Behold me ready to do
   thy will.

   Our Lord frequently declared that he had come on earth not to do his
   own will, but solely that of his Father: "I came down from heaven, not
   to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me [6] ." He spoke in
   the same strain in the garden when he went forth to meet his enemies
   who had come to seize him and to lead him to death: "But that the world
   may know that I love the Father: and as the Father hath given me
   commandment, so do I; arise and let us go hence [7] ." Furthermore, he
   said he would recognize as his brother, him who would do his will:
   "Whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my
   brother [8] ."

   To do God's will--this was the goal upon which the saints constantly
   fixed their gaze. They were fully persuaded that in this consists the
   entire perfection of the soul. Blessed Henry Suso used to say: "It is
   not God's will that we should abound in spiritual delights, but that in
   all things we should submit to his holy will [9] ." "Those who give
   themselves to prayer," says St. Teresa, "should concentrate solely on
   this: the conformity of their wills with the divine will. They should
   be convinced that this constitutes their highest perfection. The more
   fully they practice this, the greater the gifts they will receive from
   God, and the greater the progress they will make in the interior life
   [10] ." A certain Dominican nun was vouchsafed a vision of heaven one
   day. She recognized there some persons she had known during their
   mortal life on earth. It was told her these souls were raised to the
   sublime heights of the seraphs on account of the uniformity of their
   wills with that of God's during their lifetime here on earth. Blessed
   Henry Suso, mentioned above, said of himself: "I would rather be the
   vilest worm on earth by God's will, than be a seraph by my own [11] ."

   During our sojourn in this world, we should learn from the saints now
   in heaven, how to love God. The pure and perfect love of God they enjoy
   there, consists in uniting themselves perfectly to his will. It would
   be the greatest delight of the seraphs to pile up sand on the seashore
   or to pull weeds in a garden for all eternity, if they found out such
   was God's will. Our Lord himself teaches us to ask to do the will of
   God on earth as the saints do it in heaven: "Thy will be done on earth
   as it is in heaven [12] ."

   Because David fulfilled all his wishes, God called him a man after his
   own heart: "I have found David . . . a man according to my own heart,
   who shall do all my wills [13] ." David was always ready to embrace the
   divine will, as he frequently protested: "My heart is ready, O God, my
   heart is ready [14] ." He asked God for one thing alone--to teach him
   to do his will: "Teach me to do thy will [15] ."

   A single act of uniformity with the divine will suffices to make a
   saint. Behold while Saul was persecuting the Church, God enlightened
   him and converted him. What does Saul do? What does he say? Nothing
   else but to offer himself to do God's will: "Lord, what wilt thou have
   me to do [16] ?" In return the Lord calls him a vessel of election and
   an apostle of the gentiles: "This man is to me a vessel of election, to
   carry my name before the gentiles [17] ." Absolutely true--because he
   who gives his will to God, gives him everything. He who gives his goods
   in alms, his blood in scourgings, his food in fasting, gives God what
   he has. But he who gives God his will, gives himself, gives everything
   he is. Such a one can say: "Though I am poor, Lord, I give thee all I
   possess; but when I say I give thee my will, I have nothing left to
   give thee." This is just what God does require of us: "My son, give me
   thy heart [18] ." St. Augustine's comment is: "There is nothing more
   pleasing we can offer God than to say to him: Possess thyself of us'
   [19] ." We cannot offer God anything more pleasing than to say: Take
   us, Lord, we give thee our entire will. Only let us know thy will and
   we will carry it out.

   If we would completely rejoice the heart of God, let us strive in all
   things to conform ourselves to his divine will. Let us not only strive
   to conform ourselves, but also to unite ourselves to whatever
   dispositions God makes of us. Conformity signifies that we join our
   wills to the will of God. Uniformity means more--it means that we make
   one will of God's will and ours, so that we will only what God wills;
   that God's will alone, is our will. This is the summit of perfection
   and to it we should always aspire; this should be the goal of all our
   works, desires, meditations and prayers. To this end we should always
   invoke the aid of our holy patrons, our guardian angels, and above all,
   of our mother Mary, the most perfect of all the saints because she most
   perfectly embraced the divine will.

                          2. Uniformity in all Things.

   The essence of perfection is to embrace the will of God in all things,
   prosperous or adverse. In prosperity, even sinners find it easy to
   unite themselves to the divine will; but it takes saints to unite
   themselves to God's will when things go wrong and are painful to
   self-love. Our conduct in such instances is the measure of our love of
   God. St. John of Avila used to say: "One Blessed be God' in times of
   adversity, is worth more than a thousand acts of gratitude in times of
   prosperity [20] ."

   Furthermore, we must unite ourselves to God's will not only in things
   that come to us directly from his hands, such as sickness, desolation,
   poverty, death of relatives, but likewise in those we suffer from
   man--for example, contempt, injustice, loss of reputation, loss of
   temporal goods and all kinds of persecution. On these occasions we must
   remember that whilst God does not will the sin, he does will our
   humiliation, our poverty, or our mortification, as the case may be. It
   is certain and of faith, that whatever happens, happens by the will of
   God: "I am the Lord forming the light and creating the darkness, making
   peace and creating evil [21] ." From God come all things, good as well
   as evil. We call adversities evil; actually they are good and
   meritorious, when we receive them as coming from God's hands: "Shall
   there be evil in a city which the Lord hath not done [22] ?" "Good
   things and evil, life and death, poverty and riches are from God [23]
   ."

   It is true, when one offends us unjustly, God does not will his sin,
   nor does he concur in the sinner's bad will; but God does, in a general
   way, concur in the material action by which such a one strikes us, robs
   us or does us an injury, so that God certainly wills the offense we
   suffer and it comes to us from his hands. Thus the Lord told David he
   would be the author of those things he would suffer at the hands of
   Absalom: "I will raise up evils against thee out of thy own house, and
   I will take thy wives before thy face and give them to thy neighbor
   [24] ." Hence too God told the Jews that in punishment for their sins,
   he would send the Assyrians to plunder them and spread destruction
   among them: "The Assyrian is the rod and staff of my anger . . . I will
   send him to take away the spoils [25] ." "Assyrian wickedness served as
   God's scourge for the Hebrews [26] is St. Augustine's comment on this
   text. And our Lord himself told St. Peter that his sacred passion came
   not so much from man as from his Father: "The chalice which my Father
   hath given me, shall I not drink it [27] ?"

   When the messenger came to announce to Job that the Sabeans had
   plundered his goods and slain his children, he said: "The Lord gave and
   the Lord taketh away [28] ." He did not say: "The Lord hath given me my
   children and my possessions, and the Sabeans have taken them away." He
   realized that adversity had come upon him by the will of God. Therefore
   he added: "As it hath pleased the Lord, so is it done. Blessed be the
   name of the Lord [29] ." We must not therefore consider the afflictions
   that come upon us as happening by chance or solely from the malice of
   men; we should be convinced that what happens, happens by the will of
   God. Apropos of this it is related that two martyrs, Epictetus and
   Atho, being put to the torture by having their bodies raked with iron
   hooks and burnt with flaming torches, kept repeating: "Work thy will
   upon us, O Lord." Arrived at the place of execution, they exclaimed:
   "Eternal God, be thou blessed in that thy will has been entirely
   accomplished in us [30] ."

   Cesarius points up what we have been saying by offering this incident
   in the life of a certain monk: Externally his religious observance was
   the same as that of the other monks, but he had attained such sanctity
   that the mere touch of his garments healed the sick. Marveling at these
   deeds, since his life was no more exemplary than the lives of the other
   monks, the superior asked him one day what was the cause of these
   miracles.

   He replied that he too was mystified and was at a loss how to account
   for such happenings. "What devotions do you practice?" asked the abbot.
   He answered that there was little or nothing special that he did beyond
   making a great deal of willing only what God willed, and that God had
   given him the grace of abandoning his will totally to the will of God.

   "Prosperity does not lift me up, nor adversity cast me down," added the
   monk. "I direct all my prayers to the end that God's will may be done
   fully in me and by me." "That raid that our enemies made against the
   monastery the other day, in which our stores were plundered, our
   granaries put to the torch and our cattle driven off --did not this
   misfortune cause you any resentment?" queried the abbot.

   "No, Father," came the reply. "On the contrary, I returned thanks to
   God--as is my custom in such circumstances--fully persuaded that God
   does all things, or permits all that happens, for his glory and for our
   greater good; thus I am always at peace, no matter what happens."
   Seeing such uniformity with the will of God, the abbot no longer
   wondered why the monk worked so many miracles [31] .

                 3. Happiness deriving from perfect Uniformity.

   Acting according to this pattern, one not only becomes holy but also
   enjoys perpetual serenity in this life. Alphonsus the Great, King of
   Aragon, being asked one day whom he considered the happiest person in
   the world, answered: "He who abandons himself to the will of God and
   accepts all things, prosperous and adverse, as coming from his hands
   [32] ." "To those that love God, all things work together unto good
   [33] " Those who love God are always happy, because their whole
   happiness is to fulfill, even in adversity, the will of God.
   Afflictions do not mar their serenity, because by accepting misfortune,
   they know they give pleasure to their beloved Lord: "Whatever shall
   befall the just man, it shall not make him sad [34] ." Indeed, what can
   be more satisfactory to a person than to experience the fulfillment of
   all his desires? This is the happy lot of the man who wills only what
   God wills, because everything that happens, save sin, happens through
   the will of God.

   There is a story to this effect in the "Lives of the Fathers" about a
   farmer whose crops were more plentiful than those of his neighbors. On
   being asked how this happened with such unvarying regularity, he said
   he was not surprised because he always had the kind of weather he
   wanted. He was asked to explain. He said: "It is so because I want
   whatever kind of weather God wants, and because I do, he gives me the
   harvests I want [35] ." If souls resigned to God's will are humiliated,
   says Salvian [36] , they want to be humiliated; if they are poor, they
   want to be poor; in short, whatever happens is acceptable to them,
   hence they are truly at peace in this life. In cold and heat, in rain
   and wind, the soul united to God says: "I want it to be warm, to be
   cold, windy, to rain, because God wills it."

   This is the beautiful freedom of the sons of God, and it is worth
   vastly more than all the rank and distinction of blood and birth, more
   than all the kingdoms in the world. This is the abiding peace which, in
   the experience of the saints, "surpasseth all understanding [37] ." It
   surpasses all pleasures rising from gratification of the senses, from
   social gatherings, banquets and other worldly amusements; vain and
   deceiving as they are, they captivate the senses for the time being,
   but bring no lasting contentment; rather they afflict man in the depth
   of his soul where alone true peace can reside.

   Solomon, who tasted to satiety all the pleasures of the world and found
   them bitter, voiced his disillusionment thus: "But this also is vanity
   and vexation of spirit [38] ." "A fool,"says the Holy Spirit, "is
   changed as the moon; but a holy man continueth in wisdom as the sun
   [39] ." The fool, that is, the sinner, is as changeable as the moon,
   which today waxes and tomorrow wanes; today he laughs, tomorrow he
   cries; today he is meek as a lamb, tomorrow cross as a bear. Why?
   Because his peace of mind depends on the prosperity or the adversity he
   meets; he changes with the changes in the things that happen to him.
   The just man is like the sun, constant in his serenity, no matter what
   betides him. His calmness of soul is founded on his union with the will
   of God; hence he enjoys unruffled peace. This is the peace promised by
   the angel of the Nativity: "And on earth, peace to men of good will
   [40] ." Who are these "men of good will" if not those whose wills are
   united to the infinitely good and perfect will of God? "The good, and
   the acceptable, and the perfect will of God [41] ."

   By uniting themselves to the divine will, the saints have enjoyed
   paradise by anticipation in this life. Accustoming themselves to
   receive all things from the hands of God, says St. Dorotheus [42] , the
   men of old maintained continual serenity of soul. St. Mary Magdalene of
   Pazzi derived such consolation at hearing the words "will of God," that
   she usually fell into an ecstasy of love [43] . The instances of
   jangling irritation that are bound to arise will not fail to make
   surface impact on the senses. This however will be experienced only in
   the inferior part of the soul; in the superior part will reign peace
   and tranquillity as long as our will remains united with God's. Our
   Lord assured his apostles: "Your joy no man shall take from you . . .
   Your joy shall be full [44] ." He who unites his will to God's
   experiences a full and lasting joy: full, because he has what he wants,
   as was explained above; lasting, because no one can take his joy from
   him, since no one can prevent what God wills from happening.

   The devout Father John Tauler [45] relates this personal experience:
   For years he had prayed God to send him someone who would teach him the
   real spiritual life. One day, at prayer, he heard a voice saying: "Go
   to such and such a church and you will have the answer to your
   prayers." He went and at the door of the church he found a beggar,
   barefooted and in rags. He greeted the mendicant saying: "Good day, my
   friend."

   "Thank you, sir, for your kind wishes, but I do not recall ever having
   had a bad' day."

   "Then God has certainly given you a very happy life."

   "That is very true, sir. I have never been unhappy. In saying this I am
   not making any rash statement either. This is the reason: When I have
   nothing to eat, I give thanks to God; when it rains or snows, I bless
   God's providence; when someone insults me, drives me away, or otherwise
   mistreats me, I give glory to God. I said I've never had an unhappy
   day, and it's the truth, because I am accustomed to will unreservedly
   what God wills. Whatever happens to me, sweet or bitter, I gladly
   receive from his hands as what is best for me. Hence my unvarying
   happiness."

   "Where did you find God?"

   "I found him where I left creatures."

   "Who are you anyway?"

   "I am a king."

   "And where is your kingdom?"

   "In my soul, where everything is in good order; where the passions obey
   reason, and reason obeys God."

   "How have you come to such a state of perfection?"

   "By silence. I practice silence towards men, while I cultivate the
   habit of speaking with God. Conversing with God is the way I found and
   maintain my peace of soul."

   Union with God brought this poor beggar to the very heights of
   perfection. In his poverty he was richer than the mightiest monarch; in
   his sufferings, he was vastly happier than worldlings amid their
   worldly delights.

                             4. God wills our Good.

   O the supreme folly of those who resist the divine will! In God's
   providence, no one can escape hardship: "Who resisteth his will [46] ?"
   A person who rails at God in adversity, suffers without merit; moreover
   by his lack of resignation he adds to his punishment in the next life
   and experiences greater disquietude of mind in this life: "Who
   resisteth him and hath had peace [47] ?" The screaming rage of the sick
   man in his pain, the whining complaints of the poor man in his
   destitution--what will they avail these people, except increase their
   unhappiness and bring them no relief? "Little man," says St. Augustine,
   "grow up. What are you seeking in your search for happiness? Seek the
   one good that embraces all others [48] ." Whom do you seek, friend, if
   you seek not God? Seek him, find him, cleave to him; bind your will to
   his with bands of steel and you will live always at peace in this life
   and in the next.

   God wills only our good; God loves us more than anybody else can or
   does love us. His will is that no one should lose his soul, that
   everyone should save and sanctify his soul: "Not willing that any
   should perish, but that all should return to penance [49] ." "This is
   the will of God, your sanctification [50] ." God has made the
   attainment of our happiness, his glory. Since he is by his nature
   infinite goodness, and since as St. Leo [51] says goodness is diffusive
   of itself, God has a supreme desire to make us sharers of his goods and
   of his happiness. If then he sends us suffering in this life, it is for
   our own good: "All things work together unto good [52] ." Even
   chastisements come to us, not to crush us, but to make us mend our ways
   and save our souls: "Let us believe that these scourges of the Lord
   have happened for our amendment and not for our destruction [53] ."

   God surrounds us with his loving care lest we suffer eternal damnation:
   "O Lord, thou hast crowned us as with a shield of thy good will [54] ."
   He is most solicitous for our welfare: "The Lord is solicitous for me
   [55] ." What can God deny us when he has given us his own son? "He that
   spared not even his own son, but delivered him up for us all, how hath
   he not also, with him, given us all things [56] ?" Therefore we should
   most confidently abandon ourselves to all the dispositions of divine
   providence, since they are for our own good. In all that happens to us,
   let us say: "In peace, in the self same I will sleep, and I will rest:
   Because thou, O Lord, hast singularly settled me in hope [57] ."

   Let us place ourselves unreservedly in his hands because he will not
   fail to have care of us: "Casting all your care upon him, for he hath
   care of you [58] ." Let us keep God in our thoughts and carry out his
   will, and he will think of us and of our welfare. Our Lord said to St.
   Catherine of Siena, "Daughter, think of me, and I will always think of
   you." Let us often repeat with the Spouse in the Canticle: "My beloved
   to me, and I to him [59] ."

   St. Niles, abbot, used to say that our petitions should be, not that
   our wishes be done, but that God's holy will should be fulfilled in us
   and by us. When, therefore, something adverse happens to us, let us
   accept it from his hands, not only patiently, but even with gladness,
   as did the apostles "who went from the presence of the council
   rejoicing, that they were accounted worthy to suffer for the name of
   Jesus [60] ." What greater consolation can come to a soul than to know
   that by patiently bearing some tribulation, it gives God the greatest
   pleasure in its power? Spiritual writers tell us that though the desire
   of certain souls to please God by their sufferings is acceptable to
   him, still more pleasing to him is the union of certain others with his
   will, so that their will is neither to rejoice nor to suffer, but to
   hold themselves completely amenable to his will, and they desire only
   that his holy will be fulfilled.

   If, devout soul, it is your will to please God and live a life of
   serenity in this world, unite yourself always and in all things to the
   divine will. Reflect that all the sins of your past wicked life
   happened because you wandered from the path of God's will. For the
   future, embrace God's good pleasure and say to him in every happening:
   "Yea, Father, for so it hath seemed good in thy sight [61] ." When
   anything disagreeable happens, remember it comes from God and say at
   once, "This comes from God" and be at peace: "I was dumb and opened not
   my mouth, because thou hast done it." Lord, since thou hast done this,
   I will be silent and accept it. Direct all your thoughts and prayers to
   this end, to beg God constantly in meditation, Communion, and visits to
   the Blessed Sacrament that he help you accomplish his holy will. Form
   the habit of offering yourself frequently to God by saying, "My God,
   behold me in thy presence; do with me and all that I have as thou
   pleasest." This was the constant practice of St. Teresa. At least fifty
   times a day she offered herself to God, placing herself at his entire
   disposition and good pleasure.

   How fortunate you, kind reader, if you too act thus! You will surely
   become a saint. Your life will be calm and peaceful; your death will be
   happy. At death all our hope of salvation will come from the testimony
   of our conscience as to whether or not we are dying resigned to God's
   will. If during life we have embraced everything as coming from God's
   hands, and if at death we embrace death in fulfillment of God's holy
   will, we shall certainly save our souls and die the death of saints.
   Let us then abandon everything to God's good pleasure, because being
   infinitely wise, he knows what is best for us; and being all-good and
   all-loving --having given his life for us--he wills what is best for
   us. Let us, as St. Basil counsels us, rest secure in the conviction
   that beyond the possibility of a doubt, God works to effect our
   welfare, infinitely better than we could ever hope to accomplish or
   desire it ourselves.

                      5. Special Practices of Uniformity.

   Let us now take up in a practical way the consideration of those
   matters in which we should unite ourselves to God's will.

   1. In external matters. In times of great heat, cold or rain; in times
   of famine, epidemics and similar occasions we should refrain from
   expressions like these: "What unbearable heat!" "What piercing cold!"
   "What a tragedy!" In these instances we should avoid expressions
   indicating opposition to God's will. We should want things to be just
   as they are, because it is God who thus disposes them. An incident in
   point would be this one: Late one night St. Francis Borgia arrived
   unexpectedly at a Jesuit house, in a snowstorm. He knocked and knocked
   on the door, but all to no purpose because the community being asleep,
   no one heard him. When morning came all were embarrassed for the
   discomfort he had experienced by having had to spend the night in the
   open. The saint, however, said he had enjoyed the greatest consolation
   during those long hours of the night by imagining that he saw our Lord
   up in the sky dropping the snowflakes down upon him.

   2. In personal matters. In matters that affect us personally, let us
   acquiesce in God's will. For example, in hunger, thirst, poverty,
   desolation, loss of reputation, let us always say: "Do thou build up or
   tear down, O Lord, as seems good in thy sight. I am content. I wish
   only what thou dost wish." Thus too, says Rodriguez, should we act when
   the devil proposes certain hypothetical cases to us in order to wrest a
   sinful consent from us, or at least to cause us to be interiorly
   disturbed. For example: "What would you say or what would you do if
   some one were to say or do such and such a thing to you?" Let us
   dismiss the temptation by saying: "By God's grace, I would say or do
   what God would want me to say or do." Thus we shall free ourselves from
   imperfection and harassment.

   3. Let us not lament if we suffer from some natural defect of body or
   mind; from poor memory, slowness of understanding, little ability,
   lameness or general bad health. What claim have we, or what obligation
   is God under, to give us a more brilliant mind or a more robust body?
   Who is ever offered a gift and then lays down the conditions upon which
   he will accept it? Let us thank God for what, in his pure goodness, he
   has given us and let us be content too with the manner in which he has
   given it to us.

   Who knows? Perhaps if God had given us greater talent, better health, a
   more personable appearance, we might have lost our souls! Great talent
   and knowledge have caused many to be puffed up with the idea of their
   own importance and, in their pride, they have despised others. How
   easily those who have these gifts fall into grave danger to their
   salvation! How many on account of physical beauty or robust health have
   plunged headlong into a life of debauchery! How many, on the contrary,
   who, by reason of poverty, infirmity or physical deformity, have become
   saints and have saved their souls, who, given health, wealth or
   physical attractiveness had else lost their souls! Let us then be
   content with what God has given us. "But one thing is necessary [62] ,"
   and it is not beauty, not health, not talent. It is the salvation of
   our immortal souls.

   4. It is especially necessary that we be resigned in corporal
   infirmities. We should willingly embrace them in the manner and for the
   length of time that God wills. We ought to make use of the ordinary
   remedies in time of sickness-- such is God's will; but if they are not
   effective, let us unite ourselves to God's will and this will be better
   for us than would be our restoration to health. Let us say: "Lord, I
   wish neither to be well nor to remain sick; I want only what thou
   wilt." Certainly, it is more virtuous not to repine in times of painful
   illness; still and all, when our sufferings are excessive, it is not
   wrong to let our friends know what we are enduring, and also to ask God
   to free us from our sufferings. Let it be understood, however, that the
   sufferings here referred to are actually excessive. It often happens
   that some, on the occasion of a slight illness, or even a slight
   indisposition, want the whole world to stand still and sympathize with
   them in their illnesses.

   But where it is a case of real suffering, we have the example of our
   Lord, who, at the approach of his bitter passion, made known his state
   of soul to his disciples, saying: "My soul is sorrowful even unto death
   [63] " and besought his eternal Father to deliver him from it: "Father,
   if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me [64] ." But our Lord
   likewise taught us what we should do when we have made such a petition,
   when he added: "Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt [65] ."

   How childish the pretense of those who protest they wish for health not
   to escape suffering, but to serve our Lord better by being able to
   observe their Rule, to serve the community, go to church, receive
   Communion, do penance, study, work for souls in the confessional and
   pulpit! Devout soul, tell me, why do you desire to do these things? To
   please God? Why then search any further to please God when you are sure
   God does not wish these prayers, Communions, penances or studies, but
   he does wish that you suffer patiently this sickness he sends you?
   Unite then your sufferings to those of our Lord.

   "But," you say, "I do not want to be sick for then I am useless, a
   burden to my Order, to my monastery." But if you are united to and
   resigned to God's will, you will realize that your superiors are
   likewise resigned to the dispositions of divine providence, and that
   they recognize the fact that you are a burden, not through indolence,
   but by the will of God. Ah, how often these desires and these laments
   are born, not of the love of God, but of the love of self! How many of
   them are so many pretexts for fleeing the will of God! Do we want to
   please God? When we find ourselves confined to our sickbed, let us
   utter this one prayer: "Thy will be done." Let us repeat it time and
   time again and it will please God more than all our mortifications and
   devotions. There is no better way to serve God than cheerfully to
   embrace his holy will.

   St. John of Avila once wrote to a sick priest: "My dear friend,--Do not
   weary yourself planning what you would do if you were well, but be
   content to be sick for as long as God wishes. If you are seeking to
   carry out God's will, what difference should it make to you whether you
   are sick or well [66] ?" The saint was perfectly right, for God is
   glorified not by our works, but by our resignation to, and by our union
   with, his holy will. In this respect St. Francis de Sales used to say
   we serve God better by our sufferings than by our actions.

   Many times it will happen that proper medical attention or effective
   remedies will be lacking, or even that the doctor will not rightly
   diagnose our case. In such instances we must unite ourselves to the
   divine will which thus disposes of our physical health. The story is
   told of a client of St. Thomas of Canterbury, who being sick, went to
   the saint's tomb to obtain a cure. He returned home cured. But then he
   thought to himself: "Suppose it would be better for my soul's salvation
   if I remained sick, what point then is there in being well?" In this
   frame of mind he went back and asked the saint to intercede with God
   that he grant what would be best for his eternal salvation. His illness
   returned and he was perfectly content with the turn things had taken,
   being fully persuaded that God had thus disposed of him for his own
   good.

   There is a similar account by Surio to the effect that a certain blind
   man obtained the restoration of his sight by praying to St. Bedasto,
   bishop. Thinking the matter over, he prayed again to his heavenly
   patron, but this time with the purpose that if the possession of his
   sight were not expedient for his soul, that his blindness should
   return. And that is exactly what happened--he was blind again.
   Therefore, in sickness it is better that we seek neither sickness nor
   health, but that we abandon ourselves to the will of God so that he may
   dispose of us as he wishes. However, if we decide to ask for health,
   let us do so at least always resigned and with the proviso that our
   bodily health may be conducive to the health of our soul. Otherwise our
   prayer will be defective and will remain unheard because our Lord does
   not answer prayers made without resignation to his holy will.

   Sickness is the acid test of spirituality, because it discloses whether
   our virtue is real or sham. If the soul is not agitated, does not break
   out in lamentations, is not feverishly restless in seeking a cure, but
   instead is submissive to the doctors and to superiors, is serene and
   tranquil, completely resigned to God's will, it is a sign that that
   soul is well-grounded in virtue.

   What of the whiner who complains of lack of attention? That his
   sufferings are beyond endurance? That the doctor does not know his
   business? What of the faint-hearted soul who laments that the hand of
   God is too heavy upon him?

   This story by St. Bonaventure in his "Life of St. Francis" is in point:
   On a certain occasion when the saint was suffering extraordinary
   physical pain, one of his religious meaning to sympathize with him,
   said in his simplicity: "My Father, pray God that he treat you a little
   more gently, for his hand seems heavy upon you just now." Hearing this,
   St. Francis strongly resented the unhappy remark of his well-meaning
   brother, saying: "My good brother, did I not know that what you have
   just said was spoken in all simplicity, without realizing the
   implication of your words, I should never see you again because of your
   rashness in passing judgment on the dispositions of divine providence."
   Whereupon, weak and wasted as he was by his illness, he got out of bed,
   knelt down, kissed the floor and prayed thus: "Lord, I thank thee for
   the sufferings thou art sending me. Send me more, if it be thy good
   pleasure. My pleasure is that you afflict me and spare me not, for the
   fulfillment of thy holy will is the greatest consolation of my life."

                            6. Spiritual Desolation.

   We ought to view in the light of God's holy will, the loss of persons
   who are helpful to us in a spiritual or material way. Pious souls often
   fail in this respect by not being resigned to the dispositions of God's
   holy will. Our sanctification comes fundamentally and essentially from
   God, not from spiritual directors. When God sends us a spiritual
   director, he wishes us to use him for our spiritual profit; but if he
   takes him away, he wants us to remain calm and unperturbed and to
   increase our confidence in his goodness by saying to him: "Lord, thou
   hast given me this help and now thou dost take it away. Blessed be thy
   holy will! I beg thee, teach me what I must do to serve thee."

   In this manner too, we should receive whatever other crosses God sends
   us. "But," you reply, "these sufferings are really punishments." The
   answer to that remark is: Are not the punishments God sends us in this
   life also graces and benefits? Our offenses against God must be atoned
   for somehow, either in this life or in the next. Hence we should all
   make St. Augustine's prayer our own: "Lord, here cut, here burn and
   spare me not, but spare me in eternity!" Let us say with Job: "Let this
   be my comfort, that afflicting me with sorrow, he spare not [67] ."
   Having merited hell for our sins, we should be consoled that God
   chastises us in this life, and animate ourselves to look upon such
   treatment as a pledge that God wishes to spare us in the next. When God
   sends us punishments let us say with the high-priest Heli: "It is the
   Lord, let him do what is good in his sight [68] ."

   The time of spiritual desolation is also a time for being resigned.
   When a soul begins to cultivate the spiritual life, God usually showers
   his consolations upon her to wean her away from the world; but when he
   sees her making solid progress, he withdraws his hand to test her and
   to see if she will love and serve him without the reward of sensible
   consolations. "In this life," as St. Teresa used to say, "our lot is
   not to enjoy God, but to do his holy will." And again, "Love of God
   does not consist in experiencing his tendernesses, but in serving him
   with resolution and humility." And in yet another place, "God's true
   lovers are discovered in times of aridity and temptation."

   Let the soul thank God when she experiences his loving endearments, but
   let her not repine when she finds herself left in desolation. It is
   important to lay great stress on this point, because some souls,
   beginners in the spiritual life, finding themselves in spiritual
   aridity, think God has abandoned them, or that the spiritual life is
   not for them; thus they give up the practice of prayer and lose what
   they have previously gained. The time of aridity is the best time to
   practice resignation to God's holy will. I do not say you will feel no
   pain in seeing yourself deprived of the sensible presence of God; it is
   impossible for the soul not to feel it and lament over it, when even
   our Lord cried out on the cross: "My God, my God, why hast thou
   forsaken me [69] ?" In her sufferings, however, the soul should always
   be resigned to God's will.

   The saints have all experienced desolations and abandonment of soul.
   "How impervious to things spiritual, my heart!" cries a St. Bernard.
   "No savor in pious reading, no pleasure in meditation nor in prayer!"
   For the most part it has been the common lot of the saints to encounter
   aridities; sensible consolations were the exceptions. Such things are
   rare occurrences granted to untried souls so that they may not halt on
   the road to sanctity; the real delights and happiness that will
   constitute their reward are reserved for heaven. This earth is a place
   of merit which is acquired by suffering; heaven is a place of reward
   and happiness. Hence, in this life the saints neither desired nor
   sought the joys of sensible fervor, but rather the fervor of the spirit
   toughened in the crucible of suffering. "O how much better it is," says
   St. John of Avila, "to endure aridity and temptation by God's will than
   to be raised to the heights of contemplation without God's will!"

   But you say you would gladly endure desolation if you were certain that
   it comes from God, but you are tortured by the anxiety that your
   desolation comes by your own fault and is a punishment for your
   tepidity. Very well, let us suppose you are right; then get rid of your
   tepidity and exercise more diligence in the affairs of your soul. But
   because you are possibly experiencing spiritual darkness, are you going
   to get all wrought up, give up prayer, and thus make things twice as
   bad as they are?

   Let us assume that this aridity is a punishment for your tepidity. Was
   it not God who sent it? Accept your desolation, as your just desserts
   and unite yourself to God's holy will. Did you not say that you merited
   hell? And now you are complaining? Perhaps you think God should send
   you consolations! Away with such ideas and be patient under God's hand.
   Take up your prayers again and continue to walk in the way you have
   entered upon; for the future, fear lest such laments come from too
   little humility and too little resignation to the will of God.
   Therefore be resigned and say: "Lord, I accept this punishment from thy
   hands, and I accept it for as long as it pleases thee; if it be thy
   will that I should be thus afflicted for all eternity, I am satisfied."
   Such a prayer, though hard to make, will be far more advantageous to
   you than the sweetest sensible consolations.

   It is well to remember, however, that aridity is not always a
   chastisement; at times it is a disposition of divine providence for our
   greater spiritual profit and to keep us humble. Lest St. Paul become
   vain on account of the spiritual gifts he had received, the Lord
   permitted him to be tempted to impurity: "And lest the greatness of the
   revelations should exalt me, there was given me a sting of my flesh, an
   angel of Satan to buffet me [70] ."

   Prayer made amid sensible devotion is not much of an achievement:
   "There is a friend, a companion at the table, and he will not abide in
   the day of distress [71] ." You would not consider the casual guest at
   your table a friend, but only him who assists you in your need without
   thought of benefit to himself. When God sends spiritual darkness and
   desolation, his true friends are known.

   Palladius, the author of the "Lives of the Fathers of the Desert,"
   experiencing great disgust in prayer, went seeking advice from the
   abbot Macarius. The saintly abbot gave him this counsel: "When you are
   tempted in times of dryness to give up praying because you seem to be
   wasting your time, say: Since I cannot pray, I will be satisfied just
   to remain on watch here in my cell for the love of Jesus Christ!'
   "Devout soul, you do the same when you are tempted to give up prayer
   just because you seem to be getting nowhere. Say: "I am going to stay
   here just to please God." St. Francis de Sales used to say that if we
   do nothing else but banish distractions and temptations in our prayers,
   the prayer is well made. Tauler states that persevering prayer in time
   of dryness will receive greater grace than prayer made amid great
   sensible devotion.

   Rodriguez cites the case of a person who persevered forty years in
   prayer despite aridity, and experienced great spiritual strength as a
   result of it; on occasion, when through aridity he would omit
   meditation he felt spiritually weak and incapable of good deeds. St.
   Bonaventure and Gerson both say that persons who do not experience the
   recollection they would like to have in their meditations, often serve
   God better than they would do if they did have it; the reason is that
   lack of recollection keeps them more diligent and humble; otherwise
   they would become puffed up with spiritual pride and grow tepid, vainly
   believing they had reached the summit of sanctity.

   What has been said of dryness holds true of temptations also. Certainly
   we should strive to avoid temptations; but if God wishes that we be
   tempted against faith, purity, or any other virtue, we should not give
   in to discouraging lamentations, but submit ourselves with resignation
   to God's holy will. St. Paul asked to be freed from temptations to
   impurity and our Lord answered him, saying: "My grace is sufficient for
   thee [72] ."

   So should we act when we find ourselves victims of unrelenting
   temptations and God seemingly deaf to our prayers. Let us then say:
   "Lord, do with me, let happen to me what thou wilt; thy grace is
   sufficient for me. Only never let me lose this grace." Consent to
   temptation, not temptation of itself, can make us lose the grace of
   God. Temptation resisted keeps us humble, brings us greater merit,
   makes us have frequent recourse to God, thus preserving us from
   offending him and unites us more closely to him in the bonds of his
   holy love.

   Finally, we should be united to God's will in regard to the time and
   manner of our death. One day St. Gertrude, while climbing up a small
   hill, lost her footing and fell into a ravine below. After her
   companions had come to her assistance, they asked her if while falling
   she had any fear of dying without the sacraments. "I earnestly hope and
   desire to have the benefit of the sacraments when death is at hand;
   still, to my way of thinking, the will of God is more important. I
   believe that the best disposition I could have to die a happy death
   would be to submit myself to whatever God would wish in my regard. For
   this reason I desire whatever kind of death God will be pleased to send
   me."

   In his "Dialogues", St. Gregory [73] tells of a certain priest, Santolo
   by name, who was captured by the Vandals and condemned to death. The
   barbarians told him to choose the manner of his death. He refused,
   saying: "I am in God's hands and I gladly accept whatever kind of death
   he wishes me to suffer at your hands; I wish no other." This reply was
   so pleasing to God that he miraculously stayed the hand of the
   executioner ready to behead him. The barbarians were so impressed by
   the miracle that they freed their prisoner. As regards the manner of
   our death, therefore, we should esteem that the best kind of death for
   us which God has designed for us. When therefore we think of our death,
   let our prayer be: "O Lord, only let me save my soul and I leave the
   manner of my death to thee!"

   We should likewise unite ourselves to God's will when the moment of
   death is near. What else is this earth but a prison where we suffer and
   where we are in constant danger of losing God? Hence David prayed:
   "Bring my soul out of prison [74] ." St. Teresa too feared to lose God
   and when she would hear the striking of the clock, she would find
   consolation in the thought that the passing of the hour was an hour
   less of the danger of losing God.

   St. John of Avila was convinced that every right-minded person should
   desire death on account of living in peril of losing divine grace. What
   can be more pleasant or desirable than by dying a good death, to have
   the assurance of no longer being able to lose the grace of God? Perhaps
   you will answer that you have as yet done nothing to deserve this
   reward. If it were God's will that your life should end now, what would
   you be doing, living on here against his will? Who knows, you might
   fall into sin and be lost! Even if you escaped mortal sin, you could
   not live free from all sin. "Why are we so tenacious of life," exclaims
   St. Bernard, "when the longer we live, the more we sin [75] ?" A single
   venial sin is more displeasing to God than all the good works we can
   perform.

   Moreover, the person who has little desire for heaven shows he has
   little love for God. The true lover desires to be with his beloved. We
   cannot see God while we remain here on earth; hence the saints have
   yearned for death so that they might go and behold their beloved Lord,
   face to face. "Oh, that I might die and behold thy beautiful face!"
   sighed St. Augustine. And St. Paul: "Having a desire to be dissolved
   and to be with Christ [76] ." "When shall I come and appear before the
   face of God [77] ?"exclaimed the psalmist.

   A hunter one day heard the voice of a man singing most sweetly in the
   forest. Following the sound, he came upon a leper horribly disfigured
   by the ravages of his disease. Addressing him he said: "How can you
   sing when you are so terribly afflicted and your death is so near at
   hand?" And the leper: "Friend, my poor body is a crumbling wall and it
   is the only thing that separates me from my God. When it falls I shall
   go forth to God. Time for me is indeed fast running out, so every day I
   show my happiness by lifting my voice in song."

   Lastly, we should unite ourselves to the will of God as regards our
   degree of grace and glory. True, we should esteem the things that make
   for the glory of God, but we should show the greatest esteem for those
   that concern the will of God. We should desire to love God more than
   the seraphs, but not to a degree higher than God has destined for us.
   St. John of Avila [78] says: "I believe every saint has had the desire
   to be higher in grace than he actually was. However, despite this,
   their serenity of soul always remained unruffled. Their desire for a
   greater degree of grace sprang not from a consideration of their own
   good, but of God's. They were content with the degree of grace God had
   meted out for them, though actually God had given them less. They
   considered it a greater sign of true love of God to be content with
   what God had given them, than to desire to have received more."

   This means, as Rodriguez explains it, we should be diligent in striving
   to become perfect, so that tepidity and laziness may not serve as
   excuses for some to say: "God must help me; I can do only so much for
   myself." Nevertheless, when we do fall into some fault, we should not
   lose our peace of soul and union with the will of God, which permits
   our fall; nor should we lose our courage. Let us rise at once from this
   fall, penitently humbling ourselves and by seeking greater help from
   God, let us continue to march resolutely on the highway of the
   spiritual life. Likewise, we may well desire to be among the seraphs in
   heaven, not for our own glory, but for God's, and to love him more;
   still we should be resigned to his will and be content with that degree
   of glory which in his mercy he has set for us.

   It would be a serious defect to desire the gifts of supernatural
   prayer--specifically, ecstasies, visions and revelations. The masters
   of the spiritual life say that souls thus favored by God, should ask
   him to take them away so that they may love him out of pure faith--a
   way of greater security. Many have come to perfection without these
   supernatural gifts; the only virtues worth-while are those that draw
   the soul to holiness of life, namely, the virtue of uniformity with
   God's holy will. If God does not wish to raise us to the heights of
   perfection and glory, let us unite ourselves in all things to his holy
   will, asking him in his mercy, to grant us our soul's salvation. If we
   act in this manner, the reward will not be slight which we shall
   receive from the hands of God who loves above all others, souls
   resigned to his holy will.

                                 7. Conclusion.

   Finally we should consider the events which are happening to us now and
   which will happen to us in the future, as coming from the hands of God.
   Everything we do should be directed to this one end: to do the will of
   God and to do it solely for the reason that God wills it. To walk more
   securely on this road we must depend on the guidance of our superiors
   in external matters, and on our directors in internal matters, to learn
   from them God's will in our regard, having great faith in the words of
   our Lord: "He that heareth you, heareth me [79] ."

   Above all, let us bend all our energies to serve God in the way he
   wishes. This remark is made so that we may avoid the mistake of him who
   wastes his time in idle day-dreaming. Such a one says, "If I were to
   become a hermit, I would become a saint" or "If I were to enter a
   monastery, I would practice penance" or "If I were to go away from
   here, leaving friends and companions, I would devote long hours to
   prayer." If, If, If--all these if's! In the meantime such a person goes
   from bad to worse. These idle fancies are often temptations of the
   devil, because they are not in accord with God's will. Hence we should
   dismiss them summarily and rouse ourselves to serve God only in that
   way which he has marked out for us. Doing his holy will, we shall
   certainly become holy in those surroundings in which he has placed us.

   Let us will always and ever only what God wills; for so doing, he will
   press us to his heart. To this end let us familiarize ourselves with
   certain texts of sacred scripture that invite us to unite ourselves
   constantly with the divine will: "Lord, what wilt thou have me do [80]
   ?" Tell me, my God, what thou wilt have me do, that I may will it also,
   with all my heart. "I am thine, save thou me [81] ." I am no longer my
   own, I am thine, O Lord, do with me as thou wilt.

   If some particularly crashing misfortune comes upon us, for example,
   the death of a relative, loss of goods, let us say: "Yea, Father, for
   so it hath seemed good in thy sight [82] ." Yes, my God and my Father,
   so be it, for such is thy good pleasure. Above all, let us cherish that
   prayer of our Lord, which he himself taught us: "Thy will be done on
   earth as it is in heaven [83] ." Our Lord bade St. Catherine of Genoa
   to make a notable pause at these words whenever she said the Our
   Father, praying that God's holy will be fulfilled on earth with the
   same perfection with which the saints do it in heaven. Let this be our
   practice also, and we shall certainly become saints.

   May the divine will be loved and praised! May the Immaculate Virgin be
   also praised!
