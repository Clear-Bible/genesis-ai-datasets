PREFATORY NOTE.

   I HAD intended to enlarge this volume so as to embrace a special
   discussion of the Augustinian and subsequent developments of the
   Doctrine of Sin in the thought of the Church. I wished also to treat of
   the bearing on this doctrine of certain modern theories, from the
   Optimism of Leibnitz to the Pessimism of Schopenhauer and Hartmann. But
   the consideration of these later aspects of the subject must be
   deferred. It was deemed desirable that the present Lectures should
   appear without delay, and as much as possible in the form in which they
   were delivered. The volume answers to its title with sufficient
   distinctness; and although nothing new can be said on such a subject,
   the method of treatment may be found to have for readers something of
   the same interest that it had for the numerous hearers who attended the
   delivery of the Lectures.

  THE QUESTION OF SIN IN RELATION TO MODERN SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT--METHOD OF
  TREATMENT.

   THE subject which I have undertaken to discuss in these Lectures, if it
   cannot be said to lie at the foundation of Christian Theology, is more
   or less implied in the whole system of Christian doctrine. In itself it
   belongs to what in modern nomenclature is called Anthropology rather
   than Theology. It is a question, that is to say, respecting Man rather
   than God. But the Christian conception of God, and of God's action in
   the world, points throughout to man as a sinner. All the characteristic
   terms of Christian Theology--salvation, redemption, forgiveness,
   grace--indicate that there is a power of evil from which man needs to
   be saved, or which impedes his higher life. There can be no more
   important inquiry, therefore, than one into the reality and the meaning
   of this power of evil, which Christians call sin.

   It is interesting to trace, both in Theology and Philosophy, the
   interdependence of what may be called Anthropological and Theological
   questions. Man's conception of himself, of his own nature, is never
   separable from his higher conception of the Divine. He is really, even
   when his thoughts seem to wander furthest away or most aloft, the pivot
   round which they turn. What he is himself, or is supposed to be, gives
   the colour to all he thinks of Nature around him, and God above him.
   There never was a vainer effort than that so much vaunted at present of
   casting aside anthropological ideas. No more than man can strip himself
   of his nature can he strip his thought of the folds in which that
   nature enwraps it. There is a sense, and a right sense, in which man's
   thought of himself--what he is--must mould all his other thought,
   philosophical as well as theological.

   In the history of the Church this has been exemplified over and over
   again. A shallow conception of man's nature has always bred a shallow
   conception of the Divine nature. A meagre anthropology has for its
   counterpart a meagre theology. A Pelagian not merely denies the depth
   of human sin, but the profundities of the Divine action. And the same
   law of alternation or balance, if not always in the same marked degree,
   runs everywhere through the long line of the development of Christian
   thought.

   But the antithesis is not less marked in Philosophy. From the earliest
   dawn of speculation two sides everywhere appear, contrasted by their
   starting-point not less than by their results. It is the conception of
   man as a being not only mundane, but supra-mundane--as drawing his
   higher life from a higher source--which has alone given rise to a
   higher philosophy, or a Philosophy of Being. The conception of man as
   merely a consensus of external faculties has never risen above a
   philosophy of the senses. Nor could it be otherwise. Thought cannot,
   any more than water, rise higher than its source. And the thought that
   is solely earth-born, or the inheritance of mundane experiences, and
   nothing more--however subtilised or aspiring--can never bring any light
   from beyond its earthly home. We must start from a higher home, from a
   "heaven lying about us in our infancy," if we would ever reach a
   spiritual and higher line of thought at all. We cannot climb into an
   empty heaven. If we are not born with the "promise and potency" of the
   Divine, the "image of God," within us, then we shall never reach the
   Divine, earnestly as we may grope for it, and cast forth our loftiest
   thoughts to grasp it.

   The present turn of speculation once more strikingly illustrates this
   interdependence of thought on these great subjects. The favourite
   conceptions of modern science involve, if they do not start from, a
   definite view of human nature at variance with the old Biblical or
   spiritual view. Man is conceived as developed from lower forms of life
   by lengthened processes of natural selection. There is nothing
   necessarily inconsistent with an enlightened Christianity in this idea,
   so far. The Divine mind may work out its plans by processes of growth
   or adaptation as readily as by any other way. Nay, as it has been
   recently admitted by one of the most distinguished advocates of the
   modern idea, the teleological conception, or the conception of design,
   is prominently suggested rather than excluded by the theory of
   development as a mere modus operandi. But beyond question the chief
   advocates of this theory mean something very different. Nature is
   supposed by them to be not merely the sphere of operation, but the
   operating power itself--beyond which there is nothing. Man is not
   merely, like all other things, a natural growth, but he is nothing
   else. There is no higher Divine element in him. There is no such
   thing--or at least nothing that we can know or validly infer. Material
   facts and their relations or laws are all that we can ever know. It is
   this underlying sense of the theory which is at variance with the old
   Biblical view of human nature. It leaves, for example, no room for the
   idea of sin. For that which is solely a growth of nature cannot contain
   anything that is at variance with its own higher laws. It may show more
   or less perfect stages of growth, but it cannot contradict itself. If
   the individual and social man alike are merely the outcome of natural
   forces working endlessly forward towards higher and more complex forms,
   then whatever man is, he is not and cannot be a sinner. The mixed
   product of internal and external forces--of what is called organism and
   environment--he may be at certain stages of his progress very
   defective. It may require thousands of years to elevate him into a more
   complete existence. But he has not fallen below any ideal he might have
   reached. He has not wilfully rejected a good he might have known. He is
   only at any point what the sum of natural factors which enter into his
   being have made him. The two conceptions of sin and of development in
   this naturalistic sense cannot coexist. I cannot be the mere outcome of
   natural law, and yet accountable for the fact that I am no better than
   I am. If I am only the child of nature, I must be entitled to the
   privileges of nature. If I have come from matter alone, then. I cannot
   dwell within the shadow of a responsibility whose birthplace is
   elsewhere--in a different region altogether. And so the spirit of
   modern science is consistently non-Christian. A man who is nothing more
   than an aggregate of natural powers, can have no true vision
   transcending the range of these powers. The Unseen, or a law coming
   forth from the Unseen to rule his spirit, must be a mere superstition
   to him, and sin, as the violation of such a law, a mere gloomy phantom,
   to be got rid of the best way he can.

   These considerations may serve to show the importance of our subject,
   and how vitally it bears on the problems of modern thought. All these
   problems, and indeed the problems of thought in all ages, have
   circulated around two main modes of conceiving human nature--the one of
   which is spiritual, Biblical, and theistic, and the other natural,
   cosmical, and anti-theistic. These are the real antitheses which
   underlie all human speculation, and to which it always returns. It
   cannot help returning on the same line, after whatever show of
   discussion and argument, because the line is already predetermined by
   the starting-point. The conclusion on the one side or the other is
   everywhere involved in the original terms of the question. "That which
   is born of the flesh is flesh; that which is born of the spirit is
   spirit." The Democritic philosopher, whether of the ancient or a modern
   school, is already a materialist--the Platonist already a Platonist--in
   the very language with which they respectively open their inquiries.
   All depends upon the presupposition as to what man is with which they
   set out.

   The anthropological question, therefore, is really the primary question
   for all Philosophy, while the very possibility of a Theology hangs upon
   the answer given to it. If the answer be that of the modern scientific
   school, then the theological idea, or the idea of an extra-mundane
   sphere of which we can have any knowledge, disappears altogether. If
   nature round our life, and our processes of thought and action are all
   built up from without-the result, in their most subtle and lofty form,
   of material appliances-then anything beyond nature is imaginary. There
   is no room for the thought of God, or a sphere of divine action, or any
   element in us which derives meaning from this sphere. Theological
   dogmas vanish at a sweep, as a collection of mere shadows with which
   men have amused or tormented themselves. And this is clearly recognized
   by the modern scientific school, as an end at which they deliberately
   aim. Even earnest writers of this school have professed a wish that men
   would at length turn away from the contemplation of such shadows, and
   devote themselves to real work for the improvement of the world. What
   good might be done, they have virtually said, if only the intellectual
   enthusiasm and ability which are now wasted on theological questions
   were turned into the channel of scientific labour, and applied to the
   investigation of the realities of nature.[See [1]Appendix I.]

   But the theological spirit is irrepressible. It rises from the very
   bosom of the school which disowns it, and takes new and strange shapes
   in its strange home. However man may prize science and its results,
   apparently he cannot live on them. There is that in him which demands
   something more. There are powers within him which remain restless and
   unsatisfied-conditions of morality and social order which seem unable
   to stay themselves save on eternal and divine laws. [1] The final
   answer to such questions as have again been raised respecting the very
   idea of religion must be sought in a renewed study of man's whole
   nature. What really is man in his complex activity? Can he be explained
   by reference to the mere laws of cosmical progress? Are the forces seen
   working endlessly in nature below him adequate to account for all his
   life? Or are there not forces in him unaccountable on this hypothesis,
   and which relate him to a higher sphere, just as really as his senses
   and other natural organs relate him to the lower sphere? Is he, in
   short, an animal, at the best, however noble an animal; and are Mr.
   Darwin and others in the true line of explaining not merely his
   physical but his emotional and moral activities by reference to the
   nascent germs of these in the lower animals? Does the idea of gradual
   development from below give the key not merely to a part but to the
   whole of his nature, although many links of the development are
   acknowledged to be still obscure? Or is there really a higher life in
   man-forces of morality, aspiration, and devotion which make him in
   creation a "singular effect"--the image of a reasonable Power higher
   than his own, who has made him, and to whom he is subject? Is mind, in
   short, prior to matter, and not its mere evolution? And is the higher
   life of man the expression of a Higher Mind that has endowed him with
   intelligence, morality, and capacity of worship?

   It is impossible to get beyond this old antithesis lying at the
   foundation of all thought, and it is equally impossible to find a
   rational answer save in the study of man himself. If the naturalistic
   hypothesis can give an adequate account of man, then there is an end to
   the question. But not even the most extreme advocates of the hypothesis
   will venture to assert that they have approached the solution of man's
   mental, and still less of his moral, being along the line of lower
   life. Supposing that the fact of life were given them--and this in its
   very lowest forms they have failed to explain--they cannot confessedly
   find a passage from organic to conscious existence. The thread of
   evolution snaps asunder here. And even were they allowed to build on a
   basis of consciousness, they are powerless to erect thereon a moral
   structure. The moral life of humanity baffles all attempts to construct
   it merely from without. It is a kingdom within, unveiling itself from a
   higher source--as much a reality as the kingdom without, or the cosmos
   of natural law. Both, as Kant says, are equally true--"the starry
   heavens above and the moral law within;" [2] the former connecting
   itself with our external life, the latter revealing a faculty of life
   independent of animal, and even of all material existence. If there are
   times when we feel that the spiritual side of humanity has been
   somewhat exaggerated as an independent sphere, and an absolutism
   attributed to it which experience hardly warrants, there are other
   times when the whole strength of experience rises up against the most
   ingenious explanations of a psychological naturalism, and a sense of
   duty to a higher Power makes itself felt irresistibly. The heaven above
   is not more clear than the heaven of duty within. If we had to choose
   betwixt the two realities, the latter is the more intense and
   overpowering of the two.

   But this may be admitted, and yet the Biblical idea be rejected. There
   are schools of thought in our time which emphasise the moral side of
   humanity, and yet reject the old religious background whence man as a
   moral intelligence was supposed to have come. They advocate strenuously
   a moral and even a religious nature in man, and go so far as to believe
   that human happiness can only be found in conformity to a religious
   ideal. But then they either deny the objectivity of this ideal
   altogether, or at least deny its old Biblical character as centring in
   a Divine Person, or an Intelligent and Holy Will ruling man and the
   world. Experience, it is allowed, gives the data of a higher life in
   man, just as surely as the data of a lower life. But then the higher
   life is either without any sphere beyond the visible and natural sphere
   which now encloses it, or the sphere which is above it and to which it
   answers is a mere dumb power or "stream of tendency," of which we can
   know nothing save that it is and that it acts. In this view morality is
   allowed, and religion is allowed and even warmly advocated. But neither
   the morality nor the religion are of the old Biblical type. They not
   only start with man, but they stay with man. The expression "God" may
   be used, but its meaning is entirely inverted. It no longer means a
   living Person outside of us,--an Intelligence to whom our intelligences
   can ascend and with whom they can communicate. It is merely an
   idealised abstraction of ourselves, or some impersonal Power and Law
   "not ourselves." In either case, and on every such hypothesis of making
   experience not merely the starting-point but the goal of religious
   thought, we can never pass into a higher or supernatural sphere of
   intelligence. To attempt this is to attempt Metaphysic; and all our
   modern schools of experience, whether they start from external nature
   and the generalisation of cosmical phenomena, or from man and the
   phenomena of moral conduct and aspiration, detest and disavow
   Metaphysic.

   Nature and the facts of nature are tangible and powerful realities, say
   one class of our modern experience-philosophers--make what you can of
   them. If science and the laws which it unfolds are in themselves cold
   and uninspiring, clothe them with the ideas of sentiment and order. In
   other words, make them religion. It is contended by the special school
   of Positivists or the true Comtists that science must become religion,
   and it is their aim to preach as missionaries this new religion of
   scientific doctrine and scientific order. But to pass beyond the bounds
   of scientific generalisation is to pass into a region of nonsense.
   There is nothing, or at least nothing that we can ever know, beyond
   this region.

   Others, again, virtually say, leave nature alone. It is the proper
   sphere of science, and a religion of science is hopeless. But look
   within, and there a new order of facts emerges as the true basis of
   religion. We know that to be good is better than to be bad; that
   righteousness is happiness: that in our life, in short, there is a
   moral order of whose existence we cannot doubt, any more than we can
   doubt of the existence of the outward cosmical order. Belief in the
   reality of this moral order is the essence of religion. The position
   seems Christian. It is put forth as the last or most modern expression
   of Christianity. [3] But it breaks down at the most vital point. For
   beyond the subjective sphere of moral experience it recognises nothing.
   To step beyond the moral order verifiable in our experience, to a
   Supernal order with a Supreme Intelligence at its head-this is no
   longer religion but theological Metaphysic, a mere region of chaos and
   wordy darkness in which we can verify nothing.

   In neither of these cases is religion denied to man. On the contrary,
   the fullest concessions are made to it, and the line of experience is
   run out to its end, and possibly beyond its end. But in both alike all
   spiritual inference from the facts of experience is denied. Neither the
   cosmical order nor the moral order are held as witnessing to a Supreme
   Order, from which both come, and of which both are only the reflection.
   God (in the Biblical sense) is not only not the first word of these
   schools,--He is not their last. They not only do not take their
   authority from Him--they do not lead up to Him; He is not in all their
   thoughts. At the best and at the last there is only a glorified
   humanity, or "a power not ourselves making for righteousness." The
   measure of human experience is not only the measure of knowledge, but
   of being. Anthropology has not only taken precedence of Theology, but
   taken revenge upon it for its long neglect by extinguishing it. If a
   religion can be made out of man, and the facts that are verifiable in
   his experience,--good and well. But beyond the borders of this
   experience, to a single step of inference, or what they call inference,
   both the religions of science and of culture obstinately refuse to go.

   But here again the question recurs, Do these anthropological religions
   (much as they repudiate Anthropomorphism, they are anthropological and
   nothing else) rightly interpret human nature, or give a true account of
   it? Is it possible, from a study of man himself, to rest satisfied
   either with a religion of cosmical law or of moral law? Are not those
   very facts of experience, of which so much is made, only intelligible
   in the light of a higher Supreme Law? Is all ethic not necessarily
   theologic, and do not the very ideas of right and wrong disappear apart
   from an Order which is not merely within man, but without him--a
   Supreme and Holy Will, from which all cosmical and moral activity alike
   flow, and to which they obediently return? Is not the moral life of
   humanity only conceivable as a reflected life, looking back towards
   this higher Source, and gathering all its true strength therefrom--a
   Source which has lifted it upwards through the ages, and drawn it
   always more near to its own Ideal? Is not humanity itself only
   intelligible as a created and not as a self-evolved personality; as a
   subject of education, and not of mere development; as the child of a
   Divine Father, and not the victim of a power not himself which punishes
   his unrighteousness? Is not the very conception of righteousness only
   reached by a moral sense or conscience in us, which, if it is allowed
   at all, witnesses to far more than a mere stream of tendency
   encompassing and controlling our lives?

   In the course of these Lectures the views here indicated are everywhere
   implied. It was necessary, therefore, to make them so far clear at the
   outset. Our argument rests, and can only rest, both on a moral and a
   theistic basis. The question of sin is a question which has no
   existence save in the moral sphere. In the region of cosmical law it
   does not emerge at all. Whatever there may be of the appearance of evil
   within this sphere is either capable of explanation on an enlarged
   scientific view, or draws its character of mystery from the higher
   moral sphere which it touches. Apart from a moral law, enclosing all
   sentient life, and revealing itself as an intelligible and imperative
   guide in human life, there cannot even be the imagination of moral
   transgression. The most rudimentary conception of what is called sin
   vanishes. The fact of morality, therefore, and of a moral ideal, must
   be taken along with us from the outset.

   But the fact of a metaphysical or theological sphere must no less be
   presumed. At the root, Metaphysic and Theology are one, and rest on the
   same basis; nay, Morality, in any true sense, appears to us to rest on
   no other basis. Otherwise it is only a generalisation of utilities
   without any permanent essence or unity. In man there is either a
   principle of life deeper than all nature (physis)--in other words, a
   metaphysical principle--or there is not. He is primarily either
   spiritual or material--a divinely-created soul, or a subtly-composed
   combination of mere physical elements, enclosing whatever variety of
   so-called spiritual experiences. There is no evading this final issue.
   The spiritual side of humanity, which in name is not denied by any
   school of thought with which it is necessary to argue, is either real
   in the old scholastic sense, or merely nominal--a growth from a divine
   root, transcending nature, and related to a Higher Spirit, which has
   implanted it; or it is a mere growth of nature, marvellously as it may
   have subtilised and purified the lower elements out of which it has
   grown. The latter alternative is that which is really assumed by all
   our modern schools, although less prominently by some than others. This
   is the meaning of their incessant assault and abuse of Metaphysic; of
   their equally incessant admiration and applause of experience. All the
   phases of mind and feeling, spiritual as well as sensible, are allowed
   for. These phases are facts to be woven into science and religion. But
   a metaphysical or spiritual ground in human nature an ens metaphysicum
   and soul--as a separate reality, with a separate and transcendent
   sphere of its own, is presumed to be mere superstition or delusion. The
   sphere of being is here and now-nowhere else. Soul is the finest
   experience ripened within this sphere; it is nothing else. But
   Metaphysic cannot be got rid of by mere assertion. The highest thought
   of every age has returned to a metaphysical basis, and found the only
   solution of its problems in the recognition of a sphere other than the
   present, and deeper than all phases of experience. Behind the
   phenomenal, in all its manifestations, it has found the
   noumenal--behind all the flow of experience, a unity of Divine Reason
   or Soul or Spirit in man, out of which alone have come the flower and
   fruit' of his higher life. It is of the essence of this higher life,
   not only that it is independent of matter, or springs from a source
   independent of matter, but that it is related to a world of spiritual
   or metaphysical reality--a supernatural order which everywhere touches
   it and conditions it. This supernatural order is no mere ideal rule or
   law--a projection of our higher imagination or an invasion of
   "something not ourselves," whence we cannot tell. It is a divine
   reality,--a Personal Reason and Will like our own, enlightening,
   educating, controlling us. Morality, in the true sense, is conformity
   to this divine reality; Philosophy, in the highest sense, is our theory
   of its mode of being; and Theology, our knowledge of its activities or
   manifestations. Alike they presuppose a transcendent or metaphysical
   basis. Let this basis be granted, all the rest follows. Let man himself
   be Divine in his essential being, the theistic inference is a strict
   and legitimate one. Let this be denied, Theism disappears. The very
   idea of the Divine in the old, and, as we must hold, the only true
   sense, can never be reached.

   Large, therefore, as may seem our assumptions to begin with, they all
   hang together. They come very much to the old Biblical truth that man
   is a created being, and not a mere result of natural development,--that
   he was made in the image of God, endowed with a reasonable will and
   conscience, and subject to the authority of the Divine Being who made
   him. The time was when it might have been a mere matter of course to
   start with such assumptions in treating any theological topic; but in
   the present atmosphere of opinion it is hardly possible to do this
   without at least indicating what we are doing, and, so to speak,
   clearing our path towards the special question which is to occupy us.
   It is only when we have planted ourselves on a spiritual or
   metaphysical basis, below all mere phases of experience, and brought
   ourselves face to face with Soul on the one hand and God on the other,
   subject and object alike transcending mere natural development, that
   our question comes into view at all. We cannot help, therefore,
   beginning on this basis, and implying it from the first. At the same
   time, we hope in the course of our exposition to do something to
   vindicate the soundness of such a basis. It will be found better than
   any other to harmonise with the results of our analysis of the profound
   enigma of sin. The enigma may remain insoluble; but if it be at all, it
   must cast some meaning on the true character of humanity. If man be a
   sinner, the fact of sin, however inscrutable it may remain in its own
   character, cannot fail to authenticate his spiritual origin and
   relationship, and thus throw back lines of proof in favour of the
   theistic conclusion with which we have started. This is not to reason
   in a circle, but only to bring back such truths as may be gathered in
   the recesses of our moral experience to light up the pathway along
   which we have travelled.

   Having so far premised as to the character of the question before us in
   relation to modern schools of opinion, it still remains to consider as
   to our method of discussion. Sin being held to be a fact of human
   nature--an element of our moral consciousness--it might be thought best
   to begin with this consciousness, and to endeavour to fix the fact in
   the light of an internal analysis of its contents. If it be there,
   these contents must reveal it; and so we believe they do beyond doubt.
   Step by step the fact may be unfolded by an honest and searching
   scrutiny of the individual moral experience.

   This is the method of analysis which is mainly followed by J. Müller in
   his great work on the Christian Doctrine of Sin, and it long appeared
   to us the true method of dealing with the subject,--first, to examine
   the individual consciousness in its inner witness to the fact--to draw
   out the features of this self-witness; and then to view the conclusions
   thus reached in the light of Scripture, especially of the significant
   statements on the subject in the apostolic writings. But this method no
   longer appears so satisfactory as it once did. It assumes too readily
   the fixity of the moral and religious consciousness in every
   individual. It makes this consciousness as it exists now, or in modern
   Christian nations, a standard of universal application. It assumes,
   moreover, that it is possible in some way to distinguish betwixt our
   natural and our inherited moral notions--our moral consciousness merely
   as human beings, and the same consciousness as informed and instructed
   by Divine Revelation. In the first instance, we are supposed to be
   dealing with the light of Nature, as if we were able to fix its
   elements apart by themselves, before we begin to contemplate them in
   the light of Scripture. But this is really an impossible task. The
   contents of Nature and Revelation cannot any longer be separated in
   this manner. The historic and the individual conscience are
   inextricably interwoven as cause and effect. We are all of us morally
   as well as intellectually what we are, not merely because of certain
   specific and typical endowments, but because of a long line of
   inherited experiences which have come to us from all past sources of
   culture, natural and revealed. We are born of Christian parents, and
   nursed from the first of Christian ideas, which have entered into the
   sources of our moral being, and given it both colour and substance. We
   cannot any longer discriminate in this being the specific from the
   general, the individual from the catholic compounds. What is ultimate
   in our higher thought can never be disentangled from our inheritance of
   belief and education. There is no doubt a certain morality and a
   certain religion in all men by nature. The history of ethics and the
   history of religion alike show this. If we go outside of Christianity,
   we still find man a creature of morality, or a subject of religion.
   This is enough to show that moral and religious instincts are a natural
   part of humanity. But, admitting this, it is no longer possible for
   those who have been educated within the long-descended line of
   Christian ideas, to determine clearly the elements either of a natural
   Ethic or a natural Religion as distinct from those ideas. They cleave
   to us too closely. Nay, they are so inwoven in the common fibre of our
   intellectual and spiritual life, that many of those who in our day
   assail Christianity with most intelligence and force, are found
   borrowing the very ideas with which they would supplant the Gospel from
   the atmosphere of morality which it has produced, and which without it
   would soon vanish. To this extent the modern idea of continuity must be
   admitted by all. The moral and religious life of humanity is a vast
   growth, which has taken up into its lifeblood all sources of past
   knowledge from Church and Scripture, as well as from Nature and
   Science. The light of so-called Nature and the light of Revelation have
   so mingled their rays in us, as to make up a blended experience which
   it is no longer possible to break up and refer to their respective
   sources.

   It will be our aim, therefore, instead of beginning with the full idea
   of sin and appealing to Scripture everywhere for its proof, to review
   the idea in its gradual development. The idea is, according to our
   belief, a true one. It is verified by experience, recognised,
   described, and defined in Scripture. But, like all other ideas, it has
   grown from stage to stage in the human consciousness. It is not at
   first what it is afterwards--in its beginnings what it is in its full
   expression. It is now generally recognised that an idea is best
   understood and interpreted when thus unfolded along the whole line of
   its history--nay, that the best verification of the idea, or proof of
   its being true and not false, is just the manner in which it is seen
   from the beginning to cleave to the human mind and heart as a living
   possession.

   Into this growth of religious ideas there enter all the factors which
   have been concerned in their production, expansion, or
   purification--not only the natural impulses of the human mind pushing
   onwards and realising more clearly its own powers, but also what is
   meant by Revelation, or the special introduction of new thoughts and
   impulses from a higher source. Without Revelation, religious ideas
   would never have been what they are. Hebrew and Christian monotheism,
   the great doctrines of the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Atonement, the
   doctrine of Sin in its full meaning, and Justification by grace, are
   all, according to Christian belief, the result of this higher
   communication. According to the same belief, they are true as thus
   communicated. But the higher source from which such ideas come does not
   destroy their capacity of growth. On the contrary, of all ideas the
   most living and fertile have been those of Revelation. They have been
   as a new power of life to the human consciousness, darkly growing up
   from the tangled weeds of its own superstitions to the clear light of
   God revealed in Christ. None of them were revealed in their fulness all
   at once. No doctrine has come forth in complete lineaments from the
   Divine mind. It has aggregated and acquired precision of outline from
   many influences working in the mind and heart of the Church in all
   ages. Theology exists for the purpose of analysing the aggregate, and
   elucidating and verifying the details of outline, and, in short, of
   presenting the doctrine in its full contents and meaning.

   There is nothing novel in this view of Theology. I have not said there
   is. It has always been the business of Christian Theology to verify
   doctrine in the light of Scripture, and to trace how the various facts
   or texts of Scripture contribute to form the doctrine. But there is
   this difference betwixt the more recent and the older dogmatic method,
   that the modern theologian does not consider doctrines to be formed by
   a mere analysis and co-ordination of texts. They are not only logical
   deductions from Scriptural data; they are vital growths within the
   Christian consciousness. So the business of the theologian is not only
   to deduce conclusions from Scriptural premises, but to trace the vital
   links in the organism of Christian thought. He feels, moreover, the
   necessity of doing this in a true historic spirit; unfolding the
   doctrine from its first germ to its full outline; reading forward from
   the beginning, and not reading backward from the end, as has been so
   often done. This is what is meant by the historic method: not the
   discussion or estimate of past opinions, but the analysis from the
   first of a doctrine in its vital growth in the human consciousness. The
   modern theologian desires to look at the genesis of Christian ideas' as
   far as possible in their own light; to see them as they grow, and not
   merely to handle them as past logical forms. He may fail in this.
   Misconceptions will cling to him in spite of himself; and he will look
   at the past in the light of the present, and judge it thereby. But at
   any rate he has breathed the new historic atmosphere which surrounds
   the modern intelligence, and he feels that the end is not as the
   beginning in doctrine any more than in anything else; that there is a
   continuous movement all along the line of its development; and that his
   proper business is not to carry back the fullness of the result to
   measure the first springs of the movement, but to study these springs
   as they rise in their first freshness, and to trace, with unforced and
   discriminating intelligence, their gradual advance till they swell into
   the full dogmatic utterance of the Church.

   A confusion of the spheres of what have hitherto been called Nature and
   Revelation [See [2]Appendix IV.] may seem to follow from this view. We
   have already spoken of the difficulty of discriminating these spheres
   in our own experience; and the extreme schools of religious opinion,
   both in this country and in Holland and Germany, willingly confuse
   them, and recognise nothing essentially distinctive in what we call
   Revelation. Yet there is nothing in the conception itself, or the
   method which has grown out of it, that necessitates this confusion.
   Both factors--the natural and supernatural, the human and the
   divine--are alike present in the formation of all religious thought. It
   may be impossible always to distinguish them; it is to us certainly
   impossible, at this stage of religious progress, to discriminate the
   elements either of a natural Ethic or a natural Religion separable from
   the course of Christian ideas, and self-authenticating on a basis of
   its own. The historic method has destroyed these presumptions of a
   former Deism, which tried vainly to stand aloof from the course of
   Christian intelligence. But, in doing so, it is so far from having
   destroyed the claims of Nature on the one hand, or Revelation on the
   other, that it has carried them up into a living unity of Christian
   Reason, or of Reason informed and enlightened by all the influences,
   higher and lower, divine and natural, which have nurtured and fashioned
   it from the beginning.

   I shall endeavour, therefore, in these Lectures, to treat first the
   growth of the idea of evil, in its most general aspect, as it meets us
   in those forms of religious culture which preceded or were entirely
   outside of that divine education of the Hebrew race under which the
   special consciousness of sin was developed. This will bring before us
   the only purely "natural" notions on the subject-the workings of the
   human mind and feeling regarding it, untouched by any special
   revelation.

   I shall then pass to consider the idea of evil as apprehended by the
   Hebrew mind, or the rise and progress in that mind of the idea of sin,
   under the special divine training to which it was subjected. I shall
   treat, in other words, of the Old Testament doctrine of sin, which is
   absolutely necessary to the understanding of the developed doctrine in
   the New Testament.

   This fully developed doctrine will next engage us under the several
   significant aspects in which it took hold of the primitive Christian
   consciousness as represented in the New Testament Scriptures,
   especially as depicted in the Gospels and the Epistles of St. Paul. The
   doctrine of original sin, as the final expression of the Christian
   consciousness in the apostolic or first Christian age, will finally
   occupy us and close our present exposition.

   There are endless collateral controversies as to moral freedom, the
   nature and extent of the moral law, the relation of sin in its origin
   to the human and divine will, set forth in various theories. But I
   shall endeavour to keep as close to the subject as I can. There is
   little good in following the inquiry into regions which transcend all
   experience and all means of reaching a verifiable conclusion, or in
   beating out the straw of old controversies which have lost all or most
   of their meaning. It is unnecessary to entangle ourselves with the
   thoughts of others, save where they bear directly upon our line of
   exposition. The subject, as thus sketched, is ample and interesting
   enough in itself to occupy our whole space.

IDEA OF EVIL OUTSIDE OF REVELATION.

   THE question of evil is as old as humanity itself. It enters into all
   forms of religion. It is the background of mystery in all human life;
   and its shadow falls over that outward world of cosmical law which
   seems most removed from it.

   Amidst the pervading harmonies of creation there are forces ready to
   break forth with destructive activity, and to spread around ruin and
   disaster. Nature is powerful for harm as well as for help, a storehouse
   of death as well as of life. [See [5]Appendix V.] Darkness and storm
   alternate with light and serenity; the peaceful courses of the seasons
   are interrupted by the incalculable fury of the tempest; and even the
   security of the abiding earth and heavens seems invaded by the
   explosions of the earthquake and the ominous gloom of the eclipse.
   These phenomena may be all equally ordered, but they powerfully excite
   the suggestion of evil in the human imagination. In primitive times
   they touch it with a peculiarly vivid force of apprehension and dread;
   and even after the light of science has searched the secrecies of
   Nature, and laid bare its wondrous order everywhere, there lingers in
   the popular mind a deep distrust of all unwonted phenomena.

   In the region of sensitive life the idea of evil presents itself
   directly. Here it is that Nature is "red in tooth and claw," [4] and
   its very arrangements seem designed not merely to produce good, but to
   inflict evil. The whole range of animal existence presents a mingled
   scene of enjoyment and suffering--a scene bright with the activities of
   life, and health, and triumph, but also dark with the endurance of
   weakness, terror, and violence, the latter apparently entering into the
   constitution of the animal world as immediately as the other.

   And when we turn to the highest form of life in man himself, the
   presence of evil haunts it everywhere in endless forms of general and
   individual experience in all relations of human society, all functions
   of human industry, and in the noblest energies of human progress. We
   cannot conceal its working when we look within our own hearts. Nay,
   here more than anywhere it shows its deepest power, and touches human
   experience with acutest misery. Different natures will apprehend
   differently the depth and power of evil in human life; but there are
   none, not even the most sentimental enthusiasts, call dispute its
   existence; and it requires only a slight degree of moral earnestness to
   be solemnly arrested by it. The highest natures have been most moved by
   its mystery; and those who have most realised the greatness of man, and
   done most for his good, have at the same time felt most pathetically
   the shadows of evil that rest upon his lot.

   So far there can hardly be any difference of opinion as to the fact
   which we call evil. Whatever men may make of the fact, its presence
   around them, and in their own life, admits of no denial.

   A fact so universal and so painful, touching human life at all points
   with such a sore pressure, has been necessarily a subject of much
   inquiry and reflection. Men have never ceased interrogating the mystery
   which lies around them and within them. The history of religion is in
   great part a history of the explanations which men have tried to give
   of it. It is the business of these Lectures to deal with one of these
   explanations. The Christian answer to the question of evil, apart from
   all considerations of its essential importance, is one which can never
   cease to interest all thoughtful minds. It is at least one of the most
   intelligible and consistent that has been given. But, before entering
   upon our special task, it will be well to bring under brief review such
   answers as have occurred to the human mind in its successive stages of
   religious progress. The course of religious thought outside the Jewish
   and the Christian Revelation may, or may not, be the product of purely
   natural reflection. Elements of primeval tradition may mingle in it;
   but, at least, it is the only source whence we can gather the contents
   of Natural Religion in any intelligible sense of these words.

   It is needless to say that we make no attempt to handle this part of
   our task with historical completeness. Any such attempt would lead us
   far into the wide field of comparative Theology. [See [6]Appendix VI.]
   No field of inquiry can be more interesting; but it is beyond our
   present scope, as it is beyond our knowledge. All that we propose to do
   is to trace rapidly the chief ideas of evil that meet us in the great
   world of religious thought--unrepresented by the Jewish or Christian
   Scriptures. Such a sketch, however rapid, if at all intelligent, can
   hardly fail to throw a reflected light on the Christian doctrine, and
   to bring into bolder and more precise relief its distinguishing
   features. In point of fact it will be found that the answers which have
   been given to the problems of evil outside of revelation run in a few
   main lines, which continually repeat themselves, and which seem to
   exhaust all the efforts of human speculation on the subject.

   Glancing, then, at the world of religious thought outside of
   Christianity and its anticipatory revelation, we may be said to meet
   with the following successive developments of the idea of evil-some of
   them of the nature of reasoned or speculative solutions, others in the
   main unconscious generalisations which have dominated human
   intelligence, without professing to unravel the mystery which it faces.

   1. The rudest conception of evil is that which meets us in prehistoric
   and savage religions. [See [7]Appendix VII.] It is the instinct of the
   savage to conceive of the external world as upon the whole evil rather
   than good. No intelligence can be said to mingle with this instinct or
   to guide it. It is only a crude confused sense in the mind of the
   savage of the pressure of natural forces upon his security, comfort, or
   possessions. What is evil, and still less what is good, in any deeper
   sense, he never asks himself. He is incapable of even forming coherent
   imaginations of the one or the other; but instinctively he trembles
   before a Power or Powers which can hurt him, blight the fruits of his
   labour or destroy his cattle, deny his success in the chase and triumph
   in war; and he offers rites or uses spells or incantations to drive
   away these Powers, or draw them to his side. The evil is therefore
   truly far more of a god to him than the good, and devil-worship,
   however revolting and unintelligible to a later reflectiveness, is only
   a natural inference of the savage view of life and of Nature. So
   radical is the hold which evil in some form or another has over the
   human heart and imagination.

   2. As we pass to the earliest forms of historical religion, a higher
   and better view of Nature meets us. It is still full of evil, but it is
   also full of good. Its great contrasts of light and shade, of beauty
   and terror, are reproduced and personified. The external world
   continues to dominate the religious imagination; but this world is no
   longer a mere repertory of evil powers ready to crush man or destroy
   the fruits of his labour. It is a scene of incessant activity,
   productiveness, and life. The clear sky above, the radiant sunlight,
   the sweet wind no less than the destructive blast, fire, water, earth,
   all that is joyful as well as all that is gloomy in the great picture
   of the outward world, are idealised and clothed in imaginary forms.
   There may be no depth of intelligence, no clear lines drawn even
   betwixt natural qualities; yet the one side of the picture is given as
   well as the other. The brighter side is often given as the more
   prominent of the two.

   There is great variety in the forms of religion which occupy this stage
   of development. The wide group of polytheistic faiths which meets us in
   the earliest centres of civilisation of which we have any record may be
   said to belong to it. Some of them are greatly more advanced than
   others, and rise at points into a region of pure moral conception; but
   in their origin all may be said to rest on a dual imagination of
   nature, and none of them quite outreach the conditions of their origin.

   The religion of ancient Egypt, supposed by some to represent a more
   primitive stratum of religious idea than any Aryan or Semitic faith, is
   a conspicuous example of the rudest form of this embodiment of
   Nature-force in contrasted types of good and evil. In this as in all
   Nature-religions, the sun under various names is the great type of the
   Good--the symbol of joyous activity and beneficence. Evil, again, is
   pictured in the darkness of night, the cold of winter, or the
   devastating heat of summer. Osiris seems to gather to himself in the
   later Egyptian mythology all the higher qualities of active goodness,
   while Isis is the correspondent passive or receptive principle. Beside
   these stands Typhon the evil principle, conspicuous as powerful, able
   to slay Osiris and banish him to the region of the dead, but not able
   to detain him there. Sought after by Isis, he is found and brought back
   to life again, as the sun rises again after the darkness of the night.
   The Evil stands beside the Good, and enters into conflict with it, but
   it no longer fills the imagination.

   The religions of Phoenicia and of the older civilisations which spread
   around the valley of the Euphrates present a similarly rude deification
   of Nature-force. The Baal of Phoenicia is now good and now evil--now
   Baal-Adonis and now Baal-Moloch. Ashera, or Astarte, the female
   divinity, is also partly good and partly evil; now the symbol of joy
   and grace and beauty, in which aspect she seems to be cognate with the
   Hellenic Aphrodite and the Ephesian Diana, and now the symbol of terror
   and grossness. Adonis, torn by a bloody boar, and again reappearing to
   the light, is the same myth as Osiris killed by Typhon--the Good
   overcome by the Evil, but not conquered by it. The higher principle
   regains its ascendancy, and takes its position in front of the other.

   In all these conceptions, obviously the Good and Evil are alike drawn
   from Nature; but there is some movement of thought if not of moral
   interest. The human intellect has grown, if not to understand Nature,
   yet not merely to be afraid of it. Everywhere it sees two sides,--light
   as well as shade--brilliancy, life, and abundance, as well as negation,
   sterility, and darkness. Nature is no longer formless or merely evil;
   there is a rude, if incoherent, attempt at classification. Mere blind
   wonder and fear have ceased, and the mind recognises and symbolises the
   Good no less than the Evil. The conceptions are cloudy and
   interchangeable, but they are there. The first step in the great
   movement of religious thought has begun.

   The Vedic and Hellenic mythologies mark the greatest advance in this
   stage of religious thought; and in the latter particularly, the stage
   outruns itself into the moral sphere. Primarily, however, both
   mythologies start with Nature. The gods of India and of Greece, no less
   than of Egypt, are impersonations of natural force. Indra is the symbol
   of the Sun--of the serene sky--"who makes the lightning to spring forth
   and launches the light." The clouds that darken the sky represent the
   powers of evil that fight against Indra. They march under the guidance
   of Vritra, or "that which obscures." Again, the swift winds which chase
   the clouds are the auxiliaries of Indra, and the two first rays of the
   morning are twin divinities, traversing the heaven in a rapid car, and
   scattering in their passage fecundity and life. Varuna (Heaven), Indra
   (Light), Agni (Fire), are all in turn represented as the great
   Nature-force and supreme Power. The hymns celebrate them
   simultaneously; and each, without relation to the other, seems to
   occupy the chief place. "The whole mythology," as Max Müller says, "is
   fluent." The powers of Nature stand alongside of one another rather
   than in subordination to one another. They are idealisations of natural
   force, and yet they take to themselves moral attributes, and clothe
   themselves at times with a gracious and divine personality. It is
   hardly possible to excel the moral spirit of some of the Vedic hymns,
   as, for example, the following: "Let me not yet, O Varuna, enter into
   the house of clay. Have mercy, Almighty; have mercy. Through want of
   strength, thou strong and bright God, have I gone to the wrong shore.
   Have mercy, Almighty; have mercy. Whenever we seem, O Varuna, to commit
   an offence--whenever we break thy law through thoughtlessness--have
   mercy, Almighty; have mercy." [5]

   This moral growth is still more conspicuous in the Homeric mythology.
   The Zeus of Homer is not merely the Vedic Indra--the sun vanquishing
   darkness; but he is a father and king--the source of moral order, the
   judge of domestic right. Pallas is not merely the brightness of the
   serene sky, but the reflection of thought--the source of prudence,
   eloquence, art, and wit. Apollo is the symbol at once of light and of
   purity--the Hellenic messenger or Messiah mediating betwixt heaven and
   earth; [See [8]Appendix VIII.] and even Aphrodite, one of the least
   moral of the Hellenic divinities, is not merely the impersonation of
   voluptuous beauty, but of all bewitching softness and poetic grace, as
   she rises from the foam of the Cytherean wave.

   But admitting all this, it is none the less true that the most perfect
   of these conceptions have not only their origin in Nature, but that
   they never completely rise above it; the vesture of their birth
   everywhere clings to them. The moral conception is never clearly marked
   off from the unmoral or even the immoral; the one passes into the
   other. Even the personal conception sinks back into Nature and loses
   itself ever and again in the vast and dim realm of the cosmos. Human
   reflectiveness has greatly advanced, and stands face to face with
   Nature, no longer in mere dread, nor yet in a mere twofold vision of
   darkness and light. The darkness, indeed, has almost vanished from the
   scene. The Evil has lost its power by losing its grossness; it lies
   hidden away behind the bright creation of that wonderful Olympus. But
   it is only hidden away. There was such a sunlight in the early Greek
   imagination that it suffused all the activities of Nature and of life
   by its glow; but the gloomy shadows lay in wait behind even the glowing
   Epos. Olympus itself rested on a dark realm of night and chaos, and the
   gloom of Hades haunted the hero amidst all his cheerful toils and
   perils. Nowhere,certainly, in all human history, does the conception of
   evil play a less powerful part than in the early Greek religion, yet
   even here it is not banished. It is the formless background out of
   which rises alike the cosmos of natural beauty and the glory of the
   heroic life. Moral qualities mingle in the latter and touch it with a
   splendour more than that of earth, but Nature imprisons and limits both
   the Good and the Evil. Far as in special traits they may rise above it,
   they still return to the soil which nurtured them, and which conditions
   their highest aspirations.

   3. It is in a different quarter to which we must look for the first
   definite growth of a moral conception of evil, or of such a marked
   separation betwixt the Good and Evil as to place them in direct
   antagonism. Early in the unknown history of the Aryan tribes, but
   subsequent to their final dispersion eastwards and westwards, there
   seems to have occurred, in the primitive home of the race, something of
   the nature of a religious revolution. The symbolism of Nature, with its
   tendency to assume a polytheistic shape, and to obscure moral
   distinctions, must have become unsatisfactory, and led to a strong
   reaction in some higher mind or minds who had power to turn the popular
   religious thought in a new and more spiritual direction. The old
   antagonisms of light and darkness, of sunshine and storm, became
   transformed, as Bunsen says, [6] into antagonisms of good and evil--of
   Powers exerting a beneficent or corrupting influence on the mind. The
   old Aryan nomenclature underwent a singular change. The terms remained,
   but received a reversed significance. The appellation of the good
   powers was applied to the powers of evil. Dævas, for example--cognate
   with Deva and Dyaus, the name of God, the supreme type of light or the
   serene sky, the Heaven-Father--came to denote the spirits of evil, or
   the genii of darkness who fight under the Prince of Darkness.

   The author of this remarkable revolution in Aryan thought is generally
   known as Zoroaster, or Zarathustra, as the name is more correctly
   written. But beyond the fact of such a name, and the religion connected
   with it, nothing can be said to be distinctly ascertained. All attempt
   to construct Persian any more than Egyptian chronology and history
   seems hopeless. The era of Zarathustra, according to different writers,
   varies from about 600 B.C. to 1000 B.C., or even a much earlier date.
   Most scholars entitled to express an opinion on the subject believe
   that he cannot be placed later than the second-mentioned of these
   dates. But not only is the date of Zarathustra uncertain, doubts have
   even been cast upon his personality. It has been suggested that the
   name may stand, not for an individual, but for a school of early Aryan
   prophets, who initiated the great change of religious thought which has
   descended to us under the title of Zoroastrianism.

   The uncertainty which hangs around the origin of the system cannot be
   said to attach to the system itself. It is a distinctly-conceived
   dualism, in which the physical contrasts presented by pre-existing
   religions have become almost entirely merged in moral antagonism. Man
   is represented as surrounded by good and evil spirits, ranged under
   respective leaders--Ormuzd or Ahura-Mazda, the Holy-minded, and Ahriman
   or Anra-Mainyus, the Evil-minded. These spiritual powers wage with each
   other an incessant war, and man has to make his choice betwixt them. He
   cannot serve two masters. He must choose the one and reject the other.
   The Good Power is represented as the Creator. "I worship and adore,"
   says Zarathustra, "the Creator of all things, Ahura-Mazda, active
   Creator, . . . Lord of the worlds--Lord of good things, . . . the first
   fashioner--who made the pure creation." [7] And yet Evil is supposed to
   be also an independent power from the beginning--having a coequal
   existence with the Good. "In the beginning there was," says the
   prophet, "a pair of twins--two spirits, each having his own distinct
   essence. These, the Good and the Evil, rule over us in thought, word,
   and deed." [8] And. the difficulty of the choice betwixt good and evil
   rests just in this, that the one holds man as really, and, so to speak,
   as rightfully, as the other.

   It is unnecessary to dwell upon the marked development of thought which
   this system exhibits. Good and Evil are so far plainly transferred from
   the region of Nature to the region of Spirit. The evil is not that
   which merely hurts, or weakens, or destroys man. It is not merely the
   gloom of night or the fury of the desolating storm, as in Vedism; or
   the pale dread of an unknown future, as in Hellenism. Good and Evil are
   nowhere seen interchanging, or lying in indiscriminate confusion
   alongside one another. But Evil is from the first a spiritual power
   behind nature, and operating primarily upon the mind and heart. It is
   twin with the Good; and through the necessary encounter of the two all
   things are brought about--the world of life is formed. But, twin in
   being and in the genesis of the world, they are wholly opposed in
   character. Veracity, purity, righteousness, are the attributes of the
   one; lies, uncleanness, and destructiveness are the qualities of the
   other. In short, the sphere of Nature, which we have seen to bound even
   the loftiest conceptions of the Homeric pantheon, is almost entirely
   left behind in this remarkable system. We have passed from the outward
   to the inward--from the cosmical, not merely to the personal, but to
   the ethical.

   Yet when we look more closely, there are traces here also of the
   aboriginal soil out of which all Nature-religions have grown. Good is
   not wholly spiritual, or Evil either. A dead body is as polluted as a
   lie; and a fine field of wheat is as pleasing in the sight of
   Ahura-Mazda as a purified conscience. It is obvious, further, how the
   very conception of Evil as twin with Good, and equally independent with
   it, serves so far to destroy its moral character. That which is an
   inherent and necessary power in the creation of the world cannot be an
   essential contradiction of its highest law. Rather it must enter into
   all created things as their true complement and condition. There are
   passages from the Zend-Avesta which seem to rise above this necessary
   dualism or essential twofoldness of evil as well as good in the
   composition of the world. Bunsen and others have at least drawn a
   higher meaning from these passages. But there can be little doubt that
   Persian religious thought never surmounted the fundamental dualism on
   which it is based, and which has been so prominently identified with
   it. Some of the nobler Gâthâs, or hymns of the Persian scriptures, may
   speak of the world as divine, or of the Good Spirit ruling us all; but
   in others the Evil Spirit claims to rank alongside of the Good. And it
   was the fate of Zoroastrianism to plant the dualistic conception so
   deep in the human consciousness, that it is seen constantly reappearing
   in the subsequent history of religious thought, and even within the
   sphere of Christianity itself.

   Nothing, indeed, is more remarkable than the vitality of this
   conception. It is the definite basis, if not of all Gnostic thought, of
   those special forms of it which were allied to Orientalism, and which
   are sometimes spoken of as branches of the Syrian in contrast to the
   Alexandrian Gnosis. The question of evil, of its origin and its
   relation to the Supreme Being, was the great question of Gnosticism;
   and the solution which it gave of the question from one point of view
   was plainly borrowed from Zoroastrianism. It imagined the Demiourgos,
   or creator of the natural world, to be an actively malignant or evil
   being at war with the Supreme--an Ahriman in conflict with the absolute
   Source of life and goodness. There was this difference--a difference so
   far in favour of the original system--that in all the phases of
   Gnosticism the higher Divine Principle is conceived as infinitely apart
   from the work of creation, abiding in an exclusive supremacy. It is the
   Evil that is creative or demiurgic, and not the Good. The two are not
   coactive, but the Evil is, so to speak, the only activity invading the
   passive sphere or abyss of Being. A latent Pantheism, in short, lurks
   in all Gnostic thought, of which there is no trace in primitive
   Zoroastrianism. Yet the dualistic stands in front of the pantheistic
   conception, and probably gave to the various forms of the Syrian Gnosis
   its popular hold upon many minds in the first Christian ages.

   In the third century Dualism took fresh life and burst forth with new
   momentum under the name of Manichæism. This system especially
   emphasised the power of Evil as a distinct and coeternal principle in
   antagonism with the Good. [9] It acquired a rapid ascendancy, and
   exercised more influence than any preceding systems of the same
   character. In the fourth and fifth centuries it paraded itself as
   almost a rival of Christianity. Augustine was for a time its disciple,
   and speaks of its great teacher, Faustus, with all his superficiality
   and lack of precise thought, as a man of eloquence and influence. But
   even this great outburst of dualistic speculation by no means exhausted
   its vitality. It sprang up again suddenly in the East in the twelfth
   century, founding a new sect under the name of Paulicians, who seem
   somehow to have identified their characteristic principles with the
   teaching of St. Paul. Gibbon has given, in the fifty-fourth chapter of
   this great history, an animated description of this sect, and of the
   rapidity with which it spread, notwithstanding violent persecution,
   through Bulgaria and the borders of the Greek empire into Italy,
   Germany, and France. "It was discovered," he says, "that many thousand
   Catholics of rank and of either sex had embraced the Manichæan heresy"
   [10] (under this new name). The heresy spread, especially in the south
   of France; and there, amongst other uncatholic opinions, filled up the
   measure of heterodoxy and contempt for sacred forms which called forth
   and consecrated the horrors of the Albigensian war. It can hardly be
   said that even in modern times this old conception has lost its power,
   when we find one great philosopher writing of another--Mr. J. S. Mill
   of his father--"that he found it. impossible to believe that a world so
   full of evil was the work of an author combining infinite power with
   perfect goodness and righteousness;" but that he by no means
   discredited in the same degree "the Sabæan and Manichæan theory of a
   Good and an Evil Principle struggling against each other for the
   government of the universe." [11]

   4. The conception of evil was destined to undergo still further
   modifications outside the sphere of Judaism and Christianity. The
   original worship of the Aryan race, which under the influence of a
   noble inspiration passed into the ethical ardour of Zoroastrianism,
   became transformed on another side, first into the sacerdotal pantheism
   of Brahmanism, and then into the philosophy of Buddha, which has
   received various interpretations, but which, in all its
   interpretations, more or less implies the same conception of evil. It
   is no part of our work to trace these developments of religious thought
   flowing from the same fountain-head, partly revolutionary and partly
   reactionary in their relation to one another. All that it concerns us
   to note is, that the idea of evil, which is very prominent in both, is
   quite different from that clearly-defined personality which meets us in
   the Zoroastrian or Irano-Persian system of which we have been speaking.
   There the world of created life--man and all things--share in the Evil
   which, no less than the Good, has been concerned in their production.
   But while sharing in evil as an essential element of his being, man is
   at the same time invited to active struggle with it. He has the choice
   of the Good or the Evil, and all his higher activities are evoked to
   overcome the one and embrace the other. The Kingdom of Darkness holds
   him within its sphere, and the Prince of Darkness rules him by right,
   so to speak, of joint property; yet there appears to be a sphere within
   the conditions of his present life where the evil may be vanquished.
   The pious heart is promised the inheritance of the earth. [12] The
   struggle here, therefore, is not hopeless, and human life may be
   glorified in deliverance from evil. But when we turn to Brahmanism, we
   find that evil is no longer merely present in life--no longer merely
   claims a joint share in it--but has, in fact, become its characteristic
   condition. Existence itself, or at least conscious existence, has
   become the Evil. It is no longer a fight against an evil power; it is
   itself evil. To have passed from the infinite to the finite--from
   unconsciousness to consciousness--to have been born into this world of
   change at all, is evil. There is, accordingly, not merely evil in the
   world, concerned in its production, holding its own in its government,
   but the world is evil itself, and the mere fact of life is a fall from
   true Being and Good.

   This may seem a strange outcome of the lively Nature-worship of the
   Aryan tribes, as depicted in the hymns of the Rig-Veda. But it seems to
   have been a natural consequence of the changes which passed upon the
   race as they went eastward, settling in the valley of the Ganges, and
   exchanging their nomadic and warlike character for a pacific and
   settled social state. Surrounded by luxuriant and gigantic forms of
   nature, and under a comparatively unchanging sky, they seem to have
   lost their natural activity both of life and imagination. Their bards,
   as Bunsen says, "gradually became a guild which shaped itself into a
   priestly caste." [13] Their versatile and joyous symbolism of Nature
   degenerated into a sacerdotal system, in which Indra and his cognate
   divinities passed out of notice, and Brahma took their place.
   Apparently at first a mere abstract name for the contemplation of what
   was "sacred" or "holy," this word came to denote (in a neuter form [14]
   ) the Divine, the Eternal--in opposition to the temporal, the
   phenomenal-and also (in a masculine form) the God of the Brahmans, or
   the chief God of the later Hindu mythology. The idea of Brahma,
   however, even as a distinct object of worship, remained very
   impersonal, and never acquired any hold of the popular mind. He is
   nowhere so much a personality as a Universal Soul or Spirit of the
   world, of which all finite things are the manifestation. "The Universe
   is Brahma, it proceeds from Brahma, [15] and is finally again absorbed
   by Brahma." Brahma is Being, pure Being; all else is his word or image.
   But in so far as Being has passed into Form, and the Eternal clothed
   itself with the temporal, and the Infinite become the finite, evil has
   arisen. To be out of Brahma in any sense is so far evil. "The cycle of
   the universe is an error;" [16] Brahma is the only reality. "Thou, I,
   the universe must pass away;" [17] Brahma alone abides, "without
   dimension, quality, character, or duality." [18] "A wise man must
   annihilate all objects of sense in his mind, and contemplate
   continually only the one Mind which is like pure space." [19]

   It is unnecessary to dwell upon the vast change which has passed upon
   Aryan thought in the elaboration of such a system as this, and how
   entirely it transfers us to a new point of view regarding evil. In one
   sense it might seem an advanced point of view. It is the result of a
   more distinct effort of thought--a more meditative philosophy. The
   Dualism of the Zoroastrian is a more spontaneous suggestion than the
   Pantheism of the Brahman--an older and so to speak a rougher and more
   popular type of thought. But the Brahmanical conception of evil, later
   as it is in its development and more profound in mystery, is really not
   an advance upon the Zoroastrian conception; rather it is a degeneracy.
   The moral import which we were able to trace everywhere in the one has
   quite gone out of the other. There can be no genuine moral sphere in an
   existence which is evil by the mere fact that it is at all; whose very
   creaturely beginning is a fall from the Divine, and whose only
   salvation is a return to it, not by any moral effort or renovation, but
   by re-absorption. This--the only Good--stood at an infinite distance
   from the creature, whose destiny it was to pass from one form of life
   to another, conditioned by the preceding. The doctrine of
   Metempsychosis crowned the Brahmanic system, and contributed to render
   it one of the most mournful and oppressive of all religions. Life was
   not only evil in its present consciousness, but there opened before it
   a series of changes all more or less evil, from which there was no
   escape but by losing all individuality, and perishing in the abyss of
   pure Being.

   So far, Buddhism was a reaction against all this oppressive sense of
   misery in life. It taught, in opposition to the apparently endless law
   of transmigration, and the sacerdotalism which made capital out of this
   law, that happiness was to be found in a life of conscious virtue, and
   that religion was not a system of rites and ceremonies, but a true
   order of reverence, and charity, and self-denial. "To conquer one's
   self is a greater victory than to gain a battle." "He who for only one
   moment contemplates himself in utter repose"--"who cherishes reverence
   for the virtuous"--this one act of devotion is better than a hundred
   years' sacrifices. "To refrain at all times from angry words, and never
   to do another injury; to observe temperance; to live in profoundest
   meditation,--lo! this is enjoined in the Buddhas.' [20] Sayings such as
   these, which are to be found without number in the Buddhist scriptures,
   are sufficient to prove the high moral tone of Buddhism, and the extent
   to which it formed a reformation of the Brahmanical system, which, like
   the Pharisaism of the Gospels, had become intolerable to many pious
   hearts. But, not to speak of deeper defects, Buddhism, with all its
   strenuous culture of moral life, never rose above the degrading
   conception of existence as a whole presented in the older faith. It
   preached the divinity of virtue, the negation of desire, the beauty of
   repose. It tried to clear a space within the present life for the
   exercise of reverence, and purity, and charity, and honorable
   obedience. "He who cherishes reverence in his heart, and ever honours
   his superiors, to him shall be ever added these four gifts--long life,
   beauty, joy, power." [21] But withal, it left life as a natural fact
   under the curse of evil. Of the four sublime verities, the first is
   that "existence is suffering,"--and the second, that the cause of the
   suffering is desire or sensation. There is a sense, indeed, in which
   these Buddhistic aphorisms might bear a Christian meaning. There might
   seem little to choose betwixt the well-known language of Job and the
   words of the Buddha proverb, "Man's birth is full of trouble, and full
   of toil is his life also;" [22] and "He that loseth his life shall find
   it,"--"Whoso loveth father and mother better than me," might seem to
   find their echo in the divine honour attributed in another proverb to
   him "who, loose from all human ties, has risen to the divine
   communion." [23] But the spiritual standpoint is vitally different in
   the two cases. The life of sense, the life of affection, even the life
   of thought on its active, speculative, or scientific side, is all more
   or less evil from the Buddhistic point of view.
   Perfection--Nirvâna--however we may specially interpret the word, is
   only to be attained by self-contemplation, and in the end by ecstacy.
   Good, in short, only arises in so far as life in all its actualities is
   left behind. "The greatest happiness is, not to be born; the next
   greatest is for those who have been born to die soon." Even according
   to Bunsen, who has found a higher divine meaning in Buddhism than many
   others, this was its final dogma. The curse of evil clung to all sense
   of individual being. Bliss was only reached by annihilating all the
   conditions of relative existence, and plunging into Nirvâna--the
   Void--or, so far as can be understood, into Annihilation. [24]

   If the Dualism of the Irano-Persian faith perpetuated itself in certain
   forms of Gnosticism, the conception of evil as material existence was
   no less persistent in the speculation of succeeding ages. It may be
   questioned whether Brahmanism or Buddhism exerted any direct influence
   upon Alexandrian philosophy, or the successive forms of what is known
   as Neo-Platonism. But there can be no doubt that it was the same
   thought which repeated itself in those speculations. Evil was
   identified with finite being, or matter per se. Existence of itself
   simply was conceived of as a descent from the Divine. The idea of
   emanation, which underlay both the great oriental systems, was no less
   characteristic of the Alexandrian Gnosis in all its branches. The
   Infinite or pure Being was the only reality--all else was but as the
   shadow or manifestation of the Primal Source; and in the progress of
   descent from this source, evil emerged so soon as the fontal stream of
   spiritual life touched matter. Every successive evolution of the divine
   element grew feebler till it ended in opposition to the Divine. Matter
   and its adjuncts--sensation, desire, bodily affections of whatever
   kind--were all more or less at variance with the Divine, and therefore
   to be resisted as evil. It is needless to point out how pervading this
   thought has been, not only in Gnosticism and various forms of medieval
   mysticism, but throughout the whole history of monasticism, and even
   many practices of ordinary Christian devotion. It has been the latent
   spring of Christian asceticism in all its branches. Evil in such cases
   may not have been exclusively traced to matter, but it has been more or
   less associated with it; and the way to be good has been supposed to
   lie through self-mortification and the triumph of the spirit over the
   desires of the body. The Buddhist doctrine of the annihilation of self,
   extravagant as it may appear when stated in its nakedness, has a deep
   root in human nature; and the thought of evil only passing away when
   all self-feeling has been lost in the Divine, reappears in almost every
   phase of exalted religious feeling. It may receive a purely spiritual
   interpretation; but it is also apt to pass into externality, and to
   confound wrong with certain aspects of the natural life. The activities
   of natural healthfulness, the joys of sense, the joys even of the
   domestic hearth--whatever intensifies the mundane aspects of
   existence--come to be regarded with suspicion as partaking more or less
   of the lower or material sphere of being. All connected with this
   sphere is more or less of the nature of evil. The Good is only reached
   in the negation of nature, and in a supposed spiritual elevation of
   feeling which leaves far behind all mere joys of earth. And so it often
   happens that a mysticism which claims in its very loftiness to be
   peculiarly Christian, falls back by its excess into the Buddhistic or
   Gnostic Error of considering matter and its adjuncts as the source of
   evil. Manifold as are the forms of error, its range of development lies
   along two or three main lines; and these lines are seen constantly
   repeating themselves, sometimes in the most unexpected quarters.

   5. We have spoken of the idea of Evil in the early Hellenic religion
   as. lying alongside the Good in unconscious simplicity. Zeus is the
   father of gods and men, and yet the faithless husband. The free-hearted
   Achilles hates concealment. Ulysses is commended for his clever powers
   of deceit. The moral idea has not worked itself clear from the vague
   indiscriminate aspects of nature or of life in which "all things come
   alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked;
   to the good, and to the clean, and to the unclean." [25] But Hellenic
   thought, it is necessary to remember, is a great history of itself. It
   passes through many stages; and in the course of its development the
   idea of evil becomes greatly deepened, and the conception of a Nemesis
   or moral order rises within it, if not so purely, yet almost as
   conspicuously and majestically as in the Hebrew Prophets. The chief
   sphere of this development is the Greek Tragedy. Behind all the
   activities of life, and all the play of dramatic passion which compose
   this Tragedy, there is a stern background of Righteousness which will
   by no means clear the guilty. A shadowy terror overhangs all
   wrongdoing, and a curse which cannot be turned away pursues the
   offenders. This moral background is the great inspiring ideal of the
   Greek drama, and lends to it its chief grandeur and power. The ideal,
   in its mere force of awe and majesty, may be said to rival that of
   Hebrew thought; but in other and essentially moral respects it falls
   below it. The sphere of moral freedom is recognised but dimly; the
   distinction betwixt voluntary and involuntary evil comes forth but
   darkly and hesitatingly. Nemesis is just, but with a justice that
   spares not; and the darkness of a sublime despair settles on the awful
   scenes of human crime and misery. The moral elevation of Greek Tragedy,
   and the contrasts of right and wrong which it sets forth, are the
   highest and gravest efforts of Gentile thought in a religious
   direction. They bring us to the very verge of Revelation, but they do
   not pass within it. And deep and sad, tender and pathetic, as are its
   pictures of human life and heroic duty, the idea of evil which enters
   into it so largely is yet far short of the idea of sin which emerges on
   the very threshold of the Hebrew Scriptures.

III.

OLD TESTAMENT DOCTRINE OF SIN.

   WHEN we turn from the various systems of Nature-religion, even in their
   most developed form, to Revelation, we find ourselves in a very
   different atmosphere. Whence this atmosphere has come--to what special
   sources we are to trace the higher religious views that here meet
   us--it is no part of our present business to inquire. This would
   involve a treatment of the whole subject of Revelation--what it
   means--how far it is natural, and how far supernatural. It would
   involve, moreover, the treatment of many literary questions regarding
   the books of the Old Testament--their age, origin, authenticity, and
   integrity--all of which we must equally pass by. These are subjects
   belonging to a different branch of Theology from that with which we are
   concerned, and they must be dealt with on their own merits. No one in a
   time like ours, speaking from a scientific point of view, can assume
   such questions to be settled. While we decline to enter upon them,
   therefore, we do not venture to assume the conclusions of one school or
   another regarding them. The dogmatic theologian is not bound to do so.
   He takes the Bible as he finds it. Whatever may be the authorship and
   age of its several books, he sees with sufficient clearness that they
   contain a progressive development of religious thought and sentiment;
   and he has no difficulty in detecting what general elements of this
   thought and sentiment are of earlier and what of later origin. No one
   can doubt, for example--whatever conclusion may be ultimately reached
   as to the origin and composition of the Pentateuch--that the five books
   traditionally attributed to Moses contain the earliest Scriptures, and
   consequently the earliest religious ideas, of the Hebrews. They may or
   may not also contain later elements. The legal and priestly
   institutions which they describe may--some of them at least--belong to
   a period subsequent to that of Moses. But no one who has any historic
   sense can doubt that the narrative pictures of Genesis belong to a more
   primitive type of thought than anything else in the Old Testament, and
   the theologian whose province it is to trace the evolution of Doctrine
   in Scripture is therefore warranted in assuming them as the
   starting-point of his exposition. Even if there be the traces here and
   there of later colouring--of light reflected backwards from a prophetic
   vision which did not reach its fulness till long after the time of
   Moses--this would not affect his conclusions. Here and everywhere he
   must gather together the threads of revealed thought, and discriminate
   its lines of advance with the best skill he can. No traditionary
   conception of Revelation or of the contents of Scripture, however hard
   and fast that conception may be, can save him from this task of
   interpretation, and help him in the discharge of it. The sum of
   revealed truth is to him still only what he finds in Scripture.

   Our present concern is with the development of the idea of sin in Old
   Testament Revelation; and our statement is, that so soon as we come
   within the sphere of this Revelation we find ourselves breathing a
   different atmosphere from that which comes from any of the
   Nature-religions of which we have been speaking. In all of these the
   idea of evil is in some form or another an external idea. It comes to
   man even in its moral guise--in Zoroastrianism and Hellenism--from the
   outside. It is a power which holds him--the shadow of destructive
   Nature-force--or the idealisation of the more complex elements of wrong
   that surround him in life and society. It is hardly, if at all, an
   error of his own mind, or the depravation of his own will. But these,
   on the other hand, are the aspects in which from the first the idea of
   evil comes before us in Scripture. The spectre arises from within and
   not from without. The enemy is in man himself, and not in nature or in
   any symbol drawn from the suggestions of nature or of external life. In
   other words, as soon as we come within the' sphere of Revelation we
   have left nature far behind, and are in front of a human Will. The
   sphere of Revelation is from the beginning the sphere of Morality,
   towards which we have been slowly rising in our upward advance along
   the line of Nature-religion.

   It is impossible not to be struck with this change, not merely as it
   affects man, but as it affects nature. Nature is no longer a
   manifestation of evil powers, or of powers partly evil and partly good.
   The primitive man of Hebrew literature is placed in a garden eastward
   in Eden in which there "grows every tree that is pleasant to the sight
   and good for food." "Every herb which is upon the face of all the
   earth," and "every tree," and "the fowl of the air," and "every living
   thing that moveth upon the earth," are all given into the possession of
   man for rule and enjoyment. Nothing can be further from the picture
   than any shadow of evil influence. "And God saw everything that He had
   made, and, behold, it was very good." [26] Man is planted in the midst
   of these as lord of all. There is no suggestion of conflict--of the
   struggle of good against evil. There is no evil as yet in nature or in
   man.

   It is impossible to conceive a greater contrast to the picture
   presented to us in the dawn of the religious consciousness outside of
   Revelation. And yet this is only one point of the contrast. There are
   others still more important. Not only are nature and man set in a
   different light, but the Divine is, above all, differently conceived.
   The God or Gods of nature are dual or manifold in their conception--the
   wavering reflection of man's varying experience of joy and suffering.
   Their relation to man varies with the promptings of his own heart, and
   the monitions of his intellect feebly groping to comprehend the problem
   of his being. In the Hebrew Scriptures the Divine power is drawn from
   the first with a firm and clear hand, as the creative Source of all
   being, order, and life. "In the beginning God created the heaven and
   the earth;" "and God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And
   God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the
   darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called
   Night." [27]

   It is hardly possible for language to measure the length and breadth of
   advance which is here represented, beyond any stage of religious
   thought that is external to the Scriptures. The great features of
   nature--the heaven and the earth, the light and the darkness--are no
   longer first, but second. A creative Mind whose word is law stands at
   their head. A free Will whose work is Providence calls them into being
   and directs all their movements. Instead of looking with a confused and
   troubled glance upon the dim personalities of man's imagination in the
   earth and sky, the sunshine and storm, here we look beyond heaven and
   earth alike, directly into a region of Divine Intelligence and creative
   Will. And this fundamental difference makes everything else different.
   We are no longer in a region of Nature-shadows, but of moral
   realities,--a Divine Will on one side, and an ordered nature and human
   will on the other side. And it is out of these essential and primary
   relations of being that the conception of sin arises. It is a
   conception which includes evil, and yet is deeper far than any
   conception of evil we have yet reached.

   This will fully appear as we proceed with our exposition,--1st, Of the
   Fall, or primal act of sin, depicted in the third chapter of Genesis;
   2d, Of the several expressions used throughout the Old Testament
   Scriptures to denote sin; and 3d, and more particularly, as we glance
   rapidly at the development of the idea in these Scriptures in its
   relations to the divine law, the divine personality, and the community
   and mankind at large.

   What is known as the Fall, or primal act of sin, not merely stands,
   after the act of creation, at the fountain-Head of Hebrew literature,
   but enters more or less into all the developements of the Hebrew
   religious consciousness. Certain features of the narrative, on the most
   traditionary view that may be taken of it, are obviously figurative.
   They are features, that is to say, of a moral incident; and the
   incident remains the same whether we conceive these features to
   represent external facts or not. This applies especially to the
   supposed action and speech of the serpent, and the virtues attributed
   to "the tree of the knowledge of good and evil." Nothing but confusion
   of thought can arise from attempting to fix a definite meaning on such
   accessories of the incident, [28] all the genuine meaning of which
   arises from the moral portrait which it sets before us. This moral
   portrait is a true expression of the religious thought of the Hebrews,
   and it is their thought as to sin which we are in search of, and with
   which we have now to deal, whatever may be made of the literary vesture
   or form in which that thought is expressed. Here, as elsewhere, the
   reality of the thought is not dependent upon the view we may take of
   the narrative forms in which it is conveyed.

   What, then, is the sum of the moral portrait presented to us in the
   third chapter of Genesis? What are the elements of the primitive
   religious consciousness of the Hebrews on the subject, as here
   depicted? There is, first, the reality of a divine will and of a human
   will in the face of it. The human is the image or reflection of the
   Divine: "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
   likeness." It is true that this is a part of the prior creation
   narrative, and not of the Fall narrative, and that these narratives are
   possibly not from the same original source;--so modern criticism
   assures us. [See [10]Appendix X.] But whether from diverse sources or
   not, it is the same thought they reveal. The man who is tempted in the
   third chapter, is the same man, made in the image of God, spoken of in
   the first. He is a being, that is to say, gifted with reason and moral
   freedom; the image and the subject of God. The command given him in the
   second chapter, which is admitted to belong to the same narrative as
   the third, is an expression of this subjection, and, at the same time,
   of man's responsibility. "And the Lord God commanded the man, saying,
   Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of
   the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the
   day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."

   This command is presupposed in the third chapter, and forms the key to
   its whole meaning. Here, therefore, we have two great moral
   conceptions--conceptions so vital that they lie at the foundation of
   all Scriptural theology and all Scriptural ethics--the divine will
   addressing the human will and intelligence which it has called into
   being; in other words, drawing out still more fully the moral picture
   presented to us. We have (1) the divine will, (2) the expression of
   this will in a divine command or law, and (3) a creaturely will the
   subject of the law; and if all this has as yet nothing to do with sin,
   it is nevertheless the essential background to the idea. It enables us,
   and compels us from the first, to set the idea in its true light, and
   to recognize that its genuine and exclusive meaning is moral, and that
   it vanishes save in front of the Divine as will and law.

   The human will thus placed under authority, and made the subject of a
   revealed command, is first enticed and then yields to disobedience.,
   "Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the
   Lord God" (Jahveh-Elohim) "had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea,
   hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the
   woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of
   the garden: but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the
   garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch
   it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not
   surely die: for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your
   eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
   And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was
   pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she
   took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband
   with her; and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened, and
   they knew that they were naked." [29] And when they heard the voice of
   the Lord God in the garden, they were afraid, and hid themselves.

   Such is the picture of the Fall. It is unnecessary, and would be quite
   useless, to try to give any explanation of its special features;--of
   the serpent; of the form of temptation, and its special nature--whether
   ambition or sensuality; of the growth of sinful desire in the woman,
   her act of disobedience, and the participation of her husband in it; of
   its effects in the awaking of hitherto unknown conditions of shame in
   relation to one another and the divine voice. All these aspects of the
   subject may furnish matters of comment, although I hardly think of
   reasonable or useful comment, to those who care to inquire into them.
   But it is not at all necessary to deal specially with them in order to
   enter into the full meaning of the incident as a moral transaction. The
   sum of this meaning is plainly that the human will, in face of the
   divine command, yields to the force of temptation and external
   inducement, and violates the command. This is the entrance of sin into
   the world--the transgression of the divine law. The will which was made
   subject to law--the happiness of which was to lie within the law, in
   obedience to it--turns against it and seeks its happiness outside of
   the law, in opposition to it. The revolt, moreover, is induced by
   external enticement or influence; in other words, the will or spirit
   becomes subject to evil suggestion and the influence of Nature in place
   of divine law. This is the moral essence of the story. Let us draw out
   more fully its several points. They sum up a world of meaning, which no
   analysis can well exhaust.

   (a.) Evil, as it emerges upon us in the primitive Hebrew consciousness,
   is not something outside of us, but essentially something in us. It is
   the wilful turning away from the Divine, clearly revealed, expressing
   itself clearly and unequivocally in conscience--"Ye shall not eat of
   it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die;" and the wilful yielding to
   Nature or some outside influence--"As good for food, pleasant to the
   eyes, or to be desired to make one wise." It is this that makes the
   evil. The outside--Nature--has only force or power over the will after
   it has yielded from within to it. Or at least, the will must turn from
   the Divine to something else not Divine, before the evil lays hold of
   it. Something else must be desirable in preference before the evil
   emerges. In other words, the good lies in the conformity of the divine
   and human will. The evil can only arise from their nonconformity.

   But it may be said, Is the evil not already posited outside of man in
   the idea of the serpent as the. tempter? Have we not here the evil
   Power already opposed to the good, and man represented as his victim
   snatched by his wiles from the possession and enjoyment of the good?
   The later thought of Jewish theology and the Christian Church, in its
   various branches, have associated the evil personality known as Satan
   or the Devil with the serpent of Genesis. And good reasons may be urged
   for this association. The idea of the serpent tempting man and exciting
   him to evil, points to the idea of an evil Principle having already
   entered into the world and acquired influence in it. The cunning with
   which the serpent works upon the desire of the woman to rise above the
   limits of her creaturely existence, and be as God to whom she is
   rightfully subject, is truly diabolical. No doubt, therefore, was felt
   on this point in the later Jewish Church; and the Christian
   consciousness, which was influenced so largely by Jewish thought,
   readily took up the idea and expanded it. But in the narrative of
   Genesis, taken by itself, there is nothing of this later view. The
   serpent is more subtil than any beast of the field, but nothing more.
   The curse pronounced against him alludes entirely to his animal nature.
   And as a mere matter of historical criticism, therefore, we are not
   warranted in transferring the later conception to the earlier stage of
   Hebrew thought. Whatever we may make of the serpent and his cunning, we
   cannot say that a Power, and still less a Spirit, of evil was already
   conceived by the Hebrew mind as clearly existing outside of man. I do
   not profess to explain fully this feature of the incident. I am content
   to leave many things unexplained in Scripture and elsewhere. Possibly
   there were elements in the Hebrew consciousness, with all its moral
   elevation, which clung to an outside view of evil or the association of
   evil influence with certain aspects or animals of nature. It would be
   strange, indeed, if there were not survivals of the old Nature-worship
   of the Chaldean tribes, cut of which Abraham came, among his
   descendants. All that it is necessary to say here is, that in the
   narrative of the Fall, taken by itself, there is no suggestion of a
   distinct Power of Evil--like that which is found in
   Zoroastrianism--having a share in man no less than the good power. Man
   is not made evil because there is evil already without him, from which
   he cannot escape. He is made evil because he yields from within to the
   gratification of lawless desire externally excited. The object of
   desire is before him. An evil voice whispers to him that the evil is
   good, and the good evil. He listens, yields, and falls under the voice
   of temptation and the prompting of his own desire. But the very fact of
   desire beyond the law is already sin, and without this desire the evil
   would never have laid hold of him. The essential evil does not,
   therefore, come to him from without, but from within. Man makes himself
   a sinner.

   (b) Not only so. Evil, as conceived by the Hebrew religious
   consciousness, is not only from within, a revolt of the self-will from
   the divine will, but it is a self-rejection of an order which is felt
   to be wise and good. It is a fall from an ideal acknowledged to be
   divine. "But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the
   garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch
   it, lest ye die." This is the acknowledgment of the woman. She has no
   doubt of the divine order., It is the way at once of wisdom and of
   pleasantness. The voice of God utters itself unmistakably in the heart;
   but the desire of the eyes, the pleasantness of the outside, of the
   tree fair and beautiful, and apparently "good for food," prevails, and
   the sinful act is consummated. Paradise is lost; the ideal approven by
   the higher nature vanishes, never to be recalled. The knowledge of good
   and evil is indeed gained, but at a price which brings with it only
   shame and confusion of face.

   Nothing can be further from the Biblical conception than any idea of
   evil entering into humanity as a necessary factor in its development.
   The Fall is truly a stumble--in no sense a step in advance. It may be
   that compensation is to be found in it at last, and that the knowledge
   of the evil as well as the good was necessary to carry man forward
   beyond the childlike naivete of the paradisiacal state, in which he
   dwelt in harmony with the Divine above him and nature around him. The
   world of human intelligence, industry, and art, as we know it, may be
   inconceivable in connection with the primitive man. Evil may all along
   have been as necessary to its development as good. The very idea of
   progress may posit the evil as a necessary condition. This may be all
   true: all we say is, that there is no countenance given to such a view
   in the Biblical picture. The suggestion of a higher knowledge as the
   result of disobedience comes from the tempter. It lies within the
   temptation itself as its most powerful spring,--that the intellectual
   nature of the man and woman were to be advanced by the act of
   self-assertion; and the fact of this advance is so far acknowledged
   from the divine side. [30] Man is allowed to have gained in intellect,
   and so far to have come nearer the Divine ("like one of us") by the
   knowledge of evil. But his intellectual gain is his moral loss. The
   suggestion of the tempter is not the less a lie because there happened
   in it to be a side of truth. It was the bait of a richer being--of a
   higher happiness--that he had held before the woman. The bait was not
   altogether deceptive. The being is enlarged by the mental experience of
   evil, but it loses far more than it gains. It loses cheerfiul communion
   with the Divine; it loses the sense of self-approval; it is driven
   forth from Paradise. Adam and Eve have grown at once to the
   consciousness of manhood and womanhood--they are no longer as children
   in a garden--but they are at the same time ashamed of one another, and
   afraid of God. In short, they have fallen; they have lost a sure
   position--they have gained an uncertain future. The idea of a fall, of
   a distinct moral loss not to be recovered, is carefully and completely
   preserved; and whatever later theory may have made of a balance even of
   moral good in the origin of evil, there is nothing to encourage such a
   theory in the early picture. From the moral side--and this is the
   essential side--the picture is dark throughout.

   (c.) All this is more clearly evident from the idea of death associated
   with the picture. The divine prohibition, as to the "fruit of the tree
   in the midst of the garden," was, "Ye shall not eat of it, neither
   shall ye touch it, lest ye die." The suggestion of the tempter was, "Ye
   shall not surely die;" [31] and, finally, the man is driven from the
   garden, lest he "take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for
   ever." [32] Out of these well-known features of the story has come the
   intimate association of death with the Fall--an association frequently
   repeated in Scripture, and which will come before us for special
   consideration in the writings of St. Paul. All that is necessary to say
   now is that, whatever more general interpretation we may put upon these
   intimations, they must be supposed chiefly to point to the moral loss
   or injury involved in the act of disobedience. Death, as a simple
   physical fact, is unaffected by moral conditions. Its character may be
   greatly altered, and no doubt has been greatly altered, by the fact of
   sin; but its incidence is natural, and lies in the constitution of
   things. There is nothing in the passage which makes us think otherwise.
   Death is intimated as the hazard of disobedience, and the idea of
   perpetuated existence is connected with the eating of the tree of life.
   Theologians have pictured the glories of an unfallen state, and the
   immortality of a sinless race; but there is nothing in the Biblical
   text to warrant such pictures. It is nowhere indicated that man would
   have been immortal in Eden if he had not sinned. Physical dissolution
   did not directly follow the act of sin, and is not connected with it as
   immediate cause and effect. What is really always connected with sin is
   the destruction of the higher nature or self, which loses strength and
   dies under the power of evil when once accepted. In the very moment of
   sin it receives this death into itself, [33] for it thereby passes out
   of the condition of spiritual healthfulness, and, in falling below the
   fulness of the divine life which belongs to it, may be said to die. Sin
   is, therefore, not only the loss of an ideal which man might have
   enjoyed, but it is an element of death working destruction in the
   fallen will which has yielded to it, if not immediately, yet not the
   less surely. This was the true loss or penalty incurred by Adam; and
   here, as elsewhere, we are to look for a spiritual and not a literal
   meaning in the narrative. To do otherwise is merely to entangle
   ourselves in hopeless difficulties.

   2. Such are the main features of the Fall, and the same moral features
   appear more or less plainly in the expressions used to denote sin in
   the Old Testament. There is a considerable variety of such expressions,
   but it cannot be said that any clear ethical progress is marked by
   their use. They occur, if not indiscriminately, yet without marking any
   definite advance from period to period of Hebrew thought. Some,
   however, are more general, and others more particular; and it may be
   well to begin with the more general, which at the same time are more
   frequent in occurrence.

   (a.) The most frequent and universal word for sin in the Old Testament
   is chatath, [34] from a verb which originally signifies, exactly like
   its Greek representative in the New Testament, to miss the mark. [35]
   It is used in its primary physical meaning in the Book of Judges, [36]
   where men are spoken of as being each able to sling stones at an
   hair's-breadth "and not miss." Chatath is the term used in the seventh
   verse of the fourth chapter of Genesis, where the expression "sin"
   first occurs in our English version, in reference to the sacrifice of
   Cain. Sometimes in our version it is rendered more precisely fault,
   [37] sometimes trespass, [38] sometimes harm, [39] and blame. [40] The
   idea conveyed in the expression is one of the most rudimentary as well
   as comprehensive in relation to sin--the idea of failure. Whatever sin
   may otherwise be, it is always failure,--a departure from the straight
   road--a missing of the point aimed at, or which should have been aimed
   at. The idea of right, and not merely of success, is implied as the
   correlative of the expression. There is a right--an aim which it is not
   merely an advantage to have achieved, but which ought to be achieved.
   And to miss this aim is not merely to fail in the sense of deficiency,
   but it is to go out of the right way and make a mistake. Man was made
   for the right, and every departure from it is a departure from the true
   purpose for which he was made. And this is the fundamental and
   universal idea of sin conveyed in Scripture.

   (b.) The expression avon [41] is commonly taken as denoting the next
   most characteristic definition of sin. The original meaning is
   crookedness, perversity, from a verb [42] "to bend," "distort," or
   "turn out of the right course." The same rudimentary idea, therefore,
   is so far conveyed here as in the previous expression. As there is a
   right mark or point to be aimed at, so there is always a right line
   towards it. And sin is not only failure as missing the mark, but
   perversity as taking a wrong line. The divine life springing from its
   fountain-head is not only the creative, but is designed to be also the
   directive principle, both of humanity and the world; and sin arises
   whenever the course of this life is turned aside and deflected. There
   seems a deeper moral meaning, therefore, in this expression--the idea
   not only of failure which might arise from mere deficiency and lack of
   strength, but of intentional wrongness. And, upon the whole, the use of
   the expression bears out this deeper meaning. It is the expression
   applied by Cain to his own sin, when he has heard the curse pronounced
   against him, and begins to realise its true magnitude. [43] It is the
   word also used by Judah when he and his brethren stand before Joseph
   arraigned for having carried away his cup, which had been found in
   Benjamin's sack. "And Judah said, What shall we speak? or how shall we
   clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants." [44]
   It is still more significantly used in the Psalms--as, for example, in
   the thirty-second and fifty-first Psalms, both of which are indeed
   storehouses of all the main expressions denoting sin. "Blessed is he
   whose transgression" (pesha) "is forgiven, whose sin" (chätaah) "is
   covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity"
   (avon). "I acknowledged my sin" (cattathi) "unto Thee, and mine
   iniquity" (avoni) "have I not hid. I said, I will confess my
   transgressions" (peshaai) "unto the Lord; and Thou forgavest the
   iniquity of my sin" (avon chattathi). [45] Again: "Wash me thoroughly
   from mine iniquity" (avoni), "and cleanse me from my sin" (chattathi).
   "For I acknowledge my transgressions" (peshaai): "and my sin"
   (chattathi) "is ever before me. Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned"
   (the ordinary verb chata), "and done this evil" (ra) "in thy sight. . .
   Behold, I was shapen in iniquity" (avon); "and in sin" (chet) [46] "did
   my mother conceive me." [47]

   It is unnecessary to enter into further details, or to press any
   additional force that may seem to be in this expression. It would be
   too much to say that it is always discriminated from the former word by
   a precise shade of meaning--as, for example, in the last words quoted
   from the Psalmist's confession of sin. We nowhere find in the language
   of moral experience such precise adjustments of meaning--no more in
   Hebrew or Greek than in our own language. On the contrary, the
   expressions have a tendency to pass into one another, and to become
   mixed in their application, just as the words "sin" and "iniquity" with
   us. The former, however, remains the more general, the latter the more
   special expression. And it is the same with the Hebrew equivalents. The
   idea of wrongness in fact--failure, missing the mark--and the idea of
   wrongness in intention--injustice, iniquity--are the ideas respectively
   conveyed. And this reference to the will implied in the last word gives
   it a deeper shade of meaning. It brings out more prominently the moral
   character of the act, and fixes it home upon the sinner. And hence the
   word passes naturally into the idea of "guilt," for which it is often
   used in the earlier Scriptures; as in the expressions, "The iniquity"
   or guilt "of the Amorites is not yet full;" [48] "Visiting the
   iniquity" or guilt "of the fathers upon . . . the third generation;"
   [49] and again, in a passage where we have, as in the passage quoted
   from the Psalms, all the three expressions close together. "Forgiving
   iniquity" (guilt), and "transgression and sin." [50]

   (c.) There is another word, aven, [51] which is very often translated
   in our version "iniquity," [52] but which primarily means "vanity" and
   "nothingness." [53] As applied to our subject, it seems to convey the
   idea of the unreality or nothingness of all evil or opposition to the
   Divine. Powerful or successful as it may seem for a time, it must prove
   in the end unprofitable and vain.

   (d.) But a more important word is that which we have already found so
   often associated both with chattath and avon--viz., pesha, [54] which
   our translators have generally rendered transgression, sometimes
   trespass, [55] sometimes rebellion. [56] These renderings as nearly as
   possible convey the meaning of the word, which seems always to imply as
   its background the idea of a divine law, which has been broken or
   transgressed. There is here, therefore, also a strongly personal or
   moral meaning. All sorts of sins, acts of weakness, negligence, or
   carelessness, are implied in the primary expression chattath; but sins
   of design and violent purpose are specially implied by pesha. There is
   no passage brings this out more fully than the one in Job already
   indicated along with others--a passage which is translated in our
   version, "For he addeth rebellion" (pesha) ("unto his sin" (chattatho).

   (e.) In addition to these words, there are the general expression ra,
   [57] denoting evil in all senses, physical, ethical, and accidental,
   [58] and resha, [59] commonly rendered wickedness, from a root to make
   a noise or tumult. This term is supposed to express the disposition of
   evil--evil become a habit--or the quality of unrighteousness, just as
   tzedek [60] is the quality of righteousness.

   (f.) There is still a further word which claims attention before we
   close this analysis--viz., asham, [61] generally translated in our
   version as trespass or guilt, and carefully discriminated from chattath
   in its application to the Mosaic sacrifices; the one denoting the
   sin-offering, and the other the trespass-offering. Asham is derived
   from a root (asham) which means to fail, having for "its primary idea
   negligence, especially in going or gait." (Gesen.) It seems to have
   everywhere a more special meaning than chattath, as indeed all the
   other words we have been considering have. The specialty in this case
   seems to point to definite acts of sin, violations of law and
   commandment which have been brought home to the offender or
   offenders--for example, in the forty-second chapter of the Book of
   Genesis, [62] where we have one of the first and most typical uses of
   the word. It is when the offence committed against Joseph flashes
   suddenly on the minds of his brethren, under the force of his demand to
   bring Benjamin into Egypt, that they say one to another, "We are verily
   guilty" (ashemin) "concerning our brother." Frequently the word is used
   in reference to public sins, as when the numbering of the people is
   spoken of in the First Book of Chronicles [63] as a cause of trespass
   (asham) to Israel; and still more frequently for sin, either ignorant
   or wilful, against definite prohibitions of the law. [64] In the
   sixty-ninth Psalm [65] it is used to denote particular acts of sin: "O
   God, Thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from Thee."

   It is unnecessary to dwell further upon these details,-the chief
   interest of which consists in the various and dispersing light which
   they throw around the idea of sin. v All of them from the most general
   to the most particular, imply a moral significance; in other words,
   they connect the idea of sin with a human personality--some of them
   more closely than others, but all of them more or less. To "miss a
   mark," "to deviate from the straight road," "to break some rule or
   law," all involve definitely the action of an intelligent will, which
   not only might have done otherwise, but which ought to have done
   otherwise. In some cases the mistake, deviation, or transgression may
   not have been of purpose, but rather the result of weakness,
   negligence, or carelessness. But in no case is it suggested that the
   sinful act was inevitable or necessary, or, in other words, that the
   evil coming forth in human actions was beyond man's control, or a mere
   part of his nature wielded from without. In most cases the act is
   expressly referred to the free will or personality of the actor, and
   condemned as such. A moral meaning in the act is therefore everywhere
   asserted.

   3. When wet turn finally to view the subject under the successive
   phases of the Old Testament religion, this character of sin still more
   clearly appears. It everywhere comes forth as an act of the human will
   done against the divine will, or some special institutions supposed to
   represent the divine will. Sometimes the sinful act is more prominently
   held forth in relation to God as Supreme Creator and Governor, as Head
   of the world, and the Lord and Sovereign of men. This is the pervading
   idea of Genesis. "And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive
   with man. . . . And God saw that the wickedness" (ra) "of man was great
   in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart
   was only evil" (ra) "continually." [66] In such statements as these,
   and generally throughout the earlier portions of the divine Revelation,
   the conception of sin is more objective and general. It is something
   wrong in the disposition or state of man towards the Divine, something
   always for which man is responsible. But there is no analysis of the
   conception, beyond the fact that it is at variance with the divine
   order.

   As we advance beyond the simple imaginations of the Patriarchal to the
   more elaborate culture of the Mosaic times, the conception both-
   deepens in moral significance and acquires a more varied emphasis. If
   we are allowed to bring into view the ample machinery of the so-called
   Mosaic legislation, it is needless to point out how greatly the idea of
   sin must have become enlarged, or at least widened, in the face of that
   legislation. The different orders of sacrifice, and the minutiae of the
   ceremonial and social laws of the Hebrews, all point to special kinds
   of sin, called into vivid recognition by the theocratic restrictions
   everywhere encompassing the chosen people. An authoritative divine
   ritual touching the national life at every point necessarily diffused a
   widespread sense of obligation, which too frequently remained
   unfulfilled. A danger, it is true, lay in this very diffusion,
   illustrated by the Hebrew history as by all sacerdotal history. The
   numerous Levitical ordinances had a tendency to draw the sense of sin
   towards the surface, and so far to empty it of moral meaning--a result
   more or less seen in every species of sacerdotalism. When men are led
   to concentrate religious attention upon external acts, they begin to
   lose something of inward depth and spiritual reality; and religion
   often perishes in the very multitude of religious forms. The history of
   the Jewish religion is certainly no exception to this rule.

   Should we not feel warranted in attributing all the ceremonial and
   sacerdotal legislation of the Pentateuch to the time of Moses, Mosaism
   yet remains a great institution, powerful in moral influence. The ten
   "words" or commandments which even the most advanced criticism carries
   up to Moses, are in literature the most profound and comprehensive
   expression of that great order which encompasses all moral life. The
   moral law powerfully contributed to awaken the inner sense of the
   Hebrew people, and deepen their consciousness of sin. The Divine is
   presented in it not merely as Sovereign and Lord--although this is the
   opening key-note [67] --but as identified with every aspect of order,
   truth, righteousness, and purity in human life, A moral ideal not only
   invests all life, but is carried up to Jahveh-Elohim as the Source of
   this life and its highest Exemplar. It was impossible to dwell in the
   light of such an ideal and not to have had the spiritual sense
   quickened and made sensitive, and the feeling of offence towards the
   Divine called forth in many ways hitherto little understood or owned.
   This is what St. Paul means when he says that "the law entered that the
   offence might abound;" [68] and again, that "without the law sin was
   dead." [69] He is speaking of his own experience, or of the experience
   of a devout Jew in his own time; but the experience of the religious
   nature is always so far the same--nay, the experience of the individual
   is typical of the race. When the law entered into the consciousness of
   Humanity, and was added to the progressive force of divine Revelation,
   the sense of sin was deepened alongside of it. Conscience became alive
   in front of the divine commandment, and spiritual life was touched to
   its depths by that sad undertone of sin which has never died out of it.
   Through ages, the moral law has been the most powerful moral factor of
   humanity, restraining its chaotic tendencies, and binding it into
   harmonies of domestic, social, and religious well-being. It has lain
   not merely upon the human conscience, but entered into the human heart
   as one of its most living inward springs-bracing its weakness, rebuking
   its laxity, holding before it an inflexible rule of moral good. Words
   cannot measure the strength which it has been to all the higher
   qualities of the race, and the widespread moral education which it has
   diffused--discriminating and purifying the ideas alike of good and evil
   wherever it has prevailed, and clothing life with a reality and depth
   of meaning which it would never otherwise have possessed.

   With the development of Hebrew thought in the prophetic writings and
   the Psalms, all the special characteristics of sin come out yet more
   prominently. The prophetic order in its highest signification was
   nothing else than a living witness for those eternal principles of
   righteousness which previous Revelation had implanted in the Hebrew
   race, and through them in the life of Humanity. The prophets were the
   preachers of that holy religion of Jahveh which, beginning with
   Abraham, instituted by Moses, and consolidated by David and Solomon,
   runs through Hebrew history with all its vacillations and reversions as
   a golden thread, making it a power of spiritual elevation and blessing
   for the world. Continually, when the national consciousness of the
   Divine sank or became perverted, it was revived, reinforced, and once
   more turned in a right direction. The reality of the divine government
   under which Israel lived, of the exclusive claims of the worship of
   Jahveh, and of the essential antagonism betwixt this worship and all
   deeds of sinful disorder and impurity, was once more awakened and
   brought into the clear light of national recognition. This was the work
   of the prophets more than all others.: It was they who kept alive the
   moral thoughtfulness of the chosen people. The priestly sacrifices and
   ordinances, valuable as they were, were apt, like all forms of ritual,
   to degenerate into formalities. In themselves, they were not and could
   not be sources of spiritual good--it was only the divine feeling which
   lay behind their use which gave them any religious value; and when this
   feeling failed, they helped to choke it up and externalise it rather
   than to call it forth afresh. The law was a constant monition of divine
   duty; but, as the frequent lapses into idolatry prove, its very first
   word was too often forgotten and powerless. Neither the priestly nor
   the moral side of Mosaism, it may be said, could have preserved in any
   purity the religious thought of Hebraism, surrounded as it was by so
   many depressing influences, to which it was continually yielding. It
   required a distinct force to renovate and recruit it from time to time.
   And this it found in prophecy, which for more than six hundred years
   was its most powerful element of religious revival, and remains to this
   day the most vital factor of Hebrew literature. [See [11]Appendix XI.]

   With this continual revival of divine consciousness in the Hebrew
   people the consciousness of sin revived, deepened, and became more
   real. It was felt as an offence not merely against divine law or
   precept, but against a Divine Person, a living One who had claims upon
   the life of all His servants, and the violation of whose commandments
   was disobedience of His will. The prophet was always the messenger of
   God. The word of God came unto him, and he could not but utter it. He
   was not only the preacher of the law and its righteous demands, but he
   was the direct organ of the divine voice and will; and through him the
   sense of a supreme personal authority, whom it was sin to disobey, was
   brought near to the Hebrew mind. There cannot be a better illustration
   of this than the fifty-first Psalm, which represents the results of the
   dealing of the prophet Nathan with David in the matter of Bathsheba. An
   act of definite transgression is not only brought home to the
   conscience of the king, but conscience is quickened throughout, and the
   divine presence made so living to it that every other aspect of the
   king's conduct disappears in the overwhelming sense that it was
   sin--against the law, indeed, but above all against the author of the
   law--against God Himself. "For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my
   sin is ever before me. Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned, and done
   this evil in Thy sight; that Thou mightest be justified when Thou
   speakest, and be clear when Thou judgest. Behold, I was shapen in
   iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me." [70] There is no more
   comprehensive or individual expression of sin in all the Old Testament
   Scriptures. It is a definite act of transgression or violation of law;
   it is a consciousness of guilt ever before the awakened soul; it is,
   more than all, a consciousness of offence against God, who has given
   the law, and who has endowed the soul with the capacity of serving Him.
   Withal it is the outcome of an evil nature. Sin is personal, and the
   sinner without excuse. Yet its origin lies beyond the individual will.
   It is an inheritance of nature which comes to us with our birth. All
   these aspects of the subject are presented in the verses I have quoted,
   which occur irresistibly to the student of Scripture in speaking of it.
   There is no thought of definition. The different sides of the subject
   are not put forward in any systematic relation to one another. They
   come forth only as the cries of a manifold experience which knows and
   thinks of nothing but the burden which it bears. And so the same
   experience repeats itself--if not in the same comprehensive manner--in
   many an utterance of Psalm and prophecy. Wherever the voice of the
   prophet was heard sounding the depth of the souls that he addressed,
   there was the response of repentance and confession: "I acknowledge my
   transgression." "Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned." The fact of
   divine law came near to the sinner; the fact of the divine presence
   overwhelmed him. The thought of God evoked the consciousness of sin,
   and drove it home upon the sinner's heart.

   The same word of prophecy brought out more distinctly than before the
   universality of sin, and its persistence in the nation and the world.
   The prophet was a preacher of righteousness to the individual
   conscience. But he was even more a national preacher and reformer. He
   put himself forward as a public man, and dealt with all the aspects of
   public life. He was, as has been said, [71] "a power in the nation,"
   and all the elements of national life are graphically depicted in his
   pages. It is impossible to peruse these pages without recognising how
   pervading a presence evil is everywhere felt to be. It is a state and
   quality diffused throughout the nation--a characteristic of humanity.
   While originating in individual self-will, it is not merely the result
   of will in every particular case, but has so permeated the mass of
   human nature, that its thoughts are evil, and only evil. This
   conception of pervasive influence of sin goes back, indeed, to the very
   opening of Revelation, as shown in the words of Genesis already quoted
   [72] regarding the Flood. It is of the nature of sin to multiply and
   diffuse its power, repeating itself by example and a degraded tone of
   general feeling. And pervading as its influence, are its fatal
   consequences. Like a subtle poison, it not only contaminates and
   injures the individual, but the family, the tribe, the race. It kills
   wherever it spreads. Its original penalty is an inherent penalty. It
   works death by its own direct action, cutting off the life of man from
   God--the only source of life--and leaving behind only a perverted and
   self-destroying image of human activity.

   As a whole, we may sum up the doctrine of the Old Testament as follows,
   gathering into one view the results of our analysis:--

   (1.) The Hebrew conception of evil is distinctively moral. It is the
   disobedience of the human will against the Divine expressed in the form
   of command, revelation, or law. In other words, it is what we specially
   mean by sin.

   (2.) It is not only a violation of divine law, but a rejection of
   divine good.

   (3.) All sin is in its nature destructive. It bears death in it as its
   natural working or outcome.

   (4.) It is not merely individual, but diffusive. Having once entered
   into human nature, it becomes a part of it, an hereditary taint,
   passing from generation to generation, often with accelerated force.

   (5.) It is connected with a power or powers of evil outside of man, the
   character and influence of which are as yet but dimly revealed.

   (6.) And to these several points of our summary we may add a further,
   which has been emphasised by certain expositors of the religion of
   Israel. Evil is also connected with the will of Jahveh as the supreme
   source of all energy and all events. Facts of evil (ra), no less than
   of good, are traced upwards to the Almighty Will, as the ultimate
   source of all things. [73] This is true beyond all question; but it
   exceeds the truth to say, as Kuenen does, [74] that the older
   Israelitish prophets and historians did not hesitate to derive even
   moral evil from Jahveh. Precise distinctions of morality and
   contingency were unfamiliar to the Hebrew mind; and at no time would
   this mind have shrunk from attributing every form of evil accident
   (however immediately caused by human wickedness) to the Sovereign
   Power, which did as it willed in heaven and on earth. But it is
   nevertheless true, as has been clearly seen in the course of our
   exposition, that the essential idea of evil in the Hebrew mind was so
   far from associating itself with the Divine Will, that its special note
   or characteristic was opposition to this Will. The line of later
   argument, as to a possible relation of the Divine Will to sin (whereby
   its omnipotence and yet its purity should be preserved), is foreign to
   the Old Testament. It grasps events concretely; it does not analyse
   them in their origin or nature; and so, while it hesitates not to
   ascribe all evil as matter of fact, and as part of the universal
   providence which governs the world, to the Divine Will, it never fails
   to set forth sin as springing out of the depths of human personality in
   opposition to the Divine. This idea is stamped on every page of the Old
   Testament, and no concrete figures of prophetic rhetoric can be allowed
   to efface so clear and deep an impression.

IV.

DOCTRINE OF SIN AS CONTAINED IN THE GOSPELS.

   IN passing to the Christian revelation and the doctrine of sin laid
   down in the New Testament Scriptures, we carry with us the same moral
   atmosphere as in the Old Testament. We are everywhere in the same
   region of divine law and of personal responsibility. Whatever
   Christianity may be more than Mosaism and Judaism, it embraces at least
   all the moral truth which they contained. The spiritual consciousness
   of righteousness, and of sin as its violation, which has accumulated in
   the long education of the chosen people, is passed over in its full
   import to the Christian Church, which, in spiritual experience and
   organic development, is the direct descendant of the Jewish Church.
   Much besides enters from the first into Christianity,--a new power of
   life from above--a new creative force; but it loses nothing of the
   moral experience which has been growing for ages in the Jewish race. It
   takes this all up, appropriates, enlarges, and purifies it. In this
   respect conspicuously Christ came not "to destroy, but to fulfil." Upon
   this inherited experience of divine law, moral motive, and personal
   responsibility to a higher will, He took His stand and began His work
   as a Teacher and a Saviour.

   It is this organic connection betwixt the Old and the New Testament,
   and the moral truths which underlie both and make so much of their
   substance, which compels the theologian to deal with both spheres of
   Revelation, and seek for the elucidation of Christian truth not only in
   the pages of the New Testament, but in the pre-Christian pages of the
   Old. All who ignore this connection will be found to misconceive one or
   other of these spheres, and to mistake the unity of the divine plan for
   the education of our race. The connection will be found to hold more or
   less in reference to all Christian doctrines, even those which seem at
   first most removed from the Hebrew consciousness; but in the case of
   the doctrine with which we are dealing, it holds in a special manner.
   The Christian doctrine of sin is at least all the doctrine which we
   have found in the Old Testament. It may contain--it does, as we shall
   find, contain--more than we have drawn from the latter. There is new
   and further and higher light thrown upon man's moral condition by the
   teaching of our Lord and of His apostles. But what we have already
   reached is also found in their teaching, and forms everywhere its
   basis, asserted or implied; and hence the necessity of our dwelling, as
   we did in a separate Lecture, on the Old Testament view of sin. In
   doing so, we were dealing not merely with necessary preliminary matter,
   but we had already entered within that continuous line of thought and
   experience which issues in the full Christian doctrine, and forms such
   an essential part of it that without it the Christian doctrine cannot
   be fully comprehended.

   In the exposition of the fully-developed doctrine of the New Testament
   Scriptures, there are at least two main aspects in which we must
   consider it--viz., first, as presented in our Lord's teaching, as given
   in the Gospels; and second, as elaborately set forth and explained in
   the Epistles of St. Paul. I am quite aware that this is an inadequate
   division or classification of the New Testament writings for general
   dogmatic purposes. The type of doctrine presented in the fourth Gospel
   is so separable from that presented in the synoptics,--and the writings
   of St. John--the Gospels and the Epistles, I mean--stand so obviously
   by themselves in a more advanced line of thought than all the other
   writings of the Christian Scriptures,--that their dogmatic meaning
   demands almost always separate treatment. There may be said to be at
   least the three following types of thought in the New Testament: (1)
   The Judæo-Christian, represented by the first two synoptics, the
   Epistle of James, and, less definitely, the Epistles of St. Peter and
   Jude; (2) the Pauline, represented, in addition to the Epistles of the
   great apostle, by the Gospel of St. Luke and the Acts of the Apostles;
   and (3) the Johannean, represented by the fourth Gospel and the three
   Epistles of St. John. There are few dogmas of the Christian system upon
   which this last group, or the writings of St. John, have not a
   distinctive bearing, or a bearing so special as to demand special
   notice. But as regards the present subject, this cannot be said to be
   the case, for the simple reason that the experience of sin was a common
   inheritance in all the sections of the infant Church. It was nothing
   new--something, indeed, very old--which they knew as Jews, no less than
   as Christians. There was nothing, therefore, to make the
   sin-consciousness different in the different apostles, or to make their
   mode of representing our Lord's teaching regarding it marked by more
   than casual diversity. Upon the whole, it is essentially the same
   picture in this respect that we have in all the four Gospels. There may
   be distinctions to be noticed, but these distinctions do not affect the
   substance of the representation. We are warranted, therefore, in taking
   together all that the Gospels have to say regarding sin; or in viewing
   our Lord's teaching on this subject in all the four as one complete
   picture. The doctrine of St. Paul deserves separate treatment, not as
   being different from that of the Gospels, but as being so expanded and
   elaborate that it can only be handled adequately by itself. The great
   apostle, in consistency with his deeper experience and more varied
   culture, dwells specially, and at length, upon the subject, and in a
   critical and explanatory manner quite different from that of the
   Gospels. He enters not only into an analysis of the fact, but into what
   may be called its philosophy, and so sets forth a comprehensive
   doctrine, which has powerfully moulded the thought of the Church in all
   subsequent ages. Our remaining Lectures will be fully occupied in the
   consideration of this doctrine.

   In approaching the present aspect of our subject, we are met at the
   outset not only with the accumulated moral experience derived from the
   Old Testament, but, moreover, with a new or at least more clearly
   developed background of evil. In the Old Testament, evil appears mainly
   as an inward or subjective conception. The primal sin, although
   prompted by evil influence from without, is conspicuously inward and
   moral; everywhere it is the thoughts of men's hearts or the motions of
   their will, that are evil and obnoxious to God. It is strange how
   little is seen of any evil Power outside the human will, or any
   background of a kingdom of evil moving men from without. The connection
   of Satan, or the evil Power, with the serpent in the Garden of Eden, is
   an inference of later dogmatic opinion, arising naturally out of the
   circumstances and the expressions which are afterwards used in the New
   Testament regarding "that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan;"
   [75] but not only is there no mention of Satan in the narrative of the
   Fall, but the name does not occur in all the Pentateuch, or any of the
   earlier Hebrew Scriptures. The expression is, at the most, only used as
   a proper name five times in the Old Testament--viz., in the opening of
   the twenty-first chapter of the First Book of Chronicles; [76] in three
   well-known places in Job, [77] and in the prophecy of Zechariah, in the
   opening of the third chapter, where Joshua the high priest is
   represented as "standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan
   standing at his right hand to resist him." In all the other places in
   which the word occurs, it is used in its simple meaning of "adversary,"
   a sense in which it is also used in the Gospels. [78]

   Even the most expressive of these Old Testament passages gives us no
   definite idea of a spiritual Power of evil outside of man, and
   subjecting man to his control. In the prologue of the Book of Job,
   Satan is represented, with sufficient clearness, as a distinct being or
   personal existence. But the picture of his character and of his
   employment is neither imposing nor spiritual. He is not a grand or
   impressive figure. He comes among the "sons of God" to present himself
   before the Lord. He is the image of restlessness, of malice, and of
   envy--the willing envoy of inflicting mischief upon Job; but he has no
   semblance of the "Archangel ruined," nor does he assail the patriarch
   with spiritual weapons. No power of spiritual injury is ascribed to
   him. He is a delegated Agent in the hands of God, sent forth by Him to
   execute His purposes; and the power which he exercises is only a power
   over outward circumstances.

   So soon as we come within the sphere of New Testament Revelation, a
   very different picture is presented to us. From the first there is here
   depicted a clear and powerful background of evil--a kingdom of evil
   spirits or "demons," with a prince or ruler at their head, designated
   by various names, as "the Devil," "the Tempter," [79] "Satan," [80]
   "Beelzebub," [81] "the Prince of Devils," [82] "the Strong One," [83]
   "the Wicked One," [84] "the Enemy," or "the Hostile One." [85] The
   first three epithets are all used in what may be called the primitive
   account of our Lord's temptation, in the fourth chapter of St.
   Matthew's Gospel; and throughout the Gospels the words "Satan," "the
   Devil," "the Wicked One," "Beelzebub," "the Prince of Devils" (or, as
   the translation ought to have been here, as elsewhere, "Demons"), are
   used interchangeably. There can be no question, therefore, of the
   recognition in the Gospels of an active Power or Principle of evil
   outside of man, and exercising influence over him. It may be said that
   our Lord nowhere makes known the existence of such an evil Power as a
   point of doctrine. He assumes the current belief among the Jews of His
   time, rather than sets forth any new doctrine on the subject. This is
   true. But it is equally true that He clearly assumes the reality of
   such a Power; and both in His intercourse with His disciples and in His
   arguments with His opponents, uses language the natural meaning of
   which places the reality of a kingdom of evil beyond dispute.

   With any further questions pertaining to the character of this kingdom,
   the personality of its head and subordinate members, their origin,
   their agency, and mode of influence, we are not now concerned. These
   questions do not enter essentially into the consideration of our
   subject. It was necessary to bring so much into view, if for no other
   purpose than to show the somewhat different atmosphere as to the
   general question of evil which meets us in the New Testament. What at
   the utmost can only-be considered suggestions in the Old Testament,
   stand forth as clear intimations in the Christian Revelation. Evil is
   here before us from the first, and prominently, not merely as a
   characteristic of humanity and the moral atmosphere in which humanity
   moves, but as a supernatural element of affecting the world and man
   from the outside. Temptation is no longer merely a reality, addressing
   man's sense or soliciting man's will--that lies in its nature
   always--but it is a living Power, the representative of a kingdom
   hostile to the Divine, and hostile to man as the offspring of the
   Divine. All this may be equally true from the beginning, and may, as
   our dogmatic systems suppose, be the only adequate explanation of the
   primary sin and fall of man. But the fact is not made clear in the Old
   Testament by itself--is not made to fix our attention as in the New.
   Here only it is we meet in full the idea of a Power of evil fronting
   the Divine in implacable hostility, and encompassing man as his
   everactive enemy and tempter.

   It is important, at the same time, to notice how the idea of such a
   Power in the New Testament, however it may be designated or described,
   is discriminated from the evil Principle of the Persian religion to
   which we formerly adverted, and with which it has by certain writers
   been confounded, or at least brought into comparison. Some have not
   hesitated to trace the origin of the New Testament conception to the
   intercourse of the Jews with the Persians, and the influence naturally
   exercised upon them by Persian modes of thought. It is difficult to say
   whether the Jewish mind did not receive some impulse towards the whole
   subject of Angelology, and especially the existence of evil spirits,
   from their Persian neighbours, or the general stream of thought
   regarding the Supernatural which was filtrating from this quarter into
   the religious mind of the time. As with other curious questions lying
   alongside of our subject, we do not venture to enter upon this, and the
   less reluctantly that nothing definite or satisfactory can be said
   regarding it. This, however, is plainly evident, that the Jewish
   conception of Satan is greatly distinguished from the Zoroastrian
   conception of Ahriman (Anra-Mainyus). The latter is a twin spirit with
   Ormuzd (Ahura-Mazda), the good Power--apparently coequal, and no less
   concerned than the good in the production of the world. The warfare of
   the two is a warfare as of balanced forces. The world and human nature
   are conceived as arising out of their joint action or conflict. On the
   contrary, Satan is represented everywhere in the New Testament as
   indeed the enemy of God, yet subordinate and inferior to Him. His power
   is a real power; it is a power of dread and danger, capable of
   assailing Jesus himself, "the Holy One and the Just:" yet it is always
   limited and subordinate to a higher divine purpose. [86] Above all, it
   has no control of man, save through his own yielding. Evil, in short,
   even as impersonated in Satan, can only get near to man along the line
   of his own will. The Evil has no creative or original share in him.
   Satan is not, like Anra-Mainyus, concerned in his being from the first:
   and no part of his being, material or spiritual, is essentially evil,
   or a necessary prey to evil influence. The idea of matter as in itself
   evil, or the hopeless sphere of evil, underlies not only the Persian
   mythology, but all the numerous modes of thought so rife in the first
   ages of the Church, which have more or less affinity to it. There is
   not a trace of this in the Gospels. The Powers of evil, with Satan at
   their head, are everywhere conceived as moral Powers-Powers lying
   outside of the material cosmos, and while working through it, in no
   sense embedded within it or identified with it. The essential morality
   of the evangelical conception separates it, therefore, entirely from
   the Persian, and places it on a higher level.

   This point is all the more significant, that the Persian conception of
   matter as hopelessly corrupt, and itself the evil, had beyond doubt
   extended itself in the time of our Lord, within the sphere of Judaism,
   and formed a characteristic tenet of one of its three prominent sects.
   The Essenes were not only ascetics, separated from both Pharisees and
   Sadducees by certain practical observances regarding food and marriage,
   and other social restrictions, but, as recent investigation has clearly
   shown, [87] were also Gnostics, animated in their ascetical rigidities
   by the speculative principle of the abhorrence of matter as the abode
   of evil. This idea, therefore, like many others, was in the
   intellectual atmosphere of the time; and if certain modern views of the
   origin of Christianity were true, it would almost certainly have been
   found in the Gospels. Yet, as we have said, there is not a trace of it
   there. The taint of Nature-religion is entirely absent, even where the
   thought of the Gospels comes directly into contact with the thought of
   the age, circulating from Aryan no less than Semitic, sources. It does
   not cling even to the skirts of the evangelical doctrine. The
   conception of Satan, like every other element of revealed religion, is
   a moral and not a natural conception, having all its true life and
   influence within the higher sphere.

   And this also it is which renders it unnecessary that we should dwell
   further upon the background of evil brought out so prominently in the
   Gospels and throughout the New Testament Scriptures. Whatever
   conclusions we may form as to its character and influence, cannot
   affect the special truths which sum up the Christian doctrine of sin.
   Whatever be the Power or Powers of evil outside of man recognised in
   the New Testament, sin remains in its contents essentially the same.
   The hidden Powers of evil supposed to encompass man can only assail him
   from within. Their influence is spiritual, and is only operative within
   the free spiritual life which belongs to every man. This is the
   constant representation of the New Testament. There is no element of
   necessity or constraint in the picture of diabolic influence; or, if
   there is, by the very same fact, the idea of sin disappears, and that
   of mere misfortune or calamity emerges. In short, whatever be its
   accidents, sin is seen as clearly as ever--and, indeed, more clearly
   than ever--to be rooted in the personal will of man--the product of his
   own self-determining agency. It appears, if not more plainly, yet more
   fully, as the wilful transgression of law which is divine, not merely
   by imposition, but by intuition. God Himself is brought more close to
   the individual conscience as Authority and Lawgiver, but also, and
   especially, as Father,--a living Spirit of Love, whose will is at once
   man's law and man's good.

   1. In the representation of sin given by our Lord in the Gospels, the
   first point that claims attention is the manner in which He intensifies
   the Old Testament idea of it, as deviation from or transgression of
   law. The expressions used to describe sin are the direct equivalents in
   Greek of the Hebrew expressions noticed in last Lecture. The most
   general expression conveys the same idea of failure or missing a mark
   as the Hebrew expression chattath formerly discussed. [88] This is the
   expression used in the case of the "man sick of the palsy," whom our
   Lord cures in the opening of His ministry: "Son, be of good cheer; thy
   sins [89] be forgiven thee." Again, in the well-known passage,
   "Wherefore I say unto you, Every sin [90] and blasphemy shall be
   forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not
   be forgiven unto men." Again, very expressively, "Whosoever committeth
   sin is the servant of sin;" [91] and, "And when He is come, He will
   reprove the world of sin." [92] The expression rendered by our
   translators "inquity," and which more precisely means negation or
   violation of law, is also used in St. Matthew, both with and without
   the article--as, for example, in the following passages: "Depart from
   me, ye that work iniquity;" "They" (the angels) "shall gather out of
   His kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity." [93]
   The Pharisees are said to be "full of hypocrisy and iniquity." [94] The
   original of the familiar word trespasses, [95] so associated with the
   Lord's Prayer, deserves also to be mentioned in connection with the
   Gospels. The expression, however, does not occur in the Lord's Prayer
   itself; either in St. Matthew or St. Luke, but in the significant
   verses immediately following the prayer in St. Matthew's Gospel, [96]
   and the corresponding passage in St. Mark. [97] The expression used in
   the Lord's Prayer in the first Gospel is peculiar, and marks a peculiar
   shade of meaning--viz., "debts;" [98] the idea being that sins are
   chargeable against us as debts are, and that, if not forgiven, they
   must be paid in full. The language of the prayer as given in the Gospel
   of St. Luke, less frequently used than other forms of it, brings out
   the close connection betwixt sins designated by the ordinary expression
   and the idea of indebtedness: "And forgive us our sins, for we also
   forgive every one that is indebted to us." [99]

   Such is the general description of sin in the Gospels, answering nearly
   to what we have already found in the Old Testament. But a mere
   enumeration of words and their specific meanings gives but a poor
   account of the deeper meaning which our Lord's teaching throws into the
   subject. It is only when we bring into view this higher conception of
   the standard or law which marks failure, deviation, or transgression,
   that we see how far more penetrating is His conception of sin, even as
   a breach of law.

   The law was not to Him, as it had become to the ordinary Jewish mind of
   whatever school--a mere letter of commands or of prohibitions: "Honour
   thy father and thy mother;" "Thou shalt not kill;" "Thou shalt not
   commit adultery;" "Thou shalt not forswear thyself." He did not
   disparage its literal meaning; but its true meaning was far deeper than
   the letter. The law was for Him a spiritual ideal, "quick and
   powerful," like the word of God in the Epistle to the Hebrews, [100]
   "and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing
   asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow,"--"a
   discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." It is not enough
   that men keep within the letter, and in its sense do no violence or
   commit no impurity; but men are no less transgressors if they cherish
   angry feelings against a brother, or look on a woman to lust after her.
   The law, so far from being destroyed, is glorified and fulfilled in His
   teaching; and sin, or its violation, stands forth not merely as an,
   outward act, but as an inward thought or inclination.: The principle of
   law being thus spiritualised, the principle of its negation is equally
   spiritualised. The conditions of righteousness and purity binding our
   being are no mere external conditions, restraining the outward
   activities, but conditions of the soul--necessary and absolute forms of
   its life--within which its most secret movements, no less than its
   outward manifestations, must circulate. Whatever be the origin of our
   ideas of law and right--whether they come to us from without or
   within--our Lord does not meddle with such questions; they exist. They
   are summarily comprehended in the Ten Commandments. But not only so;
   the law is nigh to us--in our heart. It binds our inmost being no less
   than our external conduct. It extends absolutely over every sphere of
   our voluntary activity. The ancient words only mirror an ideal right
   that lives in every conscience not "dead in sin;" and sin begins not
   only when the letter of the law is broken, but when the ideal is
   obscured within and the heart has sunk deliberately below its own
   highest conception of right.

   2. But not merely is the conception of law, and of sin as its
   violation, thus idealised and extended in our Lord's teaching; the
   conception of God as the giver of the law, and hence of sin as personal
   disobedience against its Author, is at the same time more clearly
   brought out. The Divine is not only an external authority commanding
   us, but a living Will that claims our service. We are to keep the
   commandments, not merely because it is right for us to do so, because
   the law is a categorical imperative within us which will not let us do
   as we will, but, above all, because it is God Himself that is ruling us
   by His law. His is the voice which speaks in the ancient words, and in
   the response which our hearts make to the words. He is Himself the
   immediate object of all moral obligation. We are to obey Him, not
   merely because His commands lie upon us, but because He is the Author
   and Father of our being, in whom alone we live and move--whose we are,
   and to whom we owe all. And our sin is consequently not merely
   "transgression of law," but disobedience against Him--rejection of His
   will.

   This essential aspect of sin as involving offence against a living Will
   no less than deviation from a right rule, is abundantly present in the
   Old Testament, and especially in the prophetic writings and the Psalms.
   It was inseparably involved in the whole character of Hebraism as a
   theocracy--a system which clothed itself in the form of law, but of
   which God was everywhere the immediate centre. It was nothing new,
   therefore, to the Hebrew consciousness. This has been clearly seen
   already. A Jew could hardly ever, amidst all the traditions of
   Pharisaism, lose sight of the relation of his sin to God as well as to
   the law. But the experience is everywhere requickened in our Lord's
   teaching; and all who heard Him were made to feel that their conduct
   had not merely a legal but a personal bearing. There was One ever with
   them, seeing them not only as their fellow-men saw them, but seeing
   them in secret; [101] knowing what they had need of before they asked
   Him, [102] their "Father in heaven;"--and all that they thought and did
   was judged by Him with unerring judgment. All their evil, therefore,
   was sin against Him., It was a rejection of His will as well as an
   offence against His authority. It was not only disorder, but
   undutifulness.

   3. And this leads us to a higher element of our Lord's teaching than we
   have yet reached. The law is not only idealised, and the conception of
   the divine personality everywhere made prominent, but there is a
   clearer, if not a wholly new, revelation made of the Divine. The
   Supreme Being is not merely moral order centred in a personal will, but
   moral perfection. The Right that rules our lives is at the same time
   the Love that guides them. God is our Father in heaven, all whose will
   towards us is good. This is one of the highest notes of spiritual
   advance in the Gospels--the clear identification of righteousness and
   goodness, of law and of love. These two ideas, so apt to be
   separated--so frequently, in point of fact, separated in popular
   religion--are everywhere identical in Christ, and in the higher
   spiritual sphere revealed by Him. The God of whom He speaks is not only
   supreme, but supremely good. "He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and
   the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust." [103] "If ye
   then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how
   much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them
   that ask Him!" [104] The idea of goodness is specially the idea of God.
   And yet divine goodness is never represented as good-nature, or mere
   complacency. On the contrary, it is inseparably bound up with
   righteousness and truth. A love without justice would prove to be no
   love at all. A goodness without holiness would be a mere shadow, on
   which no true heart could rest. Love is the innermost principle of the
   Divine, but the Divine is always the Right. Goodness without morality
   is unintelligible in the spiritual sphere. Within this sphere they are
   not only inseparable, they are essentially coherent--twin aspects of
   the same spiritual perfection. Right is Love, however it may sometimes
   seem disguised in the face of wrong; and Love, on the other hand,
   embraces every essential principle of morality. Hence the Divine is all
   summed up in Love. It is the secret of moral order in heaven and on
   earth. It is the name for the highest, alike in God and in man--the
   complete expression for the law above us, and the complete expression
   for the law within us. "God is love." [105] "Love is the fulfilling of
   the law." [106] When the Pharisees were gathered together, one of them,
   a lawyer, "asked Him a question, tempting Him, and saying, Master,
   which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou
   shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
   and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the
   second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On
   these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." [107] As
   love in God is the sum of moral perfection, love in us towards God and
   towards our neighbour is the sum of all moral duty.

   This higher teaching of Christ reflects everywhere a deeper shadow on
   human sin. If divine righteousness be always divine goodness, and the
   law, even in its most restrictive aspects, be only a form of concealed
   love working for our good, the wilful violation of law and of right is
   at the same time enmity against the Good. This thought is frequently
   repeated in the Gospels. In the profound and beautiful parable of the
   prodigal son--which is throughout full of meaning for our subject--it
   is specially apparent. It is the deepest offence of the prodigal, not
   that he had yielded to the lawless impulses of self-indulgence--wasted
   his substance in riotous living, and broken the laws of temperance and
   purity--nor even that he has sinned against a parental authority which
   claimed his obedience; but that, as his own heart at length tells him,
   he has done despite to a father's love, and offended against a goodness
   which was following him solicitously amid all his wilful degradation,
   and waiting all along to welcome his return. [108] Again, in the solemn
   passage [109] about blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, where our Lord is
   contending with pathetic indignation against the darkness of Pharisaic
   unbelief, it is this thought that marks the depth of His pathos, and
   gives meaning to His awful warning: the Pharisees were offenders not
   merely against Himself but against the full lustre of goodness--the
   light of the Divine--the presence of the Holy Ghost seen in His works.
   There might have been excuses for their not apprehending or
   acknowledging Him as the Messiah on His own appeal; but His works spoke
   for themselves as works of divine healing and beneficence. The spirit
   of Goodness--of God--breathed in them, and yet they said they were the
   works of Beelzebub, the prince of devils. The light that was in them
   being darkness, how great was their darkness! The deepest element of
   their sin was this hatred of the good. This was their blasphemy against
   the Holy Ghost. All other sin may be forgiven; but a disposition which
   calls evil good, and good evil--darkness light, and light darkness--is
   unforgivable in its nature. It is hopeless--beyond the operation of
   divine grace. And so the darkness of sin deepens as the light of God
   falls upon it. The shadows are cast more gloomily into the abysses of
   human self-will and alienation from the Divine, as the ideal of Love
   rises more luminously in the spiritual heavens.

   The same aspect of our Lord's teaching serves to bring out more plainly
   the essential nature of sin. As love, or the going forth of the human
   will in harmony towards the Divine, is the highest expression of moral
   duty, so the opposite of all this, or the concentration of the will
   upon itself in opposition to the Divine, is the uttermost expression of
   sin. More than anything else, the essence of sin is to be found in
   concentrated self-will or perverted egoism. In such a case the will is
   not merely astray, or out of the right way. So far as any will may have
   thus deviated, there is always something of the nature of sin, but
   there also may be much of the nature of accident or misfortune. All
   wrong-doing is deviation, but all deviation may not proceed from a
   wrongful purpose. The mark may be missed, and the stumble made in the
   darkness of unconsciousness, under blind impulses for the moment
   irresistible. These cannot make wrong right, but they may infinitely
   excuse the wrong. The element of sin may barely exist in certain acts
   of deviation, so little relation may they have to the conscious
   personality of the agent. But where the will deliberately asserts
   itself in wrong,--choosing self-indulgence rather than
   self-control--self-interest even to a brother's hurt,--then sin appears
   in its true character. It marks itself as the opposite of what is known
   as love--the latter representing the harmony of our personal life with
   the Divine, the former the concentration of this life upon itself in
   some form or another. As love is self-forgetfulness in God, sin is
   self-assertion against Him. Always there is this insurrectionary
   movement of self more or less present, whatever particular form the sin
   may take. It is not the form that is essential, but the inner movement
   of self expressed in it. Let the outside be stripped away, this core
   remains; and this it is, or the self-will in an attitude of hostile
   erection to the Divine, which is essentially sin. Hence, too, the
   positive or affirmative character which is so radical a note of sin.
   The true unity of the Divine and the human, of which love is the
   symbol, is dissolved; but a false unity takes its place. The Divine
   ceases to be the centre; self becomes its own centre. [See [13]Appendix
   XIV.]

   There is this inward penetration everywhere in our Lord's teaching, in
   the manner in which He deals with different classes of sinners, and the
   words with which He fixes attention, not on the outside but the inside
   of life. The Magdalene, and the Prodigal, and the Publican, are all
   sinners in His sight. They. have gone astray, and turned every one to
   his own way. Instead of the right they have chosen the wrong, and
   followed after vanity. Their sin, as all sin, is hateful to Him. He
   utters no word of leniency over it; yet he never speaks of it as he
   speaks of the sin of Pharisaic pride and Sadducean unbelief. The depth
   of impurity and profligacy does not move Him, like the depth of
   hypocrisy and hatred of the Good. There is alienation from the Divine
   in both cases; but the alienation is far more deliberate and
   self-concentrated in the one case than in the other. And while in the
   one He can say, "Go, and sin no more;" in the other He says, "Ye do the
   deeds of your father. . . . Ye are of your father the devil, and the
   lusts of your father ye will do." [110] He saw clearly to the heart,
   and discriminates the sin according to the degree of its evil in the
   self-will striving against the Divine. Similarly He speaks of all
   defilement as being from within, and not from without--a part of the
   self-life, and not of the accidental or external life. The external
   character should be without blame; but it is within the heart that the
   real character is formed. "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth
   a man, but that which cometh out of the mouth, that defileth a man. . .
   . Those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the
   heart, and they defile the man. For out of the heart proceed evil
   thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false-witness,
   blasphemies." [111] All these are but various forms of self-will turned
   away from the Divine, and falsely seeking to make a centre for itself.
   "These are the things which defile a man; but to eat with unwashen
   hands defileth not a man." [112]

   4. There is a special aspect of sin, afterwards elaborated by St. Paul,
   which also appears in our Lord's teaching. He characterises it not
   merely in act and in essence, but as a condition and tendency of
   humanity. Man not only sins, but he is a sinner naturally. It is his
   nature and disposition to sin. "Every good tree bringeth forth good
   fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit." [113] "The tree
   is known by its fruit. O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil,
   speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
   speaketh." [114] The import of such language, as well as other forms of
   language [115] --even when bearing a special application--is
   sufficiently obvious. Sin is set forth as a disease or corruption of
   human nature. It is not merely an act, but a state which clings to the
   race, a tendency lying in our nature, and which is constantly coming
   forth into action. It is in the flesh--the product of the natural
   birth; and "that which is born of the flesh is flesh." [116] This
   doctrine of the "flesh" as the seat of sin will afterwards come before
   us fully in the writings of St. Paul. In the meantime, it is
   interesting to trace the definite allusion to it in the fourth Gospel.
   The idea is clearly announced, but it is only touched. In St. Paul we
   shall find it fully expanded.

   5. Along with this, another aspect of sin is very prominent in the
   Gospels in connection with our Lord's miracles. Sin is not merely a
   disease or corruption of human nature, but it is closely associated
   with frightful forms of physical malady and human unhappiness. It
   leaves a deep stain of guilt and wretchedness which repeats itself in
   individuals, families, and nations. The sick of the palsy needs
   spiritual no less than physical healing. Nay, the key of the bodily
   cure is through the spiritual. "Whether is easier to say, Thy sins be
   forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?" [117] The demon-possessed
   are diseased in body as in mind-blind and dumb as well as insane and
   violent. [118] There is clearly implied in our Lord's language [119] a
   mysterious affinity betwixt natural and moral evil. The latter bears
   with it not only its proper doom of alienation from all that is
   spiritually good, but carries with it, moreover, a frequent train of
   natural doom and disaster. It issues in many forms of guilt and misery,
   and casts its gloomy shadow far beyond its immediate subject. This
   aspect of sin will also again and more elaborately meet us in St. Paul;
   but it deserves to be noted here, not only because it is so far clearly
   indicated in our Lord's teaching, but because He has Himself also
   cautioned us against the arbitrary misuse of the principle which it
   involves. While the consequences of sin are so fatal in individuals and
   in families, passing over in many forms of inherited wretchedness from
   generation to generation, and showing its existence in physical no less
   than in moral calamity, we are not yet warranted in connecting natural
   and moral evil together in particular cases. "Or those eighteen, upon
   whom the tower of Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were
   sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? I tell you, Nay; but,
   except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish." [120] Again, in a
   well-known passage in the fourth Gospel: "Master, who did sin, this
   man, or his parents, that he was born blind? Jesus answered, Neither
   hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should
   be made manifest in him." [121] In other words--for this is what our
   Lord's teaching comes to in this matter--the punitive justice of God is
   a great fact. It is stamped on all the darker phenomena of human
   life-disease, insanity, and death. It is in the nature of sin to entail
   suffering, and work itself, as an element of punishment, into all the
   complicated web of human existence. But it is not ours to fix or
   apportion its blame. It is present in every form of suffering; but the
   incidence of suffering is no measure of individual demerit in the
   tangled spectacle of human existence.

   6. Sin, which thus belongs to our nature, and cleaves to it so
   terribly, is necessarily universal. The language of the Psalmist,
   "There is no man that doeth good and sinneth not," is plainly the
   affirmation, if not in so many words, of Christ. He addresses His
   invitation of grace to all. He is come to seek and to save that which
   is lost. [122] The clear inference is, that all have sunk from the good
   which they ought to have--"All have sinned, and come short of the glory
   of God." [123] No doubt, there are passages also in which Christ seems
   to discriminate betwixt members of the human race as "evil and good,"
   "just and unjust," [124] and where He would even seem to imply that
   there are those who have no need of His spiritual teaching,--"They that
   are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. I came not to
   call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." [125] But such passages
   are plainly capable of an explanation, which leaves the fact of
   universal sinfulness without challenge. They find their explanation in
   the fact, that our Lord's language, here and everywhere, is not the
   language of theological analysis, but of common life. And as we say
   that there are good and bad men in the world, without meaning to affirm
   that there are any men without sin, so the Gospels speak of the evil
   and the good, the just and the unjust. The "honest and good heart"
   which receives the truth is not a heart in which there is no evil, but
   one in which the evil has not so hardened and shut out the work of the
   Spirit as to prevent its responding to the force of the truth when
   presented to it. There may still be another meaning in such words of
   the Lord, as that He came not to call the righteous, but sinners to
   repentance--a meaning not without a latent touch of satire, if we can
   imagine such a thing. The "righteous" in His time was something of a
   phrase. There were those like the Pharisees who made a profession of
   righteousness, "going about to establish their own righteousness."
   [126] Our Lord might say that He came not to call these--not that they
   did not need His call, but because they thought themselves too good to
   need it. They were after their own views, perfect in legal
   righteousness, and they knew of no other. There was nothing in them,
   any more than there was in those altogether hardened in evil, to
   respond to His call. In the one class the spiritual consciousness was
   dead, in the other it was self-satisfied. The call of a Saviour could
   reach neither till the depths of personal feeling were stirred in them,
   and the distress of sin arose from these depths as something too hard
   to be borne.

   This spiritual susceptibility is everywhere presupposed as a condition
   of receiving divine grace and truth. But the absence of the
   susceptibility is not to be held as an evidence that we do not need
   both--in other words, that we are not sinners. The fact that we have no
   sense of our need--that we have never cried "out of the depths," "If
   thou, Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?"--this,
   to say the least, only proves, not that we have no sin, but that we
   have failed to realise the responsibilities of our spiritual life--that
   we have been living upon the surface of intellectual and social
   conventions, and have never got down to the depth of our own spiritual
   being, or fronted the dreadful realities of sin, righteousness, and
   judgment. It was easy to the Pharisee and Scribe in the time of our
   Lord--it may be easy to the intellectualist and the man of the world
   now--to dwell within the levels of their own conventional thought, and
   feel from these levels as if a call to repentance had for them no
   meaning. But let the levels once be broken up, the fountains of their
   deeper life unsealed, and the waters thereof roar and be troubled, and
   then the spiritual call will be found to have an answer in their
   hearts, and facts more real than any their conventions have ever
   measured will find an utterance within them. Let it be remembered,
   although it is often forgotten, that Christianity always takes human
   nature at the fullest--in its complete mass of need, feeling, and
   aspiration. It is not man as Pharisee or Sadducee, as intellectualist
   or mystic or sensualist, but man as containing in himself the potencies
   of all these--as a being of manifold complex energy, with work and
   ambitions on earth, but with aspirations towards heaven. Within such a
   full-souled being, awake to his true position in the world, there will
   always be--the Gospel assumes--the sense of sin, the self-witness of
   having erred, and strayed, and done evil before the eye of Divine
   Purity, that searches us through and through, although it looks not on
   our sin.

   7. But this view of the subject suggests a further and final
   characteristic of our Lord's teaching regarding sin, which it is
   important to notice. While man is everywhere a sinner before Him who
   was Himself "holy, harmless, undefiled," yet he is nowhere represented
   as nothing but a sinner. "There is no man that doeth good and sinneth
   not" in the Gospels any more than elsewhere in Scripture. But the
   Gospels are singularly free from those exaggerated colours in which a
   later theology has sometimes drawn human nature. Man is a fallen and
   degraded being. He is at the best, be he Pharisee or Publican, among
   the "lost" whom Christ came to seek and to save. But he is noble even
   in his degradation. There is a capacity of divine life in him, beneath
   all the ruin of his nature. He is godlike, even with the image of his
   divine original broken and defaced. The divine likeness is obscured,
   but not obliterated. It may be traced amidst all the accumulations of
   sinful ruin. The very misery of man, as Pascal has said--interpreting
   this aspect of our Lord's teaching--attests his true greatness. He is a
   king dethroned, but still a king. The crown has fallen from his head,
   its gold has become dim and its most fine gold changed, but there is
   the faint lustre of it yet on his brow, and the dignity of having once
   worn it still lives in his heart. There is nothing more characteristic
   of our Lord's teaching than this recognition of the divine original of
   humanity, and of the divine potency which still survives in it. This is
   the only key to His redemptive mission. He came to recover the fallen,
   and to set up that which had been thrown down. He saw what was in man
   more truly than all others. He saw the possibilities of restoration in
   the demoniac and the Magdalene--the promise of an eternal life in the
   trustfulness of the thief upon the cross--the divine sparks still
   living amidst all the waste of ruined lives. The cry of the returning
   prodigal was heard by Him a far way off; and even while he ate of the
   husks and grovelled with the swine, the thought of his divine home had
   not died out of him, and the capacity of return had not absolutely
   perished.

   Dark as sin ever is, therefore, in the view of our Lord, and fallen as
   human nature is, it is not yet, as it has been sometimes represented, a
   mere mass of corruption. The tone which could say of it that it
   contains nothing but sin, and produces nothing which is not damnable,
   [See [14]Appendix XV.] is foreign to the Gospels. Such language, even
   in its extravagance, may represent a true side of human nature--human
   nature in entire divorce from the Divine--but certainly not a fair
   picture of human life. The higher vision of Christ embraces not only
   one side but all sides of humanity, and penetrates beneath all surface
   manifestations to its inner secrets. And therefore His view is always
   at once compassionate and comprehensive--stern, yet gracious. He sees
   man not merely as he is or seems to be, but as he is capable of being.
   His vision is complete and creative. It takes in the end from the
   beginning; and from amidst the broken and ruined fragments of the
   divine original beholds arising again, under His redeeming touch and
   the quickening power of His regenerating Spirit, new shapes of
   spiritual excellence--the new man, created after His own image in
   knowledge, righteousness, and holiness.

   As one has said, speaking of this subject, in words so fitly and
   eloquently descriptive that we may close this Lecture with them:--

   "Not half a century ago a great man was seen stooping and working in a
   charnel-house of bones. Uncouth, nameless fragments lay around him,
   which the workmen had dug up and thrown aside as rubbish. They belonged
   to some far back ages; and no man knew what they were or whence. Few
   men cared. The world was merry at the sight of a philosopher groping
   among mouldy bones. But when that creative mind, reverently discerning
   the fontal types of being in diverse shapes, brought together those
   strange fragments, bone to bone, and rib to claw, and both to its
   corresponding vertebrae, recombining the wondrous forms of past ages,
   and presenting each to the astonished world as it lived and moved a
   hundred thousand years back, then men began to perceive that a new
   science had begun on earth. And such was the creative [vision and] work
   of Christ. He took the scattered fragments of our ruined nature,
   interpreted their meaning, showed the original intent of those powers
   which were now only destructive--drew out from publicans and sinners
   yearnings which were incomprehensible, feelings which were
   misunderstood--vindicated the beauty of their original intention,
   showed the divine order below the chaos, and exhibited to the world
   once more a human soul in the form in which God had made it, saying to
   the dry bones, live." [127]

   [88] Hamartia, failure (its original etymology is uncertain), stands
   for sin in general in the New Testament, as cht't in the Old Testament;
   and, associated with this general expression, there is a "mournfully
   numerous group" of words analogous to the Old Testament group formerly
   considered, and expressing more or less the same definite shades of
   meaning. It is unnecessary to add any critical discussion of these
   words beyond that given in the text. The three there mentioned--viz.,
   hamartia, hanomia, paraptoma--are all used by our Lord,--the first,
   however, by far the most frequently. (Hamartema is found in Mark, iii.
   28, and doubtfully in Mark, iv. 12.) Anomia is used with great
   significance in the First Epistle of St. John, iii. 4, in conjunction
   with hamartia: Pas ho poion ten hamartian kai ten anomian poiei; kai he
   hamartia estin he anomia--Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also
   the law: for sin is the transgression of the law." Paraptoma is often
   employed by St. Paul; Rom. v. 15, 16, 17, 18, 20; Eph. ii. 1; Gal. vi.
   1. Expressions specially Pauline are parakoe ("disobedience to a voice
   "), opposed to hupakoe (Rom. v. 19; 2 Cor. x. 6; Heb. ii. 2); parabasis
   ("transgression ") very frequently (Rom. ii. 23, v. 14; 1 Tim. ii. 14;
   Heb. ii. 2--in conjunction with parakoe, Heb. ix. 15). Readers anxious
   to study the several shades of meaning which have been associated with
   these words may be referred to Archbishop Trench's volume on New
   Testament Synonyms, second part, p. 61, 73. It is evident, from the
   interesting discussion and quotation of authorities there given, that
   too much is not to be made of these shades of meaning, and that the
   full force of the evangelical and Pauline thought on the subject is
   better gathered by a comprehensive induction of the leading particulars
   of this thought, such as is attempted in the Lectures, than by any mere
   critical analysis of words.

V.

DOCTRINE OF ST. PAUL'S EPISTLES.

   IT requires but little insight to recognise the difference of our
   Lord's form of teaching in the Gospels, and that of St. Paul in his
   Epistles. In the former case we have for the most part concrete
   statements or pictures. The moral truth of Judaism and the higher
   truths of the Gospel are described in life and character. They come
   before us in authoritative announcement or living form, in graphic
   incident or pictured parable. Sin and righteousness are alike embodied
   in vivid representation. Even in the Sermon on the Mount, and elsewhere
   where our Lord appears directly as an instructor, and where, as we have
   seen, He develops the idea of sin, amplifying and deepening it, in
   contrast to His own spiritual ideal, as a spiritual state or attitude,
   and not merely an external act or breach of the letter of the law, He
   does so not by explanation or argument, but by revealed assertion and
   authority. He sets forth the fact--His higher conception of the divine
   law on the one hand, and His deeper and more spiritual conception of
   sin on the other hand. He does not deal in analysis or definition.

   Nowhere in Scripture are the lines of the Good and of the Evil drawn
   more firmly or brought into sharper and clearer antagonism than in the
   Gospels. We feel as we read them everywhere the vivid breath of moral
   life and death. Sin in all its phases comes out in striking reality in
   His presence who is the "Light of the world." The forces of evil,
   whether embodied in Pharisee or Sadducee, in Herodian or Scribe, in
   Magdalene or Prodigal, in high priest or Roman governor, are distinctly
   and powerfully conceived, so that we can have no doubt of their
   features,--what it is to be good and what it is to be evil--what it is
   to be at one with the Divine, and what it is to be opposed to it. But
   withal, the teaching is by affirmation or example rather than by
   definition--by synthesis rather than by analysis. This is our Lord's
   manner: "Verily, verily, I say unto you." He taught as one "having
   authority, and not as the Scribes." His lessons were like the lessons
   of nature--graphic, living, comprehensive--addressed to the eye as well
   as the thought--majestic in their simplicity, inexhaustible in their
   divine fulness of meaning.

   It is very different with St. Paul. He is a great preacher, but he is
   still more characteristically a great Christian scribe or writer. The
   fulness of divine truth is broken up in him into its several parts. It
   does not dwell in him bodily. It is not set forth by him-as in the
   Gospels--in creative and ideal types. St. Paul had been trained in the
   Jewish schools. He had been a "Hebrew of the Hebrews--as touching the
   law a Pharisee." He was familiar not merely with the living aspects of
   Jewish thought and character, but with the argumentative subtleties of
   the one, and the practical casuistries of the other. He was accustomed
   to find definitions for his opinions, and arguments for his assertions.
   He was a scholastic in intellect, if a missionary in enthusiasm. His
   manner, in calm statement, is essentially dialectical. And so we find,
   as we might expect to find, the more simple and concrete teaching of
   the Gospels not only expanded in the Pauline Epistles, but defined and
   analysed, and, if we may say so, rationalised and set forth in its
   several elements in their intellectual and spiritual relation to one
   another.

   Our business is only with St. Paul's doctrine of sin; but his doctrine
   on this subject is closely intertwined with his system of doctrine, and
   especially with his central doctrine of righteousness by faith, and his
   vivid, if varying, conception of the law. It is necessary, so far, to
   bring into view his general system of thought, in order to understand
   the full meaning of his doctrine of sin.

   The two great ideas of righteousness and law were typical ideas of the
   Hebrew mind. They were essentially correlated, and the one can only be
   understood in connection with the other. So soon as we touch the sphere
   of Revelation we come prominently within the range of moral law; we
   find ourselves in face of a divine Will, and of human wills rightfully
   subject to it. This is an infinitely higher stage of thought than any
   attained within the sphere of natural religion, or of religion outside
   of Revelation. But whether admitted to be higher or not, there can be
   no doubt of the fact that the Old Testament is everywhere the
   Revelation of a divine Will dealing with human wills; and the tenor of
   this Revelation is that the human will can only find its happiness in
   harmony with the Divine. This harmony of the Divine and human is
   righteousness: and the key-note of the Old Testament through all its
   pages is, that righteousness alone is blessedness. "Blessed is the man
   that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way
   of sinners. . . . But his delight is in the law of the Lord. . . . The
   Lord knoweth the way of the righteous; but the way of the ungodly shall
   perish." [128] "The word righteousness," as a modern writer [129] has
   said, "is the master-word of the Old Testament." "Blessed are they that
   keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness." [130] "Cease to do
   evil; learn to do well." [131] "Stand in awe, and sin not. . . . Offer
   the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord." [132]
   Here righteousness consists in obedience to law, or conformity of the
   human will to the Divine. To be right, is to be at one with God; to be
   wrong, is to be at variance with God. God is not only the head of the
   Hebrew theocracy--the divine source from which it came--but He is a
   living presence through all its manifestations and activities. The
   divine Will was supposed to be immediately expressed in every channel
   of the Hebrew law and prophets--as much in one channel, or part of it,
   as another. "The law, the fulfilment of the law" (righteousness), "and
   the divine Author of the law, pass into each other. The mind is carried
   on imperceptibly from the one to the other." [133]

   To us the divine law is specially the moral law, or the ten words or
   commandments of Moses. We distinguish betwixt what we call the
   ceremonial or the political law of the Jews, and the moral law. But the
   Jews themselves made no such distinction. The law was to them in their
   later history the whole law of Moses as contained in the Pentateuch.
   Nay, the term law assumed a still wider significance, and seems to have
   been identified with the whole letter of the Old Testament, as
   interpreted and applied by the Sopherim or Scribes. St. Paul uses the
   word in more senses than one. It has, we shall see, a higher or
   universal meaning for him, as well as a common meaning. But the common
   meaning which it bears for him, as for other Jews, is the whole Jewish
   or Old Testament system. [134] This was the law which he had known
   before his conversion, as touching which he was a Pharisee. And this is
   the law which plays such a part in his writings, in contrast to the
   Gospel and the freedom which the Gospel brings with it.

   The mind of the Jew was impregnated by this idea of law. It was the law
   which made his religion. The two terms, or the two ideas, had become
   co-ordinate with him. He rested in the law, and made his boast of God
   as its Author. [135] It was to him a vast system, all equally of divine
   authorship. It is easy for us to trace and estimate the relation of its
   several parts, and to distinguish what is spiritual and permanent in
   it, from what is ceremonial and temporary. But this was the last thing
   of which a Jewish mind was capable. All in his religion seemed to the
   Jew equally sacred. It is the tendency of all national religion to take
   up into it much that is accidental and temporary, and to extend the
   same sanction of divine authority to all parts of its creed and
   ritual--the non-essential no less than the essential. And this tendency
   was one specially favored by the character of Judaism after the
   Captivity, and the prominence which it gave to the scholastic element
   in its exposition and diffusion. St. Paul inherited this tendency in
   its full force as a typical Jew--"a Hebrew of the Hebrews." The Jewish
   law had been to him, at least, all that it was to other Jews of his
   time. He seems jealous that any should be able to say that they prized
   it more than he had done; that they understood it better, or placed a
   more extended and significant meaning upon it. If it had been possible
   to be saved by the law--by appreciation of its divine character, by
   faithful and zealous obedience to its prescriptions--he would have
   found that salvation. As touching the righteousness which is in the
   law, he held himself blameless.

   When St. Paul speaks specially of the law, therefore, in contrast to
   the Gospel, he means the whole Jewish law. He did not, as we are now in
   the habit of doing, discriminate its parts, or separate them in their
   historical development and relative importance, any more than the other
   Jews of his time. What he did, and what distinguished him as a
   spiritual thinker and teacher, was something far more important than
   this. He saw that the idea of law was not limited by its Jewish
   conception. The thought in which he had been bred clung to him. Judaism
   was to him a great system of antique growth, and venerable in all its
   parts. He had faithfully tried to find religious life within the
   system, and yielded to none in the admiration with which he had
   regarded it.: But all the while he had been learning that the thought
   of God was greater than any system. And when he became a Christian he
   saw this clearly. He saw that God had never left Himself without a
   witness on the earth; and that what He had been specially doing for the
   Jewish people by the law, He had been more or less doing for all people
   by the voice of reason and the monitions of conscience.

   While the law, therefore, remained to St. Paul what he had been trained
   to esteem it--the whole sphere of the theocratic institutions (only
   seen in a more spiritual light)--yet it lost for him its exclusiveness.
   It took its place, not as the whole of the divine plan for man's
   spiritual education, which, before his conversion, it had seemed to him
   as well as to other Jews, but only as a phase of that plan, preceded by
   the divine promise to Abraham, and supplemented by all the indications
   of natural reason and conscience outside of Judaism. The idea of law,
   in short, was for him expanded and broadened in a sense unknown to
   Pharisaism. It became a universal principle of moral order encompassing
   all life, however dimly known or realised. The Jews had enjoyed a
   special Revelation. The Divine had been made clear to them in definite
   command and precept,--"Line upon line, precept upon precept." This was
   their privilege and boast. There could be no doubt, therefore, of their
   responsible relation to the Divine. The only doubt was whether the
   Divine had not been obscured to them by the very multiplicity of the
   sanctions which had been drawn from it--whether they had not lost the
   quick sense of the spiritual in the manifoldness of the letter. But the
   fact of a divine Ideal was something which all nations might have
   known--an undeniable reality revealed in nature, and cognisable by
   reason and conscience. The invisible things of God were to be clearly
   seen in creation and providence by all discerning and devout hearts.
   Reverence for the Divine, and obedience to it, were therefore
   obligatory within the pale of Gentilism no less than of Judaism. The
   absence of a special Revelation, or definite form of divine law, did
   not leave men excused in their violations of duty. There was the
   capacity in all men of reaching to a knowledge of the Divine, and of a
   higher divine order; and this, in the absence of definite divine
   institutions, was a law in itself. "For when the Gentiles, which have
   not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law these having
   not the law are a law unto themselves." [136] Here the common and
   higher meaning of the word appear together; and the apostle passes
   rapidly from the one to the other, the great thought in both cases
   being that there is a moral order behind all moral life, and that the
   truth and rightness of the life are only found in consistency with the
   order.

   This is the backbone, so to speak, of all St. Paul's thought, as indeed
   of that Hebrew thought which he so prominently represented. He was not
   less but more a Hebrew in that he was capable of rising above the
   Jewish stand-point of his time, and embracing not only the chosen race
   but the human race within his moral Ideal. The Jews were especially the
   children of law. They had been placed under special divine tutelage and
   government, for the very purpose that the idea of divine authority
   might be brought home to the human mind, and made a living part of it.
   Their system of policy and government, therefore, was especially the
   law, and it was difficult for the ordinary Jewish mind to conceive of
   divine authority apart from a system which was for it equivalent to the
   Divine. St. Paul did not himself see beyond it for a time. But when the
   broader vision came to him, it was not by losing the moral depth of his
   early faith, but by understanding and realising it more clearly. He did
   not, in other words, pass out of Hebraism to a less serious view of
   humanity; but he extended its essential thought so as to embrace
   humanity. The principle of divine authority which his national religion
   had nurtured was set free in his mind from the restraints in which he
   and other Jewish teachers had been accustomed to regard it, and was
   felt to be a universal principle lying at the root of all human
   happiness and all moral progress.

   It is in the light of this principle of law or moral order that St.
   Paul views all mankind, and that his doctrine of sin is set forth in
   its several aspects. Carrying with him this principle, he applied it to
   Jew and Gentile alike, and pronounced all men to be sinners. With
   reference to the same principle, more or less, he unfolded the nature
   and the effects of sin. The main points of the Pauline doctrine will
   arrange themselves naturally under three successive heads: 1st, The
   universality of sin; 2d, The nature or seat of sin; and, 3d, The
   effects or consequences of sin. St. Paul has a great deal to say on all
   these points that it concerns us to know, and his manner of teaching
   them is all the more interesting that it involves throughout an appeal
   to experience. Granting to him the principle which lies behind all his
   thought, and which it was the great function of Hebraism to plant in
   the human consciousness, that man is a moral being subject to divine
   authority--in other words, a subject of law--St. Paul works out his
   doctrine of sin in the main experimentally. He takes man, and, placing
   him in the mirror of divine law, shows him all the ruin and sadness of
   his moral state. He appeals against himself to facts of experience
   which admit of no denial; and lays bare the hidden folds of his moral
   consciousness with a keenness of psychological analysis that penetrates
   to the roots of his spiritual nature. We receive his words as words of
   divine authority; but they derive a peculiar interest and power from
   the manner in which they bring us into contact with spiritual facts,
   and clothe themselves with a life of experience which all higher minds
   may verify. It is in the great Epistle to the Romans that St. Paul
   especially unfolds his doctrine of sin, and to which our attention,
   therefore, will be mainly confined in this and the following Lecture.

   1. In the opening of the epistle, St. Paul brings mankind, both Jew and
   Gentile, to the bar of moral judgment. He sets them in the light of
   that divine righteousness which had been growing in the' consciousness
   of the devout Israelite for centuries, and which had received such a
   powerful illustration in the life and death of Christ. This
   righteousness was a subject of Revelation. Man had not reached it by
   his own tentative moral gropings or ideas. It had come forth from God,
   the expression of His character and will, and had only been attainable
   always through a living relation to Him--in other words, through faith.
   The life of the righteous spoken of in the Old Testament was, in its
   highest form, not a life of moral effort, but of divine receptivity, as
   when Habakkuk says that "the just shall live by his faith." [137] But
   the actual state, both of the Gentile and the Jewish world, was
   infinitely removed from this life of righteousness, which is only
   realized through faith in the Divine. And with the view of showing
   this, he turns first to the moral state of the Gentiles. He speaks of
   what he sees around him. There is no reason to suppose that he
   exaggerates the picture of ungodliness and immorality which he draws
   with so powerful a pencil.

   As the life of righteousness or moral order was the realisation of the
   divine Will for man, so the life of unrighteousness and moral disorder
   was the reverse of this, and therefore hateful to God. As the one was
   the object of divine complacency, the other was the object of divine
   wrath. And as St. Paul looked abroad over the Gentile world, he saw
   everywhere the revelation of this wrath against the abounding
   enormities of human sin. [138] Nor could the Gentiles plead ignorance
   of the Divine in excuse of their impiety and unrighteousness. On the
   contrary, the very strength of his accusation against them is that they
   hindered, obscured, and obstructed the truth by their unrighteousness.
   [139] The Divine was sufficiently made known to them. God had Himself
   made it known in the works of nature and in the instincts of the Divine
   originally planted within their hearts. The apostle clearly indicates
   the fact of man being able to reach the knowledge of the Divine without
   a special or positive Revelation. There is a faculty of God-knowledge
   in man originally, a susceptibility of higher truth, for the use of
   which man is responsible, and for the abuse of which he is condemnable.
   "That which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath
   showed it unto them. For the invisible things of Him from the creation
   of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
   made, even His eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without
   excuse." [140] There is that in man, call it reason or conscience,
   which, looking out upon the world, ought to see in it the expression of
   divine thought and energy-of a living and eternal Mind; and the primary
   root of sin in the Gentiles was that they had allowed the revelation of
   the Divine to be utterly obscured in them. Made capable of knowing God,
   and having around them a constant witness of His eternal power and
   Godhead, they failed to glorify Him as God, or to cherish feelings of
   reverence or thankfulness towards the divine Author of their being and
   of the world. "They became vain in their imaginations, and their
   foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they
   became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an
   image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed
   beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to
   uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts." [141]

   The source of sin in the Gentile world was this obscuration of the idea
   of God. Man having sunk away from God, necessarily sank away from the
   life of righteousness which was only to be found in the knowledge of
   the divine character, and conformity to the divine will. The truth
   which they might have known they hindered, and changed into a lie.
   [142] Abjuring the creative Will, and turning away from its
   manifestations, they fell under the dominion of the creature. Nature
   took the place of the Divine in their hearts; and the consequences are
   pictured with a terrible realism by the apostle.

   It is unnecessary for us to touch the details of the picture. It is
   enough to draw attention to the fact which he emphasises at the
   close--that the sins of which he speaks were pronounced to be sins even
   by the higher sense of those who practised them. The idea of divine law
   was not utterly gone in the Gentile mind, even amidst the sinful
   excesses which he describes. There was a divine voice made itself heard
   through all, passing judgment on such things; and the worst that could
   be said of the Gentiles--their deepest sin--was that they, "knowing the
   judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of
   death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them."
   [143]

   But were the Jews any better in reality? Were they any less sinners,
   notwithstanding all their privileges? With them there could be no
   question of a knowledge of the Divine. They had received the law and
   the prophets. The life of divine righteousness had been set forth in
   word, example, sacrifice, and precept, in their sacred books. To them
   had been committed "the oracles of God." [144] What was the outcome of
   all this? Much good, no doubt. This is not denied; on the contrary, it
   is plainly implied by the apostle. But was the life of righteousness,
   after all, really more conspicuous amongst them? They boasted of their
   privileges. They were ready and zealous in their condemnation of the
   heathen. But their condemnation of the heathen, the apostle states
   broadly, meant their own condemnation. The Jewish critic was condemned
   out of his own mouth,--"For wherein thou judgest another, thou
   condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things." And
   the judgment of God is equally true against all evil-doers. It allows
   no one to escape. [145] Divine righteousness is impartial, and renders
   "to every man according to his deeds." [146] The apostle enters into an
   elaborate expostulation with the Jew, proving at length to him that his
   law of which he boasts cannot benefit him unless he has fulfilled it.
   For it was not the hearer but the doer of the law that was righteous
   before God. The Gentiles who had done what was right according to their
   light--who, having not the law, "had done by nature the things
   contained in the law," [147] were better really than the Jews, who,
   having their law and resting in it--knowing the divine will, and
   approving "the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of
   the law"--yet failed of its fulfilment. Of their failure in word and
   deed he leaves no doubt. "For the name of God is blasphemed among the
   Gentiles," he adds, "through you." [148] The privileges of the Jew,
   therefore, were nothing without the spiritual realities they were
   designed to represent. "For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly;
   neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh: but he is a
   Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the
   spirit, and not in the letter." [149]

   The result of his analysis and argument is, that the Jew, merely as
   Jew, or an external member of the theocracy is no better than the
   Gentile. Both are "proved" by him to be alike "under sin." [150] The
   demands of divine righteousness being set over against human life, it
   is seen to fall infinitely below these demands. The divine ideal which
   encompasses it, and within which alone it can reach its true happiness,
   is nowhere realised. The voice of reason and conscience is quenched
   amongst the heathen. The law is broken by the Jew while he yet boasts
   of it. And what is true of Jew and Gentile, is true of man universally.
   The conclusion of the apostle--based upon facts of observation around
   him, in the Jewish and Gentile world--is plainly a conclusion of
   universal experience: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory
   of God." [151]

   2. Having thus established the universality of sin as a fact of
   experience, the' apostle enters upon an analysis of its character and
   origin in human nature. It is not enough for him to assert the fact, as
   the basis of his great doctrine of righteousness--not by works, but by
   faith. He shows how the fact originates in the constitution of human
   nature. There is in all men, he explains, a higher and lower nature.
   The latter he everywhere designates by the term "flesh," [152] and
   develops its nature and properties now in antagonism to the "spirit"
   [153] or divine principle, and now in contrast to what he calls the
   "mind;" [154] for St. Paul is curiously elaborate in his analysis of
   human nature. He was a spiritual psychologist long before the birth of
   psychology as a science. The seat of sin, he says, is in the "flesh."
   It is the expression of this lower element of human life: "For I know
   that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing." [155] The
   unregenerate "walk after the flesh;" the regenerate, "after the
   spirit." These two elements--the flesh and the spirit--mark the extreme
   poles of his thought. The one is the seat of sin and death, the other
   is the seat of holiness and life. The one is human nature estranged
   from the Divine; the other is human nature at one with the Divine--the
   Divine in man, as well as the divine Power above him, which raises him
   to the higher sphere. These two elements are always and utterly at
   variance. "The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against
   the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other." [156] The
   works of the flesh are all works of sin, as catalogued in the fifth
   chapter of Galatians. The fruit of the Spirit is in the higher and
   quite distinct sphere of the spiritual life. The breadth of this
   contrast everywhere appears in St. Paul's epistles, and in describing
   it,, the expression "flesh" is used to designate all the evil activity
   of human nature. It describes not merely the desires of the body, the
   appetites and motions of our carnal frame, but all that is in us
   opposed to the Divine. The mind or reason may so come under the
   dominion of the flesh as to be virtually identical with it. The
   apostle, for example, speaks of being "puffed up by a fleshly mind,"
   [157] and even of a "fleshly wisdom." [158] The flesh, therefore is not
   to be confounded with mere sensuality. It is sense or nature
   predominant in us; our whole life of activity separated from the Divine
   and turned against it--not merely this life on the side of sensual
   passion. The mind, which is actuated by sense, and ruled by its power,
   is equally within the lower sphere. This is what the apostle calls "the
   mind" or "thought of the flesh;" and this is specially declared to be
   hostile to God, the enemy of the Divine. [159]

   But while the mind may be thus subject to the flesh, and the two make
   war against the Spirit or the Divine, the mind may also itself be alive
   and powerful, and may enter, in its own strength, into a struggle with
   the flesh; in other words, the higher nature of man, always depressed
   and often entirely controlled by the lower nature, may also assert its
   own rights as an antagonist of the lower nature, and strenuously resist
   its domination. St. Paul seems clearly to recognise the reality of this
   conflict no less than the other. [160] His view sometimes enlarges to
   the one, sometimes contracts to the other. He now looks at human
   nature, banded in all its energies against the Divine, and then he
   looks at it as the sphere of a terrible struggle betwixt the good and
   the evil. This appears to be the only fair interpretation of the
   remarkable seventh chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, although, I
   need hardly say, it has been differently interpreted. Here the
   antagonistic elements are not the "flesh " and the "spirit," but the
   "flesh" and something higher within the man himself--"the inward man,"
   [161] "the law of the mind;" [162] and the whole picture conveys the
   idea of the essential war there is in every conscious moral life
   betwixt the higher and lower principles at work within it. The general
   result of the apostle's analysis seems to be as follows:--

   Man is a creature of mingled impulses, some higher and some lower.
   Moral life only begins in him with the consciousness of this double or
   contradictory nature, partly drawing him to good and partly drawing him
   to evil. It seems plainly recognised that man may go on without any
   moral consciousness. He may be dead in sin. [163] The flesh may usurp
   his whole nature. There may be nothing beyond its life in him.
   Conscience may be asleep, or may never lift its eyes to take in the
   solemn realities of duty. But it is always there, even when slumbering
   at its post; and when the sense of duty--or, in other words, the
   law--is brought home to it, there is no more contentedness in the mere
   natural or selfish life. The higher being is awakened. The sense of
   sin--previously unknown, because the sense of duty was unfelt--comes
   forth in full vividness against the law made clear in conscience. It
   requires the consciousness of the law to reveal sin in us: not that the
   law itself is evil, or the cause of sin; on the contrary, it is "holy,
   and the commandment holy, and just, and good." [164] But the revelation
   of the law within us, or the law consciously realised, is at the same
   time the revelation of sin. When the moral Ideal which should lead our
   lives rises clearly in the horizon of consciousness, then for the first
   time we feel how miserably short we come of the Ideal. It is easy to
   live contentedly if we have no Ideal. If we have no higher thoughts,
   how should our lower thoughts distract us? There is nothing for them to
   disturb--no higher expectations for them to clash with.

   It may seem to some--it has seemed to many--a good thing to have no
   sense of sin. There are people who say they cannot tell what sin is;
   they are not conscious of it, and they may count themselves happy in
   this unconsciousness. Not so the apostle. There was great misery to him
   in the consciousness of sin; but there was something still more
   dreadful in its unconsciousness. This was to have sunk out of the
   sphere of moral experience altogether, into a mere animal or fleshly
   sphere; to have lost not merely the Divine, but, so to speak, the
   capacity of it--any trace of it upon which the higher power could take
   hold, and draw the sinner to itself. This was the worst of all states
   to him--a state in which he had found himself when "without the law sin
   was dead." [165] The state into which the law brought him was miserable
   enough, but its misery was better than insensibility. Better to feel
   the wretchedness of having come short of a moral Ideal, than not to
   have such an Ideal at all. It was true that the revelation of the law
   within him destroyed his self-complacency. It depressed and killed his
   former self-righteous life. "For I was alive," he says, "without the
   law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died."
   [166] He "had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not
   covet." [167] This might seem to be the worst state, and to make the
   law the source of sin. But not so. The sin is in human nature all the
   while; only the law wakes it by its quickening touch. It is as if a man
   were to take a candle into some noisome place full of unclean life
   lying torpid in the darkness, and under the searching light the life
   began to stir and show itself in its dark reality. Such is the effect
   of the law within the human heart. It makes sin manifest as a real and
   conscious power. And so the apostle says of it, in language that sounds
   paradoxical and has given rise to much controversy, but which has a
   real meaning to all spiritual minds like his own, that "the strength of
   sin is the law." [168] It is the consciousness of law that gives all
   its force to the consciousness of sin. And the more the law is realised
   as the true bond of our lives, the more fatal will its infractions be
   felt as they appear in these lives. The consciousness of sin,
   therefore, is the result of the law; but we do not infer from this, as
   some have done, that the apostle identifies sin and its consciousness,
   so that "where there is no consciousness of sin there is no sin." [169]
   Nothing can be further from this standpoint, as we have seen. Sin is
   always in human nature. It may be torpid; the flesh may have invaded
   the whole sphere of human activity, and killed every higher element of
   life. The stillness of death may reign within the darkened chamber. But
   this state is worse than the other, and the misery of struggle is
   better than the contentment of death.

   The struggle which the apostle draws betwixt the higher and the lower
   nature is certainly a terrible one. There are not merely two elements
   at war within the soul, but two habits or tendencies. The flesh is not
   merely a succession of rebellious instincts, but "a law of sin in the
   members"--"a body of death." [170] The instincts of evil are gathered
   into an order which arrays itself against the higher order of the mind.
   The man is rent, as it were, in twain. His very personality is broken
   up--now on the side of the good, and now helpless under the evil. "It
   is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. . . . For the
   good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I
   do.... I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present
   with me. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man; but I
   see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and
   bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members."
   [171] The language of the apostle implies the hopelessness of this
   struggle, looked at from a mere human point of view, so long as only
   the mind or the higher principle within us is the antagonist of the
   flesh. It must be reinforced by the Divine. The mind must be changed
   into the spirit,--in other words, the reason must be spiritualised. The
   divine Power must become ours before the power of the flesh can be
   mastered. Otherwise the higher self still goes down under the force of
   the lower--even when it clings to its Ideal, and says in despair--It is
   not I, but sin. "When I would do good, evil is present with me. . . O
   wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this
   death?"

   To sum up our exposition, the seat of sin we have seen with St. Paul is
   the "flesh." This in its broadest sense is distinguished from the
   "spirit." As thus distinguished, the flesh represents the whole of
   human nature in its estrangement from the Divine--all the activities of
   body and mind with which fallen man is capable of opposing the Divine.
   Reason, or our higher nature, may in this sense be flesh no less than
   the body. There may be a wisdom after the flesh and a righteousness of
   the same character. The idea of the flesh, in short, may invade the
   whole sphere of human nature, and is supposed to do so when it is
   brought into contact with the spirit. But the "mind," reason, or higher
   thought, may also set itself against the flesh, instead of yielding to
   the lower principle, and may enter into conflict with it in its own
   strength, and fight it with its native weapons. This it does more or
   less in all higher natures. The law of the mind refuses to bend to the
   law of the members, but wars against it. Unless reinforced by a higher
   principle it wars unsuccessfully. But this is no reason for denying the
   reality of the struggle, or for making human nature worse than it is.
   It is something that the mind refuses to bend to the flesh, and that
   even if beaten in the struggle, it is there to show that man has not
   utterly sunk into evil and made it his good.

   3. We turn, in conclusion, to consider the effects or consequences of
   sin as described by St. Paul. These occupy a prominent place in his
   system of thought, and constitute an essential element of his doctrine.
   The effects of sin are viewed by the apostle under two aspects--the one
   in the main subjective, the other objective. The general name by which
   he describes the former is "death." "The wages of sin," he says, "is
   death." [172] "What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are
   now ashamed? for the end of those things is death." [173] "When we were
   in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in
   our members to bring forth fruit unto death." [174] This solemn
   expression occurs incessantly in St. Paul's writings in connection with
   our subject. Death everywhere follows sin as its shadow. A state of sin
   is a state of death. The unregenerate are described as "dead in their
   sins," [175] as "dead in trespasses and sins." [176] The presence of
   the flesh oppressing the mind is a "body of death." [177] The issue of
   sin is death. It is the end to which it leads, the wages which it
   receives. The one cleaves to the other inseparably--not only death to
   sin, but sin to death. For "the sting," or "goad," "of death is sin."
   [178] It is sin that urges death on, and makes it so bitter in the
   result.

   Such language necessarily carries us, as it carried St. Paul, back to
   the idea of death associated with the primal sin. "Ye shall not eat of
   it" ("the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden"), "neither
   shall ye touch it, lest ye die." [179] There the main meaning, as we
   formerly said, must be supposed to be spiritual. The act was a moral
   act. It bore with it the seeds of moral injury. Disobedience of the
   divine command involved the loss of that divine communion which is the
   true life of the moral creature. The will which had turned away from
   God had the seeds of weakness and wickedness implanted in it. It lost
   spiritual healthfulness; it sank into decay and dissolution.

   But what of physical death? it may be asked. Is not this also in
   Scripture immediately connected with sin as its consequence? Is it not
   so specially in St. Paul's Epistles? [180] What, then, are we to make
   of this? To the modern mind death is a purely natural fact. It comes in
   course of time as the natural issue of all organism, which by its very
   life spends itself, and hastens towards dissolution as an inevitable
   end. We cannot conceive any individual life perpetuated under the
   existing laws of the external world. Continued life is only possible
   through death; and new organisms can only spring from the decay of the
   old. The physical fact of death, therefore, cannot be traced to sin as
   its sole cause. Nor can St. Paul be said to do this. Even when he
   speaks of death as the dissolution of the body, it is not only this
   dissolution that he means, but death with all its adjuncts of pain and
   sadness and spiritual apprehension. This is the death of which sin is
   the sting. This is the ordinary fact to all thoughtful men--not the
   mere decay of an organism which, because it is an organism, must decay,
   and by the mere fact of its living waste away. In such decay there is
   sadness as in all decay, yet nothing strange or gloomy. Death is always
   more than this to men and women who have loved and thought--all whose
   being has been steeped in spiritual association and passion. The
   natural fact is to them inseparable from its moral accessories of loss
   and misery. And the feeling is irresistible which associates death with
   all our other evil, and makes it seem, in all its painful accidents, if
   not in its mere occurrence, as the consequence of sin. Were there no
   darkness in our lives--did sin not waste and ruin them--then death
   could hardly be to us what it is. There would be no terror in it. The
   gloom of it would vanish or be less oppressive. It is this full meaning
   of the fact, even on its physical side for moral creatures, that the
   apostle brings into causal connection with sin. Death was what it was
   to him and his fellow-Christians because of sin. The final shadow
   rested on human life because that life had turned itself away from God,
   and chosen the evil rather than the good.

   But if the apostle's view of the consequences of sin included death as
   an external fact, the special meaning of the fact for him as for the
   older Scripture writers was spiritual. It was the spiritual which
   included the literal, and gave its deepest stamp to the word, and not
   the reverse. The expressions we have already quoted plainly indicate
   this. The state of death which comes from sin as its immediate
   consequence, was the state of those living around him. It had been the
   state of the Ephesian and Colossian brethren previous to their
   conversion. It was so far the consciousness of all in whom the power of
   the flesh was striving successfully against the law of the mind, and
   bringing it into captivity to the law of sin which is in the members.
   [181] Conceived in this spiritual sense, death may be a passive or
   active state. To be dead in sin is to be as yet in the mere natural
   fleshly state in which the higher life has not emerged, or the law been
   revealed--the state to which we formerly adverted as the worst of all
   in the apostle's view, without God and without hope in the world. This
   is spiritual death in its extreme form, in which the moral nature has
   been so injured, depressed, and weakened, that it is not conscious of
   its injury. It is not there at all, in fact. The flesh has destroyed
   it. The lower nature has not only beaten down the higher nature, but so
   to speak dispossessed it, and reigns alone. There is no struggle,
   therefore; all is stillness, but it is the stillness of death. The true
   nature of the man, his moral activity, has been killed. He is therefore
   appropriately described as "dead in sin."

   But the state of conscious struggle which is also depicted by the
   apostle, in which the higher nature is alive yet ineffectually active
   in its conflict with the flesh, is also "death." The apostle felt it to
   be so in his own case.. For he says, when the idea of good first came
   to him in the commandment, sin revived, and he died. "Who shall deliver
   me," he cried, "from the body of this death?" [182] The more sin is
   active or living within us, the more we are dead. And if we are not
   utterly dead, if the moral life is not gone in us altogether, but we
   are conscious of a good at which we ought to aim--a law which demands
   our service--we shall have a corresponding consciousness of fatal
   failure. We shall realise our own moral prostration. We shall feel, in
   other words, how far we have sunk from the ideal of our lives, and lost
   the good we ought to have had, and laid up for ourselves misery that we
   might have escaped,--"wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of
   the righteous judgment of God." All this experience is death to a soul
   in which there still live any higher thoughts. Who has not known such
   terrible moments--when we have been made to possess our sins, and the
   iniquities of youth have laid hold of us with the grip of death; when
   the consciousness of lost opportunities, and enfeebled or wasted power,
   and the dreams of vanished good have haunted us--and we have dwelt in
   darkness, as them that have been long dead? Ah, my friends! these are
   realities, let men theorise about sin as they may. What men or women
   that you would care to know have not felt something of them--have not,
   in short, felt the sentence of death in themselves, as they have
   thought of what they might have done, or what they might have been, if
   they had striven more steadfastly, and sought the strength of God more
   carefully?

   This brings us to the last view of St. Paul's doctrine. Death, in so
   far as it is spiritual, is subjective. It is a state, that is to say,
   in man, whether realised by him or not, But the word seems also
   sometimes to point to the objective relation which all sin bears to
   God, as when it is said that death, or a state of condemnation, "has
   passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." [183] In any case, such
   an objective relation of sin to the divine Holiness and Justice is
   clearly expressed in the Pauline Epistles. And the special name given
   to it is sufficiently emphatic. It is called the "wrath of God." [184]
   "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and
   unrighteousness of men." "Wrath against the day of wrath." [185]
   "Because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of
   disobedience." [186] "Among whom also we all had our conversation in
   times past, in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the
   flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even
   as others." [187] These and many other passages speak of our sin as not
   merely misery to ourselves, but as offensive to God, and the object of
   His judicial punishment. This is the special idea
   conveyed--disobedience in us necessarily provokes judgment in God.
   There can be no other relation between human sin and divine
   righteousness but one of condemnation--of vindictive punishment, using
   the words in their proper sense. This is a true element of the Pauline
   doctrine, and, indeed, enters into the very heart of it. Sin is not
   only death in us, but deserves the sentence of death. It is under the
   divine wrath and curse. And it would be ill with us if it were not so.
   If God were not sure to punish the evil, and to make it bear, so far as
   it remains evil, the weight of His condemnation, the good would lose
   for us its reality: Punishment may be hard, but it lies not only in the
   nature of sin itself, but in the nature of a holy divine Will that
   loves righteousness and hates wickedness. [188] Such a Will can only go
   forth towards sin in punishment of some kind, and a righteous doom must
   rest upon it as its due award in a righteous universe. But this subject
   will receive fuller consideration in our next and final Lecture.

VI.

ORIGINAL SIN.

   IN advancing to the doctrine of original sin, we are still dealing with
   the Epistles of St. Paul and with the doctrine of St. Paul. Our aim has
   been throughout to trace the growth of the idea of sin to its full
   consciousness in the primitive Church; and St. Paul is the last
   expression of this consciousness. Within the sphere of Revelation we do
   not reach any further development of the doctrine, although still
   further developments awaited it in the thought of the fifth century,
   and in the later thought of Protestantism. We have been so much in the
   habit of identifying these later modes of thought with certain passages
   in the Pauline Epistles, that it is difficult for us to separate them.
   Such passages have so long spoken with an Augustinian or Arminian
   voice, that we can hardly read them without catching the argumentative
   tone of the one or other. But such voices are the afterthought of the
   Church heard in controversy, and not the original voice of St. Paul. It
   lies in the very principle of the historic method that we should try to
   distinguish the original from the after thought, and, as I said before,
   read always forwards instead of backwards.

   Deeply as St. Augustine had drunk of the spirit of St. Paul, and
   closely kindred as they were in intellectual and emotional nature, they
   were yet widely separated in time and circumstances. There is a great
   interval of thought betwixt the first and the fifth century, and a very
   changed atmosphere surrounds the African Bishop from that which
   surrounded the Apostle of the Gentiles. It is well for us to know how
   St. Augustine interpreted St. Paul. No student can probably understand
   the full meaning of the latter who does not know something of the
   former: yet Augustinianism is something quite distinct from Paulinism.
   It had to deal with different questions and different adversaries--with
   the Pelagian instead of the Pharisee--with the full-grown Manichee
   instead of the infant Gnostic. In the great conflict of his day,
   against Manichæan and Pelagian opponents alike, St. Augustine was
   mighty through God in the truth of St. Paul. From the great apostle he
   drew the strength of his convictions, and the weapons of his warfare.
   He developed St. Paul's thought in order to meet and confound the
   errors around him; and he did this with so much power, with such a
   living insight into the profundities of that thought, and such a genius
   of intellectual and spiritual authority, that he has left the impress
   of his theology upon the Western Church until this day--surviving alike
   the influence of the Reformation and the more serious disintegration of
   modern criticism. The Church of the West can never speak of St.
   Augustine in other words than those of reverence. But this is no reason
   why we should only read St. Paul through his interpretations. The very
   dominance of his influence should rather put us on our guard against
   doing so. St. Paul is too great a figure even to stand behind St.
   Augustine, and his thought in all its bearings is to be caught if
   possible by the theological student in its original freshness and life.
   It is difficult, no doubt, to do this. It cannot be done without a
   special training. Standing as we do at the end of a long line of
   controversial thought, it is hard for us to get to the beginning and
   unwind the line downwards. It is much easier for us to take the end as
   the beginning, and not trouble ourselves further. But this is to
   abandon Theology as a science; and in such a case we had better let it
   alone altogether.

   In dealing further with the Pauline doctrine of sin, or with that final
   aspect of it which is known as the doctrine of Original Sin, it will
   not be possible altogether to avoid points which owe their importance
   to later theology--so much of this theology rises directly out of the
   heart of the apostle's thought. Still it will be our aim to keep here,
   as elsewhere, close to our subject,--to steer as clear of controversy
   as we can, and to fix our attention down to the living features of the
   Pauline theology in itself. The interest felt in these Lectures has
   been mainly owing, as I fancy, to the manner in which I have sought to
   look at the subject, and to trace the great and solemn idea with which
   it is concerned along the fresh lines of its development in the
   spiritual consciousness of the race, rather than to make it a topic for
   polemical argument, however well-intentioned. Controversy can never
   cease in Theology any more than in other subjects of inquiry; and in
   it, more often than in many other subjects, the thesis or the
   affirmative can only be clearly seen and understood in contrast with
   the antithesis or negative. Truth can only be made bright in the face
   of error. Yet theological ideas will only rise into the region of
   Science, and become living ideas for all reverent intellects of
   whatever Church, when they have been rescued by the labours of many
   thinkers from the atmosphere of party controversy, and set in the light
   of a comprehensive inquiry into all the facts of that spiritual Order
   which runs through human history;--in other words, when they are seen
   to be real growths of that spiritual consciousness which is not only
   inseparable from Humanity, but which is its highest manifestation in
   all times of healthy moral and intellectual progress.

   In our preceding Lecture we dealt with the doctrine of St. Paul in so
   far as it may be said to be a doctrine of experience. Three special
   points occupied us: Ist, The universality of sin; 2d, The nature or
   seat of sin; and 3d, Its effects or consequences. For the proof of all
   these points St. Paul appealed to experience. The universality of sin
   was no mere theory or opinion of his, enforced by his authority. He
   looked on the Gentile and the Jewish world alike, and saw them "guilty
   before God." The righteousness or spiritual good for which man was
   formed--his own conscience being the witness--was nowhere realised. All
   had sinned and come short of that glory of God, without sharing in
   which there could be no human blessedness. This miserable conclusion
   was clearly proved to him by the facts around him; and the facts were
   not, alas! exceptional facts, save in some darker features. Man is no
   less a sinner at all points of his history than in the time of St.
   Paul. In explanation of the rise of sin in us, and its nature, he no
   less appealed to experience. His whole analysis. of the "flesh" and the
   "spirit," and again, of the "flesh" and the "mind," and of the conflict
   ever raging betwixt these higher and lower elements of our being, was
   in the main an appeal to the experience of all in whom any higher life
   has been awakened, who have risen from the death of the mere
   nature-life to the consciousness of an Ideal or a sense of duty, for
   which they ought to live--after which they ought to aspire. And,
   lastly, in speaking of the consequences of sin, he described these as
   more or less experienced by all who yield to the "law of sin and death"
   that is in their members. The end unto death is one which sinners may
   or may not realise in its fulness, but it is nevertheless always a
   reality. The wages may be deferred, or may not be consciously received;
   but they are paid, without stint, sooner or later. The fatal
   consequences may not always equally appear, but they never fail in some
   form or another.

   So far, therefore, the doctrine of the apostle may be said to be a
   doctrine of experience. His analysis is an analysis of spiritual facts,
   verifiable by you and by me, and by all who have the same spiritual
   nature. The facts may be denied. The apostle was quite well aware of
   this. But that did not alter his estimate of their reality. He had no
   doubt they would approve themselves whenever the voice of conscience
   was heard in a man, or the power of any divine Ideal taken hold of by
   him. This was enough for him. The state of those who knew nothing of
   the facts was out of account. It was a state worse than the most bitter
   consciousness of sin, because it was one in which the true life of man,
   as distinguished from his lower or mere animal life, had not yet
   emerged.

   1. But besides this doctrine of experience, there is a further doctrine
   in St. Paul--a philosophy of the subject, which in part at least
   transcends experience. Sin is not only in human nature--the expression
   of that lower side of it which he calls the "flesh,"--but it is an
   hereditary characteristic of it. Man is born in sin. In one sense, this
   may be said to be a mere truism. If man is composed of flesh as well as
   mind or reason--if there is a lower carnal life in all, and the only
   question is not as to the experience of the lower but of the higher
   life--then there can be no doubt that sin is an original element of
   human nature. It comes to us by birth. The universality of sin implies
   that sin is the outgrowth of original tendencies, and that man is a
   sinner, not merely by the fact that he deliberately chooses the evil
   rather than the good, but because his nature is evil, or has inherited
   evil properties. To this extent, the doctrine of original sin is a mere
   generalisation from obvious facts. The mixed impulses with which we
   come into the world bear their natural fruit of good and evil. Not only
   so; but, as it is the lower or animal side of human life that may be
   said to grow first--to put forth its shoots with most vigour in the
   beginning--it is inevitable that the manifestations of our lower life
   should show an early activity, and that evil rather than good should
   spring up in the fertile soil. There is nothing that can be said to
   transcend experience in such a doctrine as this; nor is there anything
   in it that can well admit of question on any hypothesis of human origin
   and destiny.

   That all individual men and women are what they are of good or evil, in
   virtue not only of their own individual acts, but of inherited
   tendencies which have descended from a long antecedent past, is so far
   an indisputable conclusion. No creature is, so to speak, merely itself
   in the world. It is where it is, or what it is, as the result of an
   indefinite advance and appropriation of preceding forms of existence.
   And this is true not only of the forms of animal life, but of all
   organic forms, moral and intellectual as well as animal. There is a
   continuous growth everywhere, and all share in this growth. All come
   forth from the teeming bosom of the past. None stand isolated or
   self-centred. Not to speak of the necessary connection between the
   higher and the lower nature of man--a connection which none can deny,
   however strenuously they may resist the materialistic interpretations
   drawn from it--intellectual and moral life by themselves are seen to
   run along continuous threads, and to grow into what they are as the
   result of many accessories. They are no more isolated than any other
   phenomena of nature and of life.

   The doctrine of hereditary corruption, therefore, stating it merely as
   we are now stating it, is so far from being contradictory to modern
   ideas, that it may be said to be a direct corollary from the doctrine
   of evolution. Assuming that there is sin at all in the world, or
   something answering to what we call sin, it becomes a direct inference
   from the scientific observation of facts, that sin has propagated
   itself from generation to generation and from race to race. If it is a
   feature in humanity, it is a feature which has come to us from our
   progenitors, and contributed its share to make man what he now is. If
   what we call corruption is universal, then it is necessarily
   hereditary. For, in fact, there is nothing in our human nature, or, for
   that part of the matter, in nature anywhere, which is not so far
   hereditary. All forms of life and activity have a lineage. They are
   only what they are as the outcome of this lineage; and man, therefore,
   can only be a sinner because he has come of a line of sinners, and the
   evil that is in him has been passed over to him from those who have
   gone before him.

   2. But the doctrine of the apostle is something more than this: it is
   something, indeed, very different from this. His mind does not move on
   the plane of inductive observation at all. He was a great master of
   facts within the spiritual sphere, a psychological analyst of no mean
   skill. He delights to deal with the realities of our inward experience,
   and to make the truth manifest in the sight of conscience. But he would
   never have dreamt of looking for any confirmation of his special
   doctrine in the laws of the natural world. The natural world was far
   less real to him than the spiritual,--and cosmic conceptions had no
   place in his mind beside the religious and scholastic conceptions in
   which he had been bred as a Pharisee, and which were illuminated and
   spiritualised, not extinguished, by his Christian culture. In his full
   explanation of the universality of sin, therefore, he rises into a
   quite different atmosphere, and travels beyond the range of ordinary
   experience. Sin is with him not merely transmitted to us, as all our
   qualities must be transmitted: but it comes to us by definite passage
   from the sin of Adam as the prototype and representative of our race.
   His idea of original sin is not simply the transmission of sinful
   qualities from generation to generation by the principle of natural
   inheritance. It is an idea of spiritual injury and penal consequence
   inflicted upon the race by the first sin, and directly imputed to the
   race in consequence of that sin. This is the doctrine which he lays
   down in two well-known passages, [189] one of which in the fifth
   chapter of the Epistle to the Romans has long been a subject of
   difficulty and controversy.

   It may be urged, as some have done, [190] that too much importance has
   been attached to these passages of St. Paul. They form, after all, but
   a small part of his writings--a few verses amongst thousands. Yet the
   commentary on them has filled the Christian world, and great parties in
   the Church have waged around them an incessant strife. It may be
   granted that Christian controversialists have made too much of these
   detached portions of St. Paul's writings. It is the bane of all
   controversy to concentrate attention upon single points, and to forget
   the connection of thought and doctrine in the emphasis of these points.
   Texts have played an unhappy part in the history of Theology, and led
   men's minds away from the balance and co-ordination of Christian truth.
   This has come from a wrong conception of Revelation, and is passing
   away with the conception out of which it sprang. But, admitting this,
   we may be sure that the instinct of the Church has not been wrong in
   attributing vital importance to the passages in question, and that they
   bring before us very fundamental elements of St. Paul's thought. His
   doctrine of original sin may have been argued too endlessly in the
   Church, and drawn out into conclusions which it will hardly bear. But
   it is one of real moment in his whole system of thought.

   The passage in the Epistle to the Romans runs as follows in our
   version: [191] "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world,
   and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men for that all have
   sinned. For until the law" (up to the time of giving the law) "sin was
   in the world; but sin is not imputed where there is no law.
   Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had
   not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the
   figure of him that was to come." Further, in the nineteenth verse:
   [192] "As by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the
   obedience of one shall many be made righteous." The passage in the
   fifteenth chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians is
   comparatively brief and general: "For as in Adam all die, even so in
   Christ shall all be made alive." [193]

   The thought of the apostle in these and other passages circulates
   around Adam on the one hand, and Christ on the other, as centres of
   spiritual influence. The state of man before Christ, and the state of
   man after--or of all who belong to Christ and share in His redeeming
   work--is strongly contrasted. Adam, as sinner, gives its character to
   the one; Christ, as Saviour and the righteous One, gives its character
   to the other. In the passage from the Epistle to the Romans, sin and
   death are represented as the ruling powers in the world. Adam is the
   source through which they have entered into the world. Through his one
   act of sin, Adam not only fell himself, but the line of spiritual
   integrity was broken in him. The flaw extended to the race. "Sin
   entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all,
   for that all have sinned." In other- words, sin passed to us from Adam,
   and death from sin. This is the simple meaning of the words as they
   stand in our version. They might seem at first to add little to the
   doctrine of hereditary corruption as generalised from the facts of
   experience. But on a closer view they will be found to add various
   features to this doctrine. They emphasise the position of Adam as not
   merely the first in a line of sinners, but as the type or
   representative of the whole line--one whose act was fatal not only for
   himself, but for all who followed him. All mankind fell with him into
   the death which he had incurred. (a.) This typical character of Adam;
   (b.) the descent of spiritual depravity from him; and (c.) the fatal
   character of the results which followed not only for himself but for
   his posterity--in other words, the judicial character of these results
   in their downward passage--are all ideas more or less involved in the
   passage. Let us look at them a little more carefully, and see how far
   they are true ideas of the apostle without special reference to the
   deductions of later theology.

   (a.) As to the first or the typical character of Adam, there can be no
   doubt. This thought is plainly implied in the passage as a whole, as
   well as in the passage quoted from the fifteenth chapter of the First
   Epistle to the Corinthians, and in other passages of the same chapter.
   [194] It is a familiar thought of the apostle. Adam was with him not
   only the first man historically, but the first man representatively. He
   stands before all others not only in time, but in idea. He is the
   earthly type, as Christ is the spiritual type, of humanity. This
   contrast of typical relation is no accident of the apostle's thought.
   It is embedded in it, and reappears constantly. There is a sense to him
   in which mankind were summed up in Adam, as believers are summed up in
   Christ. He has a profound feeling of the unity of the race, and of this
   unity Adam is a type or symbol. His act is therefore more than his own
   act. It has consequences not merely of historical sequence, but of
   representative meaning.

   (b.) But the unity of the human race is with St. Paul no mere natural
   unity, or unity of external conditions. He looks at man not from the
   outside, but from the inside, and sees the race everywhere bound
   together by inward links. It is true that it is the lower and not the
   higher side of humanity that Adam represents and sums up. Christ is the
   representative of the higher or spiritual side--the Lord from heaven.
   But even man's lower relations are inwardly apprehended. It is not
   merely natural dispositions that have come from Adam--it is sin--an
   inward depravity--a will enfeebled for all that is good, and prone to
   all that is evil. This inward view of the apostle separates his thought
   from all mere physiological considerations. These he neither denied nor
   affirmed. They were out of his sight. When he speaks of man, even on
   the lower or earthly side of his being, as represented by Adam,--he
   thinks of him as a being under moral conditions and responsibilities.
   The transmission of sin, therefore, is with him not a mere accumulation
   of evil dispositions and tendencies, but an injury in the will or moral
   power.

   (c.) This injury is characterised by him as death. In our last Lecture
   we so far expounded the meaning of this expression, and promised to
   return to it; and it is in connection with this subject, or the
   consequences of Adam's sin, that the special difficulty of St. Paul's
   doctrine arises. The full force of what the apostle means by death is
   brought before us in the two passages under consideration. It is the
   dissolution of the inward life of righteousness, which is alone the
   true life of all the true children of God. But it is also more than
   this. It is a state of condemnation, or of liability to punishment. The
   presence of sin is not merely ruinous in us, but it calls down the
   judgment of God. The "wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
   ungodliness and unrighteousness of men." There can be no other relation
   betwixt our unrighteousness and the righteousness of God but a relation
   of condemnation. And this relation is passed over to men by the Fall.
   "And so death has passed upon all men, for that" (eph' ho) "all have
   sinned."

   The precise meaning of these few words has been vehemently contested.
   Do they imply merely, as in our version is all their obvious meaning,
   that as death followed the sin of Adam, so death follows the sin of
   all? All die, because all have sinned. Or is the thought that death or
   condemnation follows directly and universally the commission of Adam's
   sin, irrespective of personal sin? Under the influence of this last
   view Augustine translated the words, "in whom all have sinned;" and
   this translation has passed into the Vulgate. [195] Instead of
   translating the words conjunctively, as from the earlier times of the
   Church they had been understood, and as they are rendered in our
   version, he sought to find a subject to the relative [196] in Adam as
   the first man. But no modern scholar can be said to advocate this
   translation, which, moreover, yields a meaning at variance with the
   context. For how does the apostle proceed in his argument? "For until
   the law," he says, or up to the time of the law, "sin was in the world;
   but sin is not imputed when there is no law." He had stated that sin
   was introduced into the world by one man, or by Adam's transgression of
   the divine law, and that death had followed sin, and passed upon all.
   But an objection seems to occur to him--If sin is always the
   transgression of law, what are we to make of the period betwixt Adam
   and Moses, when there was no positive law given to mankind? How could
   sin be reckoned against man when there was no law? He answers in the
   verses that follow: "Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses,
   even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's
   transgression." The evidence, therefore, that there was really sin in
   the world then, is that death prevailed. It is true that sinners then
   were not sinners in the same sense as Adam. They did not transgress a
   positive divine law as he did. But they were none the less sinners.
   Although they had no definite law or express divine command given them
   to test their obedience, they had the law of reason and of conscience.
   The voice of God might have been heard in their hearts if they had
   listened to it. But they failed to do this, and they sinned therefore,
   although not after the similitude of Adam's sin. He does not explain
   all this. His reasoning is enigmatic here, as in many other places; but
   this is clearly his thought, as elsewhere expressed in the epistle. The
   sufficient evidence to his mind of the presence of sin in all the time
   from Adam to Moses is the prevalence of death during this time. Death
   reigned then as at other times.

   It seems plain, therefore, that the apostle connects death in every
   case with the personal commission of sin. The death which has passed
   upon all men is not merely a death on account of Adam's sin, but on
   account of their own sins. Death is everywhere the evidence of sin. It
   implies sin; and its universality, therefore, is a proof of the
   universality of sin, just as its prevalence during the period from Adam
   to Moses was a proof that men were sinners then as at all other times,
   although they were not living under definite law. "The apostle's idea
   is, that sin as well as death is universal, and that they are
   inseparably linked to each other. The universality of sin, however, is
   not so immediately and clearly apparent as the universality of death;
   and so it is inferred that sin is universal from the fact that death is
   universal, there being no death apart from sin, which is its cause. The
   whole argument shows distinctly that, though he sees in sin and death
   the operation of a principle reigning in humanity since Adam, he yet
   conceives the death of man to be essentially connected with his own
   sin: Death came to all,' or passed upon all, because all have sinned.'
   The coming of death, in other words, cannot be explained except on the
   supposition that all have sinned. The one always involves the other."
   [197]

   While on the one hand, therefore, death follows from Adam's sin, it is
   no less inseparably connected in every case with personal sin. In other
   words, while the punishment of Adam's sin did not stay with himself,
   but was diffused with the diffusion of the sin which he initiated, it
   is not passed over by itself merely. The true relation is--(1) Adam's
   sin; (2) Our sin; (3) Death cleaving necessarily to both. But it may be
   said, Does not the death of infants, who commit no actual sin, and who
   are yet subject to death, imply the imputation of Adam's sin to them?
   If death and sin are inseparable, is not their death to be explained
   only by the fact that Adam's sin and death are passed over to them?
   Whatever force there may be in such a view, it certainly derives no
   confirmation from the present passage, which distinctly asserts the
   personal presence of sin as the cause or explanation of death. But
   what, then, of the death of infants? This, which was a puzzle in the
   fifth century, cannot, in the same degree, puzzle us, for reasons I
   have more than once explained. The dissolution of the physical system
   is nowhere in St. Paul nor in Scripture represented as solely the
   result of sin. The death of Adam, the death of sin, in St. Paul, is
   always something more than mere physical death. It may include the
   death of the body--it does this plainly and prominently in the passage
   before us--but it always includes more; and, even when it refers to
   physical death, it is not the decay of nature--the extinction of an
   organism, which is the essential note of the word--but the pain and
   misery and spiritual apprehension which the decay, in the case of human
   beings, irresistibly suggests. It is beyond doubt that death itself, in
   the mere sense of decay, is inherent in all organism; that the
   conditions of life, in short, are death; and that infant organic
   structures consequently should die when weak, or imperfect, or ready to
   vanish away, is no more remarkable than that any other organism should
   perish. The mystery of all life and death when we go beneath the
   surface, as we are incessantly prompted to do in the case of human
   beings, is impenetrable. But on the surface there is no more mystery in
   one case than another. Death follows the exhaustion of living tissue in
   young and old alike, and, as a mere natural fact, is independent of
   moral conditions, or, at least, nowhere solely follows them.

   The physical death of infants, therefore, does not require sin to
   explain it. And as to anything further, we have no knowledge. The final
   fate of infants, which perplexed Augustine's mind, cannot perplex ours.
   Of the meaning of death in the future, or what is known as perdition,
   we have no call here to speak. The reality that is in it comes from
   sin; it is the final punishment of sin. And those who go down in
   darkness to dwell in misery outside the Divine presence are receiving
   in the end wages due to them. The thought is awful enough, and may well
   make sinners pause before their feet stumble, and the light pass from
   their eyes, and, behold, there is only darkness. But it would not only
   be awful, but horrible, if we supposed that this dread reality awaited
   any life which had not here come to moral consciousness, or known the
   choice of good and evil. If we can be sure of anything at all, we may
   be sure of this, that God will deal with all as they have really done,
   rendering unto every man according to his works. If there is any moral
   truth at all, this is moral truth--that God will act fairly, and that
   none will receive what they have not deserved in their own doings.
   There is no principle more frequently enunciated both in the New and
   the Old Testament Scriptures. Whatever, therefore, may be the
   consequence of Adam's sin to infants, we may be sure that they will not
   suffer for these consequences. As they have not known to do evil, they
   cannot have evil rendered to them. Their fate may be beyond our
   scrutiny. An impenetrable veil may rest upon it, and we may never be
   able to lift it; but we take refuge in the sure truth, that the Judge
   of all will do what is right, and that He to whom we commit the
   child-life, which He has mysteriously given and mysteriously taken
   away, is "our Father which art in heaven"--whose face the angels of
   little children continually behold. [198]

   But what, then, is the precise force of our relation to Adam? To what
   extent do we suffer for his sin? What is imputed to us in consequence?
   The death which is passed upon all men--what is it more particularly?
   We have already seen that the relation of Adam to the sinful race which
   has proceeded from him is typical. There is more in it to his posterity
   than there in the relation of any other man to the race; and this not
   merely because he was first in natural order, but because the race was
   in a certain sense anticipated in him or summed up in him. It admits of
   no doubt that this was one of the governing ideas of the apostle's
   mind. Whether we make it any more clear by drawing it out according to
   our own imperfect analogies, and turning the mystery into a logical
   illustration, seems questionable. But plainly it was in the mind of the
   apostle that we suffer directly from Adam's sin--not merely in the loss
   of spiritual faculty and divine good which we would otherwise have
   possessed--but in definite punishment. God deals with the race
   judicially on account of it, as a sinful race. As our Confession of
   Faith' has it, (Our first parents being the root of all mankind, the
   guilt of their sin was imputed, and the same death, and sin, and
   corrupted nature conveyed to all their posterity." [199] I am glad to
   be able to quote these words for their own sake, and because of their
   source. They are weighty and, upon the whole, sober words; and although
   they necessarily take us away from the immediate atmosphere of
   Scripture, they do not seem to me, rightly understood, to exceed the
   fair meaning of St. Paul.

   The terms of the statement in the Confession are deserving of
   particular attention. They speak not of an imputation of sin--as many
   have done unadvisedly--but of the guilt of sin. And the distinction is
   an important one in theological language. The expression "guilt" has
   always had more meanings than one, and the theological language of the
   sixteenth and seventeenth centuries is only intelligible when this is
   kept in view. When we say that a man is guilty, we primarily mean that
   he has really done the crime or evil deed imputed to him. But when a
   person is pronounced guilty, or has incurred guilt, we also mean that
   he has become obnoxious to punishment. Here, as often elsewhere, the
   meaning of a familiar word runs out into a secondary and even a
   tertiary sense. First, and properly, the word means personal ill-doing.
   If I say to myself, "I am guilty," I accuse myself of a wrong that I
   ought not to have done. The idea is specially and prominently that of
   self-reference. The evil I could not, or should not, I have done. But
   the idea is also that of self-condemnation, or the desert of
   punishment. I deserve to suffer for what I have done. The two feelings
   are inseparable. Conscious wrong-doing is at the same time conscious
   condemnation. And every wrong-doer who has been brought to a sense of
   his wrong will have the one feeling as well as the other. And even if
   the wrongdoer have no sense of his wrong, the fact that he has
   committed a wrong, and that he deserves punishment for it, is not
   altered in his case. Let the act be carried home to him, and let it be
   proved that he did it--that he was, as it is said, art and part in
   it--and he only deserves punishment all the more that he has professed
   unconsciousness of the act, or added falsehood to his folly or crime.
   In these two meanings the proper or the moral sense of guilt is summed
   up; and it would have been better, therefore, that the use of the word
   had not been extended further. But it has been extended in theological
   language to the still further or tertiary sense of liability to
   punishment as the consequence of wrong-doing. The results of wrong
   accumulate and descend, not only upon the offender, but upon all
   connected with him. And the term "guilt" has been passed over to denote
   this condemned state, or state of punishment.

   This is the only intelligible sense in which it can be said that the
   guilt of Adam's sin is imputed to us.[See [19]Appendix XXI.] We did not
   personally participate in Adam's sin. We cannot be brought to feel that
   we did so, or that we deserve punishment for having done so. The race
   may deserve punishment inasmuch as it was summed up in him as its
   representative, and that in this sense it sinned and fell in him. There
   are those who think that the apostle's meaning is not exhausted without
   this deeper view of this subject which takes in the whole of humanity
   as bound up in Adam--as a united whole in him, and dealt with as a
   whole. His ill-deserving is therefore passed over to all, although in
   the nature of things, or on the broad ground of natural reason, that
   personal merit or demerit is incommunicable, it can never be brought
   home to all. It must be admitted that the apostle's language is of a
   strongly realistic turn, and that he conceives Adam and his race as, so
   to speak, identified in the divine view. This has been clearly allowed
   in our exposition; but it has been equally clear that sin itself, and
   the ill-desert that comes from it, as always personal, are not
   imputable. If this extreme view, therefore, be maintained, it can only
   be as a mystery--as something lying behind the region of ordinary
   thought. The clear dictate of conscience is, that we can only deserve
   ill when we have done ill.

   No one more clearly recognises this axiom of the moral sense than the
   apostle himself. In the very passage which has been more or less the
   basis of all our thought in this Lecture, we have seen how clearly he
   brings out death as always the consequence of personal sin, and not
   merely of Adam's sin. The personal element is always emphasised by him,
   as by all the Biblical writers, in connection with sin. It is you and I
   who sin, and who will be punished for our own sins. This broad moral
   commonplace, intelligible by all, owned by all, runs through Scripture,
   and is the great line upon which all its exhortations and warnings
   turn. It seems hardly possible to attach the conception of ill-desert
   to anything but personal wrong-doing. It may be doubted if the apostle
   ever intends to do this, realistic as is his conception of humanity,
   and of the relation in which it stands to the first man.

   But neither can there be any doubt that he passes over to humanity the
   state of condemnation or obnoxiousness to punishment into which Adam
   fell. That is to him a matter of fact. Adam's sin is in this sense
   guilt to all, that it brings punishment to all. And if there is also
   mystery in this,--that a race should be punished because the first man
   kept not his first estate--if the moral sense is not without difficulty
   here (there may be those who think the difficulty hardly a step
   removed),--there are at least also broad facts of experience that come
   in to help us in facing this mystery. It is a fact, however we may
   explain it, that guilt in this sense is imputable. The punishment of
   wrong-doing descends far beyond the wrong-doer. Children are involved
   in their parents' shame. A family without any ill-deserving suffers
   many ills, and even a sort of death itself, from the criminality of its
   head. A nation is plunged into misery, and reaps the reward of iniquity
   through all its bounds, when its chief men stand condemned at the bar
   of moral judgment, or have plunged it into flagrant wrong. If it be
   true that sin is' always personal, and God will render unto every man
   according to his works, it is no less true that all sin is diffusive,
   and carries with it a train of endless consequences, many of them of a
   strictly penal character. We may be sure we will not suffer at last for
   anything that we have not done. In point of fact, the question is a
   theoretical one for all who have grown to know good and evil. "If we
   say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in
   us." [200] From the first dawn of moral consciousness, we have been
   conscious of short-coming. Actual sin has become inextricably
   interwoven in us with original sin, and we stand on our own deserts
   before the bar of divine judgment. We need not therefore trouble
   ourselves with the question how far we shall be punished for the sins
   of another, seeing our own sins are more than can be reckoned up, and
   that we know in our hearts, if' we know anything, that no injustice
   will be done us by Him who judges righteously.

   It was necessary, all the same, that this deeper view of the subject
   should come before us, and that we should look at the question of sin
   not merely on its personal, but, so to speak, its impersonal or
   original side. Both sides must be taken together. If we look at human
   nature merely in its historic connection, we seem bound in a chain of
   external facts, which leaves no room for personal freedom. The very
   idea of sin seems to vanish in its necessity. How can man be blamable
   for what he cannot help--for that which is the mere outcome of the
   nature which God has given him? If God has so connected us with a
   sinful race, and so connected the race with its fallen original,--then
   all seems His own doing. And having made us what we are,. how can He
   punish us that we are no better than we are? If we push the doctrine of
   original sin as some have done, we end in the subversion of sin
   altogether. But we look within, and we know that, whatever may be our
   connection with a given order of events which hold us in their
   dependence, we are free to act--that if we sin daily, we yet can help
   sinning--that even when temptation is at its strongest we can turn away
   from it, and choose that which is right and good. Nay, we know that the
   Right and Good form the true law of our being, to which we are truly
   bound, and not the wrong or the evil which yet so often bind us. There
   is that in us which is, deeper than all sinful habit, and which no
   force of original sin can overcome, if only we give it free play. And
   if we do not do so,--if we yield to the lower rather than to the
   higher--to the evil rather than to the good,--we know that we deserve
   to receive evil, and that punishment is our due. All our experience is
   thus mixed. We are bound, and yet we are free; we are sharers in
   original sin, and yet we ourselves are sinners; inheritors of evil, and
   yet voluntarily evil-doers. We may be unable to coordinate the two
   sides of our experience, but this is no reason why we should not
   acknowledge the one side as well as the other.

   If we start merely from a single side of human nature, it is easy to
   build up systems, and there are minds which will always demand such
   systems. The Theological Necessitarian has had his day in the past;
   and, blind to the discrimination of moral facts, he has drawn out his
   theory till it has covered the whole field of Christian thought. It is
   now the high day of the Materialistic Necessitarian, who is prepared to
   explain all life--intellectual and moral as well as physical--from
   microscopic germs up to its most subtle and lofty developments. Such
   systems are said to be rigorous and consistent, and to know what they
   are about. They do not palter in a double sense, or stand with
   trembling and agitated gaze on the brink of mystery. All haze has gone
   from them; almighty Power in the one case, and almighty Law in the
   other, is made to solve all--to open the shell of the universe and show
   its secret. The modern system-monger seems quite as sure of this secret
   as the most confident theologian of the ancient school. He goes forth
   into the darkness with his naturalistic law of evolution in his hand,
   and all seems to him to fall into order. The great modern idea is to
   swallow up all the thought of the past, and to bear humanity
   prosperously into a dim future without a soul and without a God. But
   the facts of moral life are not thus to be borne down. They spring up
   irrepressibly from every attempt to merge them in some theoretic
   principle which only explains them at the expense of their reality. In
   this way they are not to be solved. They claim to be heard for
   themselves, and to vindicate their independence, however difficult it
   may be to reconcile them with any preconceived theory. The thinker, who
   feels bound to recognise both sides of human experience--the moral and
   intellectual alike--the spiritual and the scientific together,--who
   shrinks from no discovery of science and no advance in knowledge, and
   yet clings to the realities of the inner life and the verities of a
   Divine order,--has a hard time of it betwixt system-builders on the one
   side and the other;--the bigotries of an omniscient Science on the one
   hand, and the jealousies of an omniscient Theology on the other. He is
   flaunted by the one and suspected by the other. But the moderation
   which refuses to affirm where the grounds of affirmation are wanting,
   and is content to explore and recognise facts of whatever kind, even
   where it cannot co-ordinate them or bind them into a theory, is at once
   the best note of science, and the surest pledge of a theology that has
   some promise for the future, as well as hold upon the past.

   And now I have done with these Lectures. It has been to me a grateful
   surprise that so many should have felt so true an interest in them. If
   I have said anything that has helped or may yet help any to think more
   truly of a great verity of our spiritual nature, or of the verities of
   religious life and doctrine altogether, I have reason to thank God and
   take courage. I have said nothing, I hope, in any case, which can serve
   to lessen the solemn reality of the great truth of which I have been
   speaking. I have endeavoured to keep close to my task of scientific
   exposition, and to allow as few jarring notes as possible to enter from
   any side. This appears to me--it has long appeared to me--the only
   useful mode of treating Christian doctrine.

   Let us, in conclusion, remember that the sin of which I have been
   speaking is our own--your sin and mine; and that if there is sin at
   all, it is necessarily always misery. It bears its own doom with it.
   But the Son of God "was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him is
   no sin." [201] His name is Jesus, because "He saves His people from
   their sins." [202] He has come into the world, "not to condemn the
   world, but that the world through Him might be saved." [203] If we are
   conscious of the conflict of sin in ourselves--if in our higher
   moments, when we are ravished by the Good, we are yet held back by the
   Evil, and when we delight in the law of God, according to the inward
   man, we yet find a law in our members warring against the law of our
   minds, and bringing us into captivity to the law of sin and death--let
   us remember that there is One who is able to help us, and who will not
   suffer us to be tempted above what we are able to bear; and let our
   prayer be--who would not have the experience out of which such a prayer
   springs, bitter though it be, rather than rest in the deadness of
   sin?--Save us, good Lord, and bring us from all the weary and sinful
   struggle of this mortal life to Thine own holy peace, and Thine
   everlasting kingdom and glory. Amen.

  THEOLOGY AND NATURAL SCIENCE.

   SOME more definite passage to the effect of what I have here stated was
   running in my head when I wrote my Lecture. But I have failed to verify
   it. The tone of thought, however, which is implied in the text is not
   uncommon, and may be sufficiently illustrated by the following extract
   from one of David Hume's Essays ("Of the Academical or Sceptical
   Philosophy," in the Inquiry concerning the Human Understanding'), with
   accompanying comment by Professor Huxley. The extract and comment are
   found in the close of Professor Huxley's address "On the Physical Basis
   of Life"--Lay Sermons,' &c., p. 150:--

   "If we take in hand any volume of divinity, or school metaphysics, for
   instance, let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning
   quantity and number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning
   concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the
   flames, for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusions.'

   "Permit me to enforce this most wise advice. Why trouble ourselves
   about matters of which, however important they may be, we do know
   nothing, and can know nothing? We live in a world which is full of
   misery and ignorance; and the plain duty of each and all of us is to
   try to make the little corner he can influence somewhat less miserable
   and somewhat less ignorant than it was before he entered it. To do this
   effectually, it is necessary to be possessed of only two beliefs: the
   first, that the order of nature is ascertainable by our faculties to an
   extent which is practically unlimited; the second, that our volition
   counts for something as a condition of the course of events. Each of
   these beliefs can be verified experimentally as often as we like to
   try."

   Nothing else, of course, of the nature of theological truth--which
   neither concerns "quantity and number," nor yet in Hume's sense "matter
   of fact and existence"--can be verified experimentally, and why then
   trouble ourselves about what we can never know?

  KANT'S RECOGNITION OF THE MORAL LAW.

   "Two things there are, which, the oftener and the more steadfastly we
   consider, fill the mind with an ever-new, an ever-rising admiration and
   reverence--the starry heaven above, the moral law within. Of neither am
   I compelled to seek out the reality, as veiled in darkness, or only to
   conjecture the possibility, as beyond the hemisphere of my knowledge.
   Both I contemplate lying clear before me, and connect both immediately
   with my consciousness of existence. The one departs from the place I
   occupy in the outer world of sense; expands, beyond the bounds of
   imagination, this connection of my body with worlds rising beyond
   worlds, and systems blending into systems; and protends it also into
   the illimitable times of their periodic movement--to its commencement
   and perpetuity. The other departs from my invisible self, from my
   personality; and represents me in a world, truly infinite indeed, but
   whose infinity can be tracked out only by the intellect, with which
   also my connection, unlike the fortuitous relation I stand in to all
   worlds of sense, I am compelled to recognise as universal and
   necessary. In the former, the first view of a countless multitude of
   worlds annihilates, as it were, my importance as an animal product,
   which, after a brief and that incomprehensible endowment with the
   powers of life, is compelled to refund its constituent matter to the
   planet--itself an atom in the universe--on which it grew. The other, on
   the contrary, elevates my worth as an intelligence even without limit;
   and this through my personality, in which the moral law reveals a
   faculty of life independent of my animal nature--nay, of the whole
   material world,--at least if it be permitted to infer as much from the
   regulation of my being, which a conformity with that law exacts;
   proposing, as it does, my moral worth for the absolute end of my
   activity, conceding no compromise of its imperative to a necessitation
   of nature, and spurning, in its infinity, the conditions and boundaries
   of my present transitory life."--Hamilton's Lectures on Metaphysics,'
   i. 39, 40. The passage is the first paragraph of the conclusion
   (Beschluss) of the Kritik der Praktischen Vernunft,' and will be found
   in vol. viii. p. 312 of Kant's 'Sämmtliche Werke' (Leipzig, 1838).

  MODERN SCHOOL OF DUTCH DIVINES--DE ETHISCHE RICHTING.

   Holland has been during the last quarter of a century a soil even more
   fertile than Germany in the fruits of theological learning and
   speculation. The critico-historical labours of Kuenen and others are
   now well known in this country by all interested in such subjects; but
   comparatively little as yet is known of the school to which I refer in
   the text (spoken of in their own country as "De Modernen")--who may be
   characterised as the extreme left of the theological movement presently
   so active in the churches and universities of Holland. The leaders of
   this school are Dr. Hooykaas, one of the compilers of the Bible for
   Young People,' and an able young theologian of the name of Van Hamel,
   who has sustained in the press the chief part in defending and
   developing the views of the Ethical Theory of Religion.' I am indebted
   to an accomplished young clergyman in our own Church, Mr. Menzies of
   Abernyte, who is well versed both in German and Dutch Theology, for the
   following statement of the views of these writers, translated and
   summarised from articles which have appeared on the subject within the
   last two years in the Theologisch Tijdschrift.'

   "Hooykaas [204] starts with saying, God is--He acts'--that is a matter
   of experience. But suppose we have still to seek Him, in what way are
   we to arrive at a knowledge of Him? Religion is a fact; but what are
   the contents of religion? Turning to history, we find that the gods
   whom men have worshipped began with being material physical powers, but
   have gradually come to be moral powers. Parsism, Mosaism, Christianity,
   the New School in Holland, each is a step in this direction. And not
   only so; but the moral element has been the essence of religion all
   along. Hence we are in sympathy with Isaiah or Augustine, though our
   theology is radically different from theirs.

   "To us God is Holy Love. It is not His power but His love that we
   worship. To us there is nothing adorable in the Nature-God, the Ruler;
   we ourselves are superior to all power. To us the Divine is what is
   holy, noble, exalted--the Moral Ideal, in fact.

   "The reason why religion thus proceeds from the material to the moral,
   from the outward power to the spiritual power, is just that the latter
   is the higher of the two, and that as man grows he becomes fitter to
   appreciate and to worship it. It is ever coming to us, this Moral
   Ideal, and we grow capable of answering to its appeals.

   "The moral power acts. We know that to be good is better than to be
   bad. This is its action. Only the moral man can judge of this, however.
   To him who is seeking earnestly to be good, the consciousness of the
   reality of the moral law becomes so strong that he will rather doubt
   the existence of the sensible than of the moral world. Belief in the
   reality of moral ideas is the very essence of religion.'

   "Hooykaas insists again and again on the immediateness of the knowledge
   of this power. It is not a conclusion drawn from certain facts; it is
   the fact itself.' We know God in so far as He reveals Himself to us. Of
   His essence, of His existence, apart from that revelation, we know
   nothing.' In support of this position, he refers to the unconscious
   suggestions of a higher life, of sympathy, of enthusiasm for
   righteousness, of duty, which came to good men. Not we,' he says, took
   the first step--the Ideal drew us to itself before we thought of it; we
   loved God because He first loved us. The Ideal exists; it is not
   developed out of humanity, but impresses itself on the consciousness of
   humanity. At each step in the revelation, at each advance in clear
   perception of the Ideal, we are aware that we are not the producers but
   the recipients. . . .

   "Your theory of the world may be anything you choose; that is quite
   apart from your religion. Ultimately, indeed, your faith will mould
   your views on various subjects. It will be impossible for you to
   believe that an evil power created the world, or that the world, with
   all the achievements and the aspirations of millenniums, is doomed to
   utter extinction. Faith in a God whom you thus immediately know will
   also bias you in favour of an intuitive theory of morals. . . . An
   atheist is not a man who denies the existence of God, who rejects any
   particular conception of what God is, nor even a man who denies the
   reality of moral distinctions, and asserts that good and evil are alike
   the will of God, but a man who practically denies the existence and
   authority of moral powers, and asserts in his actions that there is no
   such thing as love, that self-interest is the universal and the only
   rule, that sensual desires have an intrinsic right to be satisfied,
   that money is the supreme power and lawgiver in human society. The
   conception of God matters very little; what is important is to have God
   Himself. There is no religion without God; but there is religion
   without any conception of God. We point to ourselves as examples of
   that fact.'

   "Dr. Hooykaas then goes on to argue that he has a right to retain the
   name God and the word religion for this position, although these terms
   have hitherto borne a totally different significance. God, he asserts,
   means essentially Higher Power, and more definitely an Invisible
   Supreme Power, which claims and is worthy of our adoration; and in this
   sense he can use the old word without any reserve of the Moral Ideal by
   which good men are visited and the human race drawn upwards. He enters
   then on a demonstration that this conception of God is the key to a
   proper understanding of the Jewish prophets and of Jesus. In this we
   need scarcely follow him, as we are all familiar with an argument which
   is essentially the same. Dr. Hooykaas' demonstration differs from Dr.
   Matthew Arnold's in this, that the righteous power--Dr. Arnold would
   say which, Dr. Hooykaas says whom--the prophets and Jesus more and more
   vividly apprehended is with the Dutchman a living, moving power,
   drawing near to the spirits of those who were fit to know Him."

   The writer who has gone furthest of all in the identification of true
   religion with morality is Van Hamel, [205] who has published in the
   Theologisch Tijdschrift,' an essay called "Religion without
   Metaphysics," of which the following are the principal points:--

   "He starts with the observation that theologians of the new school have
   been turning more and more away from the metaphysical element of
   religion, and seeking to deduce the claims and the nature of religion
   from moral phenomena. Some of us, he says, have followed this road to
   its very end, and are now minded to detach religion from metaphysics
   altogether--to consider it to be not a view of the world, but a view of
   life, while we both describe and preach it as moral idealism. . . .

   "Van Hamel, also, goes first of all to history, as our own countryman
   has done, to show that his religion is the true religion of
   history--the essence that remains when the accidental forms are
   stripped off. Religion, he maintains, has been everywhere and always
   essentially a view of life, and then a view of the world, to which the
   view of life, whatever it might be, gave rise. Every religion is a
   philosophy--a theory of the world; but this is not the most important
   element of it: the root of the matter has always been the view that was
   taken of life and its phenomena.

   "Supernaturalism, in fact, is not religion. It becomes religion only
   when it is the expression of human needs. Only when the higher world is
   regarded in its relation to man's own need, whatever that may be, do
   those sentiments and dispositions arise which we call religion. Only
   when the man takes one or another of his ideals as the standard of the
   history and government of the world, so that it all subserves that
   ideal, and the gods work to realise it, does his philosophy become more
   than an idle imagination--does it become religion. And the main element
   in this religion is not the supernatural theory of the world--that is
   merely the formal side of it; the main thing is the peculiar conception
   of life--the peculiar direction of wishes and expectations; these are
   what confer on a religion its distinctive character. Thus, when the
   life is little more than material and sensuous, the gods will be mere
   natural phenomena. As society is developed, and the social instincts
   gain in power, the gods of the family of the tribe--of the
   race--appear. Jahveh is, first of all, the reflection of the national
   sentiment of Israel on its ideal side. As moral life is developed,
   moral gods appear, or those already in existence receive a more
   distinctly moral character. As life becomes more complex, this
   complexity is reproduced in the forms of religion, and we have
   polytheism. When one tendency becomes predominant, and other needs are
   thrown into the shade, religion grows monotheistic. Monotheism may also
   be the reflection of an impulse towards harmony--oneness in life.

   "If this be a true account of the nature of religion, then Christianity
   may properly be called Moral Idealism. It is a religion in which
   neither sensuous life, nor national life, nor social life, nor
   ecclesiastical life, but purely moral life, is elevated to the ideal
   power, the highest element which is most worthy of God. Jesus is
   conscious of a power which carries Him irresistibly forward--is
   practically absolute--makes Him the champion of all right against all
   wrong--is ever close to Him, and fills Him with unspeakable happiness.
   He loves this power--calls it the Father in heaven. . . .

   "As long as men are supernaturalists, they instinctively elevate their
   ideals to the throne of the universe. Imagination refuses nothing that
   sentiment requires. His god, man has no difficulty in supposing, rules
   heaven and earth in the interests of his requirements--his ideals. The
   true explanation of the universe is supplied by his life, or the
   fortune and future of his nation, or the coming of the kingdom of
   heaven of which he dreams. Thus, while supernaturalism prevails, the
   view of life which is the material of religion, is easily converted
   into a view of the world, with which religion is then identified.

   "But take away supernaturalism, not only the older mechanical forms of
   it, but that notion of a Providence ruling all things in the interests
   of the good, that is, for the realisation of our ideals, which is as
   much a form of supernaturalism as the belief in miracles,--take away
   all idea of a purpose, an end, which things subserve; that is an
   unscientific notion. It is thought to be the very essence of
   Christianity--but this is not the case. Christianity is not a theory of
   the course of affairs at all. Let us acknowledge that nature goes her
   own way, and cares nothing for our wants, and would not be nature at
   all if she did otherwise.

   "Then is religion abolished? By no means. You have still what is the
   essence of Christianity, though you have lost the form--the view of
   life, the attitude in the practical world, which Jesus introduced. We
   have still our moral ideals. These are the only sources from which
   religion springs, these alone give any religion at the stage in the
   world's history its substance and its authority.

   "Here our author finds it necessary to define further what is meant by
   detaching religion from metaphysics, and calling it a view of life and
   not a view of the world. He does not deny the value of metaphysics in
   their own place; only he says they have nothing to do with religion,
   which is based on facts, experiences, and not on theories. When we call
   religion a view of life, we mean a way of taking life, a direction of
   the life, not a theory of life. It is a mode of grasping life
   practically. This can stand on its own feet--it has no need of
   theories, which, after all, are not the parents of religion but its
   children--which have been invented to account for a thing that existed
   before them, and can quite well continue to exist without them.
   Reasoning can do nothing to increase the reality and authority of the
   experiences from which religion springs; they are original, and suffice
   for themselves.

   "And if it be asked, How do you know that your ideals on which alone
   you base your religion are true, are real things, and not merely your
   own subjective fancies, and if they do not need some support from
   without before you can place such implicit confidence in them? this
   leads into the question of the basis of morality, and we do not feel
   called upon to give a solution of it. We do not pretend that our ideals
   supply us with absolute truth, and for us at our present stage of
   culture they are absolute. They are to be judged simply by their
   practical power. They are not immovable--they come to us from the
   outside, and what we call the highest is for ever changing. What is the
   highest to-day may to-morrow have yielded to a higher. But the highest
   while it is with us has an indefeasible claim to our devotion, a claim
   which reasoning did not give and which reasoning cannot take away. This
   is not religion in the old sense, he frankly admits. If the essence of
   religion reside either in supernaturalism or in metaphysics, in the
   recognition of a real object of worship or in the transcendent
   character of the universe, then there is no religion here. . . . He
   asserts, however, that the essence of what has been hitherto called
   religion is here preserved."

  REVELATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF DOCTRINE.

   It is only an untenable idea of Revelation that can be supposed at
   variance with the idea of the development of Christian Doctrine. If we
   identify Revelation with its record--in other words, with
   Scripture--then it might be assumed that Divine truth was something
   absolutely fixed ion the text of Scripture (although even in this case
   the truth would vary according to the different ways of interpreting
   it); but Revelation can only be rightly conceived as a new force of
   spiritual light and knowledge communicated to a spiritual intelligence.
   This force enters, like every other force of knowledge and morality,
   into the higher culture of the race, and, from a supernatural point of
   view, is the most powerful factor in advancing that culture. But it
   works organically like other elements of human progress. It is not a
   definite formula laid upon the human intelligence, but a definite
   impulse communicated to it.

   The Hebrew race were chosen by God to be the recipients of this higher
   spiritual knowledge; and through the writings of the Hebrew prophets,
   who were the special organs of Revelation, the Divine truth
   communicated to them has been imparted to mankind in general. These
   writings contain the Revelation, or are the record of it. Their true
   purport is not to be gathered by a mere induction of texts or proof
   passages, but by a living and sympathetic insight into the true spirit
   and structure of their thoughts, and its organic relations with all the
   spiritual thought of succeeding ages. The interpreter, in short, must
   rise to the spiritual level of the prophets' mind (through the record
   which has been preserved of that mind), and so reach the heart of the
   Revelation communicated to it. It is only in this way that what was
   Revelation to the prophets can at the same time be Revelation to
   us-Revelation in every case being, by its very terms, not a dead
   letter, but a living light in the mind and heart.

   In this manner Revelation enters as a new and ever-renewing factor into
   human thought, continually enlarging, enlightening, and purifying it,
   and religious doctrine is the ever-fresh product of this process of
   spiritual education. It is the Divine truth originally communicated to
   the prophetic mind--but which, just in virtue of its Divine
   originality, has continued to grow in the spiritual consciousness of
   humanity in connection with all the higher elements of that
   consciousness; and so from time to time has been moulded or translated
   into new forms of expression, adapted to new necessities, and in order
   to meet new forms of error. The idea of the development of Doctrine,
   therefore, instead of being opposed to the idea of Revelation, may be
   said to presuppose this latter idea, and to rest upon it. The
   difficulty of discriminating what is merely human, or as it is called
   "natural," in the product from what is divine or "supernatural," is an
   inherent difficulty which no theory of Revelation can extricate, and
   which is least of all got rid of by the theory which identifies
   Revelation with its record, or supposes doctrine to be a mere deduction
   from textual premises, or parts of the letter of Scripture brought
   together in supposed logical order,

  NATURE AND EVIL.

   The most remarkable indictment of Nature as a source of evil rather
   than of good is to be found in Mr. J. S. Mill's posthumous Essays,
   recently published. The passage is one which must be held to show the
   weakness rather than the strength of the writer's mind. It is steeped
   throughout in that unconscious Anthropomorphism which is the professed
   bane of the modern school--and yet so often a distinctive note of their
   writings. Few men were more deeply tinged with this spirit than Mr.
   Mill--to the credit of his earnest and deeply philanthropic character;
   and yet while lavishing what can be called little else than abuse upon
   Nature, in the interests of man, apparently he refused to see in man
   himself anything but an outcome of the same cosmic Forces which he so
   vigorously denounced:--

   "In sober truth, nearly all the things which men are hanged or
   imprisoned for doing to one another, are Nature's everyday
   performances. Killing, the most criminal act recognized by human laws,
   Nature does once to every being that lives; and in a large proportion
   of cases, after protracted torture such as only the greatest monsters
   whom we read of ever purposely inflicted on their living
   fellow-creatures. . . . Nature impales men, breaks them as if on the
   wheel, casts them to be devoured by wild beasts, burns them to death,
   crushes them with stones like the first Christian martyr, starves them
   with hunger, freezes them with cold, poisons them by the quick or slow
   venom of her exhalations, and has hundreds of other hideous deaths in
   reserve, such as the ingenious cruelty of a Nabis or a Domitian never
   surpassed. . . . She mows down those on whose existence hangs the
   wellbeing of a whole people, perhaps the prospects of the human race,
   for generations to come, with as little compunction as those whose
   death is a relief to themselves, or a blessing to those under their
   noxious influence. Such are Nature's dealings with life. Even when she
   does not intend to kill, she inflicts the same tortures in apparent
   wantonness. In the clumsy provision which she has made for that
   perpetual renewal of animal life, rendered necessary by the prompt
   termination she puts to it in every individual instance, no human being
   ever comes into the world but another human being is literally
   stretched on the rack for hours or days, not unfrequently issuing in
   death. Next to taking life (equal to it according to a high authority)
   is taking the means by which we live; and Nature does this too on the
   largest scale and with the most callous indifference. A single
   hurricane destroys the hopes of a season; a flight of locusts, or an
   inundation, desolates a district; a trifling chemical change in an
   edible root starves a million of people. The waves of the sea like
   banditti seize and appropriate the wealth of the rich, and the little
   all of the poor, with the same accompaniments of stripping, wounding,
   and killing, as their human antitypes. Everything, in short, which the
   worst men commit either against life or property, is perpetrated on a
   larger scale by natural agents. . . . Even the love of order,' which is
   thought to be a following of the ways of Nature, is in fact a
   contradiction of them. All which people are accustomed to deprecate as
   disorder,' and its consequences, is precisely a counterpart of Nature's
   ways. Anarchy and the Reign of Terror are overmatched in injustice,
   ruin, and death, by a hurricane and a pestilence."--Three Essays on
   Religion,' p. 28 et seq.

  COMPARATIVE THEOLOGY.

   It will be apparent to all students of comparative theology how little
   I have ventured to touch the problems of this science, although I have
   been deeply interested in it for many years, in connection with my own
   special studies in the historic development of Christian Doctrine. My
   aim has been,--leaving aside all the difficult, and, as it appears to
   me, as yet insoluble questions, as to the chronology and external
   history of the great religions antecedent to Christianity,--to sketch
   from the general substance or contents of their thought the steps of
   advance on the special question of Evil--a comparatively easy task, for
   which there are abundant materials. The outward relations of the
   ancient Egyptian religion, or of the religions of Western Asia, to the
   oriental faiths--Vedism, Brahmanism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism,--and
   again of these faiths to one another--especially the historical
   relations of Vedism and Zoroastrianism,--are subjects quite beyond my
   powers to meddle with. The view of the latter subject suggested in the
   text is that held by the most competent inquirers, whose moderation of
   judgment and good sense, as well as learning, excite the confidence of
   the second-hand student on such matters.

   The following brief statements,--the first from Bunsen's God in
   History' (Miss Winkworth's translation, from which my quotations in the
   text are uniformly made), and the second quoted in Max Müller's Chips
   from a German Workshop,' from a well-known Sanscrit scholar,--speak for
   themselves:--

   "The migration from Bactria to India took place, as we shall see,
   anterior to the reformation of the Bactrian faith by Zoroaster. The
   Vedic hymns themselves may be in part coeval with that reformation; but
   they are the hymns of the ancient faith, which in the original
   parent-land of the race was superseded, if not extirpated, by Zoroaster
   and their language is the most ancient monument of the Bactrian
   consciousness."--Bunsen,' God in History,' i. 274.

   "Professor Roth, of Tubingen, has expressed the mutual relation of the
   Veda and Zend-Avesta under the following simile: The Veda,' he writes,
   and the Zend-Avesta, are two rivers flowing from one fountain-head: the
   stream of the Veda is the fuller and purer, and has remained truer to
   its original character; that of the Zend-Avesta, has been in various
   ways polluted, has altered its course, and cannot, with certainty, be
   traced back to its source.' "--Miller on the Zend-Avesta, Chips,' &c,,
   ii. 87.

  SAVAGE NOTIONS OF EVIL.

   The following illustrative passages are from Sir John Lubbock's
   well-known volume on the Origin of Civilisation and the Primitive
   Condition of Man' (3d ed.):--

   "The Hottentots, according to Thunberg, have very vague ideas about a
   good Deity. They have much clearer notions about an evil spirit, whom
   they fear, believing him to be the occasion of sickness, death,
   thunder, and every calamity that befalls them.' The Bechuanas attribute
   all evil to an invisible god, whom they call Murimo, and never hesitate
   to show their indignation at any ill experienced, or any wish
   unaccomplished, by the most bitter curses.'"--P. 212.

   "The Abipones of South America, so well described by Dobritzhoffer, had
   some vague notions of an evil spirit, but none of a good one. The
   Coroados of Brazil acknowledge no cause of good, or no God, but only an
   evil principle, which . . . leads him astray, vexes him, brings him
   into difficulty and danger, and even kills him.'"--P. 213.

   "When Burton spoke to the Eastern negroes about the Deity, they eagerly
   asked where he was to be found, in order that they might kill him; for
   they said, Who but he lays waste our homes, and kills our wives and
   cattle?'"--P. 214.

  APOLLO.

   These, amongst other attributes and characteristics of Apollo, are very
   clearly brought out in Mr Gladstone's admirable paper on "Homerology:
   I.--Apollo," in the Contemporary Review' for March 1876.

   We quote a few sentences specially with reference to the Messianic
   functions attributed to Apollo in relation to Zeus:--

   "1. He alone of the active gods is in entire and unvarying conformity
   with the will of Zeus, and is his messenger and agent for the most
   important purposes.

   "2. He alone of male deities has the title Dios huios, son of Zeus.

   "3. He alone of male deities is termed Aii philos, dear to Zeus, and is
   addressed by him as phile Phoibe.

   "4. He alone shares with Zeus (Il. xiii. 154) the title of theon
   horistos.

   "6. Apollo is the defender of Heaven against rebellion."

   (Lecture II., page 50.)

  BRAHMA.

   Referring to a passage which he quotes from the first book of the
   'Sama-Veda,' Bunsen says:--

   "Here we have the portentous word which divides the India of the Ganges
   from that of Indus, and in general the later religious consciousness of
   India from the Irano-Aryan. But we have by no means the noun masculine
   Brahma, the supreme god of the Brahmans, who are his priests. We have
   the neuter Brahma, an abstract noun, belonging entirely to the ideal
   world; which has its tangible roots in no historical tradition, but
   rather in a thoroughly externalistic treatment of the ancient Vedic
   sacrificial rites. According to Haug, it would appear from his
   researches into the Aryo-Zendic remains that the word Brahma originally
   signified the strewing of the sacrificial grass on the spot appointed
   for the immolation, or the contemplation of this holy work, from which
   it was extended to the contemplation of every holy act. Here we find
   the stepping-stone to the objective meaning according to which the
   neuter Brahma, as an abstract noun, denotes the Divine, the Godhead;
   philosophically therefore the Absolute, Unconditioned, Eternal, which
   is placed in opposition to the temporal, the phenomenal, the imperfect,
   and conditioned."--Bunsen's God in History,' i. 319.

  NARRATIVES OF THE CREATION AND OF THE FALL.

   It is a well-known commonplace of modern criticism that the primary
   creation narrative (Gen. i-ii. 3,) and the narrative beginning with the
   fourth verse of the second chapter to the end of the third chapter, are
   from different sources.

   "The book of Genesis was not written by one man, but was put together
   from works of very different dates; works, too, whose authors by no
   means all stood upon the same religious level. This very chapter will
   furnish us with illustrations of the fact, for immediately after the
   first account of the creation, a second follows, which by no means
   agrees with it. . . . The same writer" (who gives the second account of
   creation) "continues his narrative, and tells us how Paradise was
   lost."--The Bible for Young People, by Dutch Divines' (translation), i.
   52, 58.

   Of the question as to how these and other sections of Genesis are
   related to one another, Oehler says (Old Test. Theology, i. 74): "I
   certainly consider that the present shape of Genesis arose by the
   re-editing of an Elohistic narrative, and the interpolation of
   Jehovistic passages. But, at the same time, it must appear improbable
   that the author would place at the head of his work two contradictory
   accounts of the creation.

  NATIONAL IMPORTANCE OF THE HEBREW PROPHETS.

   "Their [the Jewish] religion, gave existence to an inestimably precious
   unorganised institution, the Order (if it may be so termed) of
   Prophets. Under the protection, generally though not always effectual,
   of their sacred character, the prophets were a power in the nation
   often more than a match for kings and priests, and kept up in that
   little corner of the earth the antagonism of influences which is the
   only real security for continued progress. Religion, consequently, was
   not there--what it has been in so many other places--a consecration of
   all that was once established, and a barrier against further
   improvement. The remark of a distinguished Hebrew, that the Prophets
   were in Church and State the equivalent of the modern liberty of the
   press, gives a just but not an adequate conception of the part
   fulfilled in national and universal history by this great element of
   Jewish life; by means of which, the canon of inspiration never being
   complete, the persons most eminent in genius and moral feeling could
   not only denounce and reprobate, with the direct authority of the
   Almighty, whatever appeared to them deserving of such treatment, but
   could give forth better and higher interpretations of the national
   religion, which thenceforth became part of the religion. Accordingly,
   whoever can divest himself of the habit of reading the Bible as if it
   was one book, which until lately was equally inveterate in Christians
   and in unbelievers, sees with admiration the vast interval between the
   morality and religion of the Pentateuch, or even of the historical
   books, and the morality and religion of the Prophecies,--a distance as
   wide as between these last and the Gospels. Conditions more favorable
   to progress could not easily exist; accordingly the Jews, instead of
   being stationary, like other Asiatics, were, next to the Greeks, the
   most progressive people of antiquity, and, jointly with them, have been
   the starting-point and main propelling agency of modern
   cultivation."--J. S. Mill's Representative Government,' p. 41.

  HEBREW PROPHECY AND THE QUESTION OF EVIL.

   The following is the passage from Kuenen's Religion of Israel' alluded
   to in the text. It appears to me expressed in far too general terms,
   and to ignore altogether some of the deepest elements of the prophetic
   teaching:--

   "The older Israelitish prophets and prophetic historians had not
   hesitated to derive even evil, moral evil not excepted, from Jahveh:
   the belief that Jahveh directed all things was so strong in them, that
   they did not recoil from the consequence. Even the second
   Isaiah--perhaps with an eye to, but yet at variance with, the Persian
   dualism with which he was acquainted-had put these words into Jahveh's
   mouth:--

   I form the light and create darkness,
   I make peace and create evil;
   I, Jahveh, do all these things.'

   But it is not unnatural that objections to this conception should have
   arisen in the minds of some. Jahveh's moral purity seemed to them to be
   not uninjured by being thus made the immediate cause of sin. The remedy
   was at hand. Anro-Mainyus was not unknown to the Jews, and Satan stood
   ready as it were to undertake his part."--Kuenen's Religion of Israel'
   (translation), iii. 40.

  THE ESSENES AND THE INFLUENCE OF DUALISTIC SPECULATION IN PALESTINE IN THE
  FIRST CENTURY.

   The following abbreviated extracts from Dr. Lightfoot's recent essay on
   "The Colossian Heresy" bear out what is said in the text:--

   "The Essene is the great enigma of Hebrew history. Admired alike by
   Jew, by Heathen, and by Christian, he remains a dim, vague
   outline. . . . And yet, by careful use of the existing materials, the
   portrait of this sect may be so far restored. . . . The Essene was
   exceptionally rigorous in his observance of the Mosaic ritual. . . .
   His respect for the law extended also to the lawgiver. After God, the
   name of Moses was held in the highest reverence. He who blasphemed his
   name was punished with death. In all these points the Essene was an
   exaggeration, almost a caricature, of the Pharisee. . . .

   "To the legalism of the Pharisee, the Essene added an asceticism which
   was peculiarly his own, and which in many respects contradicted the
   tenets of the other sect. The honourable and even exaggerated estimate
   of marriage which was characteristic of the Jew, found no favour with
   the Essene. Marriage was to him an abomination. . . . But his ascetic
   tendencies did not stop here. The Pharisee was very careful to observe
   the distinction of meats lawful and unlawful, as laid down by the
   Mosaic code, and even rendered these ordinances vexatious by minute
   definitions of his own. But the Essene went far beyond him. He drank no
   wine, he did not touch animal food. . . . Again, in hot climates oil
   for anointing the body is almost a necessary of life. From this, too,
   the Essenes strictly abstained. . . .

   "From these facts it seems clear that Essene abstinence was something
   more than the mere exaggeration of Pharisaic principles. The rigour of
   the Pharisee was based on his obligation of obedience to an absolute
   external law. The Essene introduced a new principle. He condemned in
   any form the gratification of the natural cravings, nor would he
   consent to regard it as moral or immoral only, according to the motive
   which suggested it or the consequences which flowed from it. It was in
   itself an absolute evil. He sought to disengage himself, as far as
   possible, from the conditions of physical life. In short, in the
   asceticism of the Essene we seem to see the germ of that Gnostic
   dualism which regards matter as the principle, or at least the abode,
   of evil. . . .

   "An esoteric doctrine, relating to angelic beings, may have been
   another link which attached Essenism to the religion of
   Zoroaster. . . .

   "This Jewish sect exhibits the same exclusiveness in the communication
   of its doctrines. Its theological speculations take the same direction,
   dwelling on the mysteries of creation, regarding matter as the abode of
   evil, and postulating certain intermediate spiritual agencies as
   necessary links of communication between heaven and earth. And lastly,
   its speculative opinions involve the same ethical conclusions, and lead
   in like manner to a rigid asceticism. If the notices relating to these
   points do not always explain themselves, yet read in the light of the
   heresies of the apostolic age and in that of subsequent Judæo-Gnostic
   Christianity, their bearing seems to be distinct enough; so that we
   should not be far wrong if we were to designate Essenism as Gnostic
   Judaism.

   "The Essenes of whom historical notices are preserved were inhabitants
   of the Holy Land. Their monasteries were situated on the shores of the
   Dead Sea. We are told, indeed, that the sect was not confined to any
   one place, and that members of the order were found in great numbers in
   divers cities and villages."--Lightfoot on Colossians and Philemon, p.
   82 et seq.

  DR. J. MÜLLER ON LOVE TO GOD, AND SIN AS ITS OPPOSITE.

   J. Müller, in his well-known elaborate treatise on The Christian
   Doctrine of Sin,' has worked out at length the idea of sin as
   selfishness, or the antithesis of love to God. I agree with those who
   think (Dr. Hodge, 'Syst. Theol.' ii. 149, and others) that Müller has
   made too much of this idea, in trying to reduce all forms of sin to
   selfishness as their essence; but I cannot mention this earnest and
   rich-minded theologian without expressing the obligation which I owe to
   the study of his great work on the subject of my Lectures. I am
   sensible that trains of thought derived from it long ago (when I made
   it a special study, and introduced it to the knowledge of many English
   readers, probably for the first time, in the British Quarterly Review,'
   Nov. I851) still linger in my present exposition of the
   subject--different as my point of view now is. The reader may find some
   evidence of this in the following brief extracts:--

   "Love is the inmost soul of all moral ordinances; and all deep
   reverence for law, all obedience to a higher will, all those sacred
   energies which hold human life together, and confine its activity
   within accurately-defined spheres, are only love in disguise; and, like
   the Old Testament law in the history of the human race, these when
   defined and embodied in the life of the individual are paidagogoi (Gal.
   iii. 24) for the kingdom of love revealed. Love can take root only in
   the soil of earnest strictness; true liberty can germinate only beneath
   the closely-enveloping sheath of self-limitation and submission to law.

   "But love can only become the generative principle of a higher life
   when it makes itself manifest in its.. true character. It does not show
   itself in its fulness until it becomes conscious of God as its absolute
   object, and of all its other objects in their true relation to Him.
   Thus is the heavenly magnet found which is able, not for the passing
   moment of enthusiastic excitement only, but continually, to guide and
   sustain the life, of man over the dark mysterious sea in which the
   powers of the deep and the burden of its own sins and sorrows ever tend
   to sink it. . . .

   "But sin is not only the absence of love to God; for with the negation
   of our true relation to Him there is the affirmation of a false one.
   Unbelief in the true God and the revelation of His holiness always
   involves a contrary belief, if it be only in the sufficiency of one's
   own critical and sceptical understanding. Upon the disappearance of the
   divine principle, there immediately ensues the entrance of a principle
   opposed to God, according to the saying of Christ, He who is not with
   me is against me.' Man cannot abandon his true relation to God without
   setting up an idol in God's stead. . . .

   "The idol which man in sin sets up in the place of God can be none
   other than himself. He makes self and self-satisfaction the highest aim
   of his life. To self his efforts ultimately tend, however the modes and
   directions of sin may vary. The innermost essence of sin, the ruling
   and penetrating principle in all its forms, is selfishness.

   "Man must be a personal being--an ego--if he be capable of holy love;
   and if he excludes holy love from his inner life, his natural self-love
   degenerates into selfishness, the disease of self, the corruption of
   self-love."--Müller's Christian Doctrine of Sin,' i. 115, 131, 134.

  AUGUSTINE AND CALVIN ON HUMAN CORRUPTION.

   The expressions in the text are to be found in the second book of
   Calvin's Institutio Christianæ Religionis:' the first, in the close of
   the second chapter of that book, being a quotation from Augustine (De
   Verbis Apost., Serm. 10)--"Nostrum nihil nisi peccatum;" and the second
   being the title of the third chapter of the same book. I am quite aware
   that both these modes of expression are capable of a strictly
   evangelical interpretation; or, in other words, that there is a sense
   in which they may be said to be in consistency with our Lord's
   teaching. And I am far from attributing to Calvin especially, a lack of
   balance and comprehensiveness of judgment in dealing with the question
   of sin. No one can read the two chapters to which I refer without
   seeing that this would be doing Calvin injustice (as, indeed, injustice
   is often done to his special views). In the very same chapters, for
   example, he freely allows a good side in human nature, or at least an
   undestroyed power of distinguishing good and evil ("ratio, qua
   discernit homo inter bonum et malum"--L. II. c. ii. § 13)--even a power
   of virtue ("ad virtutis studium facultas"), conspicuously illustrated
   in such men as Camillus (L. II. c. iii. § 4). Calvin is seldom
   deficient in comprehensiveness of intellectual judgment. But he is none
   the less narrow, and sometimes unfair in tone. Neither he nor Augustine
   can frankly admit that what is good in human nature is after all really
   good. Admitting, for example, the external virtue of such a natural man
   as Camillus, he yet asks, "What if his mind was depraved, which it must
   have been if he was only a natural man?" (ibid.) In other words, there
   is a back-lying theory of human depravity which colours, in both these
   theologians, all their estimates of human life and character, Dogmatic
   abstractions are constantly obtruding upon their line of thought, and
   giving a direction to it very different from the broad and fair
   representations of the Gospels, where everything stands for what it
   really is of good or of evil, without any distorting and confusing
   effects of abstract theory. The tone is different in the two cases.
   This is all that is meant by the observation in the text.

  ST. PAUL'S VIEW OF LAW.

   Speaking of St. Paul's definition of the word "law," Reuss, in his
   History of Christian Theology in the Apostolic Age," says:--

   "Primarily, this word signifies, purely and simply, the law of Moses as
   contained in the Pentateuch, or even a particular article of that law.
   "The Jews, however, had already in their common speech extended the
   circle of this notion, and designated by the term law the entire Old
   Testament, less in the literary sense--according to which the prophets
   were added, to complete the idea of the volume--than in the theological
   sense, all the other books being thus regarded as corollaries of the
   Mosaic legislation. It may be boldly affirmed that in most of the
   passages in which Paul makes use of the word law, it is in the
   historical or literary sense; the allusion is to the Old Testament as a
   whole, not to the Pentateuch in particular: on this account the term
   has most frequently that which was called in the old theology the
   economic signification--that is, it stands for the entire Old Testament
   economy."--P. 33, 34.

  CONFLICT OF THE FLESH AND MIND.

   The following is part of Neander's exposition of this subject:--

   "When the law in its glory, the moral archetype, first revealed itself
   to the higher nature of man, he was filled with earnest desire to seize
   the revealed ideal; but this desire only made him more painfully
   sensible of the chasm which separated him from the object after which
   he aspired. Thus, what appeared at first a blissful ideal, by the guilt
   of death-producing sin, became changed into its opposite. The higher
   nature of man aspiring after a freer self-consciousness, is sensible of
   the harmony between itself and the divine law, in which it delights;
   but there is another power, the power of the sinful principle striving
   against the higher nature, which, when a man is disposed to follow the
   inward divine leading, drags him away, so that he cannot accomplish the
   good by which alone his heavenly nature is attracted. In the
   consciousness of this wretched disunion, he exclaims, Who shall deliver
   me from this power of sin?' . . .

   "By the opposition between the inner man and the law in the members or
   the flesh, Paul certainly does not mean simply the opposition between
   spirit and sense; for if the spirit were really so animated by the good
   which is represented in the law, as it ought to be, according to its
   original nature and destination, its volitions would be powerful enough
   to subordinate sense to itself. . . . He therefore intends by these
   terms to express the opposition between the depressed higher nature of
   man, and the sinful principle which controls the actions of
   men."--Neander's Hist. of the Planting and Training of the Christian
   Church,' Bohn's translation, p. 431, 432.

  SIN.--CONSCIOUSNESS OF SIN.

   The following are the statements referred to in the text:--

   "The answer to this question," says Baur, "lies in the undeniable
   truth, that sin is what it is essentially and simply through man's
   consciousness of it; where there is no consciousness of sin, there is
   no sin."--Baur's 'St. Paul,' p. 141.

   "In the apostle's language, consciousness is presupposed in the sin
   itself; not reflected on it from without. That which gives it the
   nature of sin is conscientia peccati. As Socrates, a little inverting
   the ordinary view and common language of mankind, declared all virtue
   to be knowledge; so the language of St. Paul implies all sin to be the
   knowledge of sin. Conscientia peccati peccatum ipsum est . . . If, from
   the apostle's ideal point of view, we regard the law, not as the tables
   given on Mount Sinai, or the books of Moses, but as the law written on
   the heart, the difficulty is, not how we are to identify the law with
   the consciousness of sin, but how we are to distinguish them. . . . In
   the language of metaphysical philosophy, we say that the subject is
   identical with the object;' in the same way sin implies the law. The
   law written on the heart, when considered in reference to the subject,
   is simply the conscience. The conscience, in like manner, when
   conceived of objectively, as words written down in a book, as a rule of
   life which we are to obey, becomes the law. For the sake of clearness
   we may express the whole in a sort of formula. 'Sin = the consciousness
   of sin = the law.' From this last conclusion the apostle only stops
   short from the remembrance of the divine original of the law, and the
   sense that what made it evil to him was the fact that it was in its own
   nature good."--Jowett's Comm. on Epistle to Romans,' p. 504, 505.

   (Lecture VI., page 179.)

  DOCTRINE OF IMPUTATION OF SIN.

   Mr. Jowett's remarks on this subject, to which we have alluded in the
   text, are deserving of quotation. There is force in what he says, and a
   much-needed caution, as to the tendency of theologians to generalise
   widely, and draw large propositions from a few Scriptural
   data--sometimes little more than "figures of speech." But, all the
   same, the line of thought concentrated in the two special passages to
   which he refers, and which form the basis of our Sixth Lecture, is
   essentially Pauline. The ideas involved in the passages, and the
   contrasts drawn in them betwixt Adam and Christ, enter into the heart
   of the apostle's thought, and cannot be explained away as mere
   rhetorical exaggeration.

   "That so many opposite systems of Theology," he says, "seek their
   authority in Scripture, is a fair proof that Scripture is different
   from them all. That is to say, Scripture often contains in germ what is
   capable of being drawn to either side; it is indistinct where they are
   distinct; it presents two lights where they present only one; it speaks
   inwardly, while they clothe themselves in the forms of human knowledge.
   That indistinct, intermediate, inward point of view at which the truth
   exists but in germ, they have on both sides tended to extinguish and
   suppress. Passing allusions, figures of speech, rhetorical oppositions,
   have been made the foundation of doctrinal statements, which are like a
   part of the human mind itself, and seem as if they never could be
   uprooted, without uprooting the very sentiment of religion. Systems of
   this kind exercise a constraining power which makes it difficult for us
   to see anything in Scripture but themselves.

   "For example, how slender is the foundation in the New Testament for
   the doctrine of Adam's sin being imputed to his posterity!--two
   passages in St. Paul at most, and these of uncertain interpretation.
   The little cloud, no bigger than a man's hand, has covered the heavens.
   To reduce such subjects to their proper proportions, we should
   consider: First, what space they occupy in Scripture; secondly, how far
   the language used respecting them is literal or- figurative; thirdly,
   whether they agree with the more general truths of Scripture and our
   moral sense, or are not rather repugnant thereto;' fourthly, whether
   their origin may not be prior to Christianity, or traceable in the
   after-history of the Church; fifthly, whether the words of Scripture
   may not be confused with logical inferences which are appended to
   them;. sixthly, in the case of this and some other doctrines, whether
   even poetry has not lent its aid to stamp them in our minds in a more
   definite and therefore different form from that in which the apostles
   taught them; lastly, how far in our own day they are anything more than
   words."--Jowett's Comm. on Epistle to Romans,' p. 180, 181.

  AUGUSTINE'S TRANSLATION OF eph' ho (Rom. v. 12).--HIS VIEWS ON "ORIGINAL SIN."

   Augustine's version of this phrase is found abundantly, as elsewhere,
   in his treatise De Peccatorum meritis et remissione,' which, he says
   (Retract. ii., 23), he was "compelled to write against the new heresy
   of Pelagius." Dealing with his own translation--in quo omnes
   peccaverunt--he applies the "quo" sometimes to "peccatum" and sometimes
   to Adam--"ille unus homo"--forgetful, apparently, as Migne points out
   in a note, that eph' o, could not agree with amartia--(Migne's ed., x.
   115). All modern scholars may be said to unite in the statement of Baur
   that, "grammatically, eph' ho, cannot be taken in any other sense than
   because,'" or, as he expands the meaning, "the fact being that;" or
   again, Alford (in loc.), "on condition that."

   "In the same treatise (L. III. c. iv.), Augustine discusses the
   question of original sin in relation to infants, and shows how plainly
   his whole views on this subject were dependent on his High Church or
   sacramentarian views as to the efficacy of baptism, and the consequent
   necessity of all infants being baptised in order to their salvation.
   His argument is as follows: Unless infants receive the benefit of the
   sacrament they are manifestly in danger of damnation. But damned they
   cannot be without sin. Now, since they have no sin of their own ("in
   vita propria"), it is necessary for us to credit them with original
   sin,--however unintelligible the mystery. It is enough to state this
   argument to show how entirely Augustine's tone of thought, on this as
   on many other matters, is removed from a modern or rational point of
   view. A fiction of sacramental efficacy is made the basis of an absurd
   argument. The name of Augustine, as I have said in the text, must
   always be held in respect; he possessed a profound spiritual nature and
   many noble qualities; but either as a writer or a thinker, there are
   few men who should be followed more cautiously. And never, certainly,
   should we allow the great apostle to speak to us only through his
   voice.

  THEOLOGICAL MEANING OF GUILT.

   I could have wished to collect an induction of passages in proof and
   illustration of the statement in the text, but it may be enough in the
   meantime to appeal to the following statements in confirmation of what
   I have said. Dr. Hodge's authority as a Calvinistic theologian will
   hardly be disputed.

   "To impute sin, in Scriptural and theological language, is to impute
   the guilt of sin. And by guilt is meant not criminality, or moral
   ill-desert, or demerit, much less moral pollution, but the judicial
   obligation to satisfy justice. Hence the evil consequent on the
   imputation is not an arbitrary infliction, not merely a misfortune or
   calamity, not a chastisement in the proper sense of that word, but a
   punishment--i. e., an evil inflicted in execution of the penalty of
   law, and for the satisfaction of justice.''--Hodge's 'Systematic
   Theology,' ii. 194.

   "The venerable Assembly's Catechism, in answer to the question, Wherein
   consists the sinfulness of our estate by nature, says, In the guilt of
   Adam's sin,' &c. Now, as guilt is blameworthiness--desert of
   punishment; and as the compilers of that generally excellent compendium
   of faith cannot well be supposed to have intended to intimate that we
   are really blameable for an act performed by Adam,--they must have used
   the word in the general sense of legal liability, or obnoxiousness to
   punishment This is the sense in which it is used by all theologians in
   this country, and in America, except by the few who identify the race
   and its parent. To be guilty of Adam's sin is to be exposed by it to
   punishment--i. e., to the endurance of its consequences. Still the
   phrase is objectionable, since, though the endurance of its
   consequences was punishment to Adam, it is not so to us. The
   constitution established with him was such as to expose us to the
   results of his conduct; but that exposure, or liability, is not guilt
   in any proper sense of the term, or in common parlance even, nor should
   it ever be so called. The child of a profligate parent is liable to
   disease, but he is never thought of as guilty. The term guilt always
   supposes personal transgression, except in technical theology, from
   which we would banish it.''--Payne's Lectures on Original Sin,' p. 79,
   80, note.
