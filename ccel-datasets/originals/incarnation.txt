Chapter 1

   Creation and the Fall

   (1) In our former book [1] we dealt fully enough with a few of the
   chief points about the heathen worship of idols, and how those false
   fears originally arose. We also, by God's grace, briefly indicated that
   the Word of the Father is Himself divine, that all things that are owe
   their being to His will and power, and that it is through Him that the
   Father gives order to creation, by Him that all things are moved, and
   through Him that they receive their being. Now, Macarius, true lover of
   Christ, we must take a step further in the faith of our holy religion,
   and consider also the Word's becoming Man and His divine Appearing in
   our midst. That mystery the Jews traduce, the Greeks deride, but we
   adore; and your own love and devotion to the Word also will be the
   greater, because in His Manhood He seems so little worth. For it is a
   fact that the more unbelievers pour scorn on Him, so much the more does
   He make His Godhead evident. The things which they, as men, rule out as
   impossible, He plainly shows to be possible; that which they deride as
   unfitting, His goodness makes most fit; and things which these
   wiseacres laugh at as "human" He by His inherent might declares divine.
   Thus by what seems His utter poverty and weakness on the cross He
   overturns the pomp and parade of idols, and quietly and hiddenly wins
   over the mockers and unbelievers to recognize Him as God.

   Now in dealing with these matters it is necessary first to recall what
   has already been said. You must understand why it is that the Word of
   the Father, so great and so high, has been made manifest in bodily
   form. He has not assumed a body as proper to His own nature, far from
   it, for as the Word He is without body. He has been manifested in a
   human body for this reason only, out of the love and goodness of His
   Father, for the salvation of us men. We will begin, then, with the
   creation of the world and with God its Maker, for the first fact that
   you must grasp is this: the renewal of creation has been wrought by the
   Self-same Word Who made it in the beginning. There is thus no
   inconsistency between creation and salvation for the One Father has
   employed the same Agent for both works, effecting the salvation of the
   world through the same Word Who made it in the beginning.

   (2) In regard to the making of the universe and the creation of all
   things there have been various opinions, and each person has propounded
   the theory that suited his own taste. For instance, some say that all
   things are self-originated and, so to speak, haphazard. The Epicureans
   are among these; they deny that there is any Mind behind the universe
   at all. This view is contrary to all the facts of experience, their own
   existence included. For if all things had come into being in this
   automatic fashion, instead of being the outcome of Mind, though they
   existed, they would all be uniform and without distinction. In the
   universe everything would be sun or moon or whatever it was, and in the
   human body the whole would be hand or eye or foot. But in point of fact
   the sun and the moon and the earth are all different things, and even
   within the human body there are different members, such as foot and
   hand and head. This distinctness of things argues not a spontaneous
   generation but a prevenient Cause; and from that Cause we can apprehend
   God, the Designer and Maker of all.

   Others take the view expressed by Plato, that giant among the Greeks.
   He said that God had made all things out of pre-existent and uncreated
   matter, just as the carpenter makes things only out of wood that
   already exists. But those who hold this view do not realize that to
   deny that God is Himself the Cause of matter is to impute limitation to
   Him, just as it is undoubtedly a limitation on the part of the
   carpenter that he can make nothing unless he has the wood. How could
   God be called Maker and Artificer if His ability to make depended on
   some other cause, namely on matter itself? If He only worked up
   existing matter and did not Himself bring matter into being, He would
   be not the Creator but only a craftsman.

   Then, again, there is the theory of the Gnostics, who have invented for
   themselves an Artificer of all things other than the Father of our Lord
   Jesus Christ. These simply shut their eyes to the obvious meaning of
   Scripture. For instance, the Lord, having reminded the Jews of the
   statement in Genesis, "He Who created them in the beginning made them
   male and female . . . ," and having shown that for that reason a man
   should leave his parents and cleave to his wife, goes on to say with
   reference to the Creator, "What therefore God has joined together, let
   no man put asunder." [2] How can they get a creation independent of the
   Father out of that? And, again, St. John, speaking all inclusively,
   says, "All things became by Him and without Him came nothing into
   being." [3] How then could the Artificer be someone different, other
   than the Father of Christ?

   (3) Such are the notions which men put forward. But the impiety of
   their foolish talk is plainly declared by the divine teaching of the
   Christian faith. From it we know that, because there is Mind behind the
   universe, it did not originate itself; because God is infinite, not
   finite, it was not made from pre-existent matter, but out of nothing
   and out of non-existence absolute and utter God brought it into being
   through the Word. He says as much in Genesis: "In the beginning God
   created the heavens and the earth; [4] and again through that most
   helpful book The Shepherd, "Believe thou first and foremost that there
   is One God Who created and arranged all things and brought them out of
   non-existence into being." [5] Paul also indicates the same thing when
   he says, "By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the
   Word of God, so that the things which we see now did not come into
   being out of things which had previously appeared." [6] For God is
   good--or rather, of all goodness He is Fountainhead, and it is
   impossible for one who is good to be mean or grudging about anything.
   Grudging existence to none therefore, He made all things out of nothing
   through His own Word, our Lord Jesus Christ and of all these His
   earthly creatures He reserved especial mercy for the race of men. Upon
   them, therefore, upon men who, as animals, were essentially
   impermanent, He bestowed a grace which other creatures lacked--namely
   the impress of His own Image, a share in the reasonable being of the
   very Word Himself, so that, reflecting Him and themselves becoming
   reasonable and expressing the Mind of God even as He does, though in
   limited degree they might continue for ever in the blessed and only
   true life of the saints in paradise. But since the will of man could
   turn either way, God secured this grace that He had given by making it
   conditional from the first upon two things--namely, a law and a place.
   He set them in His own paradise, and laid upon them a single
   prohibition. If they guarded the grace and retained the loveliness of
   their original innocence, then the life of paradise should be theirs,
   without sorrow, pain or care, and after it the assurance of immortality
   in heaven. But if they went astray and became vile, throwing away their
   birthright of beauty, then they would come under the natural law of
   death and live no longer in paradise, but, dying outside of it,
   continue in death and in corruption. This is what Holy Scripture tells
   us, proclaiming the command of God, "Of every tree that is in the
   garden thou shalt surely eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of good
   and evil ye shall not eat, but in the day that ye do eat, ye shall
   surely die." [7] "Ye shall surely die"--not just die only, but remain
   in the state of death and of corruption.

   (4) You may be wondering why we are discussing the origin of men when
   we set out to talk about the Word's becoming Man. The former subject is
   relevant to the latter for this reason: it was our sorry case that
   caused the Word to come down, our transgression that called out His
   love for us, so that He made haste to help us and to appear among us.
   It is we who were the cause of His taking human form, and for our
   salvation that in His great love He was both born and manifested in a
   human body. For God had made man thus (that is, as an embodied spirit),
   and had willed that he should remain in incorruption. But men, having
   turned from the contemplation of God to evil of their own devising, had
   come inevitably under the law of death. Instead of remaining in the
   state in which God had created them, they were in process of becoming
   corrupted entirely, and death had them completely under its dominion.
   For the transgression of the commandment was making them turn back
   again according to their nature; and as they had at the beginning come
   into being out of non-existence, so were they now on the way to
   returning, through corruption, to non-existence again. The presence and
   love of the Word had called them into being; inevitably, therefore when
   they lost the knowledge of God, they lost existence with it; for it is
   God alone Who exists, evil is non-being, the negation and antithesis of
   good. By nature, of course, man is mortal, since he was made from
   nothing; but he bears also the Likeness of Him Who is, and if he
   preserves that Likeness through constant contemplation, then his nature
   is deprived of its power and he remains incorrupt. So is it affirmed in
   Wisdom: "The keeping of His laws is the assurance of incorruption." [8]
   And being incorrupt, he would be henceforth as God, as Holy Scripture
   says, "I have said, Ye are gods and sons of the Highest all of you: but
   ye die as men and fall as one of the princes." [9]

   (5) This, then, was the plight of men. God had not only made them out
   of nothing, but had also graciously bestowed on them His own life by
   the grace of the Word. Then, turning from eternal things to things
   corruptible, by counsel of the devil, they had become the cause of
   their own corruption in death; for, as I said before, though they were
   by nature subject to corruption, the grace of their union with the Word
   made them capable of escaping from the natural law, provided that they
   retained the beauty of innocence with which they were created. That is
   to say, the presence of the Word with them shielded them even from
   natural corruption, as also Wisdom says: "God created man for
   incorruption and as an image of His own eternity; but by envy of the
   devil death entered into the world." [10] When this happened, men began
   to die, and corruption ran riot among them and held sway over them to
   an even more than natural degree, because it was the penalty of which
   God had forewarned them for transgressing the commandment. Indeed, they
   had in their sinning surpassed all limits; for, having invented
   wickedness in the beginning and so involved themselves in death and
   corruption, they had gone on gradually from bad to worse, not stopping
   at any one kind of evil, but continually, as with insatiable appetite,
   devising new kinds of sins. Adulteries and thefts were everywhere,
   murder and raping filled the earth, law was disregarded in corruption
   and injustice, all kinds of iniquities were perpetrated by all, both
   singly and in common. Cities were warring with cities, nations were
   rising against nations, and the whole earth was rent with factions and
   battles, while each strove to outdo the other in wickedness. Even
   crimes contrary to nature were not unknown, but as the martyr-apostle
   of Christ says: "Their women changed the natural use into that which is
   against nature; and the men also, leaving the natural use of the woman,
   flamed out in lust towards each other, perpetrating shameless acts with
   their own sex, and receiving in their own persons the due recompense of
   their pervertedness." [11]

Chapter 2

   The Divine Dilemma and its Solution in the Incarnation

   (6) We saw in the last chapter that, because death and corruption were
   gaining ever firmer hold on them, the human race was in process of
   destruction. Man, who was created in God's image and in his possession
   of reason reflected the very Word Himself, was disappearing, and the
   work of God was being undone. The law of death, which followed from the
   Transgression, prevailed upon us, and from it there was no escape. The
   thing that was happening was in truth both monstrous and unfitting. It
   would, of course, have been unthinkable that God should go back upon
   His word and that man, having transgressed, should not die; but it was
   equally monstrous that beings which once had shared the nature of the
   Word should perish and turn back again into non-existence through
   corruption. It was unworthy of the goodness of God that creatures made
   by Him should be brought to nothing through the deceit wrought upon man
   by the devil; and it was supremely unfitting that the work of God in
   mankind should disappear, either through their own negligence or
   through the deceit of evil spirits. As, then, the creatures whom He had
   created reasonable, like the Word, were in fact perishing, and such
   noble works were on the road to ruin, what then was God, being Good, to
   do? Was He to let corruption and death have their way with them? In
   that case, what was the use of having made them in the beginning?
   Surely it would have been better never to have been created at all
   than, having been created, to be neglected and perish; and, besides
   that, such indifference to the ruin of His own work before His very
   eyes would argue not goodness in God but limitation, and that far more
   than if He had never created men at all. It was impossible, therefore,
   that God should leave man to be carried off by corruption, because it
   would be unfitting and unworthy of Himself.

   (7) Yet, true though this is, it is not the whole matter. As we have
   already noted, it was unthinkable that God, the Father of Truth, should
   go back upon His word regarding death in order to ensure our continued
   existence. He could not falsify Himself; what, then, was God to do? Was
   He to demand repentance from men for their transgression? You might say
   that that was worthy of God, and argue further that, as through the
   Transgression they became subject to corruption, so through repentance
   they might return to incorruption again. But repentance would not guard
   the Divine consistency, for, if death did not hold dominion over men,
   God would still remain untrue. Nor does repentance recall men from what
   is according to their nature; all that it does is to make them cease
   from sinning. Had it been a case of a trespass only, and not of a
   subsequent corruption, repentance would have been well enough; but when
   once transgression had begun men came under the power of the corruption
   proper to their nature and were bereft of the grace which belonged to
   them as creatures in the Image of God. No, repentance could not meet
   the case. What--or rather Who was it that was needed for such grace and
   such recall as we required? Who, save the Word of God Himself, Who also
   in the beginning had made all things out of nothing? His part it was,
   and His alone, both to bring again the corruptible to incorruption and
   to maintain for the Father His consistency of character with all. For
   He alone, being Word of the Father and above all, was in consequence
   both able to recreate all, and worthy to suffer on behalf of all and to
   be an ambassador for all with the Father.

   (8) For this purpose, then, the incorporeal and incorruptible and
   immaterial Word of God entered our world. In one sense, indeed, He was
   not far from it before, for no part of creation had ever been without
   Him Who, while ever abiding in union with the Father, yet fills all
   things that are. But now He entered the world in a new way, stooping to
   our level in His love and Self-revealing to us. He saw the reasonable
   race, the race of men that, like Himself, expressed the Father's Mind,
   wasting out of existence, and death reigning over all in corruption. He
   saw that corruption held us all the closer, because it was the penalty
   for the Transgression; He saw, too, how unthinkable it would be for the
   law to be repealed before it was fulfilled. He saw how unseemly it was
   that the very things of which He Himself was the Artificer should be
   disappearing. He saw how the surpassing wickedness of men was mounting
   up against them; He saw also their universal liability to death. All
   this He saw and, pitying our race, moved with compassion for our
   limitation, unable to endure that death should have the mastery, rather
   than that His creatures should perish and the work of His Father for us
   men come to nought, He took to Himself a body, a human body even as our
   own. Nor did He will merely to become embodied or merely to appear; had
   that been so, He could have revealed His divine majesty in some other
   and better way. No, He took our body, and not only so, but He took it
   directly from a spotless, stainless virgin, without the agency of human
   father--a pure body, untainted by intercourse with man. He, the Mighty
   One, the Artificer of all, Himself prepared this body in the virgin as
   a temple for Himself, and took it for His very own, as the instrument
   through which He was known and in which He dwelt. Thus, taking a body
   like our own, because all our bodies were liable to the corruption of
   death, He surrendered His body to death instead of all, and offered it
   to the Father. This He did out of sheer love for us, so that in His
   death all might die, and the law of death thereby be abolished because,
   having fulfilled in His body that for which it was appointed, it was
   thereafter voided of its power for men. This He did that He might turn
   again to incorruption men who had turned back to corruption, and make
   them alive through death by the appropriation of His body and by the
   grace of His resurrection. Thus He would make death to disappear from
   them as utterly as straw from fire.

   (9) The Word perceived that corruption could not be got rid of
   otherwise than through death; yet He Himself, as the Word, being
   immortal and the Father's Son, was such as could not die. For this
   reason, therefore, He assumed a body capable of death, in order that
   it, through belonging to the Word Who is above all, might become in
   dying a sufficient exchange for all, and, itself remaining
   incorruptible through His indwelling, might thereafter put an end to
   corruption for all others as well, by the grace of the resurrection. It
   was by surrendering to death the body which He had taken, as an
   offering and sacrifice free from every stain, that He forthwith
   abolished death for His human brethren by the offering of the
   equivalent. For naturally, since the Word of God was above all, when He
   offered His own temple and bodily instrument as a substitute for the
   life of all, He fulfilled in death all that was required. Naturally
   also, through this union of the immortal Son of God with our human
   nature, all men were clothed with incorruption in the promise of the
   resurrection. For the solidarity of mankind is such that, by virtue of
   the Word's indwelling in a single human body, the corruption which goes
   with death has lost its power over all. You know how it is when some
   great king enters a large city and dwells in one of its houses; because
   of his dwelling in that single house, the whole city is honored, and
   enemies and robbers cease to molest it. Even so is it with the King of
   all; He has come into our country and dwelt in one body amidst the
   many, and in consequence the designs of the enemy against mankind have
   been foiled and the corruption of death, which formerly held them in
   its power, has simply ceased to be. For the human race would have
   perished utterly had not the Lord and Savior of all, the Son of God,
   come among us to put an end to death.

   (10) This great work was, indeed, supremely worthy of the goodness of
   God. A king who has founded a city, so far from neglecting it when
   through the carelessness of the inhabitants it is attacked by robbers,
   avenges it and saves it from destruction, having regard rather to his
   own honor than to the people's neglect. Much more, then, the Word of
   the All-good Father was not unmindful of the human race that He had
   called to be; but rather, by the offering of His own body He abolished
   the death which they had incurred, and corrected their neglect by His
   own teaching. Thus by His own power He restored the whole nature of
   man. The Savior's own inspired disciples assure us of this. We read in
   one place: "For the love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus
   judge that, if One died on behalf of all, then all died, and He died
   for all that we should no longer live unto ourselves, but unto Him who
   died and rose again from the dead, even our Lord Jesus Christ." [12]
   And again another says: "But we behold Him Who hath been made a little
   lower than the angels, even Jesus, because of the suffering of death
   crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God He should taste
   of death on behalf of every man." The same writer goes on to point out
   why it was necessary for God the Word and none other to become Man:
   "For it became Him, for Whom are all things and through Whom are all
   things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Author of their
   salvation perfect through suffering." [13] He means that the rescue of
   mankind from corruption was the proper part only of Him Who made them
   in the beginning. He points out also that the Word assumed a human
   body, expressly in order that He might offer it in sacrifice for other
   like bodies: "Since then the children are sharers in flesh and blood,
   He also Himself assumed the same, in order that through death He might
   bring to nought Him that hath the power of death, that is to say, the
   Devil, and might rescue those who all their lives were enslaved by the
   fear of death." [14] For by the sacrifice of His own body He did two
   things: He put an end to the law of death which barred our way; and He
   made a new beginning of life for us, by giving us the hope of
   resurrection. By man death has gained its power over men; by the Word
   made Man death has been destroyed and life raised up anew. That is what
   Paul says, that true servant of Christ: "For since by man came death,
   by man came also the resurrection of the dead. Just as in Adam all die,
   even so in Christ shall all be made alive," [15] and so forth. Now,
   therefore, when we die we no longer do so as men condemned to death,
   but as those who are even now in process of rising we await the general
   resurrection of all, "which in its own times He shall show," [16] even
   God Who wrought it and bestowed it on us.

   This, then, is the first cause of the Savior's becoming Man. There are,
   however, other things which show how wholly fitting is His blessed
   presence in our midst; and these we must now go on to consider.

Chapter 3

   The Divine Dilemma and its Solution in the Incarnation -- continued

   (11) When God the Almighty was making mankind through His own Word, He
   perceived that they, owing to the limitation of their nature, could not
   of themselves have any knowledge of their Artificer, the Incorporeal
   and Uncreated. He took pity on them, therefore, and did not leave them
   destitute of the knowledge of Himself, lest their very existence should
   prove purposeless. For of what use is existence to the creature if it
   cannot know its Maker? How could men be reasonable beings if they had
   no knowledge of the Word and Reason of the Father, through Whom they
   had received their being? They would be no better than the beasts, had
   they no knowledge save of earthly things; and why should God have made
   them at all, if He had not intended them to know Him? But, in fact, the
   good God has given them a share in His own Image, that is, in our Lord
   Jesus Christ, and has made even themselves after the same Image and
   Likeness. Why? Simply in order that through this gift of Godlikeness in
   themselves they may be able to perceive the Image Absolute, that is the
   Word Himself, and through Him to apprehend the Father; which knowledge
   of their Maker is for men the only really happy and blessed life.

   But, as we have already seen, men, foolish as they are, thought little
   of the grace they had received, and turned away from God. They defiled
   their own soul so completely that they not only lost their apprehension
   of God, but invented for themselves other gods of various kinds. They
   fashioned idols for themselves in place of the truth and reverenced
   things that are not, rather than God Who is, as St. Paul says,
   "worshipping the creature rather than the Creator." [17] Moreover, and
   much worse, they transferred the honor which is due to God to material
   objects such as wood and stone, and also to man; and further even than
   that they went, as we said in our former book. Indeed, so impious were
   they that they worshipped evil spirits as gods in satisfaction of their
   lusts. They sacrificed brute beasts and immolated men, as the just due
   of these deities, thereby bringing themselves more and more under their
   insane control. Magic arts also were taught among them, oracles in
   sundry places led men astray, and the cause of everything in human life
   was traced to the stars as though nothing existed but that which could
   be seen. In a word, impiety and lawlessness were everywhere, and
   neither God nor His Word was known. Yet He had not hidden Himself from
   the sight of men nor given the knowledge of Himself in one way only;
   but rather He had unfolded it in many forms and by many ways.

   (12) God knew the limitation of mankind, you see; and though the grace
   of being made in His Image was sufficient to give them knowledge of the
   Word and through Him of the Father, as a safeguard against their
   neglect of this grace, He provided the works of creation also as means
   by which the Maker might be known. Nor was this all. Man's neglect of
   the indwelling grace tends ever to increase; and against this further
   frailty also God made provision by giving them a law, and by sending
   prophets, men whom they knew. Thus, if they were tardy in looking up to
   heaven, they might still gain knowledge of their Maker from those close
   at hand; for men can learn directly about higher things from other men.
   Three ways thus lay open to them, by which they might obtain the
   knowledge of God. They could look up into the immensity of heaven, and
   by pondering the harmony of creation come to know its Ruler, the Word
   of the Father, Whose all-ruling providence makes known the Father to
   all. Or, if this was beyond them, they could converse with holy men,
   and through them learn to know God, the Artificer of all things, the
   Father of Christ, and to recognize the worship of idols as the negation
   of the truth and full of all impiety. Or else, in the third place, they
   could cease from lukewarmness and lead a good life merely by knowing
   the law. For the law was not given only for the Jews, nor was it solely
   for their sake that God sent the prophets, though it was to the Jews
   that they were sent and by the Jews that they were persecuted. The law
   and the prophets were a sacred school of the knowledge of God and the
   conduct of the spiritual life for the whole world.

   So great, indeed, were the goodness and the love of God. Yet men, bowed
   down by the pleasures of the moment and by the frauds and illusions of
   the evil spirits, did not lift up their heads towards the truth. So
   burdened were they with their wickednesses that they seemed rather to
   be brute beasts than reasonable men, reflecting the very Likeness of
   the Word.

   (13) What was God to do in face of this dehumanising of mankind, this
   universal hiding of the knowledge of Himself by the wiles of evil
   spirits? Was He to keep silence before so great a wrong and let men go
   on being thus deceived and kept in ignorance of Himself? If so, what
   was the use of having made them in His own Image originally? It would
   surely have been better for them always to have been brutes, rather
   than to revert to that condition when once they had shared the nature
   of the Word. Again, things being as they were, what was the use of
   their ever having had the knowledge of God? Surely it would have been
   better for God never to have bestowed it, than that men should
   subsequently be found unworthy to receive it. Similarly, what possible
   profit could it be to God Himself, Who made men, if when made they did
   not worship Him, but regarded others as their makers? This would be
   tantamount to His having made them for others and not for Himself. Even
   an earthly king, though he is only a man, does not allow lands that he
   has colonized to pass into other hands or to desert to other rulers,
   but sends letters and friends and even visits them himself to recall
   them to their allegiance, rather than allow His work to be undone. How
   much more, then, will God be patient and painstaking with His
   creatures, that they be not led astray from Him to the service of those
   that are not, and that all the more because such error means for them
   sheer ruin, and because it is not right that those who had once shared
   His Image should be destroyed.

   What, then, was God to do? What else could He possibly do, being God,
   but renew His Image in mankind, so that through it men might once more
   come to know Him? And how could this be done save by the coming of the
   very Image Himself, our Savior Jesus Christ? Men could not have done
   it, for they are only made after the Image; nor could angels have done
   it, for they are not the images of God. The Word of God came in His own
   Person, because it was He alone, the Image of the Father Who could
   recreate man made after the Image.

   In order to effect this re-creation, however, He had first to do away
   with death and corruption. Therefore He assumed a human body, in order
   that in it death might once for all be destroyed, and that men might be
   renewed according to the Image. The Image of the Father only was
   sufficient for this need. Here is an illustration to prove it.

   (14) You know what happens when a portrait that has been painted on a
   panel becomes obliterated through external stains. The artist does not
   throw away the panel, but the subject of the portrait has to come and
   sit for it again, and then the likeness is re-drawn on the same
   material. Even so was it with the All-holy Son of God. He, the Image of
   the Father, came and dwelt in our midst, in order that He might renew
   mankind made after Himself, and seek out His lost sheep, even as He
   says in the Gospel: "I came to seek and to save that which was lost.
   [18] This also explains His saying to the Jews: "Except a man be born
   anew . . ." [19] a He was not referring to a man's natural birth from
   his mother, as they thought, but to the re-birth and re-creation of the
   soul in the Image of God.

   Nor was this the only thing which only the Word could do. When the
   madness of idolatry and irreligion filled the world and the knowledge
   of God was hidden, whose part was it to teach the world about the
   Father? Man's, would you say? But men cannot run everywhere over the
   world, nor would their words carry sufficient weight if they did, nor
   would they be, unaided, a match for the evil spirits. Moreover, since
   even the best of men were confused and blinded by evil, how could they
   convert the souls and minds of others? You cannot put straight in
   others what is warped in yourself. Perhaps you will say, then, that
   creation was enough to teach men about the Father. But if that had been
   so, such great evils would never have occurred. Creation was there all
   the time, but it did not prevent men from wallowing in error. Once
   more, then, it was the Word of God, Who sees all that is in man and
   moves all things in creation, Who alone could meet the needs of the
   situation. It was His part and His alone, Whose ordering of the
   universe reveals the Father, to renew the same teaching. But how was He
   to do it? By the same means as before, perhaps you will say, that is,
   through the works of creation. But this was proven insufficient. Men
   had neglected to consider the heavens before, and now they were looking
   in the opposite direction. Wherefore, in all naturalness and fitness,
   desiring to do good to men, as Man He dwells, taking to Himself a body
   like the rest; and through His actions done in that body, as it were on
   their own level, He teaches those who would not learn by other means to
   know Himself, the Word of God, and through Him the Father.

   (15) He deals with them as a good teacher with his pupils, coming down
   to their level and using simple means. St. Paul says as much: "Because
   in the wisdom of God the world in its wisdom knew not God, God thought
   fit through the simplicity of the News proclaimed to save those who
   believe." [20] Men had turned from the contemplation of God above, and
   were looking for Him in the opposite direction, down among created
   things and things of sense. The Savior of us all, the Word of God, in
   His great love took to Himself a body and moved as Man among men,
   meeting their senses, so to speak, half way. He became Himself an
   object for the senses, so that those who were seeking God in sensible
   things might apprehend the Father through the works which He, the Word
   of God, did in the body. Human and human minded as men were, therefore,
   to whichever side they looked in the sensible world they found
   themselves taught the truth. Were they awe-stricken by creation? They
   beheld it confessing Christ as Lord. Did their minds tend to regard men
   as Gods? The uniqueness of the Savior's works marked Him, alone of men,
   as Son of God. Were they drawn to evil spirits? They saw them driven
   out by the Lord and learned that the Word of God alone was God and that
   the evil spirits were not gods at all. Were they inclined to
   hero-worship and the cult of the dead? Then the fact that the Savior
   had risen from the dead showed them how false these other deities were,
   and that the Word of the Father is the one true Lord, the Lord even of
   death. For this reason was He both born and manifested as Man, for this
   He died and rose, in order that, eclipsing by His works all other human
   deeds, He might recall men from all the paths of error to know the
   Father. As He says Himself, "I came to seek and to save that which was
   lost." [21]

   (16) When, then, the minds of men had fallen finally to the level of
   sensible things, the Word submitted to appear in a body, in order that
   He, as Man, might center their senses on Himself, and convince them
   through His human acts that He Himself is not man only but also God,
   the Word and Wisdom of the true God. This is what Paul wants to tell us
   when he says: "That ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be
   strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the length and breadth
   and height and depth, and to know the love of God that surpasses
   knowledge, so that ye may be filled unto all the fullness of God." [22]
   The Self-revealing of the Word is in every dimension--above, in
   creation; below, in the Incarnation; in the depth, in Hades; in the
   breadth, throughout the world. All things have been filled with the
   knowledge of God.

   For this reason He did not offer the sacrifice on behalf of all
   immediately He came, for if He had surrendered His body to death and
   then raised it again at once He would have ceased to be an object of
   our senses. Instead of that, He stayed in His body and let Himself be
   seen in it, doing acts and giving signs which showed Him to be not only
   man, but also God the Word. There were thus two things which the Savior
   did for us by becoming Man. He banished death from us and made us anew;
   and, invisible and imperceptible as in Himself He is, He became visible
   through His works and revealed Himself as the Word of the Father, the
   Ruler and King of the whole creation.

   (17) There is a paradox in this last statement which we must now
   examine. The Word was not hedged in by His body, nor did His presence
   in the body prevent His being present elsewhere as well. When He moved
   His body He did not cease also to direct the universe by His Mind and
   might. No. The marvelous truth is, that being the Word, so far from
   being Himself contained by anything, He actually contained all things
   Himself. In creation He is present everywhere, yet is distinct in being
   from it; ordering, directing, giving life to all, containing all, yet
   is He Himself the Uncontained, existing solely in His Father. As with
   the whole, so also is it with the part. Existing in a human body, to
   which He Himself gives life, He is still Source of life to all the
   universe, present in every part of it, yet outside the whole; and He is
   revealed both through the works of His body and through His activity in
   the world. It is, indeed, the function of soul to behold things that
   are outside the body, but it cannot energize or move them. A man cannot
   transport things from one place to another, for instance, merely by
   thinking about them; nor can you or I move the sun and the stars just
   by sitting at home and looking at them. With the Word of God in His
   human nature, however, it was otherwise. His body was for Him not a
   limitation, but an instrument, so that He was both in it and in all
   things, and outside all things, resting in the Father alone. At one and
   the same time--this is the wonder--as Man He was living a human life,
   and as Word He was sustaining the life of the universe, and as Son He
   was in constant union with the Father. Not even His birth from a
   virgin, therefore, changed Him in any way, nor was He defiled by being
   in the body. Rather, He sanctified the body by being in it. For His
   being in everything does not mean that He shares the nature of
   everything, only that He gives all things their being and sustains them
   in it. Just as the sun is not defiled by the contact of its rays with
   earthly objects, but rather enlightens and purifies them, so He Who
   made the sun is not defiled by being made known in a body, but rather
   the body is cleansed and quickened by His indwelling, "Who did no sin,
   neither was guile found in His mouth." [23]

   (18) You must understand, therefore, that when writers on this sacred
   theme speak of Him as eating and drinking and being born, they mean
   that the body, as a body, was born and sustained with the food proper
   to its nature; while God the Word, Who was united with it, was at the
   same time ordering the universe and revealing Himself through His
   bodily acts as not man only but God. Those acts are rightly said to be
   His acts, because the body which did them did indeed belong to Him and
   none other; moreover, it was right that they should be thus attributed
   to Him as Man, in order to show that His body was a real one and not
   merely an appearance. From such ordinary acts as being born and taking
   food, He was recognized as being actually present in the body; but by
   the extraordinary acts which He did through the body He proved Himself
   to be the Son of God. That is the meaning of His words to the
   unbelieving Jews: "If I do not the works of My Father, believe Me not;
   but if I do, even if ye believe not Me, believe My works, that ye may
   know that the Father is in Me and I in the Father." [24]

   Invisible in Himself, He is known from the works of creation; so also,
   when His Godhead is veiled in human nature, His bodily acts still
   declare Him to be not man only, but the Power and Word of God. To speak
   authoritatively to evil spirits, for instance, and to drive them out,
   is not human but divine; and who could see-Him curing all the diseases
   to which mankind is prone, and still deem Him mere man and not also
   God? He cleansed lepers, He made the lame to walk, He opened the ears
   of the deaf and the eyes of the blind, there was no sickness or
   weakness that He did not drive away. Even the most casual observer can
   see that these were acts of God. The healing of the man born blind, for
   instance, who but the Father and Artificer of man, the Controller of
   his whole being, could thus have restored the faculty denied at birth?
   He Who did thus must surely be Himself the Lord of birth. This is
   proved also at the outset of His becoming Man. He formed His own body
   from the virgin; and that is no small proof of His Godhead, since He
   Who made that was the Maker of all else. And would not anyone infer
   from the fact of that body being begotten of a virgin only, without
   human father, that He Who appeared in it was also the Maker and Lord of
   all beside?

   Again, consider the miracle at Cana. Would not anyone who saw the
   substance of water transmuted into wine understand that He Who did it
   was the Lord and Maker of the water that He changed? It was for the
   same reason that He walked on the sea as on dry land--to prove to the
   onlookers that He had mastery over all. And the feeding of the
   multitude, when He made little into much, so that from five loaves five
   thousand mouths were filled--did not that prove Him none other than the
   very Lord Whose Mind is over all?

Chapter 4

   The Death of Christ

   (19) All these things the Savior thought fit to do, so that,
   recognizing His bodily acts as works of God, men who were blind to His
   presence in creation might regain knowledge of the Father. For, as I
   said before, who that saw His authority over evil spirits and their
   response to it could doubt that He was, indeed, the Son, the Wisdom and
   the Power of God? Even the very creation broke silence at His behest
   and, marvelous to relate, confessed with one voice before the cross,
   that monument of victory, that He Who suffered thereon in the body was
   not man only, but Son of God and Savior of all. The sun veiled his
   face, the earth quaked, the mountains were rent asunder, all men were
   stricken with awe. These things showed that Christ on the cross was
   God, and that all creation was His slave and was bearing witness by its
   fear to the presence of its Master.

   Thus, then, God the Word revealed Himself to men through His works. We
   must next consider the end of His earthly life and the nature of His
   bodily death. This is, indeed, the very center of our faith, and
   everywhere you hear men speak of it; by it, too, no less than by His
   other acts, Christ is revealed as God and Son of God.

   (20) We have dealt as far as circumstances and our own understanding
   permit with the reason for His bodily manifestation. We have seen that
   to change the corruptible to incorruption was proper to none other than
   the Savior Himself, Who in the beginning made all things out of
   nothing; that only the Image of the Father could re-create the likeness
   of the Image in men, that none save our Lord Jesus Christ could give to
   mortals immortality, and that only the Word Who orders all things and
   is alone the Father's true and sole-begotten Son could teach men about
   Him and abolish the worship of idols. But beyond all this, there was a
   debt owing which must needs be paid; for, as I said before, all men
   were due to die. Here, then, is the second reason why the Word dwelt
   among us, namely that having proved His Godhead by His works, He might
   offer the sacrifice on behalf of all, surrendering His own temple to
   death in place of all, to settle man's account with death and free him
   from the primal transgression. In the same act also He showed Himself
   mightier than death, displaying His own body incorruptible as the
   first-fruits of the resurrection.

   You must not be surprised if we repeat ourselves in dealing with this
   subject. We are speaking of the good pleasure of God and of the things
   which He in His loving wisdom thought fit to do, and it is better to
   put the same thing in several ways than to run the risk of leaving
   something out. The body of the Word, then, being a real human body, in
   spite of its having been uniquely formed from a virgin, was of itself
   mortal and, like other bodies, liable to death. But the indwelling of
   the Word loosed it from this natural liability, so that corruption
   could not touch it. Thus it happened that two opposite marvels took
   place at once: the death of all was consummated in the Lord's body;
   yet, because the Word was in it, death and corruption were in the same
   act utterly abolished. Death there had to be, and death for all, so
   that the due of all might be paid. Wherefore, the Word, as I said,
   being Himself incapable of death, assumed a mortal body, that He might
   offer it as His own in place of all, and suffering for the sake of all
   through His union with it, " might bring to nought Him that had the
   power of death, that is, the devil, and might deliver them who all
   their lifetime were enslaved by the fear of death." [25]

   (21) Have no fears then. Now that the common Savior of all has died on
   our behalf, we who believe in Christ no longer die, as men died
   aforetime, in fulfillment of the threat of the law. That condemnation
   has come to an end; and now that, by the grace of the resurrection,
   corruption has been banished and done away, we are loosed from our
   mortal bodies in God's good time for each, so that we may obtain
   thereby a better resurrection. Like seeds cast into the earth, we do
   not perish in our dissolution, but like them shall rise again, death
   having been brought to nought by the grace of the Savior. That is why
   blessed Paul, through whom we all have surety of the resurrection,
   says: "This corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must
   put on immortality; but when this corruptible shall have put on
   incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall
   be brought to pass the saying that is written, 'Death is swallowed up
   in victory. O Death, where is thy sting? O Grave, where is thy
   victory?'" [26]

   "Well then," some people may say, "if the essential thing was that He
   should surrender His body to death in place of all, why did He not do
   so as Man privately, without going to the length of public crucifixion?
   Surely it would have been more suitable for Him to have laid aside His
   body with honor than to endure so shameful a death." But look at this
   argument closely, and see how merely human it is, whereas what the
   Savior did was truly divine and worthy of His Godhead for several
   reasons. The first is this. The death of men under ordinary
   circumstances is the result of their natural weakness. They are
   essentially impermanent, so after a time they fall ill and when worn
   out they die. But the Lord is not like that. He is not weak, He is the
   Power of God and Word of God and Very Life Itself. If He had died
   quietly in His bed like other men it would have looked as if He did so
   in accordance with His nature, and as though He was indeed no more than
   other men. But because He was Himself Word and Life and Power His body
   was made strong, and because the death had to be accomplished, He took
   the occasion of perfecting His sacrifice not from Himself, but from
   others. How could He fall sick, Who had healed others? Or how could
   that body weaken and fail by means of which others are made strong?
   Here, again, you may say, "Why did He not prevent death, as He did
   sickness?" Because it was precisely in order to be able to die that He
   had taken a body, and to prevent the death would have been to impede
   the resurrection. And as to the unsuitability of sickness for His body,
   as arguing weakness, you may say, "Did He then not hunger?" Yes, He
   hungered, because that was the property of His body, but He did not die
   of hunger because He Whose body hungered was the Lord. Similarly,
   though He died to ransom all, He did not see corruption. His body rose
   in perfect soundness, for it was the body of none other than the Life
   Himself.

   (22) Someone else might say, perhaps, that it would have been better
   for the Lord to have avoided the designs of the Jews against Him, and
   so to have guarded His body from death altogether. But see how
   unfitting this also would have been for Him. Just as it would not have
   been fitting for Him to give His body to death by His own hand, being
   Word and being Life, so also it was not consonant with Himself that He
   should avoid the death inflicted by others. Rather, He pursued it to
   the uttermost, and in pursuance of His nature neither laid aside His
   body of His own accord nor escaped the plotting Jews. And this action
   showed no limitation or weakness in the Word; for He both waited for
   death in order to make an end of it, and hastened to accomplish it as
   an offering on behalf of all. Moreover, as it was the death of all
   mankind that the Savior came to accomplish, not His own, He did not lay
   aside His body by an individual act of dying, for to Him, as Life, this
   simply did not belong; but He accepted death at the hands of men,
   thereby completely to destroy it in His own body.

   There are some further considerations which enable one to understand
   why the Lord's body had such an end. The supreme object of His coming
   was to bring about the resurrection of the body. This was to be the
   monument to His victory over death, the assurance to all that He had
   Himself conquered corruption and that their own bodies also would
   eventually be incorrupt; and it was in token of that and as a pledge of
   the future resurrection that He kept His body incorrupt. But there
   again, if His body had fallen sick and the Word had left it in that
   condition, how unfitting it would have been! Should He Who healed the
   bodies of others neglect to keep His own in health? How would His
   miracles of healing be believed, if this were so? Surely people would
   either laugh at Him as unable to dispel disease or else consider Him
   lacking in proper human feeling because He could do so, but did not.

   (23) Then, again, suppose without any illness He had just concealed His
   body somewhere, and then suddenly reappeared and said that He had risen
   from the dead. He would have been regarded merely as a teller of tales,
   and because there was no witness of His death, nobody would believe His
   resurrection. Death had to precede resurrection, for there could be no
   resurrection without it. A secret and unwitnessed death would have left
   the resurrection without any proof or evidence to support it. Again,
   why should He die a secret death, when He proclaimed the fact of His
   rising openly? Why should He drive out evil spirits and heal the man
   blind from birth and change water into wine, all publicly, in order to
   convince men that He was the Word, and not also declare publicly that
   incorruptibility of His mortal body, so that He might Himself be
   believed to be the Life? And how could His disciples have had boldness
   in speaking of the resurrection unless they could state it as a fact
   that He had first died? Or how could their hearers be expected to
   believe their assertion, unless they themselves also had witnessed His
   death? For if the Pharisees at the time refused to believe and forced
   others to deny also, though the things had happened before their very
   eyes, how many excuses for unbelief would they have contrived, if it
   had taken place secretly? Or how could the end of death and the victory
   over it have been declared, had not the Lord thus challenged it before
   the sight of all, and by the incorruption of His body proved that
   henceforward it was annulled and void?

   (24) There are some other possible objections that must be answered.
   Some might urge that, even granting the necessity of a public death for
   subsequent belief in the resurrection, it would surely have been better
   for Him to have arranged an honorable death for Himself, and so to have
   avoided the ignominy of the cross. But even this would have given
   ground for suspicion that His power over death was limited to the
   particular kind of death which He chose for Himself; and that again
   would furnish excuse for disbelieving the resurrection. Death came to
   His body, therefore, not from Himself but from enemy action, in order
   that the Savior might utterly abolish death in whatever form they
   offered it to Him. A generous wrestler, virile and strong, does not
   himself choose his antagonists, lest it should be thought that of some
   of them he is afraid. Rather, he lets the spectators choose them, and
   that all the more if these are hostile, so that he may overthrow
   whomsoever they match against him and thus vindicate his superior
   strength. Even so was it with Christ. He, the Life of all, our Lord and
   Savior, did not arrange the manner of his own death lest He should seem
   to be afraid of some other kind. No. He accepted and bore upon the
   cross a death inflicted by others, and those others His special
   enemies, a death which to them was supremely terrible and by no means
   to be faced; and He did this in order that, by destroying even this
   death, He might Himself be believed to be the Life, and the power of
   death be recognized as finally annulled. A marvelous and mighty paradox
   has thus occurred, for the death which they thought to inflict on Him
   as dishonor and disgrace has become the glorious monument to death's
   defeat. Therefore it is also, that He neither endured the death of
   John, who was beheaded, nor was He sawn asunder, like Isaiah: even in
   death He preserved His body whole and undivided, so that there should
   be no excuse hereafter for those who would divide the Church.

   (25) So much for the objections of those outside the Church. But if any
   honest Christian wants to know why He suffered death on the cross and
   not in some other way, we answer thus: in no other way was it expedient
   for us, indeed the Lord offered for our sakes the one death that was
   supremely good. He had come to bear the curse that lay on us; and how
   could He "become a curse" [27] otherwise than by accepting the accursed
   death? And that death is the cross, for it is written "Cursed is every
   one that hangeth on tree." [28] Again, the death of the Lord is the
   ransom of all, and by it "the middle wall of partition" [29] is broken
   down and the call of the Gentiles comes about. How could He have called
   us if He had not been crucified, for it is only on the cross that a man
   dies with arms outstretched? Here, again, we see the fitness of His
   death and of those outstretched arms: it was that He might draw His
   ancient people with the one and the Gentiles with the other, and join
   both together in Himself. Even so, He foretold the manner of His
   redeeming death, "I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto Myself."
   [30] Again, the air is the sphere of the devil, the enemy of our race
   who, having fallen from heaven, endeavors with the other evil spirits
   who shared in his disobedience both to keep souls from the truth and to
   hinder the progress of those who are trying to follow it. The apostle
   refers to this when he says, "According to the prince of the power of
   the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience."
   [31] But the Lord came to overthrow the devil and to purify the air and
   to make "a way" for us up to heaven, as the apostle says, "through the
   veil, that is to say, His flesh." [32] This had to be done through
   death, and by what other kind of death could it be done, save by a
   death in the air, that is, on the cross? Here, again, you see how right
   and natural it was that the Lord should suffer thus; for being thus
   "lifted up," He cleansed the air from all the evil influences of the
   enemy. "I beheld Satan as lightning falling," [33] He says; and thus He
   re-opened the road to heaven, saying again, "Lift up your gates, O ye
   princes, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors." [34] For it was not
   the Word Himself Who needed an opening of the gates, He being Lord of
   all, nor was any of His works closed to their Maker. No, it was we who
   needed it, we whom He Himself upbore in His own body--that body which
   He first offered to death on behalf of all, and then made through it a
   path to heaven.

Chapter 5

   The Resurrection

   (26) Fitting indeed, then, and wholly consonant was the death on the
   cross for us; and we can see how reasonable it was, and why it is that
   the salvation of the world could be accomplished in no other way. Even
   on the cross He did not hide Himself from sight; rather, He made all
   creation witness to the presence of its Maker. Then, having once let it
   be seen that it was truly dead, He did not allow that temple of His
   body to linger long, but forthwith on the third day raised it up,
   impassable and incorruptible, the pledge and token of His victory.

   It was, of course, within His power thus to have raised His body and
   displayed it as alive directly after death. But the all-wise Savior did
   not do this, lest some should deny that it had really or completely
   died. Besides this, had the interval between His death and resurrection
   been but two days, the glory of His incorruption might not have
   appeared. He waited one whole day to show that His body was really
   dead, and then on the third day showed it incorruptible to all. The
   interval was no longer, lest people should have forgotten about it and
   grown doubtful whether it were in truth the same body. No, while the
   affair was still ringing in their ears and their eyes were still
   straining and their minds in turmoil, and while those who had put Him
   to death were still on the spot and themselves witnessing to the fact
   of it, the Son of God after three days showed His once dead body
   immortal and incorruptible; and it was evident to all that it was from
   no natural weakness that the body which the Word indwelt had died, but
   in order that in it by the Savior's power death might be done away.

   (27) A very strong proof of this destruction of death and its conquest
   by the cross is supplied by a present fact, namely this. All the
   disciples of Christ despise death; they take the offensive against it
   and, instead of fearing it, by the sign of the cross and by faith in
   Christ trample on it as on something dead. Before the divine sojourn of
   the Savior, even the holiest of men were afraid of death, and mourned
   the dead as those who perish. But now that the Savior has raised His
   body, death is no longer terrible, but all those who believe in Christ
   tread it underfoot as nothing, and prefer to die rather than to deny
   their faith in Christ, knowing full well that when they die they do not
   perish, but live indeed, and become incorruptible through the
   resurrection. But that devil who of old wickedly exulted in death, now
   that the pains of death are loosed, he alone it is who remains truly
   dead. There is proof of this too; for men who, before they believe in
   Christ, think death horrible and are afraid of it, once they are
   converted despise it so completely that they go eagerly to meet it, and
   themselves become witnesses of the Savior's resurrection from it. Even
   children hasten thus to die, and not men only, but women train
   themselves by bodily discipline to meet it. So weak has death become
   that even women, who used to be taken in by it, mock at it now as a
   dead thing robbed of all its strength. Death has become like a tyrant
   who has been completely conquered by the legitimate monarch; bound hand
   and foot the passers-by sneer at him, hitting him and abusing him, no
   longer afraid of his cruelty and rage, because of the king who has
   conquered him. So has death been conquered and branded for what it is
   by the Savior on the cross. It is bound hand and foot, all who are in
   Christ trample it as they pass and as witnesses to Him deride it,
   scoffing and saying, "O Death, where is thy victory? O Grave, where is
   thy sting?" [35]

   (28) Is this a slender proof of the impotence of death, do you think?
   Or is it a slight indication of the Savior's victory over it, when boys
   and young girls who are in Christ look beyond this present life and
   train themselves to die? Every one is by nature afraid of death and of
   bodily dissolution; the marvel of marvels is that he who is enfolded in
   the faith of the cross despises this natural fear and for the sake of
   the cross is no longer cowardly in face of it. The natural property of
   fire is to burn. Suppose, then, that there was a substance such as the
   Indian asbestos is said to be, which had no fear of being burnt, but
   rather displayed the impotence of the fire by proving itself
   unburnable. If anyone doubted the truth of this, all he need do would
   be to wrap himself up in the substance in question and then touch the
   fire. Or, again, to revert to our former figure, if anyone wanted to
   see the tyrant bound and helpless, who used to be such a terror to
   others, he could do so simply by going into the country of the tyrant's
   conqueror. Even so, if anyone still doubts the conquest of death, after
   so many proofs and so many martyrdoms in Christ and such daily scorn of
   death by His truest servants, he certainly does well to marvel at so
   great a thing, but he must not be obstinate in unbelief and disregard
   of plain facts. No, he must be like the man who wants to prove the
   property of the asbestos, and like him who enters the conqueror's
   dominions to see the tyrant bound. He must embrace the faith of Christ,
   this disbeliever in the conquest of death, and come to His teaching.
   Then he will see how impotent death is and how completely conquered.
   Indeed, there have been many former unbelievers and deriders who, after
   they became believers, so scorned death as even themselves to become
   martyrs for Christ's sake.

   (29) If, then, it is by the sign of the cross and by faith in Christ
   that death is trampled underfoot, it is clear that it is Christ Himself
   and none other Who is the Archvictor over death and has robbed it of
   its power. Death used to be strong and terrible, but now, since the
   sojourn of the Savior and the death and resurrection of His body, it is
   despised; and obviously it is by the very Christ Who mounted on the
   cross that it has been destroyed and vanquished finally. When the sun
   rises after the night and the whole world is lit up by it, nobody
   doubts that it is the sun which has thus shed its light everywhere and
   driven away the dark. Equally clear is it, since this utter scorning
   and trampling down of death has ensued upon the Savior's manifestation
   in the body and His death on the cross, that it is He Himself Who
   brought death to nought and daily raises monuments to His victory in
   His own disciples. How can you think otherwise, when you see men
   naturally weak hastening to death, unafraid at the prospect of
   corruption, fearless of the descent into Hades, even indeed with eager
   soul provoking it, not shrinking from tortures, but preferring thus to
   rush on death for Christ's sake, rather than to remain in this present
   life? If you see with your own eyes men and women and children, even,
   thus welcoming death for the sake of Christ's religion, how can you be
   so utterly silly and incredulous and maimed in your mind as not to
   realize that Christ, to Whom these all bear witness, Himself gives the
   victory to each, making death completely powerless for those who hold
   His faith and bear the sign of the cross? No one in his senses doubts
   that a snake is dead when he sees it trampled underfoot, especially
   when he knows how savage it used to be; nor, if he sees boys making fun
   of a lion, does he doubt that the brute is either dead or completely
   bereft of strength. These things can be seen with our own eyes, and it
   is the same with the conquest of death. Doubt no longer, then, when you
   see death mocked and scorned by those who believe in Christ, that by
   Christ death was destroyed, and the corruption that goes with it
   resolved and brought to end.

   (30) What we have said is, indeed, no small proof of the destruction of
   death and of the fact that the cross of the Lord is the monument to His
   victory. But the resurrection of the body to immortality, which results
   henceforward from the work of Christ, the common Savior and true Life
   of all, is more effectively proved by facts than by words to those
   whose mental vision is sound. For, if, as we have shown, death was
   destroyed and everybody tramples on it because of Christ, how much more
   did He Himself first trample and destroy it in His own body! Death
   having been slain by Him, then, what other issue could there be than
   the resurrection of His body and its open demonstration as the monument
   of His victory? How could the destruction of death have been manifested
   at all, had not the Lord's body been raised? But if anyone finds even
   this insufficient, let him find proof of what has been said in present
   facts. Dead men cannot take effective action; their power of influence
   on others lasts only till the grave. Deeds and actions that energize
   others belong only to the living. Well, then, look at the facts in this
   case. The Savior is working mightily among men, every day He is
   invisibly persuading numbers of people all over the world, both within
   and beyond the Greek-speaking world, to accept His faith and be
   obedient to His teaching. Can anyone, in face of this, still doubt that
   He has risen and lives, or rather that He is Himself the Life? Does a
   dead man prick the consciences of men, so that they throw all the
   traditions of their fathers to the winds and bow down before the
   teaching of Christ? If He is no longer active in the world, as He must
   needs be if He is dead, how is it that He makes the living to cease
   from their activities, the adulterer from his adultery, the murderer
   from murdering, the unjust from avarice, while the profane and godless
   man becomes religious? If He did not rise, but is still dead, how is it
   that He routs and persecutes and overthrows the false gods, whom
   unbelievers think to be alive, and the evil spirits whom they worship?
   For where Christ is named, idolatry is destroyed and the fraud of evil
   spirits is exposed; indeed, no such spirit can endure that Name, but
   takes to flight on sound of it. This is the work of One Who lives, not
   of one dead; and, more than that, it is the work of God. It would be
   absurd to say that the evil spirits whom He drives out and the idols
   which He destroys are alive, but that He Who drives out and destroys,
   and Whom they themselves acknowledge to be Son of God, is dead.

   (31) In a word, then, those who disbelieve in the resurrection have no
   support in facts, if their gods and evil spirits do not drive away the
   supposedly dead Christ. Rather, it is He Who convicts them of being
   dead. We are agreed that a dead person can do nothing: yet the Savior
   works mightily every day, drawing men to religion, persuading them to
   virtue, teaching them about immortality, quickening their thirst for
   heavenly things, revealing the knowledge of the Father, inspiring
   strength in face of death, manifesting Himself to each, and displacing
   the irreligion of idols; while the gods and evil spirits of the
   unbelievers can do none of these things, but rather become dead at
   Christ's presence, all their ostentation barren and void. By the sign
   of the cross, on the contrary, all magic is stayed, all sorcery
   confounded, all the idols are abandoned and deserted, and all senseless
   pleasure ceases, as the eye of faith looks up from earth to heaven.
   Whom, then, are we to call dead? Shall we call Christ dead, Who effects
   all this? But the dead have not the faculty to effect anything. Or
   shall we call death dead, which effects nothing whatever, but lies as
   lifeless and ineffective as are the evil spirits and the idols? The Son
   of God, "living and effective," [36] is active every day and effects
   the salvation of all; but death is daily proved to be stripped of all
   its strength, and it is the idols and the evil spirits who are dead,
   not He. No room for doubt remains, therefore, concerning the
   resurrection of His body.

   Indeed, it would seem that he who disbelieves this bodily rising of the
   Lord is ignorant of the power of the Word and Wisdom of God. If He took
   a body to Himself at all, and made it His own in pursuance of His
   purpose, as we have shown that He did, what was the Lord to do with it,
   and what was ultimately to become of that body upon which the Word had
   descended? Mortal and offered to death on behalf of all as it was, it
   could not but die; indeed, it was for that very purpose that the Savior
   had prepared it for Himself. But on the other hand it could not remain
   dead, because it had become the very temple of Life. It therefore died,
   as mortal, but lived again because of the Life within it; and its
   resurrection is made known through its works.

   (32) It is, indeed, in accordance with the nature of the invisible God
   that He should be thus known through His works; and those who doubt the
   Lord's resurrection because they do not now behold Him with their eyes,
   might as well deny the very laws of nature. They have ground for
   disbelief when works are lacking; but when the works cry out and prove
   the fact so clearly, why do they deliberately deny the risen life so
   manifestly shown? Even if their mental faculties are defective, surely
   their eyes can give them irrefragable proof of the power and Godhead of
   Christ. A blind man cannot see the sun, but he knows that it is above
   the earth from the warmth which it affords; similarly, let those who
   are still in the blindness of unbelief recognize the Godhead of Christ
   and the resurrection which He has brought about through His manifested
   power in others. Obviously He would not be expelling evil spirits and
   despoiling idols, if He were dead, for the evil spirits would not obey
   one who was dead. If, on the other hand, the very naming of Him drives
   them forth, He clearly is not dead; and the more so that the spirits,
   who perceive things unseen by men, would know if He were so and would
   refuse to obey Him. But, as a matter of fact, what profane persons
   doubt, the evil spirits know--namely that He is God; and for that
   reason they flee from Him and fall at His feet, crying out even as they
   cried when He was in the body, "We know Thee Who Thou art, the Holy One
   of God," and, "Ah, what have I in common with Thee, Thou Son of God? I
   implore Thee, torment me not." [37]

   Both from the confession of the evil spirits and from the daily witness
   of His works, it is manifest, then, and let none presume to doubt it,
   that the Savior has raised His own body, and that He is very Son of
   God, having His being from God as from a Father, Whose Word and Wisdom
   and Whose Power He is. He it is Who in these latter days assumed a body
   for the salvation of us all, and taught the world concerning the
   Father. He it is Who has destroyed death and freely graced us all with
   incorruption through the promise of the resurrection, having raised His
   own body as its first-fruits, and displayed it by the sign of the cross
   as the monument to His victory over death and its corruption.

   Refutation of the Jews

   (33) We have dealt thus far with the Incarnation of our Savior, and
   have found clear proof of the resurrection of His Body and His victory
   over death. Let us now go further and investigate the unbelief and the
   ridicule with which Jews and Gentiles respectively regard these same
   facts. It seems that in both cases the points at issue are the same,
   namely the unfittingness or incongruity (as it seems to them) alike of
   the cross and of the Word's becoming man at all. But we have no
   hesitation in taking up the argument against these objectors, for the
   proofs on our side are extremely clear.

   First, then, we will consider the Jews. Their unbelief has its
   refutation in the Scriptures which even themselves read; for from cover
   to cover the inspired Book clearly teaches these things both in its
   entirety and in its actual words. Prophets foretold the marvel of the
   Virgin and of the Birth from her, saying, "Behold, a virgin shall
   conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name 'Emmanuel,' which
   means 'God is with us.'" [38] And Moses, that truly great one in whose
   word the Jews trust so implicitly, he also recognized the importance
   and truth of the matter. He puts it thus: "There shall arise a star
   from Jacob and a man from Israel, and he shall break in pieces the
   rulers of Moab. [39] And, again, "How lovely are thy dwellings, O
   Jacob, thy tents, O Israel! Like woodland valleys they give shade, and
   like parks by rivers, like tents which the Lord has pitched, like
   cedar-trees by streams. There shall come forth a Man from among his
   seed, and he shall rule over many peoples." [40] And, again, Isaiah
   says, "Before the Babe shall be old enough to call father or mother, he
   shall take the power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria from under
   the eyes of the king of Assyria." [41] These words, then, foretell that
   a Man shall appear. And Scripture proclaims further that He that is to
   come is Lord of all. These are the words, "Behold, the Lord sitteth on
   an airy cloud and shall come into Egypt, and the man-made images of
   Egypt shall be shaken." [42] And it is from Egypt also that the Father
   calls him back, saying, "Out of Egypt have I called My Son." [43]

   (34) Moreover, the Scriptures are not silent even about His death. On
   the contrary, they refer to it with the utmost clearness. They have not
   feared to speak also of the cause of it. He endures it, they say, not
   for His own sake, but for the sake of bringing immortality and
   salvation to all, and they record also the plotting of the Jews against
   Him and all the indignities which He suffered at their hands. Certainly
   nobody who reads the Scriptures can plead ignorance of the facts as an
   excuse for error! There is this passage, for instance: "A man that is
   afflicted and knows how to bear weakness, for His face is turned away.
   He was dishonored and not considered, He bears our sins and suffers for
   our sakes. And we for our part thought Him distressed and afflicted and
   ill-used; but it was for our sins that He was wounded and for our
   lawlessness that He was made weak. Chastisement for our peace was upon
   Him, and by His bruising we are healed." [44] O marvel at the love of
   the Word for men, for it is on our account that He is dishonored, so
   that we may be brought to honor. "For all we," it goes on, "have
   strayed like sheep, man has strayed from his path, and the Lord has
   given Him up for our sins; and He Himself did not open His mouth at the
   ill-treatment. Like a sheep He was led to slaughter, and as a lamb is
   dumb before its shearer, so He opened not His mouth; in His humiliation
   His judgment was taken away." [45] And then Scripture anticipates the
   surmises of any who might think from His suffering thus that He was
   just an ordinary man, and shows what power worked in His behalf. "Who
   shall declare of what lineage He comes?" it says, "for His life is
   exalted from the earth. By the lawlessnesses of the people was He
   brought to death, and I will give the wicked in return for His burial
   and the rich in return for His death. For He did no lawlessness,
   neither was deceit found in His mouth. And the Lord wills to heal Him
   of His affliction." [46]

   (35) You have heard the prophecy of His death, and now, perhaps, you
   want to know what indications there are about the cross. Even this is
   not passed over in silence: on the contrary, the sacred writers
   proclaim it with the utmost plainness. Moses foretells it first, and
   that right loudly, when he says, "You shall see your Life hanging
   before your eyes, and shall not believe." [47] After him the prophets
   also give their witness, saying, "But I as an innocent lamb brought to
   be offered was yet ignorant of it. They plotted evil against Me,
   saying, 'Come, let us cast wood into His bread, and wipe Him out from
   the land of the living." [48] And, again, "They pierced My hands and My
   feet, they counted all My bones, they divided My garments for
   themselves and cast lots for My clothing." [49] Now a death lifted up
   and that takes place on wood can be none other than the death of the
   cross; moreover, it is only in that death that the hands and feet are
   pierced. Besides this, since the Savior dwelt among men, all nations
   everywhere have begun to know God; and this too Holy Writ expressly
   mentions. "There shall be the Root of Jesse," it says, "and he who
   rises up to rule the nations, on Him nations shall set their hope."
   [50]

   These are just a few things in proof of what has taken place; but
   indeed all Scripture teems with disproof of Jewish unbelief. For
   example, which of the righteous men and holy prophets and patriarchs of
   whom the Divine Scriptures tell ever had his bodily birth from a virgin
   only? Was not Abel born of Adam, Enoch of Jared, Noah of Lamech,
   Abraham of Terah, Isaac of Abraham, and Jacob of Isaac? Was not Judah
   begotten by Jacob and Moses and Aaron by Ameram? Was not Samuel the son
   of Elkanah, David of Jesse, Solomon of David, Hezekiah of Ahaz, Josiah
   of Amon, Isaiah of Amos, Jeremiah of Hilkiah and Ezekiel of Buzi? Had
   not each of these a father as author of his being? So who is He that is
   born of a virgin only, that sign of which the prophet makes so much?
   Again, which of all those people had his birth announced to the world
   by a star in the heavens? When Moses was born his parents hid him.
   David was unknown even in his own neighborhood, so that mighty Samuel
   himself was ignorant of his existence and asked whether Jesse had yet
   another son. Abraham again became known to his neighbors as a great man
   only after his birth. But with Christ it was otherwise. The witness to
   His birth was not man, but a star shining in the heavens whence He was
   coming down.

   (36) Then, again, what king that ever was reigned and took trophies
   from his enemies before he had strength to call father or mother? Was
   not David thirty years old when he came to the throne and Solomon a
   grown young man? Did not Joash enter on his reign at the age of seven,
   and Josiah, some time after him, at about the same age, both of them
   fully able by that time to call father or mother? Who is there, then,
   that was reigning and despoiling his enemies almost before he was born?
   Let the Jews, who have investigated the matter, tell us if there was
   ever such a king in Israel or Judah--a king upon whom all the nations
   set their hopes and had peace, instead of being at enmity with him on
   every side! As long as Jerusalem stood there was constant war between
   them, and they all fought against Israel. The Assyrians oppressed
   Israel, the Egyptians persecuted them, the Babylonians fell upon them,
   and, strange to relate, even the Syrians their neighbors were at war
   with them. And did not David fight with Moab and smite the Syrians, and
   Hezekiah quail at the boasting of Sennacherib? Did not Amalek make war
   on Moses and the Amorites oppose him, and did not the inhabitants of
   Jericho array themselves against Joshua the son of Nun? Did not the
   nations always regard Israel with implacable hostility? Then it is
   worth inquiring who it is, on whom the nations are to set their hopes.
   Obviously there must be someone, for the prophet could not have told a
   lie. But did any of the holy prophets or of the early patriarchs die on
   the cross for the salvation of all? Was any of them wounded and killed
   for the healing of all? Did the idols of Egypt fall down before any
   righteous man or king that came there? Abraham came there certainly,
   but idolatry prevailed just the same; and Moses was born there, but the
   mistaken worship was unchanged.

   (37) Again, does Scripture tell of anyone who was pierced in hands and
   feet or hung upon a tree at all, and by means of a cross perfected his
   sacrifice for the salvation of all? It was not Abraham, for he died in
   his bed, as did also Isaac and Jacob. Moses and Aaron died in the
   mountain, and David ended his days in his house, without anybody having
   plotted against him. Certainly he had been sought by Saul, but he was
   preserved unharmed. Again Isaiah was sawn asunder, but he was not hung
   on a tree. Jeremiah was shamefully used, but he did not die under
   condemnation. Ezekiel suffered, but he did so, not on behalf of the
   people, but only to signify to them what was going to happen. Moreover,
   all these even when they suffered were but men, like other men; but He
   Whom the Scriptures declare to suffer on behalf of all is called not
   merely man but Life of all, although in point of fact He did share our
   human nature. "You shall see your Life hanging before your eyes," they
   say, and "Who shall declare of what lineage He comes?" With all the
   saints we can trace their descent from the beginning, and see exactly
   how each came to be; but the Divine Word maintains that we cannot
   declare the lineage of Him Who is the Life. Who is it, then, of Whom
   Holy Writ thus speaks? Who is there so great that even the prophets
   foretell of Him such mighty things? There is indeed no one in the
   Scriptures at all, save the common Savior of all, the Word of God, our
   Lord Jesus Christ. He it is that proceeded from a virgin, and appeared
   as man on earth, He it is Whose earthly lineage cannot be declared,
   because He alone derives His body from no human father, but from a
   virgin alone. We can trace the paternal descent of David and Moses and
   of all the patriarchs. But with the Savior we cannot do so, for it was
   He Himself Who caused the star to announce His bodily birth, and it was
   fitting that the Word, when He came down from heaven, should have His
   sign in heaven too, and fitting that the King of creation on His coming
   forth should be visibly recognized by all the world. He was actually
   born in Judea, yet men from Persia came to worship Him. He it is Who
   won victory from His demon foes and trophies from the idolaters even
   before His bodily appearing--namely, all the heathen who from every
   region have abjured the tradition of their fathers and the false
   worship of idols and are now placing their hope in Christ and
   transferring their allegiance to Him. The thing is happening before our
   very eyes, here in Egypt; and thereby another prophecy is fulfilled,
   for at no other time have the Egyptians ceased from their false worship
   save when the Lord of all, riding as on a cloud, came down here in the
   body and brought the error of idols to nothing and won over everybody
   to Himself and through Himself to the Father. He it is Who was
   crucified with the sun and moon as witnesses; and by His death
   salvation has come to all men, and all creation has been redeemed. He
   is the Life of all, and He it is Who like a sheep gave up His own body
   to death, His life for ours and our salvation.

   (38) Yet the Jews disbelieve this. This argument does not satisfy them.
   Well, then, let them be persuaded by other things in their own oracles.
   Of whom, for instance, do the prophets say "I was made manifest to
   those who did not seek Me, I was found by those who had not asked for
   Me? I said, 'See, here am I,' to the nation that had not called upon My
   Name. I stretched out My hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people."
   [51] Who is this person that was made manifest, one might ask the Jews?
   If the prophet is speaking of himself, then they must tell us how he
   was first hidden, in order to be manifested afterwards. And, again,
   what kind of man is this prophet, who was not only revealed after being
   hidden, but also stretched out his hands upon the cross? Those things
   happened to none of those righteous men: they happened only to the Word
   of God Who, being by nature without body, on our account appeared in a
   body and suffered for us all. And if even this is not enough for them,
   there is other overwhelming evidence by which they may be silenced. The
   Scripture says, "Be strong, hands that hang down and feeble knees, take
   courage, you of little faith, be strong and do not fear. See, our God
   will recompense judgment, He Himself will come and save us. Then the
   eyes of blind men shall be opened and the ears of deaf men shall hear,
   and stammerers shall speak distinctly." [52] What can they say to this,
   or how can they look it in the face at all? For the prophecy does not
   only declare that God will dwell here, it also makes known the signs
   and the time of His coming. When God comes, it says, the blind will
   see, the lame will walk, the deaf will hear and the stammerers will
   speak distinctly. Can the Jews tell us when such signs occurred in
   Israel, or when anything of the kind took place at all in Jewry? The
   leper Naaman was cleansed, it is true, but no deaf man heard nor did
   any lame man walk. Elijah raised a dead person and so did Elisha; but
   no one blind from birth received his sight. To raise a dead person is a
   great thing indeed, but it is not such as the Savior did. And surely,
   since the Scriptures have not kept silence about the leper and the dead
   son of the widow, if a lame man had walked and a blind man had received
   his sight, they would have mentioned these as well. Their silence on
   these points proves that the events never took place. When therefore
   did these things happen, unless when the Word of God Himself came in
   the body? Was it not when He came that lame men walked and stammerers
   spoke clearly and men blind from birth were given sight? And the Jews
   who saw it themselves testified to the fact that such things had never
   before occurred. "Since the world began," they said, "it has never been
   heard of that anyone should open the eyes of a man born blind. If this
   Man were not from God, He could do nothing." [53]

   (39) But surely they cannot fight against plain facts. So it may be
   that, without denying what is written, they will maintain that they are
   still waiting for these things to happen, and that the Word of God is
   yet to come, for that is a theme on which they are always harping most
   brazenly, in spite of all the evidence against them. But they shall be
   refuted on this supreme point more clearly than on any, and that not by
   ourselves but by the most wise Daniel, for he signifies the actual date
   of the Savior's coming as well as His Divine sojourn in our midst.
   "Seventy weeks," he says, "are cut short upon thy people and upon the
   holy city, to make a complete end of sin and for sins to be sealed up
   and iniquities blotted out, and to make reconciliation for iniquity and
   to seal vision and prophet, and to anoint a Holy One of holies. And
   thou shalt know and understand from the going forth of the Word to
   answer, [54] and to build Jerusalem, until Christ the Prince." [55] In
   regard to the other prophecies, they may possibly be able to find
   excuses for deferring their reference to a future time, but what can
   they say to this one? How can they face it at all? Not only does it
   expressly mention the Anointed One, that is the Christ, it even
   declares that He Who is to be anointed is not man only, but the Holy
   One of holies! And it says that Jerusalem is to stand till His coming,
   and that after it prophet and vision shall cease in Israel! David was
   anointed of old, and Solomon, and Hezekiah; but then Jerusalem and the
   place stood, and prophets were prophesying, Gad and Asaph and Nathan,
   and later Isaiah and Hosea and Amos and others. Moreover, those men who
   were anointed were called holy certainly, but none of them was called
   the Holy of holies. Nor is it any use for the Jews to take refuge in
   the Captivity, and say that Jerusalem did not exist then, for what
   about the prophets? It is a fact that at the outset of the Exile Daniel
   and Jeremiah were there, and Ezekiel and Haggai and Zechariah also
   prophesied.

   (40) So the Jews are indulging in fiction, and transferring present
   time to future. When did prophet and vision cease from Israel? Was it
   not when Christ came, the Holy One of holies? It is, in fact, a sign
   and notable proof of the coming of the Word that Jerusalem no longer
   stands, neither is prophet raised up nor vision revealed among them.
   And it is natural that it should be so, for when He that was signified
   had come, what need was there any longer of any to signify Him? And
   when the Truth had come, what further need was there of the shadow? On
   His account only they prophesied continually, until such time as
   Essential Righteousness has come, Who was made the Ransom for the sins
   of all. For the same reason Jerusalem stood until the same time, in
   order that there men might premeditate the types before the Truth was
   known. So, of course, once the Holy One of holies had come, both vision
   and prophecy were sealed. And the kingdom of Jerusalem ceased at the
   same time, because kings were to be anointed among them only until the
   Holy of holies had been anointed. Moses also prophesies that the
   kingdom of the Jews shall stand until His time, saying, "A ruler shall
   not fail from Judah nor a prince from his loins, until the things laid
   up for him shall come and the Expectation of the nations Himself." [56]
   And that is why the Savior Himself was always proclaiming "The law and
   the prophets prophesied until John." [57] So if there is still king or
   prophet or vision among the Jews, they do well to deny that Christ is
   come; but if there is neither king nor vision, and since that time all
   prophecy has been sealed and city and temple taken, how can they be so
   irreligious, how can they so flaunt the facts, as to deny Christ Who
   has brought it all about? Again, they see the heathen forsaking idols
   and setting their hopes through Christ on the God of Israel; why do
   they yet deny Christ Who after the flesh was born of the root of Jesse
   and reigns henceforward? Of course, if the heathen were worshipping
   some other god, and not confessing the God of Abraham and Isaac and
   Jacob and Moses, then they would do well to argue that God had not
   come. But if the heathen are honoring the same God Who gave the law to
   Moses and the promises to Abraham--the God Whose word too the Jews
   dishonored, why do they not recognize or rather why do they
   deliberately refuse to see that the Lord of Whom the Scriptures
   prophesied has shone forth to the world and appeared to it in a bodily
   form? Scripture declares it repeatedly. "The Lord God has appeared to
   us," [58] and again, "He sent forth His Word and healed them." [59] And
   again, "It was no ambassador, no angel who saved us, but the Lord
   Himself." [60] The Jews are afflicted like some demented person who
   sees the earth lit up by the sun, but denies the sun that lights it up!
   What more is there for their Expected One to do when he comes? To call
   the heathen? But they are called already. To put an end to prophet and
   king and vision? But this too has already happened. To expose the
   Goddenyingness of idols? It is already exposed and condemned. Or to
   destroy death? It is already destroyed. What then has not come to pass
   that the Christ must do? What is there left out or unfulfilled that the
   Jews should disbelieve so light-heartedly? The plain fact is, as I say,
   that there is no longer any king or prophet nor Jerusalem nor sacrifice
   nor vision among them; yet the whole earth is filled with the knowledge
   of God, and the Gentiles, forsaking atheism, are now taking refuge with
   the God of Abraham through the Word, our Lord Jesus Christ.

   Surely, then, it must be plain even to the most shameless that the
   Christ has come, and that He has enlightened all men everywhere, and
   given them the true and divine teaching about His Father.

   Thus the Jews may be refuted by these and other arguments from the
   Divine teaching.

Chapter 7

   Refutation of the Gentiles

   (41) We come now to the unbelief of the Gentiles; and this is indeed a
   matter for complete astonishment, for they laugh at that which is no
   fit subject for mockery, yet fail to see the shame and ridiculousness
   of their own idols. But the arguments on our side do not lack weight,
   so we will confute them too on reasonable grounds, chiefly from what we
   ourselves also see.

   First of all, what is there in our belief that is unfitting or
   ridiculous? Is it only that we say that the Word has been manifested in
   a body? Well, if they themselves really love the truth, they will agree
   with us that this involved no unfittingness at all. If they deny that
   there is a Word of God at all, that will be extraordinary, for then
   they will be ridiculing what they do not know. But suppose they confess
   that there is a Word of God, that He is the Governor of all things,
   that in Him the Father wrought the creation, that by His providence the
   whole receives light and life and being, and that He is King over all,
   so that He is known by means of the works of His providence, and
   through Him the Father. Suppose they confess all this, what then? Are
   they not unknowingly turning the ridicule against themselves? The Greek
   philosophers say that the universe is a great body, and they say truly,
   for we perceive the universe and its parts with our senses. But if the
   Word of God is in the universe, which is a body, and has entered into
   it in its every part, what is there surprising or unfitting in our
   saying that He has entered also into human nature? If it were unfitting
   for Him to have embodied Himself at all, then it would be unfitting for
   Him to have entered into the universe, and to be giving light and
   movement by His providence to all things in it, because the universe,
   as we have seen, is itself a body. But if it is right and fitting for
   Him to enter into the universe and to reveal Himself through it, then,
   because humanity is part of the universe along with the rest, it is no
   less fitting for Him to appear in a human body, and to enlighten and to
   work through that. And surely if it were wrong for a part of the
   universe to have been used to reveal His Divinity to men, it would be
   much more wrong that He should be so revealed by the whole!

   (42) Take a parallel case. A man's personality actuates and quickens
   his whole body. If anyone said it was unsuitable for the man's power to
   be in the toe, he would be thought silly, because, while granting that
   a man penetrates and actuates the whole of his body, he denied his
   presence in the part. Similarly, no one who admits the presence of the
   Word of God in the universe as a whole should think it unsuitable for a
   single human body to be by Him actuated and enlightened.

   But is it, perhaps, because humanity is a thing created and brought
   into being out of non-existence that they regard as unfitting the
   manifestation of the Savior in our nature? If so, it is high time that
   they spurned Him from creation too; for it, too, has been brought out
   of non-being into being by the Word. But if, on the other hand,
   although creation is a thing that has been made, it is not unsuitable
   for the Word to be present in it, then neither is it unsuitable for Him
   to be in man. Man is a part of the creation, as I said before; and the
   reasoning which applies to one applies to the other. All things derive
   from the Word their light and movement and life, as the Gentile authors
   themselves say, "In Him we live and move and have our being." [61] Very
   well then. That being so, it is by no means unbecoming that the Word
   should dwell in man. So if, as we say, the Word has used that in which
   He is as the means of His self-manifestation, what is there ridiculous
   in that? He could not have used it had He not been present in it; but
   we have already admitted that He is present both in the whole and in
   the parts. What, then, is there incredible in His manifesting Himself
   through that in which He is? By His own power He enters completely into
   each and all, and orders them throughout ungrudgingly; and, had He so
   willed, He could have revealed Himself and His Father by means of sun
   or moon or sky or earth or fire or water. Had He done so, no one could
   rightly have accused Him of acting unbecomingly, for He sustains in one
   whole all things at once, being present and invisibly revealed not only
   in the whole, but also in each particular part. This being so, and
   since, moreover, He has willed to reveal Himself through men, who are
   part of the whole, there can be nothing ridiculous in His using a human
   body to manifest the truth and knowledge of the Father. Does not the
   mind of man pervade his entire being, and yet find expression through
   one part only, namely the tongue? Does anybody say on that account that
   Mind has degraded itself? Of course not. Very well, then, no more is it
   degrading for the Word, Who pervades all things, to have appeared in a
   human body. For, as I said before, if it were unfitting for Him thus to
   indwell the part, it would be equally so for Him to exist within the
   whole.

   (43) Some may then ask, why did He not manifest Himself by means of
   other and nobler parts of creation, and use some nobler instrument,
   such as sun or moon or stars or fire or air, instead of mere man? The
   answer is this. The Lord did not come to make a display. He came to
   heal and to teach suffering men. For one who wanted to make a display
   the thing would have been just to appear and dazzle the beholders. But
   for Him Who came to heal and to teach the way was not merely to dwell
   here, but to put Himself at the disposal of those who needed Him, and
   to be manifested according as they could bear it, not vitiating the
   value of the Divine appearing by exceeding their capacity to receive
   it.

   Moreover, nothing in creation had erred from the path of God's purpose
   for it, save only man. Sun, moon, heaven, stars, water, air, none of
   these had swerved from their order, but, knowing the Word as their
   Maker and their King, remained as they were made. Men alone having
   rejected what is good, have invented nothings instead of the truth, and
   have ascribed the honor due to God and the knowledge concerning Him to
   demons and men in the form of stones. Obviously the Divine goodness
   could not overlook so grave a matter as this. But men could not
   recognize Him as ordering and ruling creation as a whole. So what does
   He do? He takes to Himself for instrument a part of the whole, namely a
   human body, and enters into that. Thus He ensured that men should
   recognize Him in the part who could not do so in the whole, and that
   those who could not lift their eyes to His unseen power might recognize
   and behold Him in the likeness of themselves. For, being men, they
   would naturally learn to know His Father more quickly and directly by
   means of a body that corresponded to their own and by the Divine works
   done through it; for by comparing His works with their own they would
   judge His to be not human but Divine. And if, as they say, it were
   unsuitable for the Word to reveal Himself through bodily acts, it would
   be equally so for Him to do so through the works of the universe. His
   being in creation does not mean that He shares its nature; on the
   contrary, all created things partake of His power. Similarly, though He
   used the body as His instrument, He shared nothing of its defect, [62]
   but rather sanctified it by His indwelling. Does not even Plato, of
   whom the Greeks think so much, say that the Author of the Universe,
   seeing it storm-tossed and in danger of sinking into the state of
   dissolution, takes his seat at the helm of the Life-force of the
   universe, and comes to the rescue and puts everything right? What,
   then, is there incredible in our saying that, mankind having gone
   astray, the Word descended upon it and was manifest as man, so that by
   His intrinsic goodness and His steersmanship He might save it from the
   storm?

   (44) It may be, however, that, though shamed into agreeing that this
   objection is void, the Greeks will want to raise another. They will say
   that, if God wanted to instruct and save mankind, He might have done
   so, not by His Word's assumption of a body, but, even as He at first
   created them, by the mere signification of His will. The reasonable
   reply to that is that the circumstances in the two cases are quite
   different. In the beginning, nothing as yet existed at all; all that
   was needed, therefore, in order to bring all things into being, was
   that His will to do so should be signified. But once man was in
   existence, and things that were, not things that were not, demanded to
   be healed, it followed as a matter of course that the Healer and Savior
   should align Himself with those things that existed already, in order
   to heal the existing evil. For that reason, therefore, He was made man,
   and used the body as His human instrument. If this were not the fitting
   way, and He willed to use an instrument at all, how otherwise was the
   Word to come? And whence could He take His instrument, save from among
   those already in existence and needing His Godhead through One like
   themselves? It was not things non-existent that needed salvation, for
   which a bare creative word might have sufficed, but man--man already in
   existence and already in process of corruption and ruin. It was natural
   and right, therefore, for the Word to use a human instrument and by
   that means unfold Himself to all.

   You must know, moreover, that the corruption which had set in was not
   external to the body but established within it. The need, therefore,
   was that life should cleave to it in corruption's place, so that, just
   as death was brought into being in the body, life also might be
   engendered in it. If death had been exterior to the body, life might
   fittingly have been the same. But if death was within the body, woven
   into its very substance and dominating it as though completely one with
   it, the need was for Life to be woven into it instead, so that the body
   by thus enduing itself with life might cast corruption off. Suppose the
   Word had come outside the body instead of in it, He would, of course,
   have defeated death, because death is powerless against the Life. But
   the corruption inherent in the body would have remained in it none the
   less. Naturally, therefore, the Savior assumed a body for Himself, in
   order that the body, being interwoven as it were with life, should no
   longer remain a mortal thing, in thrall to death, but as endued with
   immortality and risen from death, should thenceforth remain immortal.
   For once having put on corruption, it could not rise, unless it put on
   life instead; and besides this, death of its very nature could not
   appear otherwise than in a body. Therefore He put on a body, so that in
   the body He might find death and blot it out. And, indeed, how could
   the Lord have been proved to be the Life at all, had He not endued with
   life that which was subject to death? Take an illustration. Stubble is
   a substance naturally destructible by fire; and it still remains
   stubble, fearing the menace of fire which has the natural property of
   consuming it, even if fire is kept away from it, so that it is not
   actually burnt. But suppose that, instead of merely keeping the fire
   from it somebody soaks the stubble with a quantity of asbestos, the
   substance which is said to be the antidote to fire. Then the stubble no
   longer fears the fire, because it has put on that which fire cannot
   touch, and therefore it is safe. It is just the same with regard to the
   body and death. Had death been kept from it by a mere command, it would
   still have remained mortal and corruptible, according to its nature. To
   prevent this, it put on the incorporeal Word of God, and therefore
   fears neither death nor corruption any more, for it is clad with Life
   as with a garment and in it corruption is clean done away.

   (45) The Word of God thus acted consistently in assuming a body and
   using a human instrument to vitalize the body. He was consistent in
   working through man to reveal Himself everywhere, as well as through
   the other parts of His creation, so that nothing was left void of His
   Divinity and knowledge. For I take up now the point I made before,
   namely that the Savior did this in order that He might fill all things
   everywhere with the knowledge of Himself, just as they are already
   filled with His presence, even as the Divine Scripture says, "The whole
   universe was filled with the knowledge of the Lord." [63] If a man
   looks up to heaven he sees there His ordering; but if he cannot look so
   high as heaven, but only so far as men, through His works he sees His
   power, incomparable with human might, and learns from them that He
   alone among men is God the Word. Or, if a man has gone astray among
   demons and is in fear of them, he may see this Man drive them out and
   judge therefrom that He is indeed their Master. Again, if a man has
   been immersed in the element of water and thinks that it is God--as
   indeed the Egyptians do worship water--he may see its very nature
   changed by Him and learn that the Lord is Creator of all. And if a man
   has gone down even to Hades, and stands awestruck before the heroes who
   have descended thither, regarding them as gods, still he may see the
   fact of Christ's resurrection and His victory over death, and reason
   from it that, of all these, He alone is very Lord and God.

   For the Lord touched all parts of creation, and freed and undeceived
   them all from every deceit. As St. Paul says, "Having put off from
   Himself the principalities and the powers, He triumphed on the cross,"
   [64] so that no one could possibly be any longer deceived, but
   everywhere might find the very Word of God. For thus man, enclosed on
   every side by the works of creation and everywhere--in heaven, in
   Hades, in men and on the earth, beholding the unfolded Godhead of the
   Word, is no longer deceived concerning God, but worships Christ alone,
   and through Him rightly knows the Father.

   On these grounds, then, of reason and of principle, we will fairly
   silence the Gentiles in their turn. But if they think these arguments
   insufficient to confute them, we will go on in the next chapter to
   prove our point from facts.

Chapter 8

   Refutation of the Gentiles--continued

   (46) When did people begin to abandon the worship of idols, unless it
   were since the very Word of God came among men? When have oracles
   ceased and become void of meaning, among the Greeks and everywhere,
   except since the Savior has revealed Himself on earth? When did those
   whom the poets call gods and heroes begin to be adjudged as mere
   mortals, except when the Lord took the spoils of death and preserved
   incorruptible the body He had taken, raising it from among the dead? Or
   when did the deceitfulness and madness of demons fall under contempt,
   save when the Word, the Power of God, the Master of all these as well,
   condescended on account of the weakness of mankind and appeared on
   earth? When did the practice and theory of magic begin to be spurned
   under foot, if not at the manifestation of the Divine Word to men? In a
   word, when did the wisdom of the Greeks become foolish, save when the
   true Wisdom of God revealed Himself on earth? In old times the whole
   world and every place in it was led astray by the worship of idols, and
   men thought the idols were the only gods that were. But now all over
   the world men are forsaking the fear of idols and taking refuge with
   Christ; and by worshipping Him as God they come through Him to know the
   Father also, Whom formerly they did not know. The amazing thing,
   moreover, is this. The objects of worship formerly were varied and
   countless; each place had its own idol and the so-called god of one
   place could not pass over to another in order to persuade the people
   there to worship him, but was barely reverenced even by his own. Indeed
   no! Nobody worshipped his neighbor's god, but every man had his own
   idol and thought that it was lord of all. But now Christ alone is
   worshipped, as One and the Same among all peoples everywhere; and what
   the feebleness of idols could not do, namely, convince even those
   dwelling close at hand, He has effected. He has persuaded not only
   those close at hand, but literally the entire world to worship one and
   the same Lord and through Him the Father.

   (47) Again, in former times every place was full of the fraud of the
   oracles, and the utterances of those at Delphi and Dordona and in
   Boeotia and Lycia and Libya and Egypt and those of the Kabiri and the
   Pythoness were considered marvelous by the minds of men. But now, since
   Christ has been proclaimed everywhere, their madness too has ceased,
   and there is no one left among them to give oracles at all. Then, too,
   demons used to deceive men's minds by taking up their abode in springs
   or rivers or trees or stones and imposing upon simple people by their
   frauds. But now, since the Divine appearing of the Word, all this
   fantasy has ceased, for by the sign of the cross, if a man will but use
   it, he drives out their deceits. Again, people used to regard as gods
   those who are mentioned in the poets--Zeus and Kronos and Apollo and
   the heroes, and in worshipping them they went astray. But now that the
   Savior has appeared among men, those others have been exposed as mortal
   men, and Christ alone is recognized as true God, Word of God, God
   Himself. And what is one to say about the magic that they think so
   marvelous? Before the sojourn of the Word, it was strong and active
   among Egyptians and Chaldeans and Indians and filled all who saw it
   with terror and astonishment. But by the coming of the Truth and the
   manifestation of the Word it too has been confuted and entirely
   destroyed. As to Greek wisdom, however, and the philosophers' noisy
   talk, I really think no one requires argument from us; for the amazing
   fact is patent to all that, for all that they had written so much, the
   Greeks failed to convince even a few from their own neighborhood in
   regard to immortality and the virtuous ordering of life. Christ alone,
   using common speech and through the agency of men not clever with their
   tongues, has convinced whole assemblies of people all the world over to
   despise death, and to take heed to the things that do not die, to look
   past the things of time and gaze on things eternal, to think nothing of
   earthly glory and to aspire only to immortality.

   (48) These things which we have said are no mere words: they are
   attested by actual experience. Anyone who likes may see the proof of
   glory in the virgins of Christ, and in the young men who practice
   chastity as part of their religion, and in the assurance of immortality
   in so great and glad a company [65] of martyrs. Anyone, too, may put
   what we have said to the proof of experience in another way. In the
   very presence of the fraud of demons and the imposture of the oracles
   and the wonders of magic, let him use the sign of the cross which they
   all mock at, and but speak the Name of Christ, and he shall see how
   through Him demons are routed, oracles cease, and all magic and
   witchcraft is confounded.

   Who, then, is this Christ and how great is He, Who by His Name and
   presence overshadows and confounds all things on every side, Who alone
   is strong against all and has filled the whole world with His teaching?
   Let the Greeks tell us, who mock at Him without stint or shame. If He
   is a man, how is it that one man has proved stronger than all those
   whom they themselves regard as gods, and by His own power has shown
   them to be nothing? If they call Him a magician, how is it that by a
   magician all magic is destroyed, instead of being rendered strong? Had
   He conquered certain magicians or proved Himself superior to one of
   them only, they might reasonably think that He excelled the rest only
   by His greater skill. But the fact is that His cross has vanquished all
   magic entirely and has conquered the very name of it. Obviously,
   therefore, the Savior is no magician, for the very demons whom the
   magicians invoke flee from Him as from their Master. Who is He, then?
   Let the Greeks tell us, whose only serious pursuit is mockery! Perhaps
   they will say that He, too, is a demon, and that is why He prevailed.
   But even so the laugh is still on our side. for we can confute them by
   the same proofs as before. How could He be a demon, Who drives demons
   out? If it were only certain ones that He drove out, then they might
   reasonably think that He prevailed against them through the power of
   their Chief, as the Jews, wishing to insult Him, actually said. But
   since the fact is, here again, that at the mere naming of His Name all
   madness of the demons is rooted out and put to flight, obviously the
   Greeks are wrong here, too, and our Lord and Savior Christ is not, as
   they maintain, some demonic power.

   If, then, the Savior is neither a mere man nor a magician, nor one of
   the demons, but has by His Godhead confounded and overshadowed the
   opinions of the poets and the delusion of the demons and the wisdom of
   the Greeks, it must be manifest and will be owned by all that He is in
   truth Son of God, Existent Word and Wisdom and Power of the Father.
   This is the reason why His works are no mere human works, but, both
   intrinsically and by comparison with those of men, are recognized as
   being superhuman and truly the works of God.

   (49) What man that ever was, for instance, formed a body for himself
   from a virgin only? Or what man ever healed so many diseases as the
   common Lord of all? Who restored that which was lacking in man's nature
   or made one blind from birth to see? Aesculapius was deified by the
   Greeks because he practiced the art of healing and discovered herbs as
   remedies for bodily diseases, not, of course, forming them himself out
   of the earth, but finding them out by the study of nature. But what is
   that in comparison with what the Savior did when, instead of just
   healing a wound, He both fashioned essential being and restored to
   health the thing that He had formed? Hercules, too, is worshipped as a
   god by the Greeks because he fought against other men and destroyed
   wild animals by craft. But what is that to what the Word did, in
   driving away from men diseases and demons and even death itself?
   Dionysus is worshipped among them, because he taught men drunkenness;
   yet they ridicule the true Savior and Lord of all, Who taught men
   temperance.

   That, however, is enough on this point. What will they say to the other
   marvels of His Godhead? At what man's death was the sun darkened and
   the earth shaken? Why, even to this day men are dying, and they did so
   also before that time. When did any such marvels happen in their case?
   Now shall we pass over the deeds done in His earthly body and mention
   those after His resurrection? Has any man's teaching, in any place or
   at any time, ever prevailed everywhere as one and the same, from one
   end of the earth to the other, so that his worship has fairly flown
   through every land? Again, if, as they say, Christ is man only and not
   God the Word, why do not the gods of the Greeks prevent His entering
   their domains? Or why, on the other hand, does the Word Himself
   dwelling in our midst make an end of their worship by His teaching and
   put their fraud to shame?

   (50) Many before Him have been kings and tyrants of the earth, history
   tells also of many among the Chaldeans and Egyptians and Indians who
   were wise men and magicians. But which of those, I do not say after his
   death, but while yet in this life, was ever able so far to prevail as
   to fill the whole world with his teaching and retrieve so great a
   multitude from the craven fear of idols, as our Savior has won over
   from idols to Himself? The Greek philosophers have compiled many works
   with persuasiveness and much skill in words; but what fruit have they
   to show for this such as has the cross of Christ? Their wise thoughts
   were persuasive enough until they died; yet even in their life-time
   their seeming influence was counterbalanced by their rivalry with one
   another, for they were a jealous company and declaimed against each
   other. But the Word of God, by strangest paradox, teaching in meaner
   language, has put the choicest sophists in the shade, and by
   confounding their teachings and drawing all men to Himself He has
   filled His own assemblies. Moreover, and this is the marvelous thing by
   going down as Man to death He has confounded all the sounding
   utterances of the wise men about the idols. For whose death ever drove
   out demons, or whose death did ever demons fear, save that of Christ?
   For where the Savior is named, there every demon is driven out. Again,
   who has ever so rid men of their natural passions that fornicators
   become chaste and murderers no longer wield the sword and those who
   formerly were craven cowards boldly play the man? In a word, what
   persuaded the barbarians and heathen folk in every place to drop their
   madness and give heed to peace, save the faith of Christ and the sign
   of the cross? What other things have given men such certain faith in
   immortality as have the cross of Christ and the resurrection of His
   body? The Greeks told all sorts of false tales, but they could never
   pretend that their idols rose again from death: indeed it never entered
   their heads that a body could exist again after death at all. And one
   would be particularly ready to listen to them on this point, because by
   these opinions they have exposed the weakness of their own idolatry, at
   the same time yielding to Christ the possibility of bodily
   resurrection, so that by that means He might be recognized by all as
   Son of God.

   (51) Again, who among men, either after his death or while yet living,
   taught about virginity and did not account this virtue impossible for
   human beings? But Christ our Savior and King of all has so prevailed
   with His teaching on this subject that even children not yet of lawful
   age promise that virginity which transcends the law. And who among men
   has ever been able to penetrate even to Scythians and Ethiopians, or
   Parthians or Armenians or those who are said to live beyond Hyrcania,
   or even the Egyptians and Chaldeans, people who give heed to magic and
   are more than naturally enslaved by the fear of demons and savage in
   their habits, and to preach at all about virtue and self-control and
   against the worshipping of idols, as has the Lord of all, the Power of
   God, our Lord Jesus Christ? Yet He not only preached through His own
   disciples, but also wrought so persuasively on men's understanding
   that, laying aside their savage habits and forsaking the worship of
   their ancestral gods, they learnt to know Him and through Him to
   worship the Father. While they were yet idolaters, the Greeks and
   Barbarians were always at war with each other, and were even cruel to
   their own kith and kin. Nobody could travel by land or sea at all
   unless he was armed with swords, because of their irreconcilable
   quarrels with each other. Indeed, the whole course of their life was
   carried on with the weapons, and the sword with them replaced the staff
   and was the mainstay of all aid. All this time, as I said before, they
   were serving idols and offering sacrifices to demons, and for all the
   superstitious awe that accompanied this idol worship, nothing could
   wean them from that warlike spirit. But, strange to relate, since they
   came over to the school of Christ, as men moved with real compunction
   they have laid aside their murderous cruelty and are war-minded no
   more. On the contrary, all is peace among them and nothing remains save
   desire for friendship.

   (52) Who, then, is He Who has done these things and has united in peace
   those who hated each other, save the beloved Son of the Father, the
   common Savior of all, Jesus Christ, Who by His own love underwent all
   things for our salvation? Even from the beginning, moreover, this peace
   that He was to administer was foretold, for Scripture says, "They shall
   beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into sickles, and
   nation shall not take sword against nation, neither shall they learn
   any more to wage war." [66] Nor is this by any means incredible.

   The barbarians of the present day are naturally savage in their habits,
   and as long as they sacrifice to their idols they rage furiously
   against each other and cannot bear to be a single hour without weapons.
   But when they hear the teaching of Christ, forthwith they turn from
   fighting to farming, and instead of arming themselves with swords
   extend their hands in prayer. In a word, instead of fighting each
   other, they take up arms against the devil and the demons, and overcome
   them by their selfcommand and integrity of soul. These facts are proof
   of the Godhead of the Savior, for He has taught men what they could
   never learn among the idols. It is also no small exposure of the
   weakness and nothingness of demons and idols, for it was because they
   knew their own weakness that the demons were always setting men to
   fight each other, fearing lest, if they ceased from mutual strife, they
   would turn to attack the demons themselves. For in truth the disciples
   of Christ, instead of fighting each other, stand arrayed against demons
   by their habits and virtuous actions, and chase them away and mock at
   their captain the devil. Even in youth they are chaste, they endure in
   times of testing and persevere in toils. When they are insulted, they
   are patient, when robbed they make light of it, and, marvelous to
   relate, they make light even of death itself, and become martyrs of
   Christ.

   (53) And here is another proof of the Godhead of the Savior, which is
   indeed utterly amazing. What mere man or magician or tyrant or king was
   ever able by himself to do so much? Did anyone ever fight against the
   whole system of idol-worship and the whole host of demons and all magic
   and all the wisdom of the Greeks, at a time when all of these were
   strong and flourishing and taking everybody in, as did our Lord, the
   very Word of God? Yet He is even now invisibly exposing every man's
   error, and single-handed is carrying off all men from them all, so that
   those who used to worship idols now tread them under foot, reputed
   magicians burn their books and the wise prefer to all studies the
   interpretation of the gospels. They are deserting those whom formerly
   they worshipped, they worship and confess as Christ and God Him Whom
   they used to ridicule as crucified. Their so-called gods are routed by
   the sign of the cross, and the crucified Savior is proclaimed in all
   the world as God and Son of God. Moreover, the gods worshipped among
   the Greeks are now falling into disrepute among them on account of the
   disgraceful things they did, for those who receive the teaching of
   Christ are more chaste in life than they. If these, and the like of
   them, are human works, let anyone who will show us similar ones done by
   men in former time, and so convince us. But if they are shown to be,
   and are the works not of men but of God, why are the unbelievers so
   irreligious as not to recognize the Master Who did them? They are
   afflicted as a man would be who failed to recognize God the Artificer
   through the works of creation. For surely if they had recognized His
   Godhead through His power over the universe, they would recognize also
   that the bodily works of Christ are not human, but are those of the
   Savior of all, the Word of God. And had they recognized this, as Paul
   says, "They would not have crucified the Lord of glory." [67]

   (54) As, then, he who desires to see God Who by nature is invisible and
   not to be beheld, may yet perceive and know Him through His works, so
   too let him who does not see Christ with his understanding at least
   consider Him in His bodily works and test whether they be of man or
   God. If they be of man, then let him scoff; but if they be of God, let
   him not mock at things which are no fit subject for scorn, but rather
   let him recognize the fact and marvel that things divine have been
   revealed to us by such humble means, that through death deathlessness
   has been made known to us, and through the Incarnation of the Word the
   Mind whence all things proceed has been declared, and its Agent and
   Ordainer, the Word of God Himself. He, indeed, assumed humanity that we
   might become God. He manifested Himself by means of a body in order
   that we might perceive the Mind of the unseen Father. He endured shame
   from men that we might inherit immortality. He Himself was unhurt by
   this, for He is impassable and incorruptible; but by His own
   impassability He kept and healed the suffering men on whose account He
   thus endured. In short, such and so many are the Savior's achievements
   that follow from His Incarnation, that to try to number them is like
   gazing at the open sea and trying to count the waves. One cannot see
   all the waves with one's eyes, for when one tries to do so those that
   are following on baffle one's senses. Even so, when one wants to take
   in all the achievements of Christ in the body, one cannot do so, even
   by reckoning them up, for the things that transcend one's thought are
   always more than those one thinks that one has grasped.

   As we cannot speak adequately about even a part of His work, therefore,
   it will be better for us not to speak about it as a whole. So we will
   mention but one thing more, and then leave the whole for you to marvel
   at. For, indeed, everything about it is marvelous, and wherever a man
   turns his gaze he sees the Godhead of the Word and is smitten with awe.

   (55) The substance of what we have said so far may be summarized as
   follows. Since the Savior came to dwell among us, not only does
   idolatry no longer increase, but it is getting less and gradually
   ceasing to be. Similarly, not only does the wisdom of the Greeks no
   longer make any progress, but that which used to be is disappearing.
   And demons, so far from continuing to impose on people by their deceits
   and oracle-givings and sorceries, are routed by the sign of the cross
   if they so much as try. On the other hand, while idolatry and
   everything else that opposes the faith of Christ is daily dwindling and
   weakening and falling, see, the Savior's teaching is increasing
   everywhere! Worship, then, the Savior "Who is above all" and mighty,
   even God the Word, and condemn those who are being defeated and made to
   disappear by Him. When the sun has come, darkness prevails no longer;
   any of it that may be left anywhere is driven away. So also, now that
   the Divine epiphany of the Word of God has taken place, the darkness of
   idols prevails no more, and all parts of the world in every direction
   are enlightened by His teaching. Similarly, if a king be reigning
   somewhere, but stays in his own house and does not let himself be seen,
   it often happens that some insubordinate fellows, taking advantage of
   his retirement, will have themselves proclaimed in his stead; and each
   of them, being invested with the semblance of kingship, misleads the
   simple who, because they cannot enter the palace and see the real king,
   are led astray by just hearing a king named. When the real king
   emerges, however, and appears to view, things stand differently. The
   insubordinate impostors are shown up by his presence, and men, seeing
   the real king, forsake those who previously misled them. In the same
   way the demons used formerly to impose on men, investing themselves
   with the honor due to God. But since the Word of God has been
   manifested in a body, and has made known to us His own Father, the
   fraud of the demons is stopped and made to disappear; and men, turning
   their eyes to the true God, Word of the Father, forsake the idols and
   come to know the true God.

   Now this is proof that Christ is God, the Word and Power of God. For
   whereas human things cease and the fact of Christ remains, it is clear
   to all that the things which cease are temporary, but that He Who
   remains is God and very Son of God, the sole-begotten Word.

   Conclusion

   (56) Here, then, Macarius, is our offering to you who love Christ, a
   brief statement of the faith of Christ and of the manifestation of His
   Godhead to us. This will give you a beginning, and you must go on to
   prove its truth by the study of the Scriptures. They were written and
   inspired by God; and we, who have learned from inspired teachers who
   read the Scriptures and became martyrs for the Godhead of Christ, make
   further contribution to your eagerness to learn. From the Scriptures
   you will learn also of His second manifestation to us, glorious and
   divine indeed, when He shall come not in lowliness but in His proper
   glory, no longer in humiliation but in majesty, no longer to suffer but
   to bestow on us all the fruit of His cross--the resurrection and
   incorruptibility. No longer will He then be judged, but rather will
   Himself be Judge, judging each and all according to their deeds done in
   the body, whether good or ill. Then for the good is laid up the
   heavenly kingdom, but for those that practice evil outer darkness and
   the eternal fire. So also the Lord Himself says, "I say unto you,
   hereafter ye shall see the Son of Man seated on the right hand of
   power, coming on the clouds of heaven in the glory of the Father." [68]
   For that Day we have one of His own sayings to prepare us, "Get ready
   and watch, for ye know not the hour in which He cometh" [69] And
   blessed Paul says, "We must all stand before the judgment seat of
   Christ, that each one may receive according as he practiced in the
   body, whether good or ill." [70]

   (57) But for the searching and right understanding of the Scriptures
   there is need of a good life and a pure soul, and for Christian virtue
   to guide the mind to grasp, so far as human nature can, the truth
   concerning God the Word. One cannot possibly understand the teaching of
   the saints unless one has a pure mind and is trying to imitate their
   life. Anyone who wants to look at sunlight naturally wipes his eye
   clear first, in order to make, at any rate, some approximation to the
   purity of that on which he looks; and a person wishing to see a city or
   country goes to the place in order to do so. Similarly, anyone who
   wishes to understand the mind of the sacred writers must first cleanse
   his own life, and approach the saints by copying their deeds. Thus
   united to them in the fellowship of life, he will both understand the
   things revealed to them by God and, thenceforth escaping the peril that
   threatens sinners in the judgment, will receive that which is laid up
   for the saints in the kingdom of heaven. Of that reward it is written:
   "Eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart
   of man the things that God has prepared" [71] for them that live a
   godly life and love the God and Father in Christ Jesus our Lord,
   through Whom and with Whom be to the Father Himself, with the Son
   Himself, in the Holy Spirit, honor and might and glory to ages of ages.
   Amen.
