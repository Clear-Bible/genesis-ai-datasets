   [1439]In truth my sacrifice is nothing worth,
   [1440]In what the world calls weakness lurks
   [1441]In wrathful pride they rage and mock
   [1442]Incline a gracious ear to me
   [1443]Innumerous choirs before the shining throne
   [1444]Innumerous choirs before the shining throne
   [1445]Into temptation lead us not
   [1446]Is my foolish mind
   [1447]Is there an act our reason would applaud?
   [1448]Is thy heart athirst to know
   [1449]Is thy heart athirst to know
   [1450]It is the Dayspring from on high
   [1451]It lacketh now a few short hours
   [1452]It seems as all were over now,--
   [1453]It seems as all were over now,--
   [1454]It stands not in the power of man
   [1455]It was a wondrous war, I trow
   [1456]It will not last for long
