Prefatory note.

   It deserves attention that this pamphlet, with its humble title, "A
   Discourse concerning Liturgies," etc., and printed anonymously in 1662,
   contains the judgment of our author in regard to measures which gave
   rise to most important events in the ecclesiastical history of England.
   It is an argument against the liturgy, the imposition of which obliged
   nearly two thousand clergy of the Church of England to resign their
   livings rather than sacrifice a good conscience.

   On the Restoration, the Book of Common Prayer had been resumed in the
   royal chapel at Whitehall; it was ordained to be read in the House of
   Peers; and before the year closed, some of the parochial clergy, who
   scrupled to use it, were prosecuted according to the laws in force
   before the civil war.

   As many leading Presbyterians, however, had been favourable to the
   Restoration, the Court could not afford at first to come to an open
   rupture with them, and accordingly, in 1661, a conference was appointed
   between twelve bishops and an equal number of Presbyterian ministers,
   with instructions to revise the Book of Common Prayer, so as to bring
   it into conformity with the religious convictions of both parties, and
   establish peace and unity in the church. This conference, however,
   after long and keen debate, broke up without any good results.

   The Convocation was then ordered to revise the liturgy. The changes
   made on it were not such as to relieve the consciences of the
   Presbyterians; but, nevertheless, as revised by the Convocation, it was
   adopted by Parliament, and ratified by the Act for Uniformity in the
   Prayers and Ceremonies of the Church of England. This act, designed,
   according to Burnet, to make the terms of conformity stricter than
   before, passed the House of Commons by a majority of 186 to 180, The
   House of Lords endeavoured to abate the stringency of some of its
   provisions, but, supported by the Court, the majority in the Lower
   House effectually resisted the modifications proposed. The bill passed
   the House of Peers by a small majority, and received the royal assent
   on 19th May 1662. The act required all ministers to announce publicly
   their adherence to the liturgy, and to subscribe a declaration that it
   was unlawful, upon any pretence, to take arms against the king, or to
   endeavour any change in the government of church or state. No person,
   moreover, according to the act, could hold a benefice or administer the
   Lord's supper unless he was episcopally ordained. Fines, imprisonment,
   and the forfeiture of their livings, were the penalties to be inflicted
   on those who could not yield compliance with the law. The act took
   effect on the 24th of August, and nearly two thousand devout and
   faithful pastors were then expelled from the Church of England.

   The chief merit of the following tract can only be understood in the
   light of these exciting events. From some expressions in it, it must
   have been written while the contest prevailed, and before the liturgy
   was actually imposed; and yet the whole argument is conducted in
   perfect temper, and the readers of Owen might fail to bear in mind that
   he is discussing a question which was stirring English society to its
   depths, and involved consequences unparalleled in English history. The
   treatise has all the weight and gravity of a judicial decision. The
   author, rising above petty details, expends his strength in proof that
   the imposition of a liturgy by civil enactment is an interference with
   the authority of Christ; and, unwilling to heighten the asperities of
   the prevailing controversy, he excludes from discussion the character
   of the English liturgy, and confines himself to the abstract question,
   as to the lawfulness of enforcing it on the conscience as essential to
   divine worship. It is the more honourable to Owen that he should have
   exerted himself against the imposition of the liturgy, when it is
   remembered that as at this time he held no living in the church, he
   could not suffer under the Act of Uniformity, and the measures of the
   Court were directed against the Presbyterians rather than the
   Independents. Orme remarks of this production and its subject, "The
   principle which these forms of human composition involve is of vast
   importance; and I know not where, in so small a compass, this principle
   is so well stated and so ably opposed as in this work." -- Ed.

   concerning

   liturgies, and their imposition.

Chapter I.

   The state of the Judaical church -- The liberty given by Christ; 1.
   From the arbitrary impositions of men; 2. From the observances and
   rites instituted by Moses -- The continuance of their observation, in
   the patience and forbearance of God -- Difference about them stated --
   Legal righteousness and legal ceremonies contended for together -- The
   reason of it.

   Although our present inquiry be merely after one part of instituted
   worship under the gospel, and the due performance of it according to
   the mind of God, yet, there being a communication of some light to be
   obtained from the turning over of that worship from the Mosaical to the
   care and practice of the evangelical church, we shall look a little
   back unto it as therein stated; hoping thereby to make way for our
   clearer progress. What was the state of the church of God amongst the
   Jews as to instituted worship, when our blessed Saviour came to make
   the last and perfect discovery of his mind and will, is manifest both
   from the appointment of that worship in the law of Moses, and the
   practice of it remarked in the gospel. That the rites and ordinances of
   the worship in the church observed, were from the original in their
   nature carnal, and for the number many, on both accounts burdensome and
   grievous to the worshippers, the Scripture frequently declares.
   Howbeit, the teachers and rulers of the church, being grown wholly
   carnal in their spirits, and placing their only glory in their yoke,
   not being able to see to the end of the things that were to be done
   away, had increased those institutions, both in number and weight, with
   sundry inventions of their own; which, by their authority, they made
   necessary to be observed by their disciples. In an equal practice of
   these divine institutions and human inventions did our Lord Jesus
   Christ find the generality of the church at his coming in the flesh.
   The former, being to continue in force until the time of reformation,
   at his resurrection from the dead, should come, both by his practice
   and his teaching, as a minister of Circumcision, he confirmed and
   pressed frequently on the consciences of men, from the authority of the
   Law-maker. The latter he utterly rejected, as introduced in a high
   derogation from the perfection of the law, and the honour of Him whose
   prerogative it is to be the sole lawgiver of his church, -- the only
   fountain and disposer of his own worship. And this was the first
   dawning of liberty that, with the rising of this Day-star, did appear
   to the burdened and languishing consciences of men. He freed them, by
   his teaching, from the bondage of Pharisaical, arbitrary impositions,
   delivering their consciences from subjection to any thing in the
   worship of God but his own immediate authority. For it may not be
   supposed that, when he recommended unto his hearers an attendance unto
   the teaching of the scribes and Pharisees, with an injunction to obey
   their directions, that he intended aught but those commands which they
   gave from Him, and according to his mind, whose fear they did outwardly
   profess; seeing that, both in general and particular, he did himself
   condemn their traditions and impositions, giving out a rule of liberty
   from them unto others in his own constant practice. Yea, and whereas he
   would do civil things in their own nature indifferent, whereunto he was
   by no righteous law obliged, to avoid the offence of any which he saw
   might follow, Matt. xvii. 27, yet would he not practise or give
   countenance unto, nay, nor abstain from condemning of, any of their
   ecclesiastical self-invented observances, though he saw them offended
   and scandalized at him, and was by others informed no less, chap. xv.
   12-14; confirming his practice with that standing rule concerning all
   things relating to the worship of God, "Every plant which my heavenly
   Father hath not planted shall be rooted up." But he is yet farther to
   carry on the work of giving liberty to all the disciples, that he might
   take them into a subjection to himself and his own authority only. The
   Aaronical priesthood being the hinge on which the whole ceremonial
   worship turned, so that upon a change thereof the obligation of the law
   unto that worship, or any part of it, was necessarily to cease, our
   blessed Saviour, in his death and oblation, entering upon the office,
   and actually discharging the great duty of his priesthood, did
   virtually put an end to the whole obligation of the first institution
   of Mosaical worship. In his death was the procurement of the liberty of
   his disciples completely finished, as unto conscience; the supposed
   obligation of men's traditions, and the real obligation of Mosaical
   institutions, being by him (the first as a prophet in his teaching, the
   last as a priest in his offering) dissolved and taken away. From that
   day all the disciples of Christ were taken under his immediate
   lordship, and made free to the end of the from all obligations in
   conscience unto any thing in the worship of God but what is of his own
   institution and command.

   This dissolution of the obligation of "the law of commandments
   contained in ordinances," being declared by his apostles and disciples,
   became a matter of great difference and debate amongst the Jews, to
   whom the gospel was first preached. Those who before had slain him, in
   pursuit of their own charge, that he would bring in such an alteration
   in the worship of God as was now divulged, were many of them
   exceedingly enraged at this new doctrine, and had their prejudices
   against him and his way much increased, -- hating indeed the light,
   because their deeds were evil. These being obstinately bent to seek
   after righteousness (as it were, at least) by the works of the law,
   contended for their ceremonial works as one of the best stakes in their
   hedge, in whose observance they placed their chiefest confidence of
   their acceptance with God. But this is not all: many who, falling under
   powerful convictions of his doctrine and miracles, believed on him did
   yet pertinaciously adhere to their old ceremonial worship. Partly for
   want of clear light and understanding in the doctrine of the person and
   office of the Messiah; partly through the power of unspeakable
   prejudices which influenced their minds in reference to those rites
   which, being from of old observed by their forefathers, derived their
   original from God himself (much the most noble pleas and pretences that
   ever any of the sons of men had to insist upon for a subjection to such
   a yoke as indeed had lost all power to oblige them); they were very
   desirous to mix the observance of them with obedience unto those
   institutions which they, through the Lord Jesus, had superadded to
   them.

   Things being thus stated amongst the Jews, God having a great work to
   accomplish among and upon them in a short time, would not have the
   effect of it turn upon this hinge merely; and therefore, in his
   infinite wisdom and condescension, waived the whole contest for a
   season. For whereas, within the space of forty years or thereabout, he
   was to call and gather out from the body, by the preaching gospel, his
   remnant according to the election of grace, and to leave the rest
   inexcusable, -- thereby visibly glorifying his justice in their
   temporal and eternal ruin, -- it pleased him, in a way of connivance
   and forbearance, to continue unto that people an allowance of the
   observation of their old worship until the time appointed for its utter
   removal and actual casting away should come. Though the original
   obligation on conscience, from the first institution of their
   ceremonies, was taken away, yet hence arose a new necessity of the
   observation of them, even in them who were acquainted with the
   dissolution of that obligation, -- namely, from the offence and scandal
   of them to whom their observance was providentially indulged. On this
   account the disciples of Christ (and the apostles themselves) continued
   in a promiscuous observation of Mosaical institutions with the rest of
   the body of that people, until the appointed season of the utter
   rejection and destruction of the apostate churches was come. Hence many
   of the ancients affirm that James the Less, living at Jerusalem in
   great reputation with all the people for his sanctity and
   righteousness, was not, to the very time of his martyrdom, known to be
   a Christian; which had been utterly impossible had he totally abstained
   from communion with them in legal worship. Neither had that old
   controversy about the feast of the passover any other rise or spring
   than the mistake of some, who thought John had observed it as a
   Christian, who kept it only as a Judaical feast among the Jews: whence
   the tradition ran strong that he observed it with them on the
   fourteenth day of the month; which precise time others, turning it into
   a Christian observation, thought meet to lay aside.

   Things being thus stated, in the connivance and forbearance of God,
   among the Jews, some of them, not contented to use the indulgence,
   granted to them in mere patience, for the ends before mentioned, began
   sedulously to urge the Mosaical rites upon all the Gentiles that were
   turned unto God; so making, upon the matter, the preaching of the
   gospel to be but a new way of proselyting men unto Judaism. For the
   most part, it appears that it was not any mistake or unacquaintedness
   with the liberty brought in by Christ that made them engage in this
   quarrel for Moses; but that indeed, being themselves carnal, and,
   notwithstanding the outward name of Christ, seeking yet for
   righteousness by the law, they esteemed the observation of the
   ceremonies indispensably necessary unto salvation. This gave occasion
   unto Paul, unto whom the apostleship of the Gentiles was in a special
   manner committed, to lay open the whole mystery of that liberty given
   by Christ to his disciples from the law of Moses; as also the
   pernicious effects which its observance would produce, upon those
   principles which were pressed by the Judaical zealots. Passing by the
   peculiar dispensation of God towards the whole nation of the Jews,
   wherein the Gentile believers were not concerned; as also that
   determination of the case of scandal made at Jerusalem, Acts xv., and
   the temporary rule of condescension as to the abridgment of liberty in
   some particulars agreed unto thereupon; he fully declares that the time
   of the appointment was come, that there was no more power in the law of
   their institutions to bind the consciences of men, and that it was not
   in the power of all the men in the world to impose the observation of
   them, or any like unto them, upon anyone, though the meanest of the
   disciples of Jesus Christ. The mind of Christ in this matter being
   fully made known, and the liberty of his disciples vindicated, various
   effects in the minds of men ensued thereupon. Those who were in their
   inward principle themselves carnal, notwithstanding their outward
   profession of the gospel, delighting in and resting on an outward
   ceremonious worship, continued to oppose him with violence and fury.
   Those who with the profession of the Lord Christ had also received the
   Spirit of Christ, and were by him instructed, as in the perfection of
   righteousness, so in the beauty and excellency of the worship of the
   gospel, rejoiced greatly in the grace and privilege of the purchased
   liberty. After many contests, this controversy was buried in the ruins
   of the city and temple, when the main occasion was utterly taken away.

   By these degrees were the disciples of Christ put into a complete
   actual possession of that liberty which he had preached to them, and
   purchased for them. Being first delivered from any conscientious
   subjection to the institutions of men, and then to the temporary
   institutions of God which concerned them not, they were left in a
   dependence on and subjection unto himself alone, as to all things
   concerning worship; in which state he will assuredly continue and
   preserve them to the end of the world, under the guidance and direction
   of those rules for the use of their liberty which he has left in his
   word. But yet the principle of the difference before mentioned, which
   is fixed in the minds of men by nature, did not die together with the
   controversy that mainly issued from it. We may trace it effectually
   exerting itself in succeeding ages. As ignorance of the righteousness
   of God, with a desire to establish their own, did in any take place, so
   also did endeavours after an outward, ceremonious worship: for these
   things do mutually further and strengthen each other; and commonly
   proportionable unto men's darkness in the mystery of the righteousness
   of God in Christ is their zeal for a worldly sanctuary and carnal
   ordinances. And such hath been the force and efficacy of these combined
   principles in the minds of carnal men, that, under the profession of
   Christianity, they reduced things (in the Papacy) to the very state and
   condition wherein they were in Judaism at the time of reformation; the
   main principle in the one and the other church, in the apostasy, being
   righteousness and an insupportable yoke of ceremonious observances in
   the worship of God. And generally, in others the same principles of
   legal righteousness and a ceremonious worship have prevalency in a just
   proportion, the latter being regulated by the former; and where by any
   means the former is everted, the latter for the most part falls of its
   own accord; yea, though riveted in the minds of men by other prejudices
   also. Hence when the soul of a sinner is effectually wrought upon, by
   the preaching of the gospel, to renounce himself and his own
   righteousness, and, being truly humbled for sin, to receive the Lord
   Christ by faith, as "made unto him of God wisdom, righteousness,
   sanctification, and redemption," there needs, for the most part, little
   arguing to dissuade him from resting in or laying weight upon an
   outside, pompous worship; but he is immediately sensible of a delivery
   from its yoke, which he freely embraceth. And the reason hereof is,
   because that good Spirit by whom he is enabled to believe and receive
   the Lord Jesus Christ, gives him also an acquaintance with, and an
   experience of, the excellency, glory, and beauty of that spiritual
   communion with God in Christ whereunto believers are called in the
   gospel; which discovers the emptiness and uselessness of all which
   before, perhaps, he admired and delighted in: for "where the Spirit of
   Christ is, there is liberty." And these things, -- of seeking a
   righteousness in Christ alone, and delighting in spiritual communion
   with God, exercising itself only in the ways of his own appointment, --
   do inseparably proceed from the same Spirit of Christ, as those before
   mentioned from the same principle of self and flesh.

Chapter II.

   The disciples of Christ taken into his own disposal -- General things
   to be observed about gospel institutions -- Their number small --
   Excess of men's inventions -- Things instituted brought into a
   religious relation by the authority of Christ -- That authority is none
   other -- Suitableness in the matter of institutions, to be designed to
   their proper significancy -- That discoverable only by infinite wisdom
   -- Abilities given by Christ for the administration of all his
   institutions -- The way whereby it was done, Eph. iv. 7, 8 -- Several
   postulata laid down -- The sum of the whole -- State of our question in
   general.

   We have brought unto and left the disciples of Jesus Christ in the hand
   and sole disposal of him, their Lord and Master, as to all things which
   concern the worship of God; and how he hath disposed of them we are in
   the next place to consider. Now, he being the Head, Lord, and only
   Lawgiver of his church, coming from the bosom of his Father to make the
   last revelation of his mind and will, was to determine and appoint that
   worship of God in and by himself which was to continue to the end of
   the world. It belongeth not unto our purpose to consider distinctly and
   apart all the several institutions which by him were ordained. We shall
   only observe some things concerning them in general, that will be of
   use in our progress, and so proceed to the consideration of that
   particular about which we are in disquisition of his mind and will. The
   worship of God is either moral and internal, or external and of
   sovereign or arbitrary institution. The former we do not now consider;
   nor was the ancient, original, fundamental obligation unto it altered
   or dissolved in the least by the Lord Christ. It was as unto superadded
   institutions of outward worship, which have their foundation and reason
   in sovereign will and pleasure, that he took his disciples into his own
   disposal, discharging them from all obligations to aught else whatever
   but only what he should appoint. Concerning these, some few
   considerations will lead us to what in this discourse we principally
   intend. And the first is, That they were few, and easy to be observed.
   It was his will and pleasure that the faith and love of his disciples
   should, in some few instances, be exercised in a willing, ready
   subjection to the impositions of his wisdom and authority; and their
   service herein he doth fully recompense, by rendering those his
   institutions blessedly useful to their spiritual advantage. But he
   would not burden them with observances, either for nature or number,
   like or comparable unto them from which he purchased liberty. And
   herein hath the practice of succeeding ages put an excellent lustre
   upon his love and tenderness. For whereas he is the Lord of his church,
   to whom the consciences of his disciples are in an unquestionable
   subjection, and who can give power and efficacy to his institutions to
   make them useful to their souls, yet some of their fellow-servants
   came, I know not how, to apprehend themselves enabled to impose
   arbitrarily their appointments, reasons seeming good to their wisdom,
   they might have been considered moderate if they had not given above
   ten commandments for his one. Bellarmine tells us, indeed, that the
   laws and institutions of the church that absolutely bind all
   Christians, so that they omit their observation, are upon the matter
   but four, -- namely, to observe the fasts of Lent and Ember-weeks, to
   keep the holy days, confession once a year, and to communicate at
   Easter, De Rom. Pontif., lib. iv. cap. 18. But whereas they double the
   number of the sacred ceremonies instituted by Christ, and have every
   one of them a greater number of subservient observations attending on
   them, so he must be a stranger to their councils, canon-laws, and
   practices, that can believe his insinuation.

   Again: as the institutions and ordinances of Christ in the outward
   worship of God, whose sole foundation was in his will and pleasure,
   were few, and easy to be observed, being brought into a relation of
   worship unto God by virtue of his institution and command, without
   which no one thing in their kind can do so more than another; so they
   were, for the matter of them, such as he knew had an aptness to be
   serviceable unto the significancy whereunto they were appointed by him,
   which nothing but infinite wisdom can judge of. And this eternally
   severs them from all things of men's invention, either to the same
   purpose, or in the same way to be used. For as whatever they shall
   appoint in the worship of God can have no significancy at all, as unto
   any spiritual end, for want of a Christ-like authority in their
   institution, which alone can add that significancy to them which in
   themselves, without such an appointment, they have not; so they
   themselves, want wisdom to choose the things which have any fitness or
   aptitude to be used for that end, if the authority were sufficient to
   introduce with them such a significancy. There is nothing they can in
   this kind fix upon, but as good reason as any they are able to tender,
   for the proof of their expedience unto the end proposed to them, will
   be produced to prove them meet for a quite other signification and
   purpose, and the contrary unto them, at least things diverse to them,
   be asserted with as fair pretences, as meet to be used in their place
   and room.

   But that which we principally shall observe, in and about Christ's
   institutions of gospel worship, is the provision that he made for the
   administration of it acceptably unto God. It is of the instituted
   worship of his public assemblies that we treat. The chiefest acts and
   parts thereof may be referred to these three heads:-- preaching of the
   word, administration of the sacraments, and the exercise of discipline;
   all to be performed with prayer and thanksgiving. The rule for the
   administration of these things, so far as they are purely of his
   institution, he gave his disciples in his appointment of them. Persons,
   also, he designed to the regular administration of these his holy
   things in the assemblies of his saints, -- namely, pastors and
   teachers, -- to endure to the end of the world, after those of an
   extraordinary employment under him were to cease. It remaineth, then,
   to consider how the persons appointed by him unto the administration of
   these holy things in his assemblies, and so to the discharge of the
   whole public worship of God, should be enabled thereunto, so as the end
   by him aimed at, of the edification of his disciples and the glory of
   God, might be attained. Two ways there are whereby this may be done:
   First, By such spiritual abilities for the discharge and performance of
   this whole work as will answer the mind of Christ therein, and so serve
   for the end proposed. Secondly, By the prescription of a form of words,
   whose reading and pronunciation in these administrations should
   outwardly serve as to all the ends of the prayer and thanksgiving
   required in them, which they do contain. It is evident that our Saviour
   fixed on the former way; what he hath done as to the latter, or what
   his mind is concerning it, we shall afterward inquire.

   For the first, as in many other places, so signally in one, the apostle
   acquaints us with the course he has taken, and the provision that he
   hath made -- namely, Eph. iv. 7, 8, 11-13: "Unto every one of us is
   given grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore
   he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and
   gave gifts unto men. And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets;
   some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting
   of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the
   body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the
   knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of
   the stature of the fulness of Christ," etc. The thing aimed at is, the
   bringing of all the saints and disciples of Christ, the whole church,
   to that measure and perfection of grace which Christ hath assigned to
   them in this world, that may be meet for himself to receive in glory.
   The means whereby this is to be done and effected is, the faithful and
   regular discharge of the work of the ministry; unto which the
   administration of all his ordinances and institutions doth confessedly
   belong. That this work may be discharged in an orderly manner to the
   end mentioned, he has granted unto his church the offices mentioned, to
   be executed by persons variously called thereunto, according to his
   mind and will.

   The only inquiry remaining is, how these persons shall be enabled for
   the discharge of their office, and so accomplishment of the work of the
   ministry? This, he declares, is by the communication of grace and
   spiritual gifts from heaven unto them by Christ himself. Here lieth the
   spring of all that followeth, -- the care hereof he hath taken upon
   himself unto the end of the world. He that enabled the shoulders of the
   Levites to bear the ark of old, and their arms to slay the sacrifices,
   without which natural strength those carnal ordinances could not have
   been observed (nor was the ark to be carried for a supply of defect of
   ability in the Levites), hath, upon their removal, and the institution
   of the spiritual worship of the gospel, undertaken to supply the
   administrators of it with spiritual strength and abilities for the
   discharge of their work, allowing them supply of the defect of which he
   hath taken upon himself to perform. I suppose, then, these ensuing will
   seem but reasonable postulata:--

   1. That the means which Jesus Christ hath appointed for the attaining
   of any end, is every way sufficient for that purpose whereunto it is so
   appointed. His wisdom exacts our consent to this proposition.

   2. That what he hath taken upon himself to perform unto the end of the
   world, and promised so to do, that he will accomplish accordingly. Here
   his faithfulness requires our assent.

   3. That the communication of spiritual gifts and graces to the
   ministers of the gospel, is the provision that Christ hath made for the
   discharge of the work of their ministry, unto the edification of his
   body. This lies plain in the text.

   4. That the exercise and use of those gifts, in all those
   administrations for which they are bestowed, are expected and required
   by him. The nature of the thing itself, with innumerable testimonies,
   confirm this truth also.

   5. That it is derogatory to the glory, honour, and faithfulness of the
   Lord Jesus Christ, to affirm that he ceaseth to bestow gifts for the
   work of the ministry, whilst he continueth and requireth the exercise
   and discharge of that work. What hath befallen men, or doth yet befall
   them, through the wretched sloth, darkness, and unbelief, which their
   wilful neglect of dependence on him, or of stirring up or improving of
   what they do receive from him, and the mischiefs that have accrued to
   the church by the intrusion of such persons into the place and office
   of the ministry as were never called nor appointed by him thereunto,
   are not to be imputed unto any failing on his part, in his promise of
   dispensing the gifts mentioned to the end of the world. Of which
   several positions we shall have some use in our farther progress.

   Our Lord Jesus Christ, then, having delivered his disciples from the
   yoke of Mosaical institutions, which lay upon them from of old; as also
   from being entangled in their consciences by or from any inventions of
   men imposed on them; giving them rules for the practice of the liberty
   whereunto by him they were vindicated, taking them for the future into
   his own sole disposal in all things concerning the worship of God, he
   appoints, in his sovereign authority, both the ordinances which he will
   have alone observed in his church, and the persons by whom they are to
   be administered; [and] furnishing them with spiritual abilities to that
   end and purpose, promising his presence with them to the end of the
   world, commands them to set such, in his name and strength, in the way
   and unto the work that he hath allotted to them.

   That, now, which on this foundation we are farther to inquire into is,
   whether, over and above what we have recounted, our Saviour hath
   appointed, or by any ways given allowance unto, the framing of a
   stinted form of prayers and praises, to be read and used by the
   administrators of his ordinances in their administration of them? or
   whether the prescription and imposing of such a form or liturgy upon
   those who minister in the church, in the name and authority of Christ,
   be not contrary to his mind, and cross to his whole design for
   perpetuating of his institutions to the end of the world, in due order
   and manner? And this we shall do, and withal discover the rise and
   progress which such liturgies have had and made in the church of God.

Chapter III.

   Of the Lord's prayer, and what may be concluded from thence as to the
   invention and imposition of liturgies in the public worship of God --
   The liberty whereunto Christ vindicated and wherein he left his
   disciples.

   The first plea used to give countenance unto the composing and imposing
   of liturgies is taken from that act of our Saviour himself, who, upon
   the request of his disciples, composed for them a form of prayer;
   which, being recorded in the gospel, is said to have the force of an
   institution, rendering the observation or use of that form a necessary
   duty unto all believers to the end of the world. And this plea is
   strengthened by a discovery which some learned men say they have made,
   -- namely, that our blessed Saviour composed this form, which he
   delivered to his disciples, out of such other forms as were then in
   ordinary use among the Jews; whereby, they say, he confirmed that
   practice of prescribing forms of prayer among them, and recommended the
   same course of proceeding, by his so doing, unto his disciples. Now,
   though it be very hard to discover how, upon a supposition that all
   which is thus suggested is the very truth, any thing can be hence
   concluded to the justification of the practice of imposing liturgies,
   now inquired into; yet, that there may be no pretence left unto a plea,
   though never so weak and infirm, of such an extract as this lays claim
   unto, it will be necessary to consider the severals of it. It is
   generally apprehended that our Saviour, in his prescription of that
   form of prayer unto his disciples, did aim at two things:-- 1. That
   they might have a summary symbol of all the most excellent things they
   were to ask of God in his name, and so a rule of squaring all their
   desires and supplications by. This end all universally concur in; and
   therefore Matthew, considering the doctrinal nature of it, gives it a
   place in the first recorded sermon of our Saviour, by way of
   anticipation, and mentions it not when he comes to the time wherein it
   was really first delivered by him. 2. For their benefit and advantage,
   together with other intercessions that they should also use the
   repetition of those words, as a prescript form wherein he had comprised
   the matter of their requests and petitions. About this latter all men
   are not agreed in their judgments, whether indeed our Saviour had this
   aim in it or no. Many learned men suppose that it was a supply of a
   rule and standard of things to be prayed for, without prescribing to
   them the use or rehearsal of that form of words, that he aimed at. Of
   this number are Musculus, Grotius, and Cornelius à Lapide, with many
   others; but it may suffice to intimate, that some of all sorts are so
   minded. But we shall not, in the case in hand, make use of any
   principle so far obnoxious unto common prejudice as experience proves
   that opinion of these learned men to be. Let it, therefore, be taken
   for granted that our Saviour did command that form to be repeated by
   his disciples, and let us then consider what will regularly ensue
   thereupon. Our Saviour at that time was minister of the Circumcision,
   and taught the doctrine of the gospel under and with the observation of
   all the worship of the Judaical church. He was not yet glorified, and
   so the Spirit was not as yet given; I mean that Spirit which he
   promised unto his disciples to enable them to perform all the worship
   of God by him required at their hands, whereof we have before spoken.
   That, then, which the Lord Jesus prescribed unto his disciples, for
   their present practice in the worship of God, seems to have belonged
   unto the economy of the Old Testament. Now, to argue from the
   prescription of, and outward helps for, the performance of the worship
   of God under the Old Testament, unto a necessity of the like or the
   same under the New, is upon the matter to deny that Christ is ascended
   on high, and to have given spiritual gifts unto men eminently distinct
   from and above those given out by him under the Judaical pedagogy.
   However, their boldness seems unwarrantable, if not intolerable, who,
   to serve their own ends, upon this prescription of his, do affirm that
   our Lord Jesus composed this form out of such as were then in common
   use among the Jews. For as the proof of their assertion which they
   insist on, -- namely, the finding of some of the things expressed in
   it, or petitions of it, in the writings of the Jews, the eldest whereof
   is some hundreds of years younger than this prayer itself, -- is most
   weak and contemptible; so the affirmation itself is exceeding
   derogatory to the glory and honour of his wisdom, assigning unto him a
   work so unnecessary and trivial as would scarce become a man of
   ordinary prudence and authority. But yet, to carry on the work in hand,
   let it be supposed that our Saviour did command that form of prayer out
   of such as were then customarily used among the Jews (which is false,
   and asserted without any colour of proof); also, that he prescribed it
   as a form to be repeated by his disciples (which we have shown many
   very eminently learned men to deny); and that, though he prescribed it
   as a minister to the Judaical church, and to his disciples whilst
   members of that church, under the economy of the Old Testament, not
   having as yet received the Spirit and gifts of the New, yet that he did
   it for the use and observance of his disciples to the end of the world,
   and that not as to the objective regulation of their prayers, but as to
   the repetition of the words; yet it doth not appear how, from all these
   concessions, any argument can be drawn to the composition and
   imposition of liturgies, whose rise and nature we are inquiring after:
   for it is certain that our Saviour gives this direction for the end
   which he intends in it, not primarily as to the public worship of the
   assemblies of his disciples, but as to the guidance of every individual
   saint in his private devotion, Matt. vi. 6-8. Now, from a direction
   given unto private persons, as to their private deportment in the
   discharge of any religious duty, to argue unto a prescription of the
   whole worship of God in public assemblies is not safe. But, that we may
   hear the argument drawn from this act of our Saviour speak out all that
   it hath to offer, let us add this also to the fore-mentioned
   presumptions that our Saviour hath appointed and ordained, that in the
   assemblies of his disciples, in his worship by him required, they who
   administer in his name in and to the church should repeat the words of
   this prayer, though not peculiarly suited to any one of his
   institutions: what will thence be construed to ensue? Why, then, it is
   supposed that this will follow, -- That it is not only lawful, but the
   duty of some men to compose other forms, a hundred times as many,
   suited in their judgment to the due administration of all ordinances of
   worship is particular, imposing them on the evangelical administrations
   of those ordinances to be read by them, with a severe interdiction of
   the use of any other prayers in those administrations. Bellarmine, De
   Pont. Rom., lib. iv. cap. 16, argues for the necessity of the
   observation of rites indifferent, when once commanded by the church,
   from the necessity of the observation of baptism, in itself a thing
   indifferent, after it was commanded by Christ. Some think not to
   dispute, but blaspheme. Nor is the inference before mentioned of any
   other complexion. When it shall be made to appear, that whatever it was
   lawful for the Lord Christ to do and to prescribe to his church and
   disciples, in reference to the worship of God, the same, or any thing
   of the like nature, it is lawful for men to do, under the pretence of
   their being invested with the authority of the church, or any else
   whatever, then some colour will be given to this argument; which being
   raised on the tottering suppositions before mentioned, ends in that
   which seems to deserve a harder name than at present we shall affix to
   it.

   And this is the state and condition wherein the disciples of Christ
   were left by himself, without the least intimation of any other
   impositions in the worship of God to be laid upon them. Nor in any
   thing, or by any act of his, did he intimate the necessity or lawful
   use of any such liturgies as these which we are inquiring after, or
   prescribed and limited forms of prayers or praises, to be used or read
   in public administration of evangelical institutions; but indeed made
   provision rendering all such prescriptions useless, and (because they
   cannot be made use of but by rejection of the provision himself by
   made) unlawful.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter IV.

   Of the worship of God by the apostles -- No liturgies used by them, nor
   in the churches of their plantation -- Argument from their practice --
   Reasons pleaded for the use of liturgies: disabilities of church
   officers for gospel administration to the edification of the church;
   uniformity in the worship of God -- The practice of the apostles as to
   these pretences considered -- Of other impositions -- The rule given by
   the apostles -- Of the liturgies falsely ascribed unto some of them.

   Our next inquiry is after the practice of the apostles, -- the best
   interpretation of the mind of the Lord Jesus Christ as to the "agenda"
   of the church, or what he would have done therein in the worship of
   God, and how. That one end of their being furnished with the Spirit of
   Christ, was the right and due administration of his ordinances in his
   church, to the edification of his disciples, I suppose will not be
   denied. By virtue of his assistance, and the gifts from him received,
   they discharged this part of their duty accordingly. That they used any
   liturgies in the church-worship, wherein they went at any time before
   the disciples, cannot with any colour of proof be pretended. The
   Scripture gives us an account of many of their prayers, -- of none that
   were a repetition of a form. If any such were used by them, how came
   the memory of them utterly to perish from off the earth? Some, indeed,
   of the ancients say that they used the Lord's prayer in the
   consecration of the eucharist; which by others is denied, being in
   itself improbable, and the testimonies weak that are produced in behalf
   of its assertion. But, as hath been showed, the use of that prayer no
   way concerns the present question. There are no more Christs but one:
   "To us there is one Lord Jesus Christ." For him who hath affirmed that
   it is likely they used forms of prayer and homilies composed for them
   by St Peter, I suppose he must fetch his evidence out of the same
   authors that he used who affirmed that Jesus Christ himself went up and
   down singing mass!

   The practice, then, of the apostles is not, as far as I know, by any
   sober and learned persons controverted in this matter. They
   administered the holy thing of the gospel by virtue of the holy gifts
   they had received. But they were apostles. The inquiry is, what
   directions and commands they gave unto the bishops or pastors of the
   churches which they planted, that they might know how to behave
   themselves in the house and worship of God. Whatever they might do in
   the discharge of their duty, by virtue of their extraordinary gifts,
   yet the case might be much otherwise with them who were intrusted with
   ordinary ministerial gifts only. But we do not find that they made any
   distinction in this matter between themselves and others; for as the
   care of all the churches was on them, the duties whereof they were to
   discharge by virtue of the gifts they had received, according to their
   commission empowering them thereunto, so to the bishops of particular
   churches they gave charge to attend unto the administration of the holy
   things in them, by virtue of the gifts they had received to that
   purpose, according to the limits of their commission. And upon a
   supposition that the apostles were enabled to discharge all gospel
   administrations to the edification of the church, by virtue of the
   gifts they had received, which those who were to come after them in the
   performance of the same duties not be enabled unto, it cannot be
   imagined but that they have provided a supply for that want and defect
   themselves, and not have left the church halt and maimed to the cure of
   those whose weakness and unfitness for the duty was its disease. So,
   then neither did the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ use any
   liturgies, in the sense spoken of, in their administration of the
   worship instituted by him in his church, nor did they prescribe or
   command any such to the churches, or their officers that were planted
   in them; nor by any thing intimate the usefulness of any such liturgy,
   or form of public worship, as after ages found out and used.

   Thus far, then, is the liberty given by Christ unto his church
   preserved entire; and the request seems not immodest that is made for
   the continuance of it. When men cry to God for the liberty in his
   worship which was left unto them by Christ and his apostles, he will
   hear, though their fellow-servants should be deaf to the requests made
   unto them; and truly they must have a great confidence in their own
   wisdom and sufficiency, who will undertake to appoint, and impose on
   others, the observation of things in the worship of God which neither
   our Lord Jesus nor his apostles did appoint or impose.

   Two things are principally pretended as grounds of the imposition of
   public liturgies:-- First, The disability of the present ministers of
   churches to celebrate and administer the ordinances of the gospel, to
   the honour of God and edification of the church, without the use of
   them. Secondly, The great importance of uniformity in the worship of
   God, not possibly to be attained but by virtue of this expedient. I
   desire to know whether these arguments did occur to the consideration
   of the apostles or no. If they shall say they did, I desire to know why
   they did not make upon them the provision now judged necessary; and
   whether those that so do, do not therein prefer their wisdom and care
   for the churches of God unto the wisdom and care of the apostles. If it
   shall be said, that the bishops or pastors of the churches in their
   days had abilities for the discharge of the whole work of the ministry
   without this relief, so that the apostles had no need to make any such
   supply, I desire to know from whom they had these abilities. If it be
   said that they had them from Jesus Christ, I then shall yet also
   farther ask, whether ordinary bishops or pastors had any other gifts
   from Jesus Christ but what he promised to bestow on ordinary bishops
   and pastors of his churches? It seems to me that he bestowed no more
   upon them than he promised to bestow, -- namely, gifts for the work of
   the ministry, with an especial regard to that outward condition of his
   churches whereunto by his providence they were disposed. It will, then,
   in the next place, be inquired whether the Lord Jesus Christ promised
   to give any other gifts to the ordinary bishops and pastors of the
   churches in those days than he promised to all such officers in his
   church to the end of the world? If this appear to be the state of
   things, that the promise by virtue whereof they received those gifts
   and abilities for the discharge of their duty which rendered the
   prescription of liturgies needless, as to the first ground of them
   pretended, did and doth equally respect all that succeed in the same
   office and duty, according to the mind and will of Christ, unto the end
   of the world, is not the pretended necessity derogatory to the glory of
   the faithfulness of Jesus Christ, as plainly intimating that he doth
   not continue to fulfil his promise; or at least a full declaration of
   men's unbelief, that they do not nor will depend upon him for the
   accomplishment of the same? Thus the first pretended ground of the
   necessary use of such liturgies as we speak of endeth in a reflection
   upon the honour of our Lord Jesus, or a publication of their own
   unbelief and apostasy.

   The second is like the former. It will not, I suppose, be denied but
   that the apostles took care for the unity of the churches, and for that
   uniformity in the worship of God which is acceptable unto him. Evidence
   lies so full unto it in their writings that it cannot be denied. Great
   weight everywhere they lay upon this duty of the churches, and propose
   unto them the ways whereby it may be done, with multiplied commands and
   exhortations to attend unto them. Whence is it, then, that they never
   once intimate any thing of that which is now pressed as the only medium
   for the attaining of that end? It cannot but seem strange to some, that
   this should be the only expedient for that uniformity which is
   acceptable unto God, and yet not once come into the thoughts of any of
   the apostles of Christ, so as to be commended unto the churches for
   that purpose. Considering the many treacheries that are in the hearts
   of men, and the powerful workings of unbelief under the most solemn
   outward professions, I fear it will appear at the last day, that the
   true rise of most of the impositions on the consciences of men, which
   on various pretences are practised in the world, is from the secret
   thoughts that either Christ doth not take that care of his churches,
   nor make that supply unto them of spiritual abilities for the work of
   the ministry, which he did in the days of old; or that men are now
   grown wiser than the apostles, and those who succeeded them in the
   administration of the things of God, and so are able to make better
   provision for attaining the end they professedly aimed at than they
   knew how to do.

   The heathen, I confess, thought forms of prayer to be a means of
   preserving a uniformity in their religious worship. Hence they had a
   solemn form for every public action; yea, for those orations which the
   magistrates had unto the people. So Livius informs us, that when Sp.
   Posthumius the consul was to speak unto the people about the
   wickednesses that were perpetrated by many under the pretence of some
   Bacchanalian superstition, he gave them an account of the usefulness of
   the "solenne precationis carmen," which he had recited to keep out and
   prevent such differences about their religion as were then fallen out,
   lib. xxix. 15: "Concione advocata cum solenne carmen precationis, quod
   præfari, priusquam populum alloquantur, magistratus solent, peregisset
   consul, ita coepit: Nulli unquam concioni, Quirites, tam non solum
   apta, sed etiam necessaria, hæc solennis Deorum comprecatio fuit, quæ
   nos admoneret, hos esse Deos, quos colere, venerari, precarique majores
   vestri instituissent, non illos,'?" etc. But I hope we shall not prefer
   their example and wisdom before that of our Lord Christ and his
   apostles.

   Were prejudices removed, and self-interests laid out of the way, a man
   would think there were not much more necessity for the determination of
   this difference. Christ and his apostles, with the apostolical
   churches, knew no such liturgies. At least it seems, as was said, not
   an unreasonable request, to ask humbly and peaceably at the hands of
   any of the sons of men, that they would be pleased to allow unto
   ministers of the gospel that are sound in the faith, and known so to
   be, who will willingly submit the trial of their ministerial abilities
   to the judgment of any who are taught of God, and enabled to discern of
   them aright, that liberty in the worship of God which was confessedly
   left unto them by Christ and his apostles. But the state of things is
   altered in the world. At a convention of the apostles and others,
   wherein the Holy Ghost did peculiarly preside, when the question about
   impositions was agitated, it was concluded that nothing should be
   imposed on the disciples but what was necessary for them to observe
   antecedently to any impositions, Acts xv. 28, 29; necessary, though not
   in their own nature, yet in the posture of things in the churches;
   necessary to the avoidance of scandal, whereby the observation of that
   injunction was to be regulated. Nor was there among the things called
   necessary the imposition of any one thing positively to be practised by
   any of the disciples in the worship of God, but only an abridgment of
   their liberty in some few external things, to which it did really
   extend. But that spirit of wisdom, moderation, and tenderness, whereby
   they were guided, being rejected by men, they began to think that they
   might multiply impositions as to the positive practice of the disciples
   of Christ in the worship of God at their pleasure, so that they could
   pretend that they were indifferent in themselves before the imposition
   of them; which gives, as they say, a necessity to their observation:
   which proceeding must be left to the judgment-seat of Jesus Christ,
   Matt. xxv. 45.

   It is not worth our stay to consider what is pretended concerning the
   antiquity of liturgies, from some yet extant that bear the names of
   some of the apostles or evangelists. There is one that is called by the
   name of James, printed in Greek and Latin; another ascribed unto Peter,
   published by Lindanus; one also to Matthew, called the Ethiopic;
   another to Mark; which are in the Bible [1] P.P. And pains have been
   taken by Santesius, Pamelius, and others, to prove them genuine; but so
   much in vain as certainly nothing could be more. Nor doth Baronius in
   their Lives dare ascribe any such thing unto them. We need not any
   longer stay to remove this rubbish out of our way. They must be
   strangers to the spirit, doctrine, and writings of the apostles, who
   can impose such trash upon them as these liturgies are stuffed withal.
   The common use of words in them not known in the ages of the apostles,
   nor of some of them ensuing; the parts in them whose contrivers and
   framers are known to have lived many ages after; the mentioning of such
   things in them as were not once dreamed of in the days whereunto they
   pretend; the remembrance of them in them, as long before them deceased,
   who are suggested to be their authors; the preferring of other
   liturgies before them when once liturgies came in use, with a neglect
   of them; with the utter silence of the first Christian writers,
   stories, councils, concerning them, do abundantly manifest that they
   are plainly suppositions of a very late fraud and invention. Yea, we
   have testimonies clear enough against this pretence in Gregor., lib.
   vii. epist. 63. Alcuinus, Amatorius, Rabanus, Lib. P. P. tom. x.; with
   whom consent Walafridus Strabo, Rupertus Titiensis, Berno, Radulphus
   Tangrensis, and generally all that have written any thing about
   liturgies in former days; many of whom show how, when, and by whom, the
   several parts of that public form which at length signally prevailed
   were invented and brought into use.

Chapter V.

   The practice of the churches in the first three centuries as to forms
   of public worship -- No set forms of liturgies used by them -- The
   silence of the first writers concerning them -- Some testimonies
   against them.

   It is not about stinted forms of prayer in the worship and service of
   God, by those who, of their own accord, do make use of that kind of
   assistance, judging that course to be better than any thing they can do
   themselves in the discharge of the work of the ministry, but of the
   imposition of forms on others who desire "to stand fast in the liberty
   with which Christ hath made them free," that we inquire. This freedom
   we have manifested to have been purchased for them by the Lord Jesus,
   and the use of it continued by the apostles in their own practice, and
   to the churches planted by themselves; and this will one day appear to
   have been a sufficient plea for the maintenance of that liberty to the
   end of the world. Now, though what is purely matter of fact among the
   succeeding churches be not so far argumentative as to be insisted on as
   a rule exactly binding us to the imitation of it, yet it is deservedly
   worthy of great consideration, and not hastily to be rejected, unless
   it be discovered to have been diverse from the word, whereunto we are
   bound in all things to attend. We shall, therefore, make some inquiry
   into the practice of those churches, as to this matter of prescribing
   of forms of prayer in public church administrations, so far as any
   thing thereof is, by good antiquity, transmitted unto us.

   Our first inquiry shall be into the three first centuries, wherein,
   confessedly, the streams of gospel institutions did run more clear and
   pure from human mixtures than in those following, although few of the
   teachers that were of note do escape from animadversions from those
   that have come after them. It cannot be denied but that for the most
   part the churches and their guides, within the space of the time
   limited, walked in the paths marked out for them by the apostles, and
   made conspicuous by the footsteps of the first churches planted by
   them. It doth not, then, appear, for aught as I can yet discover, that
   there was any attempt to invent, frame, and compose any liturgies or
   prescribed forms of administering the ordinances of the gospel,
   exclusive to the discharge of that duty by virtue of spiritual gifts
   received from Jesus Christ, much less for an imposition of any such
   forms on the consciences and practice of all the ministers of the
   churches within the time mentioned. If any be contrary-minded, it is
   incumbent on them to evince their assertion by some instances of
   unquestionable truth. As yet, that I know of, this is not performed by
   any. Baronius, ad an. Christi 58, num. 102-104, etc., treating
   expressly of the public prayers of the ancient Christians, is wholly
   silent as to the use of any forms amongst them, though he contends for
   their worshipping towards the east: which custom, when it was
   introduced, is most uncertain; but most certain that by many it was
   immoderately abused, who expressly worshipped the rising sun: of which
   abominable idolatry among Christians Leo complains, Serm. vii. De
   Nativitate. Indeed, the cardinal, ad an. 63, 12, 17, faintly contends
   that some things in the liturgy of James were composed by him, because
   some passages and expressions of it are used by Cyril of Jerusalem in
   his Mystagog. v.; but whereas Cyril lived not within the time limited
   unto our inquiry, and those treatises are justly suspected to be
   suppositions, nor is the testimony of that liturgy once cited or
   mentioned by him, the weakness of this insinuation is evident. Yea, it
   is most probable, that whosoever was the composer of that forged
   liturgy, he took those passages out of those reputed writings of Cyril,
   which were known in the church long before the name of the other was
   heard of. I know no ground of expectation of the performance of that
   which, as yet, men have come short in, -- namely, in producing
   testimonies for the use of such liturgies as we are inquiring after;
   considering the diligence, ability, and interest of those who have been
   already engaged in that inquiry. Now, the silence of those who, in all
   probability, would have given an account of them had any such been in
   use in their days, with the description they give us of such a
   performance of the worship of God in the assemblies of Christians as is
   inconsistent with, and exclusive of, such prescribed forms as we treat
   of, is as full an evidence in this kind as our negative is capable of.
   In those golden fragments of antiquity which we have preserved by
   Eusebius, -- I mean the Epistles of the church of Smyrna about the
   martyrdom of Polycarpus, and of the churches of Vienne and Lyons
   concerning their persecution, -- we have not the least intimation of
   any such forms of service. In the Epistle of Clemens, or the church of
   Rome to the church of Corinth, in those of Ignatius, in the writings of
   Justin Martyr, Clemens, Tertullian, Origen, Cyprian, and their
   contemporaries, there is the same silence concerning them. The
   pseudographical writings that bear the names of the men of those days,
   with any pretence of considerable antiquity, as the Canons of the
   Apostles, Quæstiones ad Orthodoxos, Dionysius Hierarch. Divin. Nom.,
   will not help in the cause; for though in some of them there are
   prayers mentioned, -- and that for and about such things as were not
   "in rerum natura" in the days wherein those persons lived unto whose
   names they are falsely ascribed, -- yet they speak nothing to the point
   of liturgies as stated in our inquiry. Something, I confess, may be
   found in some of the writings of some one or two of those of the third
   century, intimating the use of some particular prayers in some
   churches. So Origen, Homil. xi. in Hierimea: "Ubi frequenter in
   oratione dicimus, Da omipotens, da nobis partem cum prophetis, da cum
   apostolis Christi tui, tribue ut inveniamur ad vestigia unigeniti
   tui.'?" But whether he speaks of a form or of the matter only of
   prayer, I know not. But such passages belong not unto our purpose.
   Those who deal expressly about the order, state, and condition of the
   churches, and the worship of God in them, their prayers and
   supplications, knew nothing of prescribed liturgies; yea, they affirm
   plainly that which is inconsistent with the use of them. The account
   given of the worship of the Christians in those days by Justin Martyr
   and Tertullian is known as having been often pleaded. I shall only
   mention it in our passage, and begin with the latter. "Illuc," saith
   he, (that is, towards heaven,) "suspicientes Christiani," (not like the
   idolaters, who looked their idols and images,) "manibus expansis," (not
   embracing altars or images, as did the heathen,) "quia innocuis, capite
   nudo, quia non erubescimus, denique sine monitore, quia de pectore
   oramus," (not as who repeat their prayers after their priests or
   sacrificers, but pouring out our prayers conceived in our breasts,)
   Apol., cap. xxx. And again, cap. xxxix.: "Corpus sumus de conscientia,
   religionis et disciplinæ unitate, et spei foedere coimus in cætum et
   congregationem, ut ad Deum quasi vi facta precationibus ambiamus
   orantes. Hæc vis Deo grata est. Oramus etiam," etc. Whether this
   description of the public worship of the Christians in those days be
   consistent with the prescribed forms contended about, impartial men may
   easily discern.

   The former treateth of the same matter in his Apology, in several
   places of it: Atheoi men houn hos ouk esmen, ton demiourgon ton de tou
   pantos sebomenoi, anendee haimaton kai spondon kai thumiamaton, hos
   edidachthemen legontes, logo euches kai eucharistias eph' hois
   prospherometha pasin hose dunamis ainountes; -- "Atheists," saith he,
   "we are not, seeing we worship the Maker of the world; affirming,
   indeed, as we are taught, that he stands in no need of blood,
   drink-offerings, or incense. In all our oblations we praise him
   according to our abilities, with" (or in the way of) "prayer and
   thanksgivings." This was, it seems, the liturgy of the church in the
   days of Justin Martyr; they called upon God with prayer and
   thanksgivings, according to the abilities they had received. The like
   account he gives of the prayers of persons converted, to prepare
   themselves for baptism; as also of the prayers of the administrators of
   that ordinance. Afterward, also, treating of the joining the baptized
   person unto the church, and the administration of the Lord's supper in
   the assembly, he adds: Meta to houtos lousai ton pepeismenon, kai
   sunkatatetheimenon, epi tous legomenous adelphous agomen entha
   sunegmenoi eisi, koinas euchas poiesomenoi huper te heauton, kai tou
   photisthentos, etc. -- "After the believer who is joined unto us is
   thus washed, we bring him to those who are called brethren" (that is,
   the body of the church), "thither where they are gathered together for
   to make their prayers and supplications for themselves, and him who is"
   (newly) "illuminated," etc. These prayers, he declares afterward, were
   made by him who did preside among the brethren in the assembly, -- that
   is, the bishop or pastor; who, when he had finished his prayer, the
   whole people cried, Amen; which leaves small room for the practice of
   any liturgy that is this day extant, or that hath left any memory of
   itself in this world. These prayers and supplications, he addeth, the
   president of the assembly hose dunamis auto anapempei, "poureth out
   according to his ability;" and epi polu poieitai, he "doth this work at
   large," or continues long in his work (of praises unto God in the name
   of Jesus Christ). I know some have excepted against the usual
   interpretation of these words, hose dunamis, although they have not
   been able to assign any other tolerable sense unto them besides that
   which they would willingly oppose. But as the rendering of them
   "According to his ability," or, "As he is able," may not only be
   justified, but evinced to be the only sense the words are capable of,
   so the argument in hand doth not, as to its efficacy, depend on the
   precise signification of those two words, but on the whole contexture
   of the holy martyr's discourse; so relating to the worship of the
   churches in those days as to manifest that the use of prescribed forms
   of liturgies to be read in them was then utterly unknown.

   I suppose it will be granted, that the time we have been inquiring
   into, -- namely, the first three hundred years after Christ, -- was the
   time of the church's greatest purity, though out of her greatest
   prosperity; that the union of the several churches was preserved beyond
   what afterward was ever in a gospel way attained, and the uniformity in
   worship which Christ requires observed amongst them; but all this while
   the use of these liturgies was utterly unknown: which makes the case
   most deplorable, that it should now be made the hinge whereon the whole
   exercise of the ministry must turn, it being a thing not only destitute
   of any warrant from Christ and his apostles, but utterly unknown to
   those churches whose antiquity gives them deservedly reverence with
   all; and so cannot claim its spring and original antecedent to such
   miscarryings and mistakes in the churches as all acknowledge to deserve
   a narrow and serious weighing and consideration. We may, then, I
   suppose, without giving occasion to the just imputation of any mistake,
   affirm, That the composing and imposition of liturgies, to be
   necessarily used or read in the administration of the ordinances of the
   gospel, is destitute of any plea or pretence, from Scripture or
   antiquity.

Chapter VI.

   The pretended antiquity of liturgies disproved -- The most ancient --
   Their variety -- Canons of councils about forms of church
   administrations -- The reasons pleaded in the justification of the
   first invention of liturgies answered -- Their progress and end.

   Considering with what confidence the antiquity of liturgies in the
   churches of Christ hath been pretended, it may seem strange to some
   that we should so much as attempt to divest them of that plea and
   pretence. But the love of the truth enforceth us to contend against
   many prejudices in this matter. May a denial of their antiquity, with
   the reasons of that denial tendered, provoke any to assert it by such
   testimonies as we have not as yet had the happiness to come to an
   acquaintance with, the advantage as well as the trouble will be theirs
   who shall so do. Only, in their endeavour to that purpose, I shall
   desire of them that they would not labour to impose on those whom they
   undertake to inform, by the ambiguous use of some word among the
   ancients; nor conclude a prescribed form of administration when they
   find mention of the administration itself; nor reckon reading of the
   Scriptures or singing of psalms as parts of the liturgy contended
   about; nor, from the use of some particular prayer by some persons,
   argue for the equity or necessity of composing such entire liturgies,
   or offices as they call them, for all evangelical administrators, and
   their necessary observation. So that these conditions be observed, I
   shall profess myself much engaged unto any one who shall discover a
   rise of them within the limits of the antiquity that hath been usually
   pretended and pleaded in their justification and practice. For my part,
   I know not any thing that ever obtained a practice and observation
   among Christians, whose springs are more dark and obscure than those of
   liturgies. They owe not their original to any councils, general or
   provincial; they were not the product of the advice or consent of any
   churches, nor was there any one of them at any time completed. No pleas
   can I as yet discover in them of old about uniformity in their use, or
   any consent in them about them. Every church seemeth to have done what
   seemed good in the church's own eyes, after once the way unto the use
   of them was opened. To whom in particular we are indebted for that
   invention, I know not; it may be those who are wiser do, and I wish
   they would value the thanks that they may have for the discovery when
   they shall be pleased to make it. They seem to me to have had but
   slender originals. One invented one form of prayer, or thanksgiving, or
   benediction; another added to what he had found out, -- which was the
   easier task. Future additions gave some completeness to their
   beginners. Those in the Greek church, which bear the names of
   Chrysostom and Basil, seem to be the first that ever extended
   themselves to the whole worship of the church. Not that by them whose
   names they bear they were composed as now they appear, unless we shall
   think that they wrote them after their decease; but probably they
   collected some forms into order that had been by others invented,
   making such additions themselves as they judged needful, and so
   commended the use of them to the churches wherein they did preside. The
   use of them being arbitrarily introduced was not, by any injunction we
   find, made necessary; much less did any one single form plead for a
   general necessity. In the Latin church, Ambrose used one form, Gregory
   another, and Isidore a third. Nor is it unlikely but the liturgies were
   as many as the episcopal churches of those days. Hence, in the
   beginning of the fifth century, in an African council, can. 70, which
   is the 103d in the Codex Can. African., it is provided that no prayers
   be read in the administration of the eucharist but such as have been
   approved in some council, or have been observed by some prudent men
   formerly; which canon, with some addition, is confirmed in the second
   Milevitan council, can. 12: and the reason given in both is, lest there
   should any thing contrary to the faith creep into their way of worship.
   But this, as I said, was in the beginning of the fifth century, after
   divers forms of administration of holy things in the church had by
   divers been invented. The finding out of this invention was the act of
   some particular men, who have not been pleased to acquaint us with the
   reason of their undertaking. As yet it doth not appear unto us that
   those reasons could possibly be taken from the word, the practice of
   the apostles, or the churches by them planted, or those which followed
   them for some generations, nor from any council held before their days;
   and so, it may be, we are not much concerned to inquire what they were.
   Yet what is at present pleaded in the behalf of the first composers of
   liturgies may, in the way, be chiefly considered. Necessity is the
   first thing usually pretended. Many men being put into the office of
   the ministry who had not gifts and abilities for the profitable
   discharge of the work of the ministry, unto the edification of the
   church, they who had the oversight of them, according to the custom of
   those days, were enforced to compose such forms for their use as they
   judged expedient; so providing for the edification of the church, which
   else would have suffered from their weakness and insufficiency.
   Besides, many parts of the world, especially the east, in those days
   swarmed with antitrinitarian heretics of sundry sorts, who, many of
   them, by unsuspected wiles and dissimulations, and subscriptions of
   confessions, endeavoured to creep into the office of the ministry of
   the church, partly out of blind zeal to diffuse the poison of their
   abominations, partly out of carnal policy to be made partakers of the
   advantages which for the most part attended the orthodox profession.
   This increased the necessity of composing such forms of public worship
   as, being filled with expressions pointed against the errors of the
   times, might be a means to keep seducers from imposing themselves on
   ecclesiastical administrations. Thus there is no ancient liturgy, but
   it is full of the expressions that had been consented upon in the
   councils that were convened for the condemnation of those errors which
   were in their days most rife and pernicious. On this ground do learned
   men of all sorts conclude the liturgy falsely ascribed to James to be
   younger than the Nicene and Ephesine councils, from the use of the
   words homoousios and theotokos in it.

   But it doth not yet appear that these reasons were sufficient to
   justify such an innovation in the churches of Christ; for supposing
   that there were such a decay of gifts and abilities among them that
   were called to the administration of gospel institutions, that they
   were not able to discharge their duty in that work to the edification
   of the church, in like manner as those had done who went before them,
   this must needs have come to pass, either because our Lord Jesus Christ
   did cease to give out his gifts to his church, as he had done in former
   days upon his usual terms, or that men were negligent and careless in
   the receiving of them from him, -- either not seeking them at his hand,
   or not exercising and improving of them according to his will and
   command. Other reason of this decay that I know of cannot be assigned.
   To affirm the former, on any pretence whatever, is blasphemously to
   accuse our Lord Jesus Christ of breach of promise, he having solemnly
   engaged to be with his disciples, not for an age or two, but to the end
   of the world, and that by the graces and gifts of his Spirit. I know it
   is pretended, that when Christians were multiplied there was a
   necessity of appointing them officers who had not the gifts and
   qualifications that otherwise would have been esteemed necessary; but I
   know withal that it is impossible Christians should be multiplied in
   the way of Christ faster than he is ready to give out gifts for their
   edification. The latter reason above, then, must be granted to be the
   cause of the defect of abilities in church officers, pleaded in the
   justification of the introduction into the church of composed forms of
   administration to be read by them. I wish, then, we might, in the fear
   of the Lord, consider whether the remedy were well suited unto the
   disease. I suppose all impartial men will grant that there ought to
   have been a return unto Him endeavoured from whom they were gone
   astray; at least gospel means used for the obtaining of those gifts of
   Christ, and the improving of them being received. Finding themselves at
   the loss wherein they were, should they not have searched their hearts
   and ways, to consider wherefore it was that the presence of Christ was
   so withdrawn from them, that they were so left without the assistance
   which others ministering in their places before them had received?
   Should not they have pulled out their single talent, and fallen to
   trading with it, that it might have increased under their care? Was not
   this the remedy and cure of the breach made by them, that God and man
   expected from them? Was it just, then, and according to the mind of
   Christ, that, instead of an humble returnal unto a holy, evangelical
   dependence on himself, they should invent an expedient to support them
   in the condition wherein they were, and so make all such returnal for
   hereafter needless? Yet this they did in the invention of liturgies, --
   they found out a way to justify themselves in their spiritual
   negligence and sloth, and to render a dependence on the Lord Christ for
   supplies of his Spirit, to enable them unto gospel administrations,
   altogether needless; they had now provided themselves with an ability
   they could keep in the church, so that he might keep the furniture of
   his Spirit unto himself. And this quickly became the most poisonous
   ingredient in the apostasy of the latter times.

   Nor is there any sufficient warrant for this invention in the second
   pretence. There were many antichrists in the apostles' time, yet they
   never thought of this engine for their discovery or exclusion out of
   the church. Confessions of faith, or acknowledged forms of wholesome
   words, with the care of the disciples of Christ, or his churches, which
   are enabled by him to judge and discern of truth and error, are the
   preservations against the danger intimated that the gospel hath
   provided.

   This being the entrance that the liturgies inquired after made into the
   churches of God, we are not much concerned to inquire what was their
   progress. That in the western parts of the world they all at length
   centred in the Roman mass-book and rituals we know. Their beginnings
   were small, plain, brief; their use arbitrary; the additions they
   received were from the endeavours of private men in several ages,
   occasional for the most part; the number of them great, equal to the
   various denominations of the churches; until the papal authority
   growing absolute and uncontrollable, the Roman form was imposed on the
   world, that, by innumerable artifices in a long tract of ages, was
   subjected thereunto, and that contrary to the determination of former
   Roman bishops, who advised the continuance of the different forms of
   administration which were in use in several churches: "Mihi placet, ut
   sive in Romanis sive in Galliarum partibus, seu in quâlibet ecclesiâ
   aliquid invenisti quod plus omnipotenti Deo possit placere sollicitè
   eligas," Greg. Resp. ad Interrogat. August. This being the state and
   condition, this the issue, that the invention of liturgies to be read
   in the worship of God was come unto before the Reformation, I shall
   briefly subjoin unto it an account of what was done in these kingdoms
   in reference unto it; which will make way to the clear stating of the
   question in particular that we are farther to speak unto. The history
   of our Reformation is known. I shall not speak any thing that may
   reflect with the least dishonour on the work or the workmen. We have
   abundant cause to bless the Lord continually for the one and the other.
   Yet still we must remember that our Reformers were men, and that the
   Reformation was a work performed by men. The former never claimed
   infallibility, nor the latter, that I know of, perfection; so that some
   things that were done by the one and in the other may admit of new
   considerations, without the reflection of any thing upon them that the
   one and the other would not readily and willingly admit. I shall
   therefore briefly give an account of that part of the work which
   concerns our business in hand. What was the state of this nation at the
   time of the Reformation, and what were the minds of the greater part of
   men in it in reference unto the work, is sufficiently declared in all
   the stories of those days. God having been pleased to send the saving
   light of the gospel into the minds and hearts of them in chief rule, --
   that is, King Edward and some of his counsellors, -- they found no
   small difficulties to wrestle withal in dealing with the inveterate
   prejudices wherewith the generality of men were possessed against the
   work they intended. The far greater part of the clergy, true to their
   carnal present interest, with all their might and cunning opposed their
   endeavours. The greatest part of the nobility averse to their
   proceedings; the body of the people, blinded with superstition and
   profaneness, easily excited by the priests (whose peculiar concernment
   lay in keeping all things in their old channel and course) to make head
   against their proceedings; foreign nations round about fomenting to the
   uttermost all home-bred discontents, and offering themselves, by the
   instigation of the pope, to hinder the work by all ways that possibly
   they could imagine; -- amongst all these the body of the people, which
   are the king's most special care, as they are his strength and wealth,
   were looked on as most to be regarded, as without whose concurrence
   their discontents of all others were likely only to consume themselves.
   Now, the people being in those days very ignorant, and unacquainted
   with the doctrines of the Scripture, were very little or not at all
   concerned what persuasion men were of in religion, as to the articles
   of pure belief, so as they might retain the "agenda" in the worship of
   God which they had been accustomed unto. Hence it was that those
   prelates, who were the instruments of the papal persecution in this
   nation, wisely stated the whole cause of their cruelty to be the Mass,
   or the worship of the church, seldom, unless compelled by disputations,
   once mentioning of the articles of faith, which yet they knew to be the
   main foundation of the difference between themselves and the reformers;
   because in this particular they had the advantage of the popular
   favour, the people violently interposing themselves in the behalf of
   that part of the present religion wherein their only share did lie. Had
   they laid the reasons and grounds of their quarrel in the differences
   of opinions about the "credenda" of the gospel, they would scarcely
   have prevailed with the common people to carry fagot for the burning of
   their brethren for things whereof they understood little or nothing at
   all.

   Our wise and provident reformers, considering this state of things and
   temper of the minds of men, however they resolvedly declared for the
   "credenda" of the gospel, and asserted the articles of faith from which
   the Roman church had most eminently apostatized, yet found it their
   concernment to attemper the way of public worship, as much as possible
   with consistency with the articles of the faith they professed, to that
   which the popularity had been inured unto. Observing plainly that all
   their concernment in religion lay in the outward worship whereunto they
   had been accustomed, having very confused apprehensions of the
   speculative part of it, it was easy for them to apprehend that if they
   could condescend to furnish them with such a way thereof as might
   comply in some reasonable manner with their former usage, these two
   things would ensue:-- First, That the main reformation, in the
   doctrine, which alone would deliver the people from their prejudicate
   opinions about the worship of God, would be carried on with less noise
   and observation, and consequently less contest and opposition; for
   whilst they had a way and form of worship proposed to them wherewith
   they could be contented, those that were wiser might believe and teach
   what they pleased: which, in the providence of God, proved in a short
   time a blessed means of delivering them from their old entanglements
   and darkness. Secondly, That their priests, who were the chief
   instigators to all disorder and opposition to the whole work of
   reformation, finding a way proposed for their continuance in the
   possession of their places, and a worship prescribed which they could
   as easily perform and go through withal as what they had practised in
   former days, might possibly acquiesce in the proceedings of their
   betters, finding the temporal interest, which they chiefly respected,
   to be saved. And this afterward, accordingly, they did, reading the
   service-book instead of the mass; without which supply of such wants
   and defects in them as I shall not name, they would never have
   entertained any thoughts of owning the Reformation, nor of suffering
   the people to submit themselves thereunto. On these considerations, and
   for these ends, it is evident, from the story of those times, that our
   present liturgy was framed. Rejecting out of the offices before in use
   such things as were directly contrary to the articles of faith
   protested in the reformation in hand, translating of what remained into
   English, with such supplies and alterations as the rejection of those
   things before mentioned made necessary, the book mentioned, in some
   haste, and with some other disadvantages for such a work, was by our
   first reformers compiled. And, indeed, somewhat there was in this case
   not much unlike that insisted on in the entrance of this discourse
   between the believing Jews and Gentiles. Many of the Jews who were
   willing to receive Christ's reformation in point of faith and
   obedience, yet pertinaciously adhered to their old ceremonious worship,
   violently setting themselves against any that durst speak a word
   against its continuance. That there might not be an endless contest and
   strife about the matter, and so the progress of the gospel be hindered
   amongst the one sort and the other, the apostles taking in hand the old
   worship, as to the Gentile worshippers, whose case above came then
   under consideration, they reject and declare abrogate all such
   ceremonies whose necessary observation had an inconsistency with the
   doctrine of the gospel, proposing only some few things to be observed,
   which occasioned the greatest difference between the parties at
   variance.

   Now, as this composition of that difference was accommodated to the
   present scandal, and the obligation unto its observation to be
   regulated thereby; so by the removal thereof, itself, as unto any use
   in the church of Christ, did expire. Not unlike unto this of the
   apostles seems the aim of our first reformers to have been; that they
   might win the people, who had been accustomed to the way of worship in
   use in the Papacy, unto a compliance with the doctrine of the gospel,
   and that there might not be endless contests about that which was
   presently to be practised, -- which perhaps they thought of small
   importance in comparison of those weighty fundamental truths which they
   had endeavoured to acquaint them with, and bring them to the belief of,
   -- they provided for the use of such parts of it and in such a manner
   as were not openly inconsistent with the truths which was in their
   hearts to communicate unto them. And it is not impossible but that this
   constitution might have had the same end with the other, if not of
   present use, being of things of another nature, yet of a timely
   expiration, when notoriously useless as to the main ends intended in
   it, had not the interest of some interposed for its continuance beyond
   the life and influence of all or any of those causes or occasions. And
   hence it is that those streams at this day run strongly and fiercely,
   by the addition and pouring into of adventitious rivulets, with showers
   or rather storms of temporal interest, whose springs are all utterly
   long since dried up.

   The Book of Common Prayer being composed as hath been declared, became
   from its very cradle and infancy a bone of contention to the church of
   God in this nation. Many of the people and ministers, who seemed to be
   enlightened with a beam of truth of an equal lustre and brightness with
   that which shined in the minds of their brethren, wholly decried that
   prudential compliance with the people's ignorance and adherence to
   Popery, which was openly avowed in the composition and imposition of
   it, and called earnestly for a purer way of the administration of
   gospel ordinances, more agreeable to the word and primitive times, than
   they apprehended that prescribed form to contain and exhibit. Others,
   again, in the justification of that whereof themselves were the
   authors, laboured to recommend the book, not only as to truth, but as
   useful and very beneficial for the edification of the church. It is
   known, also, that the contests of men in this nation about this form of
   divine service were not confined to this nation, but were carried by
   them into other parts of the world. And should I pursue the suffrage
   that hath lain against it, from the first day of its composure to this
   wherein we live, never giving it a quiet possession in the minds and
   consciences of men, with the various evils that have all along attended
   its imposition, I suppose it might of itself prevail with sober men,
   who desire their moderation should be known to all, because the Judge
   standeth at the door, to take the whole matter of the imposition of
   this or the like form once more under a sedate consideration. And they
   may, perhaps, be the rather induced thereunto, if they will but
   impartially weigh that the opposition to the imposed liturgy hath
   increased daily, according to the increase of light and gospel gifts
   among men: so that there seems to be no way to secure its station but
   by an opposition unto them and extirpation of them; which is a sad work
   for any that are called Christians to engage into.

   I presume the conscientious reader will be able to discover, from what
   hath been spoken, rules sufficient to guide his judgment in reference
   unto the use of prescribed liturgies. The story of their rise and
   progress is enough to plead for a liberty from an indispensable
   necessity of their observation. That which is of pure human invention,
   and comparatively of late and uncertain original, whose progress hath
   been attended with much superstition and persecution, stands in need of
   very cogent reasons to plead for its continuance; for others will not
   outbalance the evils that are asserted to flow from it. But it may be
   this will not suffice with some for a final decision and determination
   of this difference. I shall, therefore, briefly state the question
   about them, which only I shall speak unto, and try their use and
   usefulness by that infallible rule by which both we and they must be
   judged another day.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter VII.

   The question stated -- First argument against the composing and
   imposing of liturgies -- Arbitrary additions to the worship of God
   rejected -- Liturgies not appointed by God -- Made necessary in their
   imposition, and a part of the worship of God -- Of circumstances of
   worship -- Instituted adjuncts of worship not circumstances --
   Circumstances of actions, as such, not circumstances of worship --
   Circumstances commanded made parts of worship -- Prohibitions of
   additions produced, considered, applied.

   To clear up what it is in particular that we insist upon, some few
   things are to be premised:-- First, then, I do not in especial intend
   the liturgy now in use in England, any farther than to make it an
   instance of such imposed liturgies, whereof we treat. I shall not,
   then, at all inquire what footing it hath in the law, how nor when
   established, nor what particular failings are pleaded to be in it, nor
   what conformity it bears with the Roman offices, with the like things
   that are usually objected against it. Nor, secondly, do I oppose the
   directive part of this liturgy as to the reading of the Scripture, when
   it requires that which is Scripture to be read, the administration of
   the ordinances by Christ appointed, nor the composition of forms of
   prayer suited to the nature of the institutions to which they relate,
   so they be not imposed on the administrators of them to be read
   precisely as prescribed. But, thirdly, this is that alone which I shall
   speak unto, -- the composing of forms of prayer in the worship of God,
   in all gospel administrations, to be used by the ministers of the
   churches, in all public assemblies, by a precise reading of the words
   prescribed unto them, with commands for the reading of other things,
   which they are not to omit, upon the penalty contained in the sanction
   of the whole service and the several parts of it. The liberty which
   some say is granted for a man to use his own gifts and abilities in
   prayer before and after sermons, will, I fear, as things now stand,
   upon due consideration, appear rather to be taken than given. However,
   it concerns not our present question, because it is taken for granted
   by those that plead for the strict observation of a book, that the
   whole gospel worship of God, in the assemblies of Christians, may be
   carried on and performed without any such preaching as is prefaced with
   the liberty pretended.

   These things being premised, I shall subjoin some of the reasons that
   evidently declare the imposition and use of such a liturgy or form of
   public words to be contrary to the rule of the word, and consequently
   sinful.

   First, the arbitrary invention of any thing, with commands for its
   necessary and indispensable use in the public worship of God, as a part
   of that worship, and the use of any thing so invented and so commanded
   in that worship, is unlawful, and contrary to the rule of the word; but
   of this nature is the liturgy we treat of. It is an invention of men,
   not appointed, not commanded of God; it is commanded to be used in the
   public worship of God, by reading the several parts of it, according to
   the occasions that they respect, and that indispensably; and is made a
   part of that worship.

   There are three things affirmed in the assumption concerning the
   liturgy:-- First, That it is not appointed or commanded of God; that
   is, there is no command of God either for the use of this or that
   liturgy in particular, nor in general that any such should so be, and
   be so used as is pleaded. And this we must take for granted, until some
   instance of such command be produced. Secondly, That it is made
   necessary, by virtue of the commands of men, to be used in the public
   worship of God. About this there will be no difference. Let it be
   denied, and there is an end of all this strife. I shall not dispute
   about other men's practice. They who are willing to take it upon their
   consciences that the best way to serve God in the church, or the best
   ability that they have for the discharge of their duty therein,
   consists in the reading of such a book (for I suppose they will grant
   that they ought to serve God with the best they have), shall not by me
   be opposed in their way and practice. It is only about its imposition,
   and the necessity of its observance by virtue of that imposition, that
   we discourse. Now, the present command is, that such a liturgy be
   always used in the public worship of God, and that without the use or
   reading of it the ordinances of the gospel be not administered at any
   time, nor in any place, with strong pleas for the obligation arising
   from that command, making the omission of its observance to be sinful.
   It is, then, utterly impossible that any thing should be more
   indispensably necessary than the reading of the liturgy in the worship
   of God is. It is said, indeed, that it is not commanded as though in
   itself it were necessary, either a prescribed liturgy, or this or that,
   for then it were sin in any not to use it, whether it were commanded by
   the church or not; but for order, uniformity, conveniency, and the
   preventing of sundry evils that would otherwise ensue, it is commanded:
   which command makes the observation of it necessary unto us. But we are
   not as yet inquiring what are the reasons of its imposition; they may
   afterward be spoken unto. And time also may be taken to show that it
   were much more tolerable if men would plead for the necessity of the
   things which it seems good unto them to command, and on that ground to
   command their observance, than, granting them not necessary in
   themselves, to make them necessary to be observed merely by virtue of
   their commands, for reasons which they say satisfy themselves, but come
   short of giving satisfaction to them from whom obedience is required;
   for whereas the will of man can be no way influenced unto obedience but
   by mere acknowledged sovereignty, or conviction of reason in and from
   the things themselves, commands in and about things wherein they own
   not that the commanders have an absolute sovereignty (as God hath in
   all things, the civil supreme magistrate in things civil that are good
   and lawful), nor can they find the reasons of the things themselves
   cogent, are a yoke which God hath not designed the sons of men to bear.
   But it is concerning the necessary use of the liturgy in the worship of
   God that we are disputing; which, I suppose, will not be denied.

   [Thirdly,] It remaineth, then, to consider whether the use of the
   liturgy as prescribed be made a part of the worship of God. Now, that
   wherewith and whereby God is commanded to be worshipped, and without
   which all observation or performance of his public worship is
   forbidden, is itself made a part of his worship. The command, "With
   this (or thus) shall you worship God," makes the observation of that
   command a part of God's worship. It is said that it is only a
   circumstance of worship, but no part of it. Prayer is the worship of
   God; but that this prayer shall be used and no other is only a
   circumstance of it: so that though it may be possibly accounted a
   circumstance or accidentary part of God's worship, yet it is not
   asserted to be of the substance of it. How far this is so, and how far
   it is otherwise must be considered. Circumstances are either such as
   follow actions as actions, or such as are arbitrarily superadded and
   adjoined by command unto actions, which do not of their own accord, nor
   naturally nor necessarily attend them. Now, religious actions in the
   worship of God are actions still. Their religious relation doth not
   destroy their natural being. Those circumstances, then, which do attend
   such actions as actions not determined by divine institution, may be
   ordered, disposed of, and regulated by the prudence of men. For
   instance, prayer is a part of God's worship. Public prayer is so, as
   appointed by him. This, as it is an action to be performed by man,
   cannot be done without the assignment of time, and place, and sundry
   other things, if order and conveniency be attended to. These are
   circumstances that attend all actions of that nature, to be performed
   by a community, whether they relate to the worship of God or no. These
   men may, according as they see good, regulate and change as there is
   occasion; I mean, they may do so who are acknowledged to have power in
   such things. As the action cannot be without them, so their regulation
   is arbitrary, if they come not under some divine disposition and order,
   as that of time in general doth. There are also some things, which some
   men call circumstances, also, that no way belong of themselves to the
   actions whereof they are said to be the circumstances, nor do attend
   them, but are imposed on them, or annexed unto them, by the arbitrary
   authority of those who take upon them to give order and rules in such
   cases; such as to pray before an image or towards the east, or to use
   this or that form of prayer in such gospel administrations, and no
   other. These are not circumstances attending the nature of the thing
   itself, but are arbitrarily superadded to the things that they are
   appointed to accompany. Whatever men may call such additions, they are
   no less parts of the whole wherein they serve than the things
   themselves whereunto they are adjoined. The schoolmen tell us that that
   which is made so the condition of an action, that without it the action
   is not to be done, is not a circumstance of it, but such an adjunct as
   is a necessary part. But not to contend about the word, such
   additionals, that are called circumstantial, are made parts of worship
   as are made necessary by virtue of command to be observed. Sacrifices
   of old were the instituted worship of God. That they should be offered
   at the tabernacle or temple at Jerusalem, and nowhere else, was a
   circumstance appointed to be observed in their offerings; and yet this
   circumstance was no less a part of God's worship than the sacrifice
   itself. In the judgment of most men, not only prayer, and the matter of
   our prayer, is appointed by our Saviour in the Lord's prayer, but we
   are commanded also to use the very words of it. I desire to know
   whether the precise use of these words be not a part of God's worship?
   It seems that it is; for that which is commanded by Christ to be used
   in the worship of God is a part of God's worship. The case is the same
   here. Prayer is commanded, and the use of these prayers is commanded;
   the latter distinctly, as such, as well as the former, is made a part
   of God's worship. Nor is there any ground for that distinction of the
   circumstantial or accidentary part of God's worship, and worship
   substantially taken, or the substantial parts of it. The worship of God
   is either moral or instituted. The latter contains the peculiar ways
   and manner of exerting the former according to God's appointment. The
   actions whereby these are jointly discharged, or the inward moral
   principles of worship are exerted in and according to the outward
   institutions, have their circumstances attending them. These in
   themselves, nakedly considered, have in them neither good nor evil, nor
   are any circumstances in the worship of God, much less circumstantial
   parts of his worship, but only circumstances of those actions as
   actions whereby it is performed. And whatever is instituted of God in
   and about those circumstances is a substantial part of his worship.

   Nor is the prescribing of such a form of prayer a regulation of those
   circumstances of public prayer, for decency, order, and uniformity,
   which attend it as a public action, but the superaddition of an adjunct
   condition, with which it is to be performed, and without which it is
   not to be performed as it is prayer, the worship of God. Of this nature
   was sacrificing of old on the altar at the tabernacle or temple, and
   there alone; and many more instances of the like nature may be given.
   Praising of God and blessing of the people were parts of the worship of
   God, appointed by himself to be performed by the priests under the law.
   In the doing thereof at certain seasons, they were commanded to use
   some forms of words prescribed unto them for that purpose. Not only
   hereby the praising and blessing of God, but the use of those forms in
   so doing, became a necessary part of the worship of God; and so was the
   use of organs and the like instruments of music, which respect that
   manner of praising him which God then required. The case is here no
   otherwise. Prayers and thanksgivings, in the administration of the
   ordinances of the gospel, are of the instituted worship of God. Unto
   these, as to the manner of their performance, is the imposition of the
   liturgical forms spoken of superadded, and their use made a necessary
   adjunct of the duty itself, so as that it may not be performed without
   them; which makes them a no less necessary part of the worship of God
   than any of his institutions of old were which related to the
   circumstances and the manner of his worship, as the temple, tabernacle,
   altar, forms of thanksgiving and confession, composed and prescribed by
   the Holy Ghost himself.

   But I suppose this will not be much gainsaid; by some it is
   acknowledged in express terms. And for the matter of fact, we find that
   the reading of a book of service is with many taken not to be a part,
   but the whole of the worship of God, which if it be done, they suppose
   God is acceptably worshipped without more ado; and if it be omitted,
   whatever else be done in the room of it, that God is not worshipped at
   all.

   Our inquiry, then, must be, whether such additions to or in the worship
   of God, besides or beyond his own institution and appointment, be
   allowable, or lawful to be practised. I shall first recite the words in
   general of some testimonies that lie against such a practice, and then
   consider what they most particularly speak unto. Of this sort are Exod.
   xx. 4, 5: "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any
   likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth
   beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; thou shalt not bow
   down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a
   jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,"
   etc. Deut. iv. 2: "Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you,
   neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the
   commandments of the Lord your God which I command you." Chap. xii. 32:
   "What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add
   thereto, nor diminish from it." Prov. xxx. 6: "Add not unto his words,
   lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar." Jer. vii. 31: "They
   have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son
   of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I
   commanded them not, neither came it into my heart." Matt. xv. 9: "In
   vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of
   men." Ver. 13: "Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted,
   shall be rooted up." Also, Mark vii. 7, 8; Rev. xxii. 18: "If any man
   shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that
   are written in this book." The mind of God in these and the like
   prohibitions, the reader may find exemplified, Lev. x. 1-3, etc.; Josh.
   xxii. 10, etc.; Judges viii. 24, etc.; 2 Kings xvi. 11, 12; 1 Chron.
   xv. 13, and in other places.

   Men who, having great abilities of learning, are able to distinguish
   themselves from under the power of the most express rules and commands,
   should yet, methinks, out of a sense of their weakness (which they are
   ready to profess themselves convinced of when occasion is offered to
   deliver their thoughts concerning them), have compassion for those who,
   being not able to discern the strength of their reasonings, because of
   their fineness, are kept in a conscientious subjection to the express
   commands of God, especially conceiving them not without some cogent
   cause reiterated.

   But lest the present exasperation of the spirits of men should
   frustrate that hope and expectation, let us consider what is the
   precise intendment of the testimonies produced, seeing we have reason
   to look well to the justice of our cause in the first place; which
   being cleared, we may the better be satisfied in coming short of favour
   where it may not be obtained. The places of Scripture produced are
   taken partly out of the Old Testament, partly out of the New. And I
   suppose it will be granted that there is an equal force of rule in the
   one as in the other; for though these in the Old Testament had their
   peculiar respect to the worship that was then instituted, yet they had
   [respect to it] not as then instituted, but as the worship which God
   himself had appointed. And therefore their general force abides while
   God requires any worship at the hands of men, unless it may be made
   appear that God hath parted with that prerogative of being the
   appointer of his own worship now under the New Testament, which he so
   vindicated unto himself under the Old. Take them, then, in their
   general aim and intention, that which these and the like testimonies
   unanimously speak unto us is this, That the will of God is the sole
   rule of his worship, and all the concernment of it, and that his
   authority is the sole principle and cause of the relation of any thing
   to his worship in a religious manner; and consequently, that he never
   did, nor ever will, allow that the wills of his creatures should be the
   rule or measure of his honour or worship, nor that their authority
   should cause any thing to hold a new relation unto him, or any other
   but what it hath by the law of its creation. And this is the sum and
   substance of the second commandment, wherein so great a cloud of
   expositors do centre their thoughts, that it will not be easy for any
   to withstand them; so that the other texts produced are express to all
   the particulars of the assertion laid down may be easily evinced.

   That the Lord asserts his own authority and will as the constituting
   cause and rule of all his worship was the first thing asserted. His
   repetition of "My words," "What I have commanded," and the like
   expressions, secure this enclosure. Unless men can pretend that there
   is the same reason of the words and commands of God himself, it is in
   vain for them to pretend a power of instituting any thing in the
   worship of God; for the formal reason of every such institution is,
   that the word of it is the word of God. It is enough to discard any
   thing from a relation to the worship of God, to manifest that the
   appointers of it were men, and not God. Nor can any man prove that God
   hath delegated unto them his power in this matter; nor did he ever do
   so to any of the sons of men, -- namely, that they should have
   authority to appoint any thing in his worship, or about it, that
   seemeth meet unto their wisdom. With some, indeed, in former days, he
   intrusted the work of revealing unto his church and people what he
   himself would have observed; which dispensation he closed in the person
   of Christ and his apostles. But to intrust men with authority, not to
   declare what he revealed, but to appoint what seemeth good unto them,
   he never did it; the testimonies produced lie evidently against it.
   Now, surely, God's asserting his own will and authority as the only
   rule and cause of his worship, should make men cautious how they
   suppose themselves like or equal unto him herein, especially being
   destitute of warrant from the approved example or precedent of any that
   have gone before them. If the example of any one in the Old or New
   Testament could be produced, that of his own mind and authority made
   any such additions to the worship of God as that which we treat about,
   by virtue of any trust or power pretended from or under him, and found
   acceptance in his so doing, or that was not severely rebuked for his
   sin therein, some countenance would seem to be given unto those that at
   present walk in such paths; although I suppose it would not be easy for
   thereto prove any particular instances, which might have peculiar
   exemption from the general law, which we know not, to be a sufficient
   warrant for their proceedings. But whereas God himself having
   instituted his own worship and all the concernments of it, doth also
   assert his own authority and will as the sole cause and rule of all the
   worship that he will accept, no instance being left on record of any
   one that ever made any additions to what he had appointed, on any
   pretence whatever, or by virtue of any authority whatever, that was
   accepted with him; and whereas the most eminent of those who have
   assumed that power to themselves, as also of the judgment of the
   reasons necessary for the exerting of it, as to matter and manner, have
   been given up, in the righteous judgment of God, to do things not
   convenient, yea, abominable unto him (as in the papal church), -- it is
   not unlikely to be the wisdom of men to be very cautious of intruding
   themselves into this thankless office.

   But such is the corrupt nature of man, that there is scarce any thing
   whereabout men have been more apt to contend with God from the
   foundation of the world. That their will and wisdom may have a share
   (some at least) in the ordering of his worship, is that which of all
   things they seem to desire. Wherefore, to obviate their pride and
   folly, to his asserting of his own prerogative in this matter, he
   subjoins severe interdictions against all or any man's interposing
   therein, so as to take away any thing by him commanded, or to add any
   thing to what is by him appointed. This also the testimonies recited
   fully express. The prohibition is plain, "Thou shalt not add to what I
   have commanded." Add not to his words, "That is, in his worship, to the
   things which by his word he hath appointed to be observed, -- neither
   to the word of his institution nor to the things instituted." Indeed,
   adding things adds to the word; for the word that adds is made of a
   like authority with his. All making to ourselves is forbidden, though
   what we so make may seem unto us to tend to the furtherance of the
   worship of God. It is said men may add nothing to the substance of the
   worship of God, but they may order, dispose, and appoint the things
   that belong to the manner and circumstances of it, and this is all that
   is done in the prescription of liturgies. Of circumstances in and about
   the worship of God we have spoken before, and removed that pretence.
   Nor is it safe distinguishing in the things of God where himself hath
   not distinguished. When he gave out the prohibitions mentioned under
   the Old Testament, he was appointing or had appointed his whole
   worship, and all that belonged unto it, in matter and manner, way and
   order, substance and circumstance. Indeed, there is nothing in its
   whole nature, as it belongs to the general being of things, so
   circumstantial, but that if it be appointed by God in his worship, it
   becomes a part of the substance of it; nor can any thing that is not so
   appointed ever by any be made a circumstance of his worship, though
   many things are circumstances of those actions which in his worship are
   performed. This distinction, then, directly makes void the command, so
   that conscience cannot acquiesce in it. Besides, we have showed that
   liturgies prescribed and imposed are necessary parts of God's worship,
   and so not to be salved by this distinction.

   Moreover, to testify what weight he laid on the observance of these
   general prohibitions, when men found out other ways of worship than
   what he had appointed, though the particulars were such as fell under
   other special interdictions, yet the Lord was pleased to place the
   great aggravation of their sin in the contempt of those general rules
   mentioned. This is that he urgeth them with, that they did things by
   him not appointed; of not observing any thing in religion but what he
   requires, that he presseth them withal. The command is general, "You
   shall add nothing to what I have instituted." And the aggravation of
   the sin pressed by him relates not to the particular nature of it, but
   to this general command or prohibition, "You have done what I commanded
   you not." That the particular evil condemned was also against other
   special commands of God, is merely accidental to the general nature of
   the crime they were urged withal. And whereas God hath given out these
   rules and precepts, "You shall do whatever I command you, and according
   as I command you; you shall add nothing thereunto, nor take any thing
   therefrom," can the transgression of this rule be any otherwise
   expressed but thus, "They did the thing which he commanded not nor did
   it ever come into his heart?"

   It is said, that the intention of these rules and prohibitions is only
   to prevent the addition of what is contrary to what God hath appointed,
   and not of that which may tend to the furtherance and better discharge
   of his appointments. The usual answer to this acceptation is, that
   whatever is added is contrary to what is commanded, though not in this
   or that particular command, yet to that command that nothing be added.
   It is not the nature of any particular that is condemned, but the power
   of adding, in those prohibitions. Let us see, then, whether of these
   senses has the fairest evidence with the evident purport and intention
   of the rules, precepts, and prohibitions under consideration.

   Our Lord Jesus Christ directs his apostles to teach his disciples "to
   do and observe whatever he commanded them." Those who contend for the
   latter interpretation of those and the like precepts before mentioned,
   affirm that there is in these words a restriction of the matter of
   their commission to the express commands of Christ. What he commands,
   they say, they were to teach men to observe, and nothing else; nor will
   he require the observance of aught else at our hands. The others would
   have his intention to be, whatever he commanded, and whatever seemeth
   good to them to command, so it be not contrary unto what was by him
   commanded; as if he had said, "Teach men to observe whatever I command
   them; and command you them to observe whatever you think meet, so it be
   not contrary to my commands." Certainly this gloss at first view seems
   to defeat the main intendment of Christ, in that express limitation of
   their commission unto his own commands. So also under the Old
   Testament: giving order about his worship, the Lord lets Moses know
   that he must do all things according to what he should show and reveal
   unto him. In the close of the work committed unto him, to show what he
   had done was acceptable to God, it is eight or ten times repeated that
   he did all as the Lord commanded him; nothing was omitted, nothing
   added by him. That the same course might be observed in the following
   practice which was taken in the first institution, the Lord commands
   that nothing be added to what was so appointed by him, nothing
   diminished from it. The whole duty, then, of the church, as unto the
   worship of God, seems to lie in the precise observation of what is
   appointed and commanded by him. To assert things may be added to the
   worship of God not by him appointed, which, in the judgment of those
   that add them, seem useful for the better performance of what he hath
   appointed, so that they be not contrary unto them, seems to defeat the
   whole end and intention of God in all those rules and prohibitions, if
   either the occasion, rise, cause of them, or their commendable
   observance, be considered. On these and no better terms is that
   prescribed liturgy we treat of introduced and imposed. It comes from
   man, with authority to be added to the worship that Christ requires,
   and ventures on all the severe interdictions of such additions, armed
   only with the pretence of not being contrary to any particular command
   in the matter of it (which yet is denied), and such distinctions as
   have not the least ground in Scripture, or in the reason of the things
   themselves which it is applied unto. Might we divert into particulars,
   it were easy to demonstrate that the instances given in the Scripture
   of God's rejection of such additions do abundantly obviate all the
   pleas that are insisted on for the waiving of the general prohibition.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter VIII.

   Of the authority needful for the constituting and ordering of any thing
   that is to have relation to God and his worship -- Of the power and
   authority of civil magistrates -- The power imposing the liturgy -- The
   formal reason of religious obedience -- Use of the liturgy an act of
   civil, not religious obedience, Matt. xxviii. 20 -- No rule to judge of
   what is meet in the worship of God, but his word.

   Besides the regulation of all our proceedings and actions in the
   worship of God by the command and prohibitions insisted on in the
   foregoing chapter, there are two things indispensably necessary to
   render the prescription of any thing in religious worship allowable or
   lawful to be observed, both pointed unto by the testimonies produced;
   and these are, -- first, An authority to enjoin; and, secondly, A
   certain rule to try the injunction by.

   The worship of God is of that nature that whatsoever is performed in it
   is an act of religious obedience. That any thing may be esteemed such,
   it is necessary that the conscience be in it subject to the immediate
   authority of God. His authority alone renders any act of obedience
   religious. All authority is originally in God, and there are two ways
   whereby he is pleased to exert it:-- First, By a delegation of
   authority unto some persons for some ends and purposes; which they
   being invested withal, may command in their own names an observance of
   the things about which, by God's appointment, their authority is to be
   exercised. Thus is it with kings and rulers of the earth. They are
   powers ordained of God, having authority given them by him. And being
   invested with power, they give out their commands for the doing or
   performing of such or such things whereunto their authority doth
   extend. That they ought to be obeyed in things good and lawful, doth
   not arise from the authority vested in themselves, but from the
   immediate command of God that in such things they ought to be obeyed.
   Hence obedience in general unto magistrates is a part of our moral and
   religious obedience unto God, as it respects his command, whatever the
   nature and object of it be. But the performance of particular actions,
   wherein by their determination our obedience exerts itself, being
   resolved into that authority which is vested in them, is not religious
   but civil obedience, any otherwise than as in respect of its general
   nature it relates to the command of God in general. No act, I say, that
   we perform, whereof this is the formal reason, that it is appointed and
   commanded by man, though that man be intrusted with power from God to
   appoint and require acts of that nature, is an act of religious
   obedience unto God in itself, because it relates not immediately to his
   divine authority requiring that act.

   Secondly, God doth exert his authority immediately, and that either
   directly from heaven, as in the giving of the law, or by the
   inspiration of others to declare his will; unto both which his word
   written answereth. Now, whatever is done in obedience to the authority
   of God thus exerting itself is a part of that religious duty which we
   owe to God, whether it be in his first institution and appointment, or
   any duty in its primitive revelation, or whether it be in the commands
   he gives for the observation of what he hath formerly appointed; for
   when God hath commanded any things to be observed in his worship,
   though he design and appoint men to see them observed accordingly, and
   furnish them with the authority of commanding to that purpose, yet the
   interposition of that authority of men, though by God's institution,
   doth not at all hinder but that the duty performed is religious
   obedience, relating directly to the will and command of God. The power
   commanding in the case we have in hand is man's, not that of the Lord;
   for though it be acknowledged that those who do command have their
   authority from God, yet unless the thing commanded be also in
   particular appointed by God, the obedience that is yielded is purely
   civil, and not religious. This is the state of the matter under
   consideration: The commanding and imposing power is variously
   apprehended. Some say it is the church that doth it, and so assert the
   authority to be ecclesiastical. "Every church," say they, "hath power
   to order things of this nature for order and decency's sake." When it
   is inquired what the church is that they intend, then some are at a
   loss, and would fain insinuate somewhat into our thoughts that they
   dare not openly assert and maintain. The truth is, the church in this
   sense is the king, or the king and parliament, by whose advice he
   exerts his legislative power. By their authority was the liturgy
   composed, or it was composed without authority; by their authority it
   must be imposed, if it be imposed. What is or was done in the
   preparation of it by others, unto their judgment, hath no more
   influence into the authoritative imposition of it than the act of a
   person learned in the law, drawing up a bill for the consideration of
   parliament, hath into its binding law-power when confirmed. In this
   sense we acknowledge the power ordaining and imposing this liturgy to
   be of God, to be good and lawful, to be obeyed unto the utmost extent
   of that obedience which to man can be due, and that upon the account of
   the institution and command of God himself; but yet, supposing the
   liturgy to fall within the precincts and limits of that obedience, the
   observance and use of it, being not commanded of God, is purely an act
   of civil obedience, and not religious, wherein the conscience lies in
   no immediate subjection to Jesus Christ. It is of the same general
   nature with the honest discharge of the office of a constable; and this
   seems inconsistent with the nature of the worship of God.

   But whatever be the immediate imposing power, we have direction as to
   our duty in the last injunction of our blessed Saviour to his apostles,
   Matt. xxviii. 20, "Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I
   have commanded." In things which concern the worship of God, the
   commanding power is Christ, and his command the adequate rule and
   measure of our obedience. The teaching, commanding, and enjoining of
   others to do and observe those commands, is the duty of those intrusted
   with Christ's authority under him. Their commission to teach and
   enjoin, and our duty to do and observe, have the same rules, the same
   measure, bounds, and limits. What they teach and enjoin beyond what
   Christ hath commanded, they do it not by virtue of any commission from
   him; what we do beyond what he hath commanded, we do it not in
   obedience to him; -- what they so teach, they do it in their own name,
   not his; what we so do, we do in our own strength, not his, nor to his
   glory. The answer of Bellarmine to that argument of the protestant
   divines from this place, against the impositions of his church, is the
   most weak and frivolous that I think ever any learned man was forced to
   make use of; and yet where to find better will not easily occur. Our
   Lord Jesus Christ saith, "Go and teach men to observe whatsoever I have
   commanded you; and, lo, I am with you alway;" to which he subjoins, "It
   is true, but yet we are bound also to obey them that are set over us,
   -- that is, our church guides;" and so leaves the argument as
   sufficiently discharged! Now, the whole question is concerning what
   those church guides may teach and enjoin, whereunto we are to give
   obedience, which is here expressly restrained to the things commanded
   by Christ; to which the cardinal offers not one word. The things our
   Saviour treats about are principally the "agenda" of the gospel, --
   things to be done and observed in the worship of God. Of these, as was
   said, he makes his own command the adequate rule and measure: "Teach
   men to observe" panta hosa "all whatsoever I command." In their so
   doing alone doth he promise his presence with them; that is, to enable
   them unto the discharge of their duty. He commands, I say, all that
   shall to the end of the world be called to serve him in the work of the
   gospel, to "teach." In that expression he compriseth their whole duty,
   as their whole authority is given them in this commission. In their
   teaching, indeed, they are to command with all authority; and upon the
   non-obedience of men unto their teaching, either by not receiving their
   word, or by walking unworthy of it when it is received in the
   profession of it, he hath allotted them the course of their whole
   proceedings; but still requiring that all be regulated by what they are
   originally commissionated and enabled to teach and command. Let, then,
   the imposition of a liturgy be tried by this rule. It was never by
   Christ commanded to his apostles, cannot by any be taught as his
   command; and therefore men, in the teaching or imposing of it, have no
   promise of his presence, nor do they that observe it yield any
   obedience unto him therein. This, I am sure, will be the rule of
   Christ's inquiry at his great visitation at the last day, -- the things
   which himself hath commanded will be inquired after, as to some men's
   teachings, and all men's observation, and those only. And I cannot but
   admire with what peace and satisfaction to their own souls men can
   pretend to act as by commission from Christ, as the chief
   administrators of his gospel and worship on the earth, and make it
   their whole business almost to teach men to do and observe what he
   never commanded, and rigorously to inquire after and into the
   observation of their own commands, whilst those of the Lord Jesus are
   openly neglected.

   But let the authority of men for imposition be supposed to equal the
   fancy of any who through ignorance or interest are most devoted unto
   it, when they come to put their authority into execution, commanding
   things in and about the worship of God, I desire to know by what rule
   they are to proceed in their so doing. All the actions of men are or
   ought to be regular: good or evil they are, as they answer to or
   dissent from their proper rule. The rule in this matter must be the
   word of God, or their own prudence. Allow the former to be the rule, --
   that is, revealing what they ought to command, -- and there is a total
   end of this difference. What a rule the latter is like to prove is easy
   to conjecture; but there is no need of conjectures where experience
   interposeth. The great philosopher is blamed by some for inserting the
   determination of men wise and prudent into his definition of the rule
   of moral virtue; for they say, "That cannot be certainly known whose
   rule and measure is fluctuating and uncertain." If there be ground for
   this assertion in reference to moral virtues, whose seed and principles
   are inlaid in the nature of man, how much more is that rule to be
   questioned when applied to things whose spring and foundation lies
   merely in supernatural revelation? How various, uncertain, and
   tumultuating, how roving this pretended rule is like to prove, how
   short it comes to any one single property of a sufficient rule, much
   more of all things that are necessary to complete a rule of prorocecome
   [2] in such cases, were easy to demonstrate. What good and useful place
   that is like to obtain in the worship of God, which, having its rise in
   the authority of man, is framed by the rule of the wisdom of man, and
   so wholly resolved into his will, I may say will be one day judged and
   determined, but that it is so already sufficiently in the word of
   truth.

Chapter IX.

   Argument second -- Necessary use of the liturgy exclusive of the use of
   the means appointed by Christ for the edification of his church.

   We proceed to some farther considerations upon the state of the
   question before laid down, and shall insist on some other arguments
   against the imposition pleaded for. We have spoken to the authority
   imposing; our next argument is taken from the thing or matter imposed,
   and the end of that imposition.

   A human provision of means for the accomplishing of any end or ends in
   the worship of God for which Jesus Christ himself hath made and doth
   continue to make provision, to the exclusion of that provision so by
   him made, is not allowable. About this assertion I suppose we shall
   have no contention. To assert the lawfulness of such provisions is, in
   the first instance, to exalt the wisdom and authority of men above that
   of Christ, and that in his own house. This men will not nakedly and
   openly do, though by just consequence it be done everyday. But we have
   secured our proposition by the plainness of its terms, against which no
   exception can lie. It remaineth, then, that we show that the things
   mentioned in it, and rejected as disallowable, are directly applicable
   to the imposition of liturgies contended about.

   That the prescription of the liturgy, to be used as prescribed, is the
   provision of a means for the accomplishing of some ends in the worship
   of God, the judgment and the practice of those who contend for it do
   sufficiently declare. Those ends, or this end (to sum up all in one),
   is, that the ordinances and institutions of Christ may be quickly
   administered and solemnized in the church with decency and order, unto
   the edification of the assemblies wherein it is used. I suppose none
   will deny this to be the end intended in its imposition; it is so
   pleaded continually; nor is there any other that I know of assigned.
   Now, of the things mentioned it is the last that is the principal end,
   -- namely, the edification of the church; which is aimed at for its own
   sake, and so regulates the whole procedure of mere mediums, and those
   that are so mediums as also to be esteemed subordinate ends. Such are
   decency and order, or uniformity. These have not their worth from
   themselves, nor do they influence the intention of the liturgists for
   their own sakes, but as they tend unto edification; and this he
   apostolical rule expressly requireth, 1 Cor. xiv. The prescription,
   then, of a liturgy is a provision for the right administration of the
   ordinances of the gospel unto the edification of the church. This is
   its general nature; and in the administration of the ordinances of the
   gospel consists the chief and main work of the ministry. That this
   provision is human hath been before declared. It was not made by Christ
   nor his apostles, but of men; and by men was it made and imposed on the
   disciples of Christ. It remaineth, then, that we consider whether Jesus
   Christ have not made provision for the same end and purpose, -- namely,
   that the ordinances and institutions of the gospel may be administered
   to the edification of the church. Now, this the apostle expressly
   affirms, Eph. iv. 7-13, "Unto every one of us is given grace according
   to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, When he
   ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.
   And he gave some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the
   saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of
   Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the
   knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of
   the stature of the fulness of Christ." The Lord Jesus, who hath
   appointed the office of the ministry, hath also provided sufficient
   furniture for the persons called according to his mind to the discharge
   of that office and the whole duty of it. That the administration of the
   ordinances of the gospel is the work of the ministry, I suppose will
   not be denied. Now, that this work of the ministry may be discharged to
   the edification of his body, and that to the end of the world, until
   all his people in every generation are brought unto the measure of
   grace assigned unto them in this life, is expressly affirmed. He hath
   given gifts for this end and purpose, -- namely, that the work of the
   ministry may be performed to the edification of his body. To say that
   the provision he hath made is not every way sufficient for the
   attaining of the end for which it was made by him, or that he
   continueth not to make the same provision that he did formerly, are
   equally blasphemous; the one injurious to his wisdom, the other to his
   truth, both to his love and care of his church. For decency and
   uniformity in all his churches the Lord Jesus also hath provided. The
   administration of the same specifical ordinances in the assemblies of
   his disciples, convened according to his mind, according to the same
   rule of his word, by virtue of the same specifical gifts of the Spirit
   by him bestowed on the administrators of them, constitutes the
   uniformity that he requires, and is acceptable unto him. This was the
   uniformity of the apostolical churches, walking by the same rule of
   faith and obedience, and no other; and this is all the uniformity that
   is among the true churches of Christ that are this day in the world. To
   imagine that there should be a uniformity in words and phrases of
   speech, and the like, is an impracticable figment, which never was
   obtained, nor ever will be to the end of the world. And when men, by
   the invention of rites and orders, began to depart from this
   uniformity, how far they were from falling into any other is notorious
   from that discourse of Socrates on this matter, lib. v. cap. 21. For
   these, then, the Lord Christ hath made provision. And where there is
   this uniformity unto edification, let those things be attended unto
   which are requisite for the nature of assemblies meeting for such ends,
   as assemblies, and all the decency and order which Christ requireth
   will ensue. I suppose it will not be safe for any man to derogate from
   the sufficiency of this provision. If any shall say, that we see and
   find by experience that men called to be ministers are not so enabled
   to the work of the ministry as, by virtue of the gifts they have
   received, to administer the ordinances of the gospel unto the
   edification of the church, I shall desire them to consider whether
   indeed such persons be rightly called unto the ministry, and do labour
   aright to discharge their duty in that office; seeing that if they are
   so and do so, there seems to be a direct failure of the promise of
   Christ, which is blasphemy to imagine. And it may be considered whether
   this pretended defect and want do not, where it is in those who are
   indeed called to the work of the ministry, proceed from their neglect
   to stir up the gifts that they have received by the use and exercise of
   them; for which end alone they are intrusted with them. And it may be
   farther considered, whether their neglect hath not been occasioned
   greatly by some men's imposing of prescribed liturgies, and others
   trusting to their use in those things and for those ends for which men
   are intrusted with those gifts by Jesus Christ. And if this be so, --
   as indeed, upon due search, it will appear so to be, -- then we have a
   secret inclusion of the provision made by Christ for the ends mentioned
   plainly intimated unto us, before we arrive at the express
   consideration of it.

   But to proceed. The provision that Christ hath made for the discharge
   of the whole work of the ministry, in the administration of the
   ordinances of the gospel, unto the edification of his church, is his
   collation or bestowing of gifts on men rightly called to the office of
   the ministry, enabling them unto, and to be exercised in, that work. In
   the prescription and imposition of a liturgy, there is a provision made
   for the discharge of the work of the ministry, in the administration of
   the ordinances of the gospel, unto the edification of the church, in
   and by the precise reading and pronouncing of the words set down
   therein, without alteration, diminution, or addition. It remaineth,
   then, to consider whether this latter provision be not exclusive of the
   former, and whether the use of them both at the same time be not
   inconsistent. The administration of gospel ordinances consists in
   prayer, thanksgiving, instruction, and exhortations, suitably applied
   unto the special nature and end of the several ordinances themselves,
   and the use of them in the church. For the right performance of all
   these, Christ gives gifts unto ministers; the liturgy [gives] a certain
   number of words, to be read without addition or alteration, and this
   "toties quoties" as the ordinances are to be administered. Now, unless
   it can be made to appear that an ability to read the prescribed words
   of the liturgy be the gifts promised by Christ for the discharge of the
   work of the ministry, which cannot be done, it is most evident that
   there is an inconsistency between the use and actual exercise of these
   several provisions of mediums for the compassing of the same end; and,
   consequently, the necessary, indispensable use of the liturgy is
   directly exclusive of the use of the means provided by Christ, and for
   that end for which the liturgy is invented and imposed. What dismal
   effects have issued hereupon may be declared hereafter, if need be.
   Certainly more than one commandment of God, and more than one promise
   of Christ, have been made void by this tradition; and I desire that
   none would be offended if, as my own apprehension, I affirm that the
   introduction of liturgies was, on the account insisted on, the
   principal means of increasing and carrying on that sad defection and
   apostasy, in the guilt whereof most churches in the world have
   inwrapped themselves. Nor doth there lie at present any relief against
   this consideration from hence, that ministers are allowed the exercise
   of their gifts they have received in their preaching, and prayers
   before and after sermons. For, first, that indeed there is such a
   liberty allowed, if the present liturgy be so imposed as by some is
   pretended, is very questionable. Many that are looked on as skilled in
   that law and mystery of it do by their practice give another
   interpretation of the intendment of its imposition, making it extend to
   all that is done in the public worship, the bare preaching or reading
   of a sermon or homily excepted. Nor, secondly, is that the matter
   inquired into, whether ministers may at any time, or in any part of
   God's worship, make use of their gifts? but whether they may do it in
   all those administrations, for whose performance, to the edification of
   his body, they are bestowed on them by Jesus Christ? which, by the rule
   of the liturgy, we have showed they may not; and I doubt not but it
   will be granted, by those who contend for the imposition of the
   liturgy, that it extends to the principal parts, if not the whole, of
   the public worship of God in the church. Now, certainly, it is
   necessary that conscience be clearly satisfied that this prescription
   of a human provision of means for such ends in the worship of God as
   Christ hath made provision for, which is excluded thereby, be not
   against express rule of Scripture, Ezek. xliii. 8; Matt. xv. 9; Col.
   ii. 20-22; without precedent or example; derogatory to the glory of
   Christ, Heb. iii. 5, 6, and, in particular, of his truth, wisdom, and
   love of his church, as also to the perfection of the Scripture, 2 Tim.
   iii. 15, 16; -- and whether it brings not the ministers of the gospel
   into open sin, Rom. xii. 6-8; 1 Cor. xii. 6-10; Eph. iv. 8, 11, 12; 1
   Pet. iv. 10, 11; and so be an occasion of the wrath of God and ruin of
   the souls of men, before they admit of it or submit unto it.

Chapter X.

   Other considerations about the imposition of liturgies.

   Furthermore, the great rule of gospel administrations is, that all
   things be done to edification. This is the main end of the ministry
   itself, in all the duties thereof that are purely evangelical. For this
   end was the office of the ministry instituted; for this end are
   ministerial gifts dispensed; for this end were the sacraments
   appointed, and all church assemblies, church power, and whatever else
   belongs to churches. It is all ordained for this end, that the body of
   Christ may be "edified" and "increased with the increase of God," Eph.
   iv. 7, 8, 11-15; Col. ii. 19; Acts ix. 31; Rom. xiv. 15, 19; 1 Cor. x.
   23, xiv. 3-5, 12, 26; 2 Cor. xii. 19; 1 Tim. i. 4. The full and
   adequate rule of all church order and duties is, that all things be
   done to edification. It doth not hence ensue that whatever men shall
   judge to conduce to edification may be used by themselves or imposed on
   others in the worship of God. Christ himself, the only wise and
   competent judge in such cases, hath precisely himself determined what
   is conducing hereunto, having, as on other accounts, so on this also,
   limited men to his prescription, because nothing is effectual unto
   edification but by virtue of his blessing, which is annexed only to his
   own institutions. But this will undeniably hence ensue, that whatever
   is contrary unto or a hinderance of edification, ought not to be
   appointed or observed in the worship of God; for certainly whatever is
   a hinderance of that, in any kind, unto whose furtherance all things of
   that kind ought to contribute, their whole worth and virtue consisting
   in that contribution, can have no due place amongst them. If it appear
   that this is the state and condition of this imposed liturgy in church
   administrations, I presume it will be confessed that it ought not to
   obtain any place or room amongst them. The edification of the church
   depends principally on the blessing of God upon the exercise of those
   ministerial gifts which are bestowed on men for that end, -- namely,
   that he church be edified. God supplying "seed to the sower" blesseth
   it with an increase in the field where it is sowed, 2 Cor. ix. 10. The
   gifts that are bestowed on ministers are their principal talents, that
   they ought to trade withal for the profit of their Master; that is, the
   building up of his house, wherein his wealth in this world doth lie.
   Yea, all the gifts that are bestowed by the Spirit of Christ on man are
   given them "to profit withal," 1 Cor. xii. 7; and they are required
   with them to act for God in the edification of the body of Christ,
   everyone according to his measure, 1 Pet. iv. 10, 11. This, I suppose,
   will be granted. Moreover, that the gifts bestowed by Christ on the
   guides of his church, the ministers of the gospel, are proportioned and
   suited to the end which he aimeth to accomplish by them, as we have in
   part before declared, so it is evident from the infinite wisdom of him
   that bestows them. From both which it will undeniably follow, that on
   the due and regular use and employment of those gifts which men receive
   from Christ depends, and that solely, the edification of his church. I
   suppose this will not be denied, [that] where the gifts bestowed by the
   Spirit of Christ upon the ministers of his church are used and
   exercised in the work of the ministry, according to his mind and will,
   there, by his blessing, the edification which he doth intend will
   ensue. Let us, then, proceed. These gifts, as the Scripture witnesseth
   and experience convinceth, are bestowed in great variety and in several
   degrees. The greater and more excellent they are in any intrusted with
   them, the more excellent is the means of edification which the Lord
   affords unto his disciples by them. Edification, then, as in its
   general nature it depends on the gifts of Christ which he bestows on
   the officers of his church, so as to the degrees of it and its special
   furtherance, it depends on the degrees and special improvement of those
   gifts. For this cause all those to whom the work of the ministry is
   committed, as they ought to "desire spiritual gifts," 1 Cor. xiv. 1,
   that the church may be edified by them, so to "covet earnestly the best
   gifts," chap. xii. 31, that they may singularly edify the church; and
   also seek to excel in those gifts, chap. xiv. 20, that the same word of
   edification may be carried on to the utmost. It may, then, be inquired
   how these spiritual gifts, -- which we must suppose all ministers of
   the gospel, in some measure, to have received, -- may be improved, so
   that they may "excel to the edifying of the church," which is expressly
   required of them. We say, then, that the improvement and increase of
   spiritual gifts doth ordinarily and regularly depend on their due and
   holy exercise. He that had a talent and used it not, though he
   endeavoured to keep it safe, yet it did not increase, when every one
   that traded with the stock wherewith they were intrusted made a regular
   increase, according to the measure they had received. And in experience
   we daily see men napkining their talents until they are taken from
   them, whilst others receive additions to their store, at least such
   supplies as that their first provisions fail not. Hence, the great
   direction for the exercise of the work of the ministry is, to stir up
   the gift received; by a due performance whereof, in all persons
   intrusted with them, is the whole work of edifying the body of Christ,
   until it reach the measure appointed to every member, completed and
   finished. Edification, then, depends on the improvement of gifts, and
   the improvement of gifts on their due exercise according to the mind of
   Christ. The want, then, of that due exercise, either by the neglect of
   them on whom they are bestowed, or any hinderance of it put upon them
   by others, is the sole way of obstructing the improvement of spiritual
   gifts, and, by direct and immediate consequence, of the edification of
   the church. Now, this seems to be so much done by the prescription of
   the liturgy and imposition of it, that it is impossible for the wit of
   man to invent a more effectual expedient for the compassing of that
   evil end. The main exercise of spiritual gifts, on which their growth
   and improvement doth depend, lies in the administration of gospel
   ordinances; that is, the work of the ministry, for which they are
   bestowed. To hinder, therefore, or forbid that exercise is directly to
   forbid the due, regular, appointed means of their increase; and so,
   also, of the edification of the body of Christ, the means indispensably
   necessary unto it being removed and taken away. Now, this is open and
   avowedly done in the imposed liturgy, if imposed. It says expressly
   that the ministers of the gospel shall not use or exercise any
   spiritual gift in the administration of those ordinances for which
   provision is made in the book.

   And as in this case the condition of the people, who are deprived of
   the means of their edification, is sad, so that of the ministers of the
   gospel is miserable and deplorable. The Lord Jesus Christ bestows gifts
   upon them, requiring the use and exercise of them in the work of the
   ministry at their utmost peril; men, on the other side, forbid them
   that use and exercise, and that with such forcible prohibitions as
   threaten to bear down the whole public exercise of the ministry before
   them. But the Lord knows how to deliver those that are his out of
   temptation. It will be no relief against the force of this
   consideration, that there are some things left wherein ministers may
   exercise their gifts and trade with their talents; for as this is but
   pretended, so it is not in this or that part of their work, but in the
   whole of the ministry committed unto them, that Christ indispensably
   requires the guides of his church that they should trade with their
   talents and exercise their gifts; and accordingly are they to provide
   for their account at the last day. By this one engine, then, at the
   same time, are the people deprived of the means of edification provided
   for them in the care, wisdom, and love of the Lord Christ, and
   ministers brought into a necessity of sinning, or foregoing the public
   exercise of their ministry.

   Again, in particular, it is the work and duty of the ministers of the
   gospel to make application of the grace of Christ, whereof they are
   stewards, to the flocks committed to their charge, and that according
   to the especial state and condition of all especial wants which may any
   way be known unto them. The way of their application of this grace lies
   principally in the administration of gospel ordinances. Therein are
   they to declare, unfold, tender, and apply the grace of Christ,
   according unto the wants of his disciples, the good of whose souls they
   watch for in particular. These wants are very far from being the same,
   in the same degree, in and unto every congregation, or unto any one
   congregation at all times, or unto all persons in any congregation;
   which is easily discerned by a faithful and skilful guide. The especial
   application, then, mentioned, according to the rule of the gospel, and
   special addresses unto God in the name of the flock, with respect to
   the especial wants of all or any of them, belong to that edification
   which Christ hath appointed for his church. Now, how this duty can be
   attended unto in the observance of a prescribed form of liturgy, from
   whence it is not lawful to digress, is beyond my understanding to
   apprehend. I confess, men who scoff at edification and deride spiritual
   gifts, who think all religion to consist in the observation of some
   carnal institution, who neither know nor care to come to an
   acquaintance with the spiritual wants of poor souls, nor do tremble at
   the threatenings of Christ pointed against their negligence and
   ignorance, Ezek. xxxiv. 4; that suppose the whole baptized world
   converted to God, and preaching itself, on that account, less necessary
   than formerly at the first plantation of the gospel; that esteem the
   doubts and temptations of believers as needless scruples, and their
   sedulous endeavours to grow in grace and the knowledge of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, labour lost in hypocrisy; that perhaps do envy at and are
   troubled with the light and knowledge of the people of God, and suppose
   they can discharge the duty of the ministry by a bare reading of the
   service-book to their parish, by themselves, or some hired by them so
   to do, without once inquiring into the spiritual condition of them the
   care of whose souls they plead to be committed to them, -- may think
   light of this consideration: but those who know the terror of the Lord,
   and any thing of their own duty, will be otherwise minded. Yea,
   farther, there seems to be in the imposition of a liturgy, to be used
   always as a form in all gospel administrations, an unwarrantable
   abridgment of the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and
   therefore sin in the imposition and use of it; for as it is a sin in
   others to abridge us of the liberty purchased for us by Jesus Christ,
   so it is in us to give it up, and not to suffer in our testimony for
   it. Now, of that liberty purchased for us by Jesus Christ, so far as it
   relates to the worship of God, there are two parts, -- first, A freedom
   from those pedagogical institutions of God himself, which by his own
   appointment were to continue only to the time of reformation; secondly,
   A freedom from subjection to the authority of men as to any new
   impositions in or about the worship of God, 1 Cor. vii. 23. And the
   same rule is given out as to our duty and deportment in reference unto
   both these, Gal. v. 1; 1 Pet. ii. 16. Now, not to stand fast in the
   liberty for us purchased by Christ, is not to have that esteem of it as
   a privilege given us by his love we ought to have, nor that sense of it
   as a duty enjoined us by him which ought to be in us. I say, there is
   the same reason of both these in respect of liberty. As we are freed
   from Mosaical institutions, so that none can impose the observation of
   them upon us by virtue of their first appointment, so are we also from
   any succeeding impositions of men. Our liberty equally respects the one
   and the other. And as to those institutions, such was the tenderness of
   the Holy Ghost and the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, by his
   directions and guidance, that they would not (no, not for a season)
   enjoin the observance of any of them (no, not of those which put men on
   no positive duties, but were mere abridgments in point of some
   practices) upon the disciples of Christ, but only such whose
   observation for that season was made necessary by reason of scandals
   and offences before any such imposition of theirs, Acts xv. Nor, by a
   parity of reason, if regard be had to their example, can there any
   abridgment be lawfully made of the liberty of Christ's disciples by any
   imposition of things of the latter sort, unless it be as to the
   observation of some such things as are made necessary in case of
   scandal antecedent unto any such imposition. We grant, then, that there
   may be, yea, there ought "de facto" to be, an abridgment made of our
   liberty as to the performance of some things at some times, which in
   general we are made free unto, where that performance, in the use and
   exercise of our liberty, would prove a hinderance unto edification, the
   great end whereunto all these things are subservient. But then the case
   must be so stated antecedent to any imposition. First to impose that
   which is not necessary, and then to assert a necessity of its
   observation lest scandal should ensue, is a course that men are not
   directed unto by any gospel rule or apostolical practice. The sum is,
   That abridgment of the liberty of the disciples of Christ, by
   impositions on them of things which he hath not appointed, nor made
   necessary by circumstances antecedent unto such impositions, are plain
   usurpations upon the consciences of the disciples of Christ,
   destructive of the liberty which he hath purchased for them, and which,
   if it be their duty to walk according to gospel rule, is sinful to
   submit unto. That of this nature is the imposition of a liturgy
   contended about is evident. It hath no institution or appointment by
   Jesus Christ, it is wholly of men; there is nothing antecedent unto its
   imposition that should make it necessary to be imposed; a necessity of
   its observation is induced upon and by its imposition, which is
   directly destructive to our liberty in Jesus Christ. The necessity
   pretended from the insufficiency of ministers for the discharge of that
   which is their proper work hath in great part been caused by this
   imposition, and where it hath not, some men's sin is not to be made
   other men's punishment. Reasons pleaded for the imposition opposed
   shall be elsewhere considered.
