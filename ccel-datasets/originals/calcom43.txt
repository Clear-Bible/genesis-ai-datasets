   TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE

   IT may be natural to inquire why the Epistles to Timothy and Titus have
   been less copiously illustrated by popular Commentaries than the other
   writings of the Apostle Paul. The reason probably is, that they are
   addressed chiefly to office-bearers, and not to private members of the
   Church; though they abound largely in those doctrinal statements and
   practical instructions which every Christian ought carefully to study.

   While fewer expositors than might have been desired have devoted their
   labors to this portion of the word of God, the leading subject of it
   has been ably handled in a different form. Not to mention the early
   Fathers, it is sufficient to name "The Pastoral Care," "The Reformed
   Pastor," and other kindred works, which have taken their rank among the
   standard volumes of Christian Theology. Besides elaborate treatises,
   extending over the whole field of ministerial labor, detached parts of
   it have been sometimes selected for separate illustration. Of every
   collection of books fitted to make

   "the man of God perfect, thoroughly prepared
   for every good work," (2 Timothy 3:17)

   a goodly portion relates to the duties of the pastorate. It has been of
   unspeakable importance to the interests of religion, and ought to be
   recorded to the praise of divine grace, that the valuable instructions
   on this subject to which readers have access derive additional weight
   from the holy lives and devoted zeal of their authors, who have only
   inculcated on others what they had faithfully practiced. To all whose
   views are directed to the sacred office, or who have already been
   invested with it, the perusal of such books must be exceedingly
   advantageous.

   Yet here, as in everything else, let us appeal

   "to the law and to the testimony."( Isaiah 8:20.)

   The foundation of every code of rules for guiding the ministers of
   Christ must be sought, not in the judgments of uninspired men, however
   able and judicious, but in the Holy Scriptures, and chiefly in the
   Epistles to Timothy and Titus, the accurate interpretation of which is
   therefore unspeakably valuable. Calvin has examined them with his usual
   skill, and will be heard with profound attention. His candor appears to
   more than ordinary advantage. Never does he press the words of the Holy
   Spirit beyond what appears to him to be their natural meaning, or
   depart from the rigid discharge of his task as an expositor for the
   sake of giving undue prominence to his peculiar views. On this point it
   may be sufficient to refer to his remarks on the authority which some
   ministers of the gospel appear to have exercised over others, as a
   specimen of his unshaken determination to adhere to the sacred records,
   and of his utter indifference to any use that might be made of such
   statements by those whose views of church-government differed from his
   own. Nowhere is his sterling honesty more conspicuous.

   The notes to the present volume are enriched by numerous extracts from
   a rare work -- the Author's Sermons on the two Epistles to Timothy. But
   for the strong and general desire that posterity should listen to this
   great preacher, those Sermons would never have seen the light. They
   were written down, as they flowed from his lips, in the same manner as
   the extemporaneous Latin expositions of which some account has been
   given elsewhere. While they are Expository Discourses, leaving no part
   of the two Epistles unexplored, they are addressed to the great body of
   the Christian people, and are distinguished by those homely and
   striking appeals, and that marvelous felicity of language, which even
   his biographer Audin reluctantly ascribes to him.

   TO THE MOST NOBLE AND TRULY CHRISTIAN PRINCE,

   EDWARD, DUKE OF SOMERSET,

   EARL OF HERTFORD, etc. PROTECTOR OF ENGLAND
   AND IRELAND, AND ROYAL TUTOR,

   JOHN CALVIN

   OFFERS HIS SALUTATIONS.

   The brilliant reputation, most noble Prince, not only of your other
   virtues, altogether heroic, but especially of your distinguished piety,
   produces so warm a love of you in the hearts of all good men, even of
   those to whom you are unknown by face, that you must unavoidably be
   regarded with extraordinary affection and reverence by all right-minded
   persons in the kingdom of England, on whom hath been bestowed the
   privilege, not only of beholding with their eyes those benefits which
   are admired by others who only hear of them, but likewise of reaping
   all the advantage which a most excellent governor can confer on the
   whole body of the people, and on every one of its members. Nor is there
   any reason why the praises bestowed on you should be suspected of
   falsehood, as if they proceeded from flatterers; for a clear proof of
   them is to be found in your actions.

   When a pupil belongs to private life, and his wealth is moderate, the
   work of a tutor is attended by difficulty; but you hold the office of
   tutor, not of the King only, but of a very large kingdom, and you
   discharge that office with such wisdom and skill, that all are
   astonished at your success. That your virtue might not shine merely
   amidst the laws, and in a peaceful state of the commonwealth, God has
   exhibited it to view in war also, which has hitherto been conducted by
   you with not less prosperity and valor.

   Yet the great and numerous difficulties which every person readily
   perceived that you had experienced did not hinder you from making the
   restoration of religion your principal object. That consideration is
   certainly not less advantageous to the public benefit of the kingdom
   than it is worthy of a Prince; for then do kingdoms enjoy solid
   prosperity and faithful guardianship, when he, on whom they were
   founded, and by whom they are preserved -- the Son of God himself --
   rules over them. Thus you could not have established more firmly the
   kingdom of England than by banishing idols and setting up there the
   pure worship of God; for the true doctrine of godliness, which had too
   long been crushed and buried by the sacrilegious tyranny of the Roman
   Antichrist, cannot but be restored; and what is that, but to place
   Christ on his throne? And this act, which in itself is excellent, is so
   much the more praiseworthy on account of the small number of rulers in
   the present day who own the subjection of their high rank to the
   spiritual scepter of Christ.

   It was therefore a high advantage to this illustrious King, that such a
   person, related to him by blood, was the guide of his youth; for,
   although the noble character of his mind is universally applauded, yet,
   in training him to habits of manly firmness, and in regulating the
   English Church, so long as his tender age does not permit him to
   discharge these duties, such an instructor was much needed. And I doubt
   not that even now he acknowledges that you were given to him by the
   peculiar kindness of God, in order that he might soon afterwards
   receive his affairs from your hands in excellent condition.

   For my own part, neither the distance of place nor my humble rank could
   prevent me from congratulating you on your distinguished success in
   promoting the glory of Christ. And since it has pleased God to make me
   one of those by whose labors and exertions he has, in the present day,
   given to the world the doctrine of the gospel in greater purity than
   before, why should I not, however widely I am separated from you,
   express as strongly as I can my reverence for you, who have been
   appointed, through the extraordinary kindness of God, to be the
   defender and protector of that very doctrine? And since I had no other
   proof of it to give, I thought that, at least as an earnest of my
   regard, it was my duty to offer to you my Commentaries on two of Paul's
   Epistles. Nor have I selected at random the gift that I should offer,
   but, in the exercise of my judgment, have selected that which appeared
   to me to be the most suitable. Here Paul admonishes his beloved Timothy
   by what kind of doctrine he must edify the Church of God, what vices
   and enemies he must resist, and how many annoyances he must endure. He
   exhorts him to give way to no difficulties, to vanquish all dangers by
   courage, to restrain by authority the licentiousness of wicked men, and
   not to bestow gifts through eagerness to obtain their favor. In short,
   in these two Epistles we have the true government of the Church set
   before us in a lively picture.

   Now, since in order to restore the English Church, which, along with
   almost every other part of Christendom, had been miserably corrupted by
   the shocking wickedness of Popery, you employ your strenuous efforts
   under the direction of your King, and for that purpose have many
   Timothys under your charge, neither they nor you can direct your holy
   transactions in a more profitable manner than by taking the rule here
   laid down by Paul for your pattern. For there is nothing in them that
   is not highly applicable to our times, and hardly anything that is
   necessary in the building of the Church that may not likewise be drawn
   from them. I trust that my labor will, at least, afford some
   assistance; but I choose that this should be known by experience rather
   than that I should boast of it in words. If you, most noble Prince,
   shall approve of it, I shall have abundant reason for congratulating
   myself; and your remarkable kindness does not permit me to doubt that
   you will take in good part that service which I now perform.

   May the Lord, in whose hand are the ends of the earth, long uphold the
   safety and prosperity of the kingdom of England, adorn its illustrious
   King with the royal spirit, bestow on him a large measure of all
   blessings, and grant to you grace to persevere happily in your noble
   course, that through you his renown may be more and more widely
   extended.

   Geneva, 25th July 1556.

   THE ARGUMENT

   ON

   THE FIRST EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY

   This Epistle appears to me to have been written more for the sake of
   others than for the sake of Timothy, and that opinion will receive the
   assent of those who shall carefully consider the whole matter. I do
   not, indeed, deny that Paul intended also to teach and admonish him;
   but my view of the Epistle is, that it contains many things which it
   would have been superfluous to write, if he had had to deal with
   Timothy alone. He was a young man, not yet clothed with that authority
   which would have been sufficient for restraining the headstrong men
   that rose up against him. It is manifest, from the words used by Paul,
   that there were at that time some who were prodigiously inclined to
   ostentation, and for that reason would not willingly yield to any
   person, and who likewise burned with such ardent ambition, that they
   would never have ceased to disturb the Church, had not a greater than
   Timothy interposed. It is likewise manifest, that there were many
   things to be adjusted at Ephesus, and that needed the approbation of
   Paul, and the sanction of his name. Having therefore intended to give
   advice to Timothy on many subjects, he resolved at the same time to
   advise others under the name of Timothy.

   In the first chapter, he attacks some ambitious persons who made their
   boast of discussing idle questions. It may readily be concluded that
   they were Jews, who, while they pretended to have zeal for the law,
   disregarded edification, and attended only to frivolous disputes. It is
   an intolerable profanation of the law of God, to draw out of it nothing
   that is profitable, but merely to pick up materials for talking and to
   abuse the pretense of it for the purpose of burdening the Church with
   contemptible trifles.

   Longer shall enough have such corruptions prevailed in Popery; for what
   else was the scholastic theology than a huge chaos of empty and useless
   speculations? And in our own day there are many who in order to display
   their acuteness in handling the word of God, allow themselves to sport
   with it in the same manner as if it were profane philosophy. Paul
   undertakes to support Timothy in the correction of this vice, and
   points out what is the principal instruction to be derived from the
   Law; that it may be evident that they who use the Law in a different
   manner are corrupters of it.

   Next, that his authority may not be despised, after having acknowledged
   his unworthiness he, at the same time, asserts in lofty terms what he
   became through the grace of God. At length he concludes the chapter by
   a solemn threatening, by means of which he both confirms Timothy in
   sound doctrine and a good conscience, and fills others with terror and
   alarm, by holding out to them the example of Hymenaeus and Alexander.

   In the second chapter, he enjoins that public prayers be offered to God
   for all men, and especially for princes and magistrates; and here, in
   passing, he likewise makes a remark on the advantage which the world
   derives from civil government. He then mentions the reason why we ought
   to pray for all men; namely, that God, by exhibiting to all the gospel
   and Christ the Mediator, shews that he wishes all men to be saved; and
   he likewise confirms this statement by his own apostleship, which was
   specially appointed to the Gentiles. Next, he invites all men, whatever
   may be their country or place of abode, to pray to God; and takes
   occasion for inculcating that modesty and subjection which females
   ought to maintain in the holy assembly.

   In the third chapter, after having declared the excellence of the
   bishop's office, he delineates a true bishop, and enumerates the
   qualifications required in him. Next, he describes the qualifications
   of deacons, and of the wives both of deacons and of bishops. And in
   order that Timothy may be more diligent and conscientious in observing
   all things, he reminds him what it is to be employed in the government
   of "the Church, which is the house of God, and the pillar of truth."
   Finally, he mentions the chief and fundamental point of all heavenly
   doctrine -- that which relates to the Son of God manifested in the
   flesh; in comparison of which all things else, to which he perceived
   that ambitious men were wholly devoted, should be reckoned of no value.

   As to what follows, in the beginning of the fourth chapter, the false
   doctrines about forbidding marriage and various kinds of food, and the
   absurd fables which are at variance with this doctrine, are severely
   condemned by him. Next, he adds, that he and all good men, who hold
   this doctrine, have none for their adversaries but those who cannot
   endure that men shall place their trust in the living God. At the close
   of the chapter, he again fortifies Timothy by a new exhortation.

   In the fifth chapter, after having recommended modesty and gentleness
   in reproofs, he reasons about widows, who at that time were admitted
   into the service of the Church. He enjoins that they shall not be
   received indiscriminately, but only those who, having been approved
   throughout their whole life, are arrived at sixty years of age, and
   have no domestic tie. Hence he passes on to the elder's, and explains
   how they ought to conduct themselves, both in their manner of life and
   in the exercise of discipline. This doctrine the Apostle seals by a
   solemn oath, and again forbids him to admit any one heedlessly into the
   office of the eldership. [1] He exhorts him to drink wine, instead of
   water, for the preservation of his health. At the close of the chapter,
   he exhorts him to defer pronouncing judgment on concealed
   transgressions.

   In the sixth chapter, he gives instruction concerning the duty of
   servants, and takes occasion to make a vehement attack on false
   teachers, who, by disputing about unprofitable speculations, are more
   eager for gain than for edification, and shews that covetousness is a
   most deadly plague. He then returns to a solemn charge similar to the
   former, that the exhortations which he now gives to Timothy may not be
   ineffectual. Lastly, after having taken a passing notice of riches, he
   again forbids Timothy to entangle himself with useless doctrines.

   As to the ordinary Greek inscription, which states that this Epistle
   was written from Laodicea, I do not agree with it; for since Paul,
   writing to the Colossians while he was a prisoner, affirms that he had
   never seen the Laodiceans, those who hold the opinion, which I reject,
   are constrained to make two Laodiceas in Asia Minor, though only one is
   mentioned by historians. Besides, when Paul went into Macedonia, he
   left Timothy at Ephesus, as he expressly declares. He wrote this
   Epistle either on the road, before he arrived there, or after having
   returned from the journey. Now Laodicea is evidently at a greater
   distance from Macedonia than Ephesus is; and it is not probable that
   Paul, on his return, went to Laodicea, passing by Ephesus, especially
   since there were many reasons that urged him to visit it; and therefore
   I rather think that he wrote it from some other place. But this is not
   a matter of so much importance that I should wish to debate it with
   those who are of an opposite opinion. Let every person follow his own
   judgment. I only point out what -- at least in my opinion -- is more
   probable.

   COMMENTARIES ON

   THE FIRST EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY

   CHAPTER 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Timothy 1:1-4

   1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our
   Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;

   1. Paulus apostolus Iesu Christi secundum ordinationem Dei Salvatoris
   nostri, et Domini Iesu Christi spei nostrae:

   2. Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from
   God our Father, and Jesus Christ our Lord.

   2. Timotheo germano filio in fide, gratia, misericordia, pax a Deo
   Patre nostro, et Christo Iesu Domino Nostro.

   3. As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into
   Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other
   doctrine.

   3. Qeumadmodum rogavi te ut maneres Ephesi, quum proficiscerer in
   Macedoniam, volo denunties quibusdam, ne aliter doceant;

   4. Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister
   questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do

   4. Neque attendant fabulis et genealogiis nunquam finiendis, quae
   quaestiones praebent magis quam aedificationem Dei, quae in fide
   consistit.

   1 Paul an apostle If he had written to Timothy alone, it would have
   been unnecessary to claim this designation, and to maintain it in the
   manner that he does. Timothy would undoubtedly have been satisfied with
   having merely the name; for he knew that Paul was an Apostle of Christ,
   and had no need of proof to convince him of it, being perfectly
   willing, and having been long accustomed, to acknowledge it. He has his
   eye, therefore, chiefly on others, who were not so ready to listen to
   him, or did not so easily believe his words. For the sake of such
   persons, that they may not treat lightly what he writes, he affirms
   that he is "an Apostle of Christ."

   According to the Appointment of God our Savior, and of the Lord Jesus
   Christ He confirms his apostleship by the appointment or command of
   God; for no man can make himself to be an apostle, but he whom God hath
   appointed is a true apostle, and worthy of the honor. Nor does he
   merely say, that he owes his apostleship to God the Father, but
   ascribes it to Christ also; and, indeed, in the government of the
   Church, the Father does nothing but through the Son, and therefore they
   both act together.

   He calls God the Savior, a title which he is more frequently accustomed
   to assign to the Son; but it belongs to the Father also, because it is
   he who gave the Son to us. Justly, therefore, is the glory of our
   salvation ascribed to him. For how comes it that we are saved? It is
   because the Father loved us in such a manner that he determined to
   redeem and save us through the Son. He calls Christ our hope; and this
   appellation is strictly applicable to him; for then do we begin to have
   good hope, when we look to Christ, since in him alone dwells all that
   on which our salvation rests.

   2 To Timothy my own son This commendation expresses no small praise.
   Paul means by it, that he owns Timothy to be a true and not a bastard
   son, and wishes that others should acknowledge him to be such; and he
   even applauds Timothy in the same manner as if he were another Paul.
   But how does this agree with the injunction given by Christ, (Matthew
   23:9,) "Call no man your father on the earth?"

   Or how does it agree with the declaration of the Apostle,

   "Though ye have many fathers according to the flesh, yet there is but
   One who is the Father of spirits." (1 Corinthians 4:15; Hebrews 12:9.)
   [2]

   I reply, while Paul claims for himself the appellation of father, he
   does it in such a manner as not to take away or diminish the smallest
   portion of the honor which is due to God. (Hebrews 12:9.) It is a
   common proverb "That which is placed below another is not at variance
   with it." The name father, applied to Paul, with reference to God,
   belongs to this class. God alone is the Father of all in faith, because
   he regenerates us all by his word, and by the power of his Spirit, and
   because none but he bestows faith. But they whom he is graciously
   pleased to employ as his ministers for that purpose, are likewise
   allowed to share with him in his honor, while, at the same time, He
   parts with nothing that belongs to himself. Thus God, and God alone,
   strictly speaking, was Timothy's spiritual Father; but Paul, who was
   God's minister in begetting Timothy, lays claim to this title, by what
   may be called a subordinate right.

   Grace, mercy, peace. So far as relates to the word mercy, he has
   departed from his ordinary custom in introducing it, moved, perhaps, by
   his extraordinary affection for Timothy. Besides, he does not observe
   the exact order; for he places first what ought to have been last,
   namely, the grace which flows from mercy. For the reason why God at
   first receives us into favor and why he loves us is, that he is
   merciful. But it is not unusual to mention the cause after the effect,
   for the sake of explanation. As to the words grace and peace, we have
   spoken on other occasions.

   3. As I besought thee Either the syntax is elliptical, or the particle
   hina is redundant; and in both cases the meaning will be obvious. [3]
   First, he reminds Timothy why he was besought to remain at Ephesus. It
   was with great reluctance, and through hard necessity, that he parted
   with a companion so dearly beloved and so faithful, in order that he
   might laboriously hold the part of his deputy, which no other man would
   have been competent to fill; and, therefore, Timothy must have been
   powerfully excited by this consideration, not only not to throw away
   his time, but to conduct himself in an excellent and distinguished
   manner.

   I wish that thou shouldst forbid any. Thus, by way of inference, he
   exhorts him to oppose the false teachers who corrupted pure doctrine.
   In the injunction given to Timothy, to occupy his place at Ephesus, we
   ought to observe the holy anxiety of the Apostle; for while he labored
   so much to collect many churches he did not leave the former churches
   destitute of a pastor. And indeed, as an ancient writer remarks, "To
   keep what has been gained is not a smaller virtue than to make new
   acquisitions." The word forbid denotes power; for Paul wishes to arm
   him with power to restrain others.

   Not to teach differently The Greek word (heterodidaskalein) which Paul
   employs, is a compound, and, therefore, may either be translated, "to
   teach differently," or after a new method, or, "to teach a different
   doctrine." The translation given by Erasmus, (sectari,) "to follow,"
   does not satisfy me; because it might be understood to apply to the
   hearers. Now Paul means those who, for the sake of ambition, brought
   forward a new doctrine.

   If we read it, "to teach differently," the meaning will be more
   extensive; for by this expression he will forbid Timothy to permit any
   new forms of teaching to be introduced, which do not agree with the
   true and pure doctrine which he had taught. Thus, in the Second
   Epistle, he recommends hupotuposis, [4] that is, a lively picture of
   his doctrine. (2 Timothy 1:13.) For, as the truth of God is one, so is
   there but one plain manner of teaching it, which is free from false
   ornament, and which partakes more of the majesty of the Spirit than of
   the parade of human eloquence. Whoever departs from that, disfigures
   and corrupts the doctrine itself; and, therefore, "to teach
   differently," must relate to the form.

   If we read it, "to teach something different," it will relate to the
   matter. Yet it is worthy of observation, that we give the name of
   another doctrine not only to that which is openly at variance with the
   pure doctrine of the gospel, but to everything that either corrupts the
   pure gospel by new and borrowed inventions, or obscures it by ungodly
   speculations. For all the inventions of men are so many corruptions of
   the gospel; and they who make sport of the Scriptures, as ungodly
   people are accustomed to do, so as to turn Christianity into an act of
   display, darken the gospel. His manner of teaching therefore, is
   entirely opposed to the word of God, and to that purity of doctrine in
   which Paul enjoins the Ephesians to continue.

   4 And not to give heed to fables He applies the term "fables," in my
   opinion, not only to contrived falsehoods, but to trifles or fooleries
   which have no solidity; for it is possible that something which is not
   false may yet be fabulous. In this sense, Suetonius speaks of fabulous
   history, [5] and Livy employs the word fabulari, "to relate fables," as
   denoting useless and foolish talk. And, undoubtedly, the word muthos,
   (which Paul here employs,) is equivalent to the Greek word phluaria,
   that is, "trifles." Moreover, by bringing forward one class by way of
   example, he has removed all doubt; for disputes about genealogies are
   enumerated by him amongst fables, not because everything that can be
   said about them is fictitious, but because it is useless and
   unprofitable.

   This passage, therefore, may thus be explained: -- "Let them not give
   heed to fables of that character and description to which genealogies
   belong." And that is actually the fabulous history of which Suetonius
   speaks, and which even among grammarians, has always been justly
   ridiculed by persons of sound judgment; for it was impossible not to
   regard as ridiculous that curiosity which, neglecting useful knowledge,
   spent the whole life in examining the genealogy of Achilles and Ajax,
   and wasted its powers in reckoning up the sons of Priam. If this be not
   endured in childish knowledge, in which there is room for that which
   affords pleasure, how much more intolerable is it heavenly wisdom [6] ?

   And to genealogies haste have end [7] He calls them endless, because
   vain curiosity has no limit, but continually falls from labyrinth to
   labyrinth.

   Which produce questions He judges of doctrine by the fruit; for every
   thing that does not edify ought to be rejected, although it has no
   other fault; and everything that is of no avail but for raising
   contentions, ought to be doubly condemned. And such are all the subtle
   questions on which ambitious men exercise their faculties. Let us,
   therefore, remember, that all doctrines must be tried by this rule,
   that those which contribute to edification may be approved, and that
   those which give ground for unprofitable disputes may be rejected as
   unworthy of the Church of God.

   If this test had been applied during several centuries, although
   religion had been stained by many errors, at least that diabolical art
   of disputing, which has obtained the appellation of Scholastic
   Theology, would not have prevailed to so great an extent. For what does
   that theology contain but contentions or idle speculations, from which
   no advantage is derived? Accordingly, the more learned a man is in it,
   we ought to account him the more wretched. I am aware of the plausible
   excuses by which it is defended, but they will never make out that Paul
   has spoken falsely in condemning, everything of the sort.

   Rather than the edification of God. [8] Subtleties of this description
   edify in pride, and edify in vanity, but not in God. He calls it "the
   edification of God," either because God approves of it, or because it
   is agreeable to the nature of God. [9]

   Which consist in faith. He next shews that this edification consists in
   faith; and by this term he does not exclude the love of our neighbor,
   or the fear of God, or repentance; for what are all these but fruits of
   "faith" which always produces the fear of God? Knowing that all the
   worship of God is founded on faith alone, he therefore reckoned it
   enough to mention "faith," on which all the rest depend.

   [2] Our author, quoting from memory, blends the two passages, not quite
   accurately, yet so as to convey the true meaning of both. -- Ed.

   [3] "The construction here is tortuous and elliptical. Poreuomenos eis
   Makedonian must be construed between kathos and parekalesa, and the
   protasis at kathos is without its apodosis, houtos, which must be
   supplied. The simplest and most natural method is to understand houto
   kai nun parakalo." -- Bloomfield.

   [4] "Il ne recommande pas simplement a Timothee de retener sa doctrine,
   mais il use d'un mot qui signifie le vray patron, ou vif portraict
   d'icelle." -- "He does not merely advise Timothy to hold by his
   doctrine, but employs a word which denotes the true pattern or lively
   portrait of it."

   [5] "Et c'est en ceste signification que Suetone, en la vie de Tibere,
   dit que cest empereur la s'amusoit fort a l'histoire fabuleuse." --
   "And it is in this sense that Suetonius, in his life of Tiberius, says
   that that emperor amused himself very much with fabulous history."

   [6] "Here we see more clearly, that Paul did not merely condemn in this
   passage doctrines which are altogether false, and which contain some
   blasphemies, but likewise all those useless speculations which serve to
   turn aside believers from the pure simplicity of our Lord Jesus Christ.
   This is what Paul includes under the word "fables," for he means not
   only deliberate and manifest falsehoods, but likewise everything that
   is of no use, and this is implied in the word which he employs. What,
   then, does Paul set aside in this passage? All curious inquiries, all
   speculations which serve only to annoy and distress the mind, or in
   which there is nothing but a fair show and display, and which do not
   promote the salvation of those who hear them. This must be carefully
   remembered, for we shall afterwards see that the reason why Paul speaks
   of them in this manner is, that the word of God must be profitable. (2
   Timothy 3:16.) All who do not apply the word of God to good profit and
   advantage are despisers and falsifiers of good doctrine." -- Fr. Ser.

   [7] "'Aperantos properly signifies interminable. Hence there is also an
   implicit sense of what is unprofitable. This, indeed, some, but I think
   injudiciously, make the principal one." -- Bloomfield.

   [8] "Rather than godly edifying," -- Eng. Tr.

   [9] "This word edify is sufficiently common in the Holy Scripture, but
   is not understood by all. In order to understand it aright, let us
   observe, that it is a comparison which is set before us; for we ought
   to be temples of God, because he wishes to dwell in us. -- Those who
   profit in a right manner, that is, in faith, in the fear of God, in
   holiness of life, are said to be edified; that is, God builds them to
   be his temples, and wishes to dwell in them; and also that we should
   unitedly form a temple of God, for each of us is a stone of that
   temple. Thus, when each of us shall be well instructed in his duty, and
   when we shall all be united in holy brotherhood, then shall we be
   edified in God. It is true, that men may sometimes be edified in pride:
   as we see that they who take delight in their vain imaginations, and
   who spread their wings, and swell themselves out like toads, think that
   they are well edified. Alas! what a poor building is this! But Paul
   expressly says, that we must be edified according to God. By which he
   shews, that when we shall be instructed to serve God, to render to him
   pure worship, to place all our confidence in him, this is the
   edification at which we must aim; and every doctrine that has that
   tendency is good and holy, and ought to be received; but all that is
   opposed to it must be rejected without farther dispute: it is
   unnecessary to make any longer inquiry. And why must this or that be
   rejected? Because it does not contribute to the edification of God." --
   Fr. Ser.

   1 Timothy 1:5-11

   5. Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and
   of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:

   5. Porro finis praecepti est charitas, ex puro corde, et conscientia
   bona, et fide non simulata.

   6. From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;

   6. A quibus postquam nonnulli aberrarunt, deflexerunt ad vaniloquium,

   7. Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they
   say, nor whereof they affirm.

   7. Volentes esse legis doctores, non intelligentes quae loquuntur,
   neque de quibus affirmant.

   8. But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;

   8. Scimus autem quod lex bona sit, si quis ea legitime utatur:

   9. Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for
   the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for
   unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers,
   for manslayers,

   9. Sciens illud, quod justo non sit lex posita, sed injustis et
   inobsequentibus, impiis et peccatoribus, irreligiosis et profanis,
   parricidis et matricidis, homicidis,

   10. For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for
   menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other
   thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;

   10. Scortatoribus, masculorum concubitoribus, plagiariis, mendacibus,
   perjuris, et si quid aliud est, quod sanae doctrinae adversatur;

   11. According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was
   committed to my trust.

   11. Secundum Evangelium gloriae beati Dei, quod concreditum est mihi.

   Those unprincipled men with whom Timothy had to deal, boasted of having
   the law on their side, in consequence of which Paul anticipates, and
   shews that the law gives them no support but was even opposed to them,
   and that it agreed perfectly with the gospel which he had taught. The
   defense set up by them was not unlike that which is pleaded by those
   who, in the present day, subject the word of God to torture. They tell
   us that we aim at nothing else than to destroy sacred theology, as if
   they alone nourished it in their bosom. They spoke of the law in such a
   manner as to exhibit Paul in an odious light. And what is his reply? In
   order to scatter those clouds of smoke, [10] he comes frankly forward,
   by way of anticipation, and proves that his doctrine is in perfect
   harmony with the law, and that the law is utterly abused by those who
   employ it for any other purpose. In like manner, when we now define
   what is meant by true theology, it is clearly evident that we desire
   the restoration of that which had been wretchedly torn and disfigured
   by those triflers who, puffed up by the empty title of theologians, are
   acquainted with nothing but vapid and unmeaning trifles. Commandment is
   here put for the law, by taking a part for the whole.

   Love out of a pure heart If the law must be directed to this object,
   that we may be instructed in love, which proceeds from faith and a good
   conscience, it follows, on the other hand, that they who turn the
   teaching of it into curious questions are wicked expounders of the law.
   Besides, it is of no great importance whither the word love be regarded
   in this passage as relating, to both tables of the law, or only to the
   second table. We are commanded to love God with our whole heart, and
   our neighbors as ourselves; but when love is spoken of in Scripture, it
   is more frequently limited to the second part. On the present occasion
   I should not hesitate to understand by it the love both of God and of
   our neighbor, if Paul had employed the word love alone; but when he
   adds, "faith, and a good conscience, and a pure heart," the
   interpretation which I am now to give will not be at variance with his
   intention, and will agree well with the scope of the passage. The sum
   of the law is this, that we may worship God with true faith and a pure
   conscience, and that we may love one another. Whosoever turns aside
   from this corrupts the law of God by twisting it to a different
   purpose.

   But here arises a doubt, that Paul appears to prefer "love" to "faith."
   I reply, they who are of that opinion reason in an excessively childish
   manner; for, if love is first mentioned, it does not therefore hold the
   first rank of honor, since Paul shows also that it springs from faith.
   Now the cause undoubtedly goes before its effect. And if we carefully
   weigh the whole context, what Paul says is of the same import as if he
   had said, "The law was given to us for this purpose, that it might
   instruct us in faith, which is the mother of a good conscience and of
   love." Thus we must begin with faith, and not with love.

   "A pure heart" and "a good conscience" do not greatly differ from each
   other. Both proceed from faith; for, as to a pure heart, it is said
   that "God purifieth hearts by faith." (Acts 15:9.) As to a good
   conscience, Peter declares that it is founded on the resurrection of
   Christ. (1 Peter 3:21.) From this passage we also learn that there is
   no true love where there is not fear of God and uprightness of
   conscience.

   Nor is it unworthy of observation that to each of them he adds an
   epithet; [11] for, as nothing is more common, so nothing is more easy,
   than to boast of faith and a good conscience. But how few are there who
   prove by their actions that they are free from all hypocrisy!
   Especially it is proper to observe the epithet Which he bestows on
   "faith," when he calls it faith unfeigned; by which he means that the
   profession of it is insincere, when we do not perceive a good
   conscience, and when love is not manifested. Now since the salvation of
   men rests on faith, and since the perfect worship of God rests on faith
   and a good conscience and love, we need not wonder if Paul makes the
   sum of the law to consist of them.

   6 From which some having gone astray He continues to pursue the
   metaphor of an object or end; for the verb astochein, the participle of
   which is here given, signifies to err or go aside from a mark. [12]

   Have turned aside to idle talking This is a remarkable passage, in
   which he condemns for "idle talking" [13] all the doctrines which do
   not aim at this single end, and at the same time points out that the
   views and thoughts of all who aim at any other object vanish away. It
   is, indeed, possible that useless trifles may be regarded by many
   persons with admiration; but the statement of Paul remains unshaken,
   that everything that does not edify in godliness is mataiologia, [14]
   "idle talking." We ought; therefore to take the greatest possible care
   not to seek anything in the holy and sacred word of God but solid
   edification, lest otherwise he inflict on us severe punishment for
   abusing it.

   7 Wishing to be teachers of the law He does not reprove those who
   openly attack the instruction of the law, but those who boast of
   belonging to the rank of teachers of it. He affirms that such persons
   have no understanding, because they harass their faculties to no
   purpose by curious questions. And, at the same time, he rebukes their
   pride by adding, --

   Of what things they affirm, for none will be found more bold in
   pronouncing rashly on matters unknown to them than the teachers of such
   fables. We see in the present day with what pride and haughtiness the
   schools of the Sorbonne pronounce their authoritative decisions. And on
   what subjects? On those which are altogether hidden from the minds of
   men -- which no word of Scripture, and no revelation has ever made
   known to us. With greater boldness do they affirm their purgatory [15]
   than the resurrection of the dead. As to their contrivances about the
   intercession of the saints, if we do not hold them to be an undoubted
   oracle, they cry out that the whole of religion is overturned. What
   shall I say as to their vast labyrinths about the hierarchies of
   heaven, relationships, and similar contrivances? It is a matter that
   has no end. The Apostle declares that in all these is fulfilled what is
   said in a well-known ancient proverb,

   "Ignorance is rash;" as he says that, "puffed up by their carnal mind,
   they intrude into things which they know not."
   (Colossians 2:18.)

   8 Now we know that the law is good He again anticipates the calumny
   with which they loaded him; for, whenever he resisted their empty
   display, they seized on this shield for their defense "What then? Do
   you wish to have the law buried, and blotted out of the remembrance of
   men?" In order to repel this calumny, Paul acknowledges that "the law
   is good," but contends that we are required to make a lawful use of it.
   Here he argues from the use of cognate terms; for the word lawful
   (legitimus) is derived from the word law (lex). But he goes still
   further, and shews that the law agrees excellently with the doctrine
   which it teaches; and he even directs it against them.

   9 That the law is not made for a righteous man The apostle did not
   intend to argue about the whole office of the law, but views it in
   reference to men. It frequently happens that they who wish to be
   regarded as the greatest zealots for the law, give evidence by their
   whole life that they are the greatest despisers of it. A remarkable and
   striking instance of this is found in those who maintain the
   righteousness of works and defend free-will. They have continually in
   their mouth these words, "Perfect holiness, merits, satisfactions;" but
   their whole life cries out against them, that they are outrageously
   wicked and ungodly, that they provoke in every possible way the wrath
   of God, and fearlessly set his judgment at naught. They extol in lofty
   terms the free choice of good and evil; but they openly shew, by their
   actions, that they are the slaves of Satan, and are most firmly held by
   him in the chains of slavery.

   Having such adversaries, in order to restrain their haughty insolence,
   Paul remonstrates that the law is, as it were, the sword of God to slay
   them; and that neither he nor any like him have reason for viewing the
   law with dread or aversion; for it is not opposed to righteous persons,
   that is, to the godly and to those who willingly obey God. I am well
   aware that some learned men draw an ingenious sense out of these words;
   as if Paul were treating theologically about the nature of "the law."
   They argue that the law has nothing to do with the sons of God, who
   have been regenerated by the Spirit; because it was not given for
   righteous persons. But the connection in which these words occur shuts
   me up to the necessity of giving a more simple interpretation to this
   statement. He takes for granted the well-known sentiment, that "from
   bad manners have sprung good laws," and maintains that the law of God
   was given in order to restrain the licentiousness of wicked men;
   because they who are good of their own accord do not need the
   authoritative injunction of the law.

   A question now arises, "Is there any mortal man who does not belong to
   this class?" I reply, in this passage Paul gives the appellation
   "righteous" to those who are not absolutely perfect, (for no such
   person will be found,) but who, with the strongest desire of their
   heart, aim at what is good; so that godly desire is to them a kind of
   voluntary law, without any motive or restraint from another quarter. He
   therefore wished to repress the impudence of adversaries, who armed
   themselves with the name of "the law" against godly men, whose whole
   life exhibits the actual role of the law, since they had very great
   need of the law, and yet did not care much about it; which is more
   clearly expressed by the opposite clause. If there be any who refuse to
   admit that Paul brings an implied or indirect charge against his
   adversaries as guilty of those wicked acts which he enumerates, still
   it will be acknowledged to be a simple repelling of the slander; and if
   they were animated by a sincere and unfeigned zeal for the law, they
   ought rather to have made use of their armor for carrying on war with
   offenses and crimes, instead of employing it as a pretext for their own
   ambition and silly talking.

   For the unrighteous and disobedient Instead of "unrighteous," it would
   have been better if translators had made use of the word "lawless;" for
   the Greek word is anomous, which does not differ much from the second
   word in the clause, "disobedient." By sinners he means wicked persons,
   or those who lead a base and immoral life.

   For the ungodly and profane These words might have been fitly rendered
   "profane and impure;" but I did not wish to be fastidious in matters of
   little importance.

   10 For robbers The Latin word plagium was employed by ancient writers
   to denote the carrying off or enticing the slave of another man, or the
   false sale of a freeman. Those who wish to obtain more full information
   on this subject may consult authors on the civil law, and especially on
   the Flavian Law.

   Here Paul glances at several classes, which include briefly every kind
   of transgressions. The root is obstinacy and rebellion; which he
   describes by the first two words. Ungodly and sinners appear to denote
   transgressors of the first and second table. To these he adds the
   profane and impure, or those who lead a base and dissolute life. There
   being chiefly three ways in which men injure their neighbors, namely,
   violence, dishonesty, and lust, he reproves successively those three
   ways, as may be easily seen. First, he speaks of violence as manifested
   by manslayers and murderers of parents; secondly, he describes shameful
   uncleanness; and thirdly, he comes down to dishonesty and other crimes.

   If there is anything else that is contrary to sound doctrine In this
   clause he maintains that his gospel is so far from being opposed to the
   law, that it is a powerful confirmation of it. He declares that by his
   preaching, he supports that very sentence which the Lord pronounced in
   his law, against "everything that is contrary to sound doctrine." Hence
   it follows, that they who depart from the gospel, do not adhere to the
   spirit of the law, but merely pursue its shadow.

   Sound doctrine is contrasted with frivolous questions about which he
   says (1 Timothy 6:3) that foolish teachers are in an unhealthy
   condition and which, on account of the effect produced by them, are
   called diseased. [16]

   11 According to the gospel of glory By calling it "the gospel of
   glory," that is, "the glorious gospel," he sharply rebukes those who
   labored to degrade the gospel, in which God displays his glory. He
   expressly says that it hath been intrusted to him, that all may know
   that there is no other gospel of God than that which he preaches; and
   consequently, that all the fables which he formerly rebuked are at
   variance both with the law and with the gospel of God.

   [10] "Pour demesler tout ce qu'ils entassoyent pour esblouir les yeux

   the purpose of blinding the eyes of plain people."

   [11] "Il donne a chacune vertu son epithet." -- "He gives to each
   virtue its epithet."

   [12] "Here he makes use of a metaphor taken from those who shoot with a
   bow; for they have their mark at which they aim, and do not shoot
   carelessly, or at random. Thus Paul shews that God, by giving us the
   law, has determined to give us a sure road, that we may not be liable
   to wander like vagabonds. And, indeed, it is not without reason that
   Moses exhorteth the people, This is the way, walk ye in it,' as if he
   had said that men do not know where they are, till God has declared to
   them his will; but then they have an infallible rule. -- Let us
   carefully observe that God intends to address us in such a manner that
   it shall not be possible for us to go astray, provided that we take him
   for our guide, seeing that he is ready and willing to perform that
   office, when we do not refuse such a favor. This is what Paul meant by
   this metaphor; as we are told that all who have it not as their object
   to rely on the grace of God, in order that they may call on God as
   their Father, and may expect salvation from him, and who do not walk
   with a good conscience, and with a pure heart toward their
   neighborhood, are like persons who have wandered and gone astray." --
   Fr. Ser.

   [13] "De vanite et mesonge." -- "For vanity and falsehood."

   [14] "Mataiologia has reference to the interminable and unprofitable
   zeteseis mentioned at 1 Timothy 1:4, and called kenophonias at 1
   Timothy 6:20; this vain and empty talk being, by implication, opposed
   to the performance of substantial duties." -- Bloomfield.

   [15] "And in Popery what are the articles that shall be held as most
   certain? What angel, or what devil, revealed to them that there is a
   purgatory? They have fabricated it out of their own brain, and, after
   having attempted to produce some passages of the Holy Scriptures, they
   have at length become bewildered, so that they have no defense of their
   purgatory, but its antiquity. There it is! It has been always held.'
   Such is the foundation of faith, according to the learned Papists. And
   then we must not call in question that we ought to apply to the
   departed saints as our advocates and intercessors. To go to God without
   baying as our guide St. Michael, or the Virgin Mary, or some other
   saint whom the Pope shall have inserted in his calendar for the
   occasion, would be of no avail. And why? On what ground? Will they find
   in all the Holy Scriptures a single word, a single syllable, to shew
   that creatures, that is, deceased persons, intercede for us? For in
   this world we ought to pray for one another, and that is a mutual
   obligation; but as to deceased persons, not a word is said about them."
   -- Fr. Ser.

   [16] "All vices are contrary to sound doctrine. For what is the
   advantage to be derived from the Word of God? It is the pasture of our
   souls; and, next, it is a medicine. We have bread and various kinds of
   food for the nourishment of our body: the word of God is of the same
   use for our souls. But it is more advantageous in this respect, that,
   when we are diseased with our vices, when there are many corruptions
   and wicked desires, we must be purged of them; and the Word of God
   serves us for various purposes, for purging, for blood-letting, for
   drink, and for diet. In short, all that physicians can apply to the
   human body, for healing its diseases, is not a tenth part of what the
   Word of God accomplishes for the health of our souls On that account
   Paul speaks here of sound doctrine. For inquisitive and ambitious
   persons are always in a diseased state; they have no health in them
   they are like those unhappy patients who have lost their appetite, and
   who suck and lick, but cannot receive any nourishment. But when the
   Word of God is applied in a right manner, there must be a contest;
   there was a war against every vice; and the Word of God must condemn
   them in such a manner that the hearts of men shall be touched and
   pierced -- shall be humbled and laid low with sincere repentance to
   groan before God; and, if there be nothing else, that they shall at
   least be convinced, that they shall have remorse within themselves,
   that they may so be an example to all that are not altogether
   incorrigible. This is the way in which the Lord wishes that his word
   may be applied to a good use." -- Fr. Ser.

   1 Timothy 1:12-13

   12. And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he
   counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;

   12. Et gratiam habeo, qui me potentum reddidit, Christo Iesu Domino
   nostro, quod fidelem me judicavit, ponendo in ministerium,

   13. Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I
   obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.

   13. Qui pruis eram blasphemus et persequutor, et violentus, sed et
   misericordiam adeptus sum, quod ignorans feci in incredulitate.

   12 I give thanks Great is the dignity -- of the apostleship, which Paul
   has claimed for himself; and he could not, looking at his former life,
   be accounted at all worthy of so high an honor. Accordingly, that he
   may not be accused of presumption, he comes unavoidably to make mention
   of his own person, and at once frankly acknowledges his own
   unworthiness, but nevertheless affirms that he is an Apostle by the
   grace of God. But he goes further, and turns to his own advantage what
   appeared to lessen his authority, declaring that the grace of God
   shines in him so much the more brightly.

   To our Lord Jesus Christ When he gives thanks to Christ, he removes
   that dislike towards him which might have been entertained, and cuts
   off all ground for putting this question, "Does he deserve, or does he
   not deserve, so honorable an office?" for, although in himself he has
   no excellence, yet it is enough that he was chosen by Christ. There
   are, indeed, many who, under the same form of words, make a show of
   humility, but are widely different from the uprightness of Paul, whose
   intention was, not only to boast courageously in the Lord, but to give
   up all the glory that was his own. [17]

   By putting me into the ministry. Why does he give thanks? Because he
   has been placed in the ministry; for thence he concludes that he hath
   been, accounted faithful Christ does not receive any in the manner that
   is done by ambitious [18] people, but selects those only who are well
   qualified; and therefore all on whom he bestows honor are acknowledged
   by us to be worthy. For is it inconsistent with this, that Judas,
   according to the prediction, (Psalm 109:8) was elevated for a short
   time, that he might quickly fall. It was otherwise with Paul, who
   obtained the honor for a different purpose, and on a different
   condition, when Christ declared that he should be

   "a chosen vessel to him." (Acts 9:15.)

   But in this manner Paul seems to say that faithfulness, by which he had
   been previously distinguished, was the cause of his calling. If it were
   so, the thanksgiving would be hypocritical and contradictory; for he
   would owe his apostleship not only to God, but to his own merit. I
   deny, therefore, that the meaning is, that he was admitted to the rank
   of an apostle, because God had foreseen his faith; for Christ could not
   foresee in him anything good but what the Father had bestowed on him.
   Still, therefore, it continues to be true,

   "Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you."
   (John 15:16.)

   On the contrary, he draws from it a proof of his fidelity, that Christ
   had made him an Apostle; for he declares that they whom Christ makes
   Apostles must be held to be pronounced faithful by his decrees.

   In a word, this judicial act is not traced by him to foreknowledge, but
   rather denotes the testimony which is given to men; as if he had said,
   "I give thanks to Christ, who, by calling me into the ministry, has
   openly declared that he approves of my faithfulness." [19]

   Who hath made me powerful He now introduces the mention of another act
   of the kindness of Christ, that he strengthened him, or "made him
   powerful." By this expression he does not only mean that he was at
   first formed by the hand of God, so as to be well qualified for his
   office, but he likewise includes the continued bestowal of grace. For
   it would not have been enough that he was once declared to be faithful,
   if Christ had not strengthened him by the uninterrupted communication
   of aid. He acknowledges, therefore, that he is indebted to the grace of
   Christ on two accounts, because he was once elevated, and because he
   continues in his office.

   13. Who was formerly a blasphemer and persecutor; a blasphemer against
   God, a persecutor and oppressor against the Church. We see how candidly
   he acknowledges that it might be brought against him as a reproach, and
   how far he is from extenuating his sins, and how, by willingly
   acknowledging his unworthiness, he magnifies the greatness of the grace
   of God. Not satisfied with having called himself a "persecutor," he
   intended to express more fully his rage and cruelty by an additional
   terns, an oppressor.

   Because I did it ignorantly in unbelief "I obtained pardon," said he,
   "for my unbelief; because it proceeded from ignorance;" for persecution
   and oppression were nothing else than the fruits of unbelief.

   But he appears to insinuate that there is no room for pardon, unless
   when ignorance can be pleaded in excuse. What then? Will God never
   pardon any one who has sinned knowingly? I reply, we must observe the
   word unbelief; [20] for this term limits Paul's statement to the first
   table of the law. Transgressions of the second table, although they are
   voluntary, are forgiven; but he who knowingly and willingly breaks the
   first table sins against the Holy Spirit, because he is in direct
   opposition to God. He does not err through weakness, but, by rushing
   wickedly against God, gives a sure proof of his reprobation.

   And hence may be obtained a definition of the sin against the Holy
   Ghost; first, that it is open rebellion against God in the
   transgression of the first table; secondly, that it is a malicious
   rejection of the truth; for, when the truth of God is not rejected
   through deliberate malice, the Holy Spirit is not resisted. Lastly,
   unbelief is here employed as a general term; and malicious design,
   which is contrasted with ignorance, may be regarded as the point of
   difference. [21]

   Accordingly, they are mistaken who make the sin against the Holy Ghost
   to consist in the transgression of the second table; and they are also
   mistaken, who pronounce blind and thoughtless violence to be a crime so
   heinous. For men commit the sin against the Holy Spirit, when they
   undertake a voluntary war against God in order to extinguish that light
   of the Spirit which has been offered to them. This is shocking
   wickedness and monstrous hardihood. Nor is there room for doubting
   that, by an implied threatening, he intended to terrify all who had
   been once enlightened, not to stumble against truth which they knew;
   because such a fall is destructive and fatal; for if, on account of
   ignorance, God forgave Paul his blasphemies, they who knowingly and
   intentionally blaspheme ought not to expect any pardon.

   But it may be thought that what he now says is to no purpose; for
   unbelief, which is always blind, can never be unaccompanied by
   ignorance. I reply, among unbelievers some are so blind that they are
   deceived by a false imagination of the truth; and in others, while they
   are blinded, yet malice prevails. Paul was not altogether free from a
   wicked disposition; but he was hurried along by the thoughtless zeal,
   so as to think that what he did was right. Thus he was an adversary of
   Christ, not from deliberate intention, but through mistake and
   ignorance. The Pharisees, who through a bad conscience slandered
   Christ, were not entirely free from mistake and ignorance; but they
   were instigated by ambition, and base hatred of sound doctrine, and
   even by furious rebellion against God, so that maliciously and
   intentionally, and not in ignorance, they set themselves in opposition
   to Christ. [22]

   there are always dogs that bark against God's servants, aiming at
   nothing but to bring them into contempt, or rather to make their
   doctrine be despised and abhorred. Wishing to shut the mouths of such
   people, Paul says that he is satisfied with having the authority and
   warrant of Christ. As if he had said, Men may reject me, but it is
   enough that I am declared to be faithful by him who has all authority
   in himself, and who, being the heavenly Judge, hath pronounced it. When
   he put me into that office, he declared that he reckoned me to be his
   servant, and that he intended to employ me in preaching his gospel.

   may, provided that I have Christ on my side, let men jeer at me, it
   will be of no avail; For the decision pronounced by the Lord Jesus
   Christ can never be recalled.' Thus we see what was Paul's intention,
   namely, that he does not here mean that Christ foresaw in him anything

   that, by putting him into it, he declared and made it evident to men,

   1 Timothy 1:14-17

   14. And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and
   love which is in Christ Jesus.

   14. Exuberavit autem supra modum gratia Domini nostri, cum fide et
   dilectione, quae est in Christo Iesu.

   15. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
   Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.

   15. Fidelus sermo, et dignus omnino qui accipiatur, quod Christus Iesus
   venit in mundum, ut peccatores salvos faceret, quorum primus sum ego.

   16. Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus
   Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which
   should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.

   16. Verum ideo misericordiam sum adeptus, ut in me primo ostenderet
   Iesus Christus omnen clementiam, in exemplar iis, qui credituri essent
   in ipso in vitam aeternam.

   17. Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God,
   be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

   17. Regi autem saeculorum immortali, invisibili, soli sapienti Deo,
   honor et gloria in saecula saeculorum. Amen.

   14 And the grace of our Lord He again magnifies the grace of God
   towards himself, not only for the purpose of removing the dislike of it
   and testifying his gratitude, but also to employ it as a shield against
   the slanders of wicked men, whose whole design was to bring down his
   apostleship to a lower level. When he says that it abounded, and that,
   too, beyond measure, the statement implies that the remembrance of past
   transactions was effaced, and so completely swallowed up, that it was
   no disadvantage to him that God had formerly been gracious to good men.

   With faith and love Both may be viewed as referring to God, in this
   sense, that God showed himself to be true, and gave a manifestation of
   his love in Christ, when he bestowed his grace upon him. But I prefer a
   more simple interpretation, that "faith and love" are indications and
   proofs of that grace which he had mentioned, that it might not be
   supposed that he boasted needlessly or without good grounds. And,
   indeed, "faith" is contrasted with unbelief, and "love in Christ" is
   contrasted with the cruelty which he had exercised towards believers;
   as if he had said, that God had so completely changed him, that he had
   become a totally different and new man. Thus from the signs and effects
   he celebrates in lofty terms the excellence of that grace which must
   obliterate the remembrance of his former life.

   15 It is a faithful saying After having defended his ministry from
   slander and unjust accusations, not satisfied with this, he turns to
   his own advantage what might have been brought against him by his
   adversaries as a reproach. He shews that it was profitable to the
   Church that he had been such a person as he actually was before he was
   called to the apostleship, because Christ, by giving him as a pledge,
   invited all sinners to the sure hope of obtaining pardon. For when he,
   who had been a fierce and savage beast, was changed into a Pastor,
   Christ gave a remarkable display of his grace, from which all might be
   led to entertain a firm belief that no sinner; how heinous and
   aggravated so ever might have been his transgressions, had the gate of
   salvation shut against him.

   That Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners He first brings
   forward this general statement, and adorns it with a preface, as he is
   wont to do in matters of vast importance. In the doctrine of religion,
   indeed, the main point is, to come to Christ, that, being lost in
   ourselves, we may obtain salvation from him. Let this preface be to our
   ears like the sound of a trumpet to proclaim the praises of the grace
   of Christ, in order that we may believe it with a stronger faith. Let
   it be to us as a seal to impress on our hearts a firm belief of the
   forgiveness of sins, which otherwise with difficulty finds entrance
   into the hearts of men.

   A faithful saying What was the reason why Paul aroused attention by
   these words, but because men are always disputing with themselves [23]
   about their salvation? For, although God the Father a thousand times
   offer to us salvation, and although Christ himself preach about his own
   office, yet we do not on that account cease to tremble, or at least to
   debate with ourselves if it be actually so. Wherefore, whenever any
   doubt shall arise in our mind about the forgiveness of sins, let us
   learn to repel it courageously with this shield, that it is an
   undoubted truth, and deserves to be received without controversy.

   To save sinners. The word sinners is emphatic; for they who acknowledge
   that it is the office of Christ to save, have difficulty in admitting
   this thought, that such a salvation belongs to "sinners." Our mind is
   always impelled to look at our worthiness; and as soon as our
   unworthiness is seen, our confidence sinks. Accordingly, the more any
   one is oppressed by his sins, let him the more courageously betake
   himself to Christ, relying on this doctrine, that he came to bring
   salvation not to the righteous, but to "sinners." It deserves
   attention, also, that Paul draws an argument from the general office of
   Christ, in order that what he had lately testified about his own person
   might not appear to be on account of its novelty.

   Of whom, I am the first Beware of thinking that the Apostle, under a
   presence of modesty, spoke falsely, [24] for he intended to make a
   confession not less true than humble, and drawn from the very bottom of
   his heart.

   But some will ask, "Why does he, who only erred through ignorance of
   sound doctrine, and whose whole life, in even other respect, was
   blameless before men, pronounce himself to be the chief of sinners?" I
   reply, these words inform us how heinous and dreadful a crime unbelief
   is before God, especially when it is attended by obstinacy and a rage
   for persecution. (Philippians 3:6.) With men, indeed, it is easy to
   extenuate, under the presence of heedless zeal, all that Paul has
   acknowledged about himself; but God values more highly the obedience of
   faith than to reckon unbelief, accompanied by obstinacy, to be a small
   crime. [25]

   We ought carefully to observe this passage, which teaches us, that a
   man who, before the world, is not only innocent, but eminent for
   distinguished virtues, and most praiseworthy for his life, yet because
   he is opposed to the doctrine of the gospel, and on account of the
   obstinacy of his unbelief, is reckoned one of the most heinous sinners;
   for hence we may easily conclude of what value before God are all the
   pompous displays of hypocrites, while they obstinately resist Christ.

   16 That in me the first Jesus Christ might shew When he calls himself
   the first, he alludes to what he had said a little before, that he was
   the first [26] among sinners and, therefore, this word means "chiefly,"
   or, "above all." The Apostle's meaning is, that, from the very
   beginning, God held out such a pattern as might be visible from a
   conspicuous and lofty platform, that no one might doubt that he would
   obtain pardon, provided that he approached to Christ by faith. And,
   indeed, the distrust entertained by all of us is counteracted, when we
   thus behold in Paul a visible model of that grace which we desire to
   see.

   17 Now to the King eternal His amazing vehemence at length breaks out
   into this exclamation; because he could not find words to express his
   gratitude; for those sudden bursts occur chiefly when we are
   constrained to break off the discourse, in consequence of being
   overpowered by the vastness of the subject. And is there anything more
   astonishing than Paul's conversion? Yet, at the same time, by his
   example he reminds us all that we ought never to think of the grace
   manifested in God's calling [27] without being carried to lofty
   admiration.

   Eternal, invisible, only wise This sublime praise of the grace which
   God had bestowed on him [28] swallows up the remembrance of his former
   life. For how great a deep is the glory of God! Those attributes which
   he ascribes to God, though they belong to him always, yet are admirably
   adapted to the present occasion. The Apostle calls him the King
   eternal, not liable to any change; Invisible, because (1 Timothy 6:16)
   he dwells in light that is inaccessible; and, lastly, the Only Wise,
   because he renders foolish, and condemns as vanity, all the wisdom of
   men. The whole agrees with that conclusion at which he arrives:

   "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How
   incomprehensible are his designs! How unsearchable his ways!" (Romans
   11:33.)

   He means that the infinite and incomprehensible wisdom of God should be
   beheld by us with such reverence that, if his works surpass our senses,
   still we may be restrained by admiration.

   Yet as to the last epithet Only, it is doubtful whether he means to
   claim all glory for God alone, or calls him the only wise, or says that
   he only is God. The second of these meanings is that which I prefer;
   for it was in fine harmony with his present subject to say, that the
   understanding of men, whatever it may be, must bend to the secret
   purpose of God. And yet I do not deny that he affirms that God alone is
   worthy of all glory; for, while he scatters on his creatures, in every
   direction, the sparks of his glory, still all glory belongs truly and
   perfectly to him alone. But either of those meanings implies that there
   is no glory but that which belongs to God.

   1 Timothy 1:18-20

   18. This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the
   prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a
   good warfare;

   18. Hoc praeceptum commendo tibi, fili Timothee, secundum praecedentes
   super te prophetias, ut milites in illis bonam militiam;

   19. Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away
   concerning faith have made shipwreck:

   19. Habens fidem et bonam conscientiam; a qua aversi quidam circa fidem
   naufragium fecerunt:

   20. Of whom is Hymenæus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto
   Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.

   20. Ex quibus sunt Hymenaeus et Alexander, quos tradidi Satanae, ut
   discant non maledicere.

   18 I recommend to thee this commandment All that he had introduced
   about his own person may be viewed as a digression from his subject.
   Having to arm Timothy with authority, it became necessary for himself
   to be clothed with the highest authority; and, therefore, he took an
   early opportunity of refuting an opinion which might have stood in his
   way. And now, after having proved that his apostleship ought not to be
   less esteemed by good men, because at one time he fought against the
   kingdom of Christ, this obstacle being removed, he returns to the
   course of his exhortation. The commandment, therefore, is the same as
   he mentioned at the beginning.

   Son Timothy By calling him his son, he not only expresses his own warm
   regard towards him, but also recommends him to others under that name.

   According to the prophecies which went before concerning thee. In order
   to encourage him still more, he reminds him what kind of testimony he
   had obtained from the Spirit of God; for it was no small excitement,
   that his ministry was approved by God, and that he had been called by
   divine revelation before he was called by the votes of men. "It is
   disgraceful not to come up to the expectations which men have been led
   to form; and how much more disgraceful will it be to make void, as far
   as lies in thy power, the judgment of God?"

   But we must first ascertain what are the prophecies of which he speaks.
   Some think that Paul was instructed by revelation to confer the office
   on Timothy. That I acknowledge to be true, but I add that others made
   revelations; for it was not without reason that Paul made use of the
   plural number. Accordingly, we conclude from these words that several
   prophecies were uttered concerning Timothy, in order to recommend him
   to the Church. [29] Being still a young man, he might have been
   despised on account of his age; and Paul might also have been exposed
   to calumnies, on account of having ordained youths, before the proper
   time, to the elder's office. Besides, God had appointed him to great
   and difficult undertakings; for he was not one of the ordinary rank of
   ministers, but approached very closely to that of the apostles, and
   frequently occupied the place of Paul during his absence. It was,
   therefore, necessary that he should receive an extraordinary testimony,
   in order to make it manifest that it was not conferred on him at random
   by men, but that he was chosen by God himself. To be adorned with the
   applauses of the prophets was not an ordinary occurrence, or one which
   was common to him along with many persons; but because there were some
   circumstances to Timothy, it was the will of God that he should not be
   received by men until he had been previously approved by his own voice;
   it was the will of God that he should not enter into the exercise of
   his office until he had been called by the revelations of the prophets.
   The same thing happened to Paul and Barnabas, (Acts 13:2,) when they
   were ordained to be teachers of the Gentiles; for it was a new and
   uncommon occurrence, and they could not otherwise have escaped the
   charge of rashness.

   It will now be objected by some, "If God had formerly declared, by his
   prophets, what kind of minister Timothy should be, what purpose did it
   serve to admonish him, to show that he was actually such a person?
   Could he falsify prophecies which had been uttered by divine
   revelation?" I reply, it could not happen differently from what God had
   promised; but at the same time it was the duty of Timothy, not to give
   himself up to sloth and inactivity, but to render a cheerful compliance
   with the providence of God. It is therefore not without good reason,
   that Paul, wishing to stimulate him still more, mentions the
   "prophecies," by which God might be said to have pledged himself on
   behalf of Timothy; for he was thus reminded of the purpose for which he
   was called.

   That thou by them mayest war a good warfare. By this he means that
   Timothy, relying on such approbation of God, ought to fight more
   courageously. What is there that either ought to give, or can give us
   greater cheerfulness than to know that God has appointed us to do what
   we are doing? These are our arms, these are our weapons of defense, by
   the aid of which we shall never fail.

   By the word warfare, he states indirectly, that we must maintain a
   contest; and this applies universally to all believers, but especially
   to Christian teachers, who may be said to be standard-bearers and
   leaders. It is as if he had said, "O Timothy, if thou canst not fulfill
   thy office without a contest, remember that thou art armed by divine
   prophecies for cherishing assured hope of victory, and arouse thyself
   by calling them to remembrance. That warfare which we maintain, having
   God for our leader, is a good warfare; that is, it is glorious and
   successful."

   19 Having faith and a good conscience I understand the word faith to be
   a general term, denoting sound doctrine. In the same sense he
   afterwards speaks of "the mystery of faith." (1 Timothy 3:9.) And,
   indeed, the chief things demanded from a teacher are these two: -- that
   he shall hold by the pure truth of the gospel; and next, that he shall
   administer it with a good conscience and holiest zeal. Where these are
   found, all the others will follow of their own accord.

   From which some having turned aside concerning faith He shows how
   necessary it is that faith be accompanied by a good conscience;
   because, on the other hand, the punishment of a bad conscience is
   turning aside from the path of duty. They who do not serve God with a
   sincere and a perfect heart, but give a loose rein to wicked
   dispositions, even though at first they had a sound understanding, come
   to lose it altogether.

   This passage ought to be carefully observed. We know that the treasure
   of sound doctrine is invaluable, and therefore there is nothing that we
   ought to dread more than to have it taken from us. But Paul here
   informs us, that there is only one way of keeping it safe; and that is,
   to secure it by the locks and bars of a good conscience. This is what
   we experience every day; for how comes it that there are so many who,
   laying aside the gospel, rush into wicked sects, or become involved in
   monstrous errors? It is because, by this kind of blindness, God
   punishes hypocrisy; as, on the other hand, a genuine fear of God gives
   strength for perseverance.

   Hence we may learn two lessons. First, Teachers and ministers of the
   gospel, and, through them all the churches are taught with what horror
   they ought to regard a hypocritical and deceitful profession of true
   doctrine, when they learn that it is so severely punished. Secondly,
   this passage removes the offense by which so many persons are greatly
   distressed, when they perceive that some, who formerly professed their
   attachment to Christ and to the gospel, not only fall back into their
   former superstitions but (which is far worse) are bewildered and
   captivated by monstrous errors. For by such examples, God openly
   supports the majesty of the gospel, and openly shows that he cannot at
   all endure the profanation of it. And this is what experience has
   taught us in every age. All the errors that have existed in the
   Christian Church from the beginning, proceeded from this source, that
   in some persons, ambition, and in others, covetousness, extinguished
   the true fear of God. A bad conscience is, therefore, the mother of all
   heresies; and we see that a vast number of persons, who had not
   sincerely and honestly embraced the faith, are hurried along, like
   brute beasts, into the reveries of the Epicureans, so that their
   hypocrisy is exposed. And not only so, but contempt of God is
   universally prevalent, and the licentious and disgraceful lives of
   almost all ranks show that there is either none at all, or the smallest
   possible potion of integrity in the world; so that there is very great
   reason to fear lest the light which had been kindled may be speedily
   extinguished, and God may leave the pure understanding of the gospel to
   be possessed by very few.

   Have made shipwreck: The metaphor taken from shipwreck is highly
   appropriate; for it suggests to us, that, if we wish to arrive safely
   at the harbor, our course must be guided by a good conscience,
   otherwise there is danger of "shipwreck;" that is, there is danger lest
   faith be sunk by a bad conscience, as by a whirlpool in a stormy sea.
   [30]

   20 Of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander. The former will be again
   mentioned in the Second Epistle, in which the kind of "shipwreck" which
   he made is likewise described; for he said that the resurrection was
   past. (2 Timothy 2:17-18.) There is reason to believe that Alexander
   also was bewitched by an error so absurd. And shall we wonder at the
   present day, if any are deceived by the various enchantments of Satan,
   when we see that one of Paul's companions perished by so dreadful a
   fall?

   He mentions both of them to Timothy as persons whom he knew. For my own
   part, I have no doubt that this is the same Alexander that is mentioned
   by Luke, and who attempted, but without success, to quell the
   commotion. Now he was an Ephesian, and we have said that this Epistle
   was chiefly written for the sake of the Ephesians. We now learn what
   was his end; and hearing it, let us keep possession of our faith by a
   good conscience, that we may hold it safe to the last.

   Whom I have delivered to Satan. As I mentioned in the exposition of
   another passage, (1 Corinthians 5:5,) there are some who interpret this
   to mean that extraordinary chastisement was inflicted on those persons;
   and they view this as referring to dunameis, "the powers" mentioned by
   Paul in the same Epistle. (1 Corinthians 12:28.) For, as the apostles
   were endowed with the gift of healing, in order to testify the favor
   and kindness of God towards the godly, so against wicked and rebellious
   persons they were armed with power, either to deliver them to the devil
   to be tormented, or to inflict on them other chastisements. Of this
   "power," Peter gave a display in Ananias and Sapphira, (Acts 5:1,) and
   Paul in the magician Bar-Jesus. (Acts 13:6.) But, for my own part, I
   choose rather to explain it as relating to excommunication; for the
   opinion that the incestuous Corinthian received any other chastisement
   than excommunication is not supported by any probable conjecture. And,
   if by excommunicating him, Paul delivered him to Satan, why should not
   the same mode of expression have a similar import in this passage?
   Besides, it explains very well the force of excommunication; for, since
   in the Church Christ holds the seat of his kingdom, out of the Church
   there is nothing but the dominion of Satan. Accordingly, he who is cast
   out of the Church must be placed, for a time, under the tyranny of
   Satan, until, being reconciled to the Church, he return to Christ. I
   make one exception, that, on account of the enormity of the offense, he
   might have pronounced a sentence of perpetual excommunication against
   them; but on that point I would not venture to make a positive
   assertion.

   That they may learn not to blaspheme. What is the meaning of this last
   clause? For one who has been cast out of the Church takes upon himself
   greater freedom of acting, because, being freed from the yoke of
   ordinary discipline, he breaks out into louder insolence. I reply, to
   whatever extent they may indulge in their wickedness, yet the gate will
   be shut against them, so that they shall not contaminate the flock; for
   the greatest injury done by wicked men is, when they mingle with others
   under the presence of holding the same faith. The power of doing injury
   is taken from them, when they are branded with public infamy, so that
   none are so simple as not to know that these are irreligious and
   detestable men, and therefore their society is shunned by all.
   Sometimes, too, it happens that -- being struck down by this mark of
   disgrace which has been put upon them -- they become less daring and
   obstinate; and therefore, although this remedy sometimes renders them
   more wicked, yet it is not always ineffectual for subduing their
   fierceness.

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Timothy 2:1-4

   1. I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers,
   intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;

   1. Adbortor igitur, ut ante omnia fiant deprecationes, obsecrationes,
   interpellationes, gratiarum actiones pro omnibus hominibus,

   2. For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a
   quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.

   2. Pro regibus et omnibus in eminentia constitutis, ut placidam et
   quietam vitam degamus cum omni pietate et honestate.

   3. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;

   3. Hoc enim bonum et acceptum coram Salvatore nostro Deo,

   4. Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of
   the truth.

   4. Qui omnes homines vult salvos fieri, et ad agnitionem veritatis
   venire.

   1 I exhort therefore. These exercises of godliness maintain and even
   strengthen us in the sincere worship and fear of God, and cherish the
   good conscience of which he had spoken. Not inappropriately does he
   make use of the word therefore, to denote an inference; for those
   exhortations depend on the preceding commandment.

   That, above all, prayers be made. First, he speaks of public prayers,
   which he enjoins to be offered, not only for believers, but for all
   mankind. Some might reason thus with themselves: "Why should we be
   anxious about the salvation of unbelievers, with whom we have no
   connection? Is it not enough, if we, who are brethren, pray mutually
   for our brethren, and recommend to God the whole of his Church? for we
   have nothing to do with strangers." This perverse view Paul meets, and
   enjoins the Ephesians to include in their prayers all men, and not to
   limit them to the body of the Church.

   What is the difference between three out of the four kinds which Paul
   enumerates, I own that I do not thoroughly understand. The view given
   by Augustine, who twists Paul's words so as to denote ceremonial
   observances customary at that time, is quite childish. A simpler
   exposition is given by those who think that "requests" are when we ask
   to be delivered from what is evil; "prayers," when we desire to obtain
   something profitable; and "supplications," when we deplore before God
   injuries which we have endured. Yet for my own part, I do not draw the
   difference so ingeniously; or, at least, I prefer another way of
   distinguishing them.

   Proseuchai is the Greek word for every kind of prayer; and deeseis
   denotes those forms of petitions in which something definite is asked.
   In this way the two words agree with each other, as genus and species.
   'Enteuxeis is the word commonly used by Paul to signify those prayers
   which we offer for one another. The word used for it in the Latin
   Translation is "intercessiones," intercessions. Yet Plato, in his
   second dialogue, styled Alcibiades, uses it in a different sense, to
   moan a definite petition offered by a person for himself; and in the
   very inscription of the book, and in many passages, he shows plainly,
   as I have said, that proseuche is a general term. [31]

   But not to dwell longer than is proper on a matter that is not
   essential, Paul, in my own opinion, simply enjoins that, whenever
   public prayers are offered, petitions and supplications should be made
   for all men, even for those who at present are not at all related to
   us. And yet this heaping up of words is not superfluous; but Paul
   appears to me purposely to join together three terms for the same
   purpose, in order to recommend more warmly, and urge more strongly,
   earnest and constant prayer. We know now sluggish we are in this
   religious duty; and therefore we need not wonder if, for the purpose of
   arousing us to it, the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of Paul, employs
   various excitements.

   And thanksgivings. As to this term, there is no obscurity; for, as he
   bids us make supplication to God for the salvation of unbelievers, so
   also to give thanks on account of their prosperity and success. That
   wonderful goodness which he shews every day, when

   "he maketh his sun to rise on the good and the bad,"
   (Matthew 5:45,)

   is worthy of being praised; and our love of our neighbor ought also to
   extend to those who are unworthy of it.

   2 For kings He expressly mentions kings and other magistrates because,
   more than all others, they might be hated by Christians. All the
   magistrates who existed at that time were so many sworn enemies of
   Christ; and therefore this thought might occur to them, that they ought
   not to pray for those who devoted all their power and all their wealth
   to fight against the kingdom of Christ, the extension of which is above
   all things desirable. The apostle meets this difficulty, and expressly
   enjoins Christians to pray for them also. And, indeed, the depravity of
   men is not a reason why God's ordinance should not be loved.
   Accordingly, seeing that God appointed magistrates and princes for the
   preservation of mankind, however much they fall short of the divine
   appointment, still we must not on that account cease to love what
   belongs to God, and to desire that it may remain in force. That is the
   reason why believers, in whatever country they live, must not only obey
   the laws and the government of magistrates, but likewise in their
   prayers supplicate God for their salvation. Jeremiah said to the
   Israelites,

   "Pray for the peace of Babylon, for in their peace ye shall have
   peace." (Jeremiah 29:7.)

   The universal doctrine is this, that we should desire the continuance
   and peaceful condition of those governments which have been appointed
   by God.

   That we may lead a peaceful and quiet life By exhibiting the advantage,
   he holds out an additional inducement, for he enumerates the fruits
   which are yielded to us by a well regulated government. The first is a
   peaceful life; for magistrates are armed with the sword, in order to
   keep us in peace. If they did not restrain the hardihood of wicked men,
   every place would be full of robberies and murders. The true way of
   maintaining peace, therefore, is, when every one obtains what is his
   own, and the violence of the more powerful is kept under restraint.

   With all godliness and decency The second fruit is the preservation of
   godliness, that is, when magistrates give themselves to promote
   religion, to maintain the worship of God, and to take care that sacred
   ordinances be observed with due reverence. The third fruit is the care
   of public decency; for it is also the business of magistrates to
   prevent men from abandoning themselves to brutal filthiness or
   flagitious conduct, but, on the contrary, to promote decency and
   moderation. If these three things are taken away, what will be the
   condition of human life? If, therefore, we are at all moved by
   solicitude about the peace of society, or godliness, or decency, let us
   remember that we ought also to be solicitous about those through whose
   agency we obtain such distinguished benefits.

   Hence we conclude, that fanatics, who wish to have magistrates taken
   away, are destitute of all humanity, and breathe nothing but cruel
   barbarism. How different is it to say, that we ought to pray for kings,
   in order that justice and decency may prevail, and to say, that not
   only the name of kingly power, but all government, is opposed to
   religion! We have the Spirit of God for the Author of the former
   sentiment, and therefore the latter must be from the Devil.

   If any one ask, Ought we to pray for kings, from whom we obtain none of
   these advantages? I answer, the object of our prayer is, that, guided
   by the Spirit of God, they may begin to impart to us those benefits of
   which they formerly deprived us. It is our duty, therefore, not only to
   pray for those who are already worthy, but we must pray to God that he
   may make bad men good. We must always hold by this principle, that
   magistrates were appointed by God for the protection of religion, as
   well as of the peace and decency of society, in exactly the same manner
   that the earth is appointed to produce food. [32] Accordingly, in like
   manner as, when we pray to God for our daily bread, we ask him to make
   the earth fertile by his blessing; so in those benefits of which we
   have already spoken, we ought to consider the ordinary means which he
   has appointed by his providence for bestowing them.

   To this must be added, that, if we are deprived of those benefits the
   communication of which Paul assigns to magistrates, that is through our
   own fault. It is the wrath of God that renders magistrates useless to
   us, in the same manner that it renders the earth barren; and,
   therefore, we ought to pray for the removal of those chastisements
   which have been brought upon us by our sins.

   On the other hand, princes, and all who hold the office of magistracy,
   are here reminded of their duty. It is not enough, if, by giving to
   every one what is due, they restrain all acts of violence, and maintain
   peace; but they must likewise endeavor to promote religion, and to
   regulate morals by wholesome discipline. The exhortation of David
   (Psalm 2:12) to "kiss the Son," and the prophecy of Isaiah, that they
   shall be nursing -- fathers of the Church, (Isaiah 49:23,) are not
   without meaning; and, therefore, they have no right to flatter
   themselves, if they neglect to lend their assistance to maintain the
   worship of God.

   3 For this is good and acceptable before God. After having taught that
   what he enjoined is useful, he now brings forward a stronger argument
   -- that it pleases God; for when we know what is His will, this ought
   to have the force of all possible reasons. By good he means what is
   proper and lawful; and, since the will of God is the rule by which all
   our duties must be regulated, he proves that it is right because it
   pleases God.

   This passage is highly worthy of observation; and, first, we draw from
   it the general doctrine, that the true rule for acting well and
   properly is to look to the will of God, and not to undertake anything
   but what he approves. Next, there is likewise laid down a rule for
   godly prayer, that we should follow God as our leader, and that all our
   prayer should be regulated by his will and command. If due force had
   been allowed to this argument, the prayers of Papists, in the present
   day, would not have abounded with so many corruptions. For how will
   they prove that they have the authority of God for having recourse to
   dead men as their intercessors, or for praying for the dead? In short,
   in all their form of prayer, what can they point out that is pleasing
   to God?

   4 Who wishes that all men may be saved. Here follows a confirmation of
   the second argument; and what is more reasonable than that all our
   prayers should be in conformity with this decree of God?

   And may come to the acknowledgment of the truth. Lastly, he
   demonstrates that God has at heart the salvation of all, because he
   invites all to the acknowledgment of his truth. This belongs to that
   kind of argument in which the cause is proved from the effect; for, if

   "the gospel is the power of God for salvation to every one that
   believeth," (Romans 1:16,)

   it is certain that all those to whom the gospel is addressed are
   invited to the hope of eternal life. In short, as the calling is a
   proof of the secret election, so they whom God makes partakers of his
   gospel are admitted by him to possess salvation; because the gospel
   reveals to us the righteousness of God, which is a sure entrance into
   life.

   Hence we see the childish folly of those who represent this passage to
   be opposed to predestination. "If God" say they, "wishes all men
   indiscriminately to be saved, it is false that some are predestined by
   his eternal purpose to salvation, and others to perdition." They might
   have had some ground for saying this, if Paul were speaking here about
   individual men; although even then we should not have wanted the means
   of replying to their argument; for, although the will of God ought not
   to be judged from his secret decrees, when he reveals them to us by
   outward signs, yet it does not therefore follow that he has not
   determined with himself what he intends to do as to every individual
   man.

   But I say nothing on that subject, because it has nothing to do with
   this passage; for the Apostle simply means, that there is no people and
   no rank in the world that is excluded from salvation; because God
   wishes that the gospel should be proclaimed to all without exception.
   Now the preaching of the gospel gives life; and hence he justly
   concludes that God invites all equally to partake salvation. But the
   present discourse relates to classes of men, and not to individual
   persons; for his sole object is, to include in this number princes and
   foreign nations. That God wishes the doctrine of salvation to be
   enjoyed by them as well as others, is evident from the passages already
   quoted, and from other passages of a similar nature. Not without good
   reason was it said, "Now, kings, understand," and again, in the same
   Psalm,

   "I will give thee the Gentiles for an inheritance, and the ends of the
   earth for a possession." (Psalm 2:8-10.)

   In a word, Paul intended to shew that it is our duty to consider, not
   what kind of persons the princes at that time were, but what God wished
   them to be. Now the duty arising out of that love which we owe to our
   neighbor is, to be solicitous and to do our endeavor for the salvation
   of all whom God includes in his calling, and to testify this by godly
   prayers.

   With the same view does he call God our Savior; for whence do we obtain
   salvation but from the undeserved kindness of God? Now the same God who
   has already made us partakers of salvation may sometime extend his
   grace to them also. He who hath already drawn us to him may draw them
   along with us. The Apostle takes for granted that God will do so,
   because it had been thus foretold by the predictions of the prophets,
   concerning all ranks and all nations.

   tou deisthai, from being in want' and is a petition for that hou

   consider that when you are in want of anything, your petition is
   deesis.' If we attend again to the customary usage of the word, it
   signifies a petition for a benefit.' My opinion is, that the various
   names express one and the same thing, viewed under various aspects. Our
   prayers are called deeseis, so far as by them we declare to God our
   need; for deesthai is "to be in need.' They are proseuchai, as they
   contain our wishes. They are aitemata, as they express petitions and
   desires. They are enteuxeis, as we are permitted by God to approach
   Him, not with timidity, but in a familiar manner: for enteuxis is a

   1 Timothy 2:5-7

   5. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man
   Christ Jesus;

   5. Unus enim Deus, unus et Mediator Dei et hominum, homo Christus
   Iesus,

   6. Who gave himself for all, to be testified in due time.

   6. Qui dedit semetipsum pretium redemtionis pro omnibus, (ut esset)
   testimonium temporibus suis,

   7. Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the
   truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and
   verity.

   7. In quod positus sum praeco et Apostolus: veritatem dico in Christo,
   non menitor, Doctor Gentium in fide et veritate.

   5 For there is one God This argument might, at first sight, appear to
   be not very strong, that God wishes all men to be saved, because he is
   one; if a transition had not been made from God to men. Chrysostom --
   and, after him, others -- view it in this sense, that there are not
   many gods, as idolaters imagine. But I think that Paul's design was
   different, and that there is here an implied comparison of one God with
   the whole world and with various nations, out of which comparison
   arises a view of both, as they mutually regard each other. In like
   manner the Apostle says,

   "Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yea,
   it is one God who justifieth the circumcision by faith, and the
   uncircumcision through faith.' (Romans 3:29.)

   Accordingly, whatever diversity might at that time exist among men,
   because many ranks and many nations were strangers to faith, Paul
   brings to the remembrance of believers the unity of God, that they may
   know that they are connected with all, because there is one God of all
   -- that they may know that they who are under the power of the same God
   are not excluded for ever from the hope of salvation.

   And one Mediator between God and men This clause is of a similar import
   with the former; for, as there is one God, the Creator and Father of
   all, so he says that there is but one Mediator, [33] through whom we
   have access to the Father; and that this Mediator was given, not only
   to one nation, or to a small number of persons of some particular rank,
   but to all; because the fruit of the sacrifice, by which he made
   atonement for sins, extends to all. More especially because a large
   portion of the world was at that time alienated from God, he expressly
   mentions the Mediator, through whom they that were afar off now
   approach.

   The universal term all must always be referred to classes: of men, and
   not to persons; as if he had said, that not only Jews, but Gentiles
   also, not only persons of humble rank, but princes also, were redeemed
   by the death of Christ. Since, therefore, he wishes the benefit of his
   death to be common to all, an insult is offered to him by those who, by
   their opinion, shut out any person from the hope of salvation.

   The man Christ Jesus. When he declares that he is "a man," the Apostle
   does not deny that the Mediator is God, but, intending to point out the
   bond of our union with God, he mentions the human nature rather than
   the divine. This ought to be carefully observed. From the beginning,
   men, by contriving for themselves this or that mediator, departed
   farther from God; and the reason was, that, being prejudiced in favor
   of this error, that God was at a great distance from them, they knew
   not to what hand to turn. Paul remedies this evil, when he represents
   God as present with us; for he has descended even to us, so that we do
   not need to seek him above the clouds. The same thing is said in
   Hebrews 4:15,

   "We have not a high priest who cannot sympathize within our
   infirmities, for in all things he was tempted."

   And, indeed, if this were deeply impressed on the hearts of all, that
   the Son of God holds out to us the hand of a brother, and that we are
   united to him by the fellowship of our nature, in order that, out of
   our low condition, he may raise us to heaven; who would not choose to
   keep by this straight road, instead of wandering in uncertain and
   stormy paths! Accordingly, whenever we ought to pray to God, if we call
   to remembrance that exalted and unapproachable majesty, that we may not
   be driven back by the dread of it, let us, at the same time, remember
   "the man Christ," who gently invites us, and takes us, as it were, by
   the hand, in order that the Father, who had been the object of terror
   and alarm, may be reconciled by him and rendered friendly to us. This
   is the only key to open for us the gate of the heavenly kingdom, that
   we may appear in the presence of God with confidence.

   Hence we see, that Satan has, in all ages, followed this course, for
   the purpose of leading men astray from the right path. I say nothing of
   the various devices by which, before the coming of Christ, he alienated
   the minds of men, to contrive methods of approaching to God. At the
   very commencement of the Christian Church, when Christ, with so
   excellent a pledge, was fresh in their remembrance, and while the earth
   was still ringing with that delightfully sweet word from his mouth,

   "Come to me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,
   and I will give you rest," (Matthew 11:28,)

   there were, nevertheless, some persons skilled in deception, who thrust
   angels into his room as mediators; which is evident from Colossians
   2:18. But what Satan, at that time, contrived secretly, he carried to
   such a pitch, during the times of Popery, that scarcely one person in a
   thousand acknowledged Christ, even in words, to be the Mediator. And
   while the name was buried, still more was the reality unknown.

   Now that God has raised up good and faithful teachers, who have labored
   to restore and bring to the remembrance of men what ought to have been
   one of the best-known principles of our faith, the sophists of the
   Church of Rome have resorted to every contrivance for darkening a point
   so clear. First, the name is so hateful to them, that, if any one
   mentions Christ as Mediator, without taking notice of the saints, he
   instantly falls under a suspicion of heresy. But, because they do not
   venture to reject altogether what Paul teaches in this passage, they
   evade it by a foolish exposition, that he is called "one Mediator," not
   "the only Mediator." As if the Apostle had mentioned God as one out of
   a vast multitude of gods; for the two clauses are closely connected,
   that "there is one God and one Mediator;" and therefore they who make
   Christ one out of many mediators must apply the same interpretation in
   speaking of God. Would they rise to such a height of impudence, if they
   were not impelled by blind rage to crush the glory of Christ?

   There are others who think themselves more acute, and who lay down this
   distinction, that Christ is the only Mediator of redemption, while they
   pronounce the saints to be mediators of intercession. But the folly of
   these interpreters is reproved by the scope of the passage, in which
   the Apostle speaks expressly about prayer. The Holy Spirit commands us
   to pray for all, because our only Mediator admits all to come to him;
   just as by his death he reconciled all to the Father. And yet they who
   thus, with daring sacrilege, strip Christ of his honor, wish to be
   regarded as Christians.

   But it is objected that this has the appearance of contradiction; for
   in this very passage Paul enjoins us to intercede for others, while, in
   the Epistle to the Romans, he declares that intercession belongs to
   Christ alone. (Romans 8:34.) I reply, the intercessions of the saints,
   by which they aid each other in their addresses to God, do not
   contradict the doctrine, that all have but one Intercessor; for no
   man's prayers are heard either in behalf of himself, or in behalf of
   another, unless he rely on Christ as his advocate. When we intercede
   for one another, this is so far from setting aside the intercession of
   Christ, as belonging to him alone, that the chief reliance is given,
   and the chief reference made, to that very intercession.

   Some person will perhaps think, that it will, therefore, be easy for us
   to come to an agreement with the Papists, if they place below the only
   intercession of Christ, all that they ascribe to the saints. This is
   not the case; for the reason why they transfer to the saints the office
   of interceding is, that they imagine that otherwise we are destitute of
   an advocate. It is a common opinion among them, that we need
   intercessors, because in ourselves we are unworthy of appearing in the
   presence of God. By speaking in this manner, they deprive Christ of his
   honor. Besides, it is a shocking blasphemy, to ascribe to saints such
   excellence as would procure for us the favor of God: and all the
   prophets, and apostles, and martyrs, and even the angels themselves --
   are so far from making any pretension to this, that they too have need
   of the same intercession as ourselves.

   Again, it is a mere dream, originating in their own brain, that the
   dead intercede for us; and, therefore, to found our prayers on this is
   altogether to withdraw our trust from calling upon God. But Paul lays
   down, as the rule for calling on God in a proper manner, faith grounded
   on the word of God. (Romans 10:17.) Justly, therefore, everything that
   men contrive, in the exercise of their own thoughts, without the
   authority of the word of God, is rejected by us.

   But not to dwell on this subject longer than the exposition of the
   passage demands, let it be summed up in this manner; that they who have
   actually learned the office of Christ will be satisfied with having him
   alone, and that none will make mediators at their own pleasure but
   those who neither know God nor Christ. Hence I conclude, that the
   doctrine of the Papists -- which darkens, and almost buries, the
   intercession of Christ, and introduces pretended intercessors without
   any support from Scripture -- is full of wicked distrust, and also of
   wicked rashness.

   6 Who gave himself a ransom for all [34] The mention of redemption in
   this passage is not superfluous; for there is a necessary connection
   between the two things, the sacrifice of the death of Christ, and his
   continual intercession. (Romans 8:34.) These are the two parts of his
   priesthood; for, when Christ is called our priest, it is in this sense,
   that he once made atonement for our sins by his death, that he might
   reconcile us to God; and now having entered into the sanctuary of
   heaven, he appears in presence of the Father, in order to obtain grace
   for us, that we may be heard in his name. (Psalm 110:4; Hebrews 7:17.)
   So much the more does he expose the wicked sacrilege of the Papists,
   who, by making dead saints to be companions of Christ in this affair,
   transfer to them likewise the glory of the priesthood. Read the fourth
   chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, towards the conclusion, and the
   beginning of the fifth chapter, [Hebrews 4:14-5:10,] and you will find
   what I maintain, that the intercession by which God is reconciled to us
   is founded on the sacrifice; which, indeed, is demonstrated by the
   whole system of the ancient priesthood. It follows, therefore, that it
   is impossible to take from Christ any part of the office of
   intercession, and bestow it on others, without stripping him of the
   title of priesthood.

   Besides, when the Apostle calls him antilutron, "a ransom," [35] he
   overthrows all other satisfactions. Yet I am not ignorant of the
   injurious devices of the Papists, who pretend that the price of
   redemption, which Christ paid by his death, is applied to us in
   baptism, so that original sin is effaced, and that afterwards we are
   reconciled to God by satisfactions. In this way they limit to a small
   period of time, and to a single class, that benefit which was universal
   and perpetual. But a full illustration of this subject will be found in
   the Institutes.

   That there might be a testimony in due time; that is, in order that
   this grace might be revealed at the appointed time. The phrase, for
   all, which the Apostle had used, might have given rise to the question,
   "Why then had God chosen a peculiar people, if he revealed himself as a
   reconciled Father to all without distinction, and if the one redemption
   through Christ was common to all?" He cuts off all ground for that
   question, by referring to the purpose of God the season [36] for
   revealing his grace. For if we are not astonished that in winter, the
   trees are stripped of their foliage, the fields are covered with snow,
   and the meadows are stiff with frost, and that, by the genial warmth of
   spring, what appeared for a time to be dead, begins to revive, because
   God appointed the seasons to follow in succession; why should we not
   allow the same authority to his providence in other matters? Shall we
   accuse God of instability, because he brings forward, at the proper
   time, what he had always determined, and settled in his own mind?

   Accordingly, although it came upon the world suddenly and was
   altogether unexpected, that Christ was revealed as a Redeemer to Jews
   and Gentiles, without distinction; let us not think that it was sudden
   with respect to God but, on the contrary, let us learn to subject all
   our sense to his wonderful providence. The consequence will be, that
   there will be nothing that comes from him which shall not appear to us
   to be highly seasonable. On that account this admonition frequently
   occurs in the writings of Paul and especially when he treats of the
   calling of the Gentiles, by which, at that time, on account of its
   novelty, many persons were startled and almost confounded. They who are
   not satisfied with this solution, that God, by his hidden wisdom,
   arranged the succession of the seasons, will one day feel, that, at the
   time when they think that he was idle, he was framing a hell for
   inquisitive persons.

   7 For which I have been appointed. That it may not be thought that he
   makes rash assertions -- as many are wont to do -- on a subject which
   he did not well understand, he affirms that God had appointed him for
   this purpose, that he might bring the Gentiles, who had formerly been
   alienated from the kingdom of God, to have a share in the gospel; for
   his apostleship was a sure foundation of the divine calling. And on
   this account he labors very hard in asserting it, as there are many who
   received it with no small difficulty.

   I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie. He employs an oath, or
   protestation, as in a matter of extraordinary weigh and importance,
   that he is a teacher of the Gentiles, and that in faith and truth These
   two things denote a good conscience, but still it must rest on the
   certainty of the will of God. Thus he means, that he preaches the
   gospel to the Gentiles, not only with pure affection, but also with an
   upright and fearless conscience; because he does nothing but by the
   command of God.

   [33] "Christ is said to be the one Mediator in the same sense that God
   is said to be the one God. As there is but one Creator of man, so there
   is but one Mediator for men. As God is the God of all that died before
   Christ came, as well as of those that died after; so Christ is the
   Mediator of all that died before his coming, as well as of those that
   saw his day. They had Christ for their Mediator, or some other; some
   other they could not have, because there is but one. They might as well
   have had another Creator besides God, as another Mediator besides the
   man Christ Jesus. In regard of the antiquity of his mediation, from the
   foundation of the world, he us represented, when he walks as Mediator
   in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks,' with hair as white as
   wool,' a character of age (Revelation 1:14); as God is described so in
   regard of his eternity, (Daniel 7:9.) There is but one God from
   eternity; but one Mediator, whose mediation hath the same date as the
   foundation of the world, and runs parallel with it." -- Charnock.

   [34] "He gave himself antilutron huper, a ransom for' all. If this does
   not imply the notion of Vicarious, I very much question whether
   language can express it. Lutron is a Ransom; which conveys a vicarious
   sense, in its most common and authorized acceptation. Hanti, which is
   equivalent to Instead, still more fully ascertains and strengthens the
   idea. (Hanti, Matthew 2:22.) By this word the LXX. translated the word
   tht, (tabhdth.) And that tht denotes the substitution of one instead of
   another, no student of the sacred language will venture to deny. (See
   Genesis 22:13; 2 Samuel 18:33; 2 Kings 10:24.) huper, which is
   translated For, and denotes a substitution of one in the place of
   another; this, added to all, renders the expression as determinate and
   emphatical for the purpose as words can possibly be. Thus writes
   Clemens Romanus, To haiua autou edochen huper hemon Iesous Christos ho
   Kurios hemon, chai ten sarcha huper tos earchos hemon, chai ten psuchen
   huper ton psuchon hemon. "Jesus Christ our Lord gave his blood for us,
   and his flesh for our flesh, and his soul for our souls." (Ep. 1 ad
   Corinth.) Exactly to the same purpose Justin the Martyr expresses
   himself: He gave his own Son a ransom (huper) for us, the holy for
   transgressors, the sinless for the sinful, the righteous for the
   unrighteous, the immortal for the mortal.' (Ep. 1 ad Diogn.)" --
   Hervey's Theron and Aspasqo

   [35] "Quand il l'appelle Rancon, ou, Pris de redemption." -- "When he
   calls him the Ransom or Price of our redemption." -- "Christ came to
   give up his life as a lutron. Now lutron properly denotes the ransom
   paid, in order to deliver any one from death, or its equivalent,
   captivity, or from punishment in general. It has been satisfactorily
   proved that, among both the Jews and the Gentiles, peculiar victims
   were accepted as a ransom for the life of an offender, and to atone for
   his offense. -- The antilutron of this passage is a stronger term than
   the lutron of Matthew 20:28, and is well explained by Hesych.,
   antidoton, implying the substitution, in suffering punishment, of one
   person for another. See 1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Titus

   1 Timothy 2:8-10

   8. I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands,
   without wrath and doubting.

   8. Volo igitur orare viros in omni loco, sustollentes puras manus,
   absque ira et disceptatione.

   9. In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel,
   with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or
   pearls, or costly array;

   9. Consimiliter et mulieres in amictu decoro cum verecundia et
   temperantia ornare semetipsas, non tortis crinibus, aut auro, aut
   margaritis, aut vestitu sumptuoso;

   10. But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.

   10. Sed, quod decet mulieres porfitentes pietatem, per bona opera.

   8 I wish therefore that men may pray This inference depends on the
   preceding statement; for, as we saw in the Epistle to the Galatians, we
   must receive "the Spirit of adoption," [37] in order that we may call
   on God in a proper manner. Thus, after having exhibited the grace of
   Christ to all, and after having mentioned that he was given to the
   Gentiles for the express purpose, that they might enjoy the same
   benefit of redemption in common with the Jews, he invites all in the
   same manner to pray; for faith leads to calling on God. Hence, at
   Romans 15:9, he proves the calling of the Gentiles by these passages.

   "Let the Gentiles rejoice with his people." (Psalm 67:5.)

   Again,

   "All ye Gentiles, praise God.', (Psalm 117:1.)

   Again,

   "I will confess to thee among the Gentiles." (Psalm 18:49.)

   The material argument holds good, from faith to prayer, and from prayer
   to faith, whether we reason from the cause to the effect, or from the
   effect to the cause. This is worthy of observation, because it reminds
   us that God reveals himself to us in his word, that we may call upon
   him; and this is the chief exercise of faith.

   In every place This expression is of the same import as in the
   beginning of the First Epistle to the Corinthians,

   "with all that in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our
   Lord," (1 Corinthians 1:2,)

   so that there is now no difference between Gentile and Jew, between
   Greek and barbarian, because all in common have God as their Father;
   and in Christ is now fulfilled what Malachi had foretold, that not only
   in Judea, but throughout the whole world, pure sacrifices are offered.
   (Malachi 1:11.)

   Lifting up pure hands As if he had said, "Provided that it be
   accompanied by a good conscience, there will be nothing to prevent all
   the nations from calling upon God everywhere. But he has employed the
   sign instead of the reality, for "pure hands" are the expressions of a
   pure heart; just as, on the contrary, Isaiah rebukes the Jews for
   lifting up "bloody hands," when he attacks their cruelty. (Isaiah
   1:15.) Besides, this attitude has been generally used in worship during
   all ages; for it is a feeling which nature has implanted in us, when we
   ask God, to look upwards, and has always been so strong, that even
   idolaters themselves, although in other respects they make a god of
   images of wood and stone, still retained the custom of lifting up their
   hands to heaven. Let us therefore learn that the attitude is in
   accordance with true godliness, provided that it be attended by the
   corresponding truth which is represented by it, namely, that, having
   been informed that we ought to seek God in heaven, first, we should
   form no conception of Him that is earthly or carnal; and, secondly,
   that we should lay aside carnal affections, so that nothing may prevent
   our hearts from rising above the world. But idolaters and hypocrites,
   when they lift up their hands in prayer, are apes; for while they
   profess, by the outward symbol, that their minds are raised upwards,
   the former are fixed on wood and stone, as if God were shut up in them,
   and the latter, wrapped up either in useless anxieties, or in wicked
   thoughts, cleave to the earth; and therefore, by a gesture of an
   opposite meaning, [38] they bear testimony against themselves.

   Without wrath Some explain this to mean a burst of indignation, when
   the conscience fights with itself, and, so to speak, quarrels with God
   which usually happens when adversity presses heavily upon us; for then
   we are displeased that God does not send us immediate assistance, and
   are agitated by impatience. Faith is also shaken by various assaults;
   for, in consequence of his assistance not being visible, we are seized
   with doubts, whether or not he cares about us, or wishes us to be
   saved, and things of that nature.

   They who take this view think that the word disputing denotes that
   alarm which arises from doubt. Thus, according to them, the meaning
   would be, that we should pray with a peaceful conscience and assured
   confidence. Chrysostom and others think that the apostle here demands
   that our minds should be calm and free from all uneasy feelings both
   towards God and towards men; because there is nothing that tends more
   to hinder pure calling on God than quarrels and strife. On this account
   Christ enjoins, that if any man be at variance with his brother, he
   shall go and be reconciled to him before offering his gift on the
   altar.

   For my part, I acknowledge that both of these views are just; but when
   I take into consideration the context of this passage, I have no doubt
   that Paul had his eye on the disputes which arose out of the
   indignation of the Jews at having the Gentiles made equal to
   themselves, in consequence of which they raised a controversy about the
   calling of the Gentiles, and went so far as to reject and exclude them
   from the participation of grace. Paul therefore wishes that debates of
   this nature should be put down, and that all the children of God of
   every nation and country should pray with one heart. Yet there is
   nothing to restrain us from drawing from this particular statement a
   general doctrine.

   9 In like manner also women As he enjoined men to lift up pure hands,
   so he now prescribes the manner in which women ought to prepare for
   praying aright. And there appears to be an implied contrast between
   those virtues which he recommends and the outward sanctification of the
   Jews; for he intimates that there is no profane place, nor any from
   which both men and women may not draw near to God, provided they are
   not excluded by their vices.

   He intended to embrace the opportunity of correcting a vice to which
   women are almost always prone, and which perhaps at Ephesus, being a
   city of vast wealth and extensive merchandise, especially abounded.
   That vice is -- excessive eagerness and desire to be richly dressed. He
   wishes therefore that their dress should be regulated by modesty and
   sobriety; for luxury and immoderate expense arise from a desire to make
   a display either for the sake of pride or of departure from chastity.
   And hence we ought to derive the rule of moderation; for, since dress
   is an indifferent matter, (as all outward matters are,) it is difficult
   to assign a fixed limit, how far we ought to go. Magistrates may indeed
   make laws, by means of which a rage for superfluous expenditure shall
   be in some measure restrained; but godly teachers, whose business it is
   to guide the consciences, ought always to keep in view the end of
   lawful use. This at least will be settled beyond all controversy, that
   every thing in dress which is not in accordance with modesty and
   sobriety must be disapproved.

   Yet we must always begin with the dispositions; for where debauchery
   reigns within, there will be no chastity; and where ambition reigns
   within, there will be no modesty in the outward dress. But because
   hypocrites commonly avail themselves of all the pretexts that they can
   find for concealing their wicked dispositions, we are under the
   necessity of pointing out what meets the eye. It would be great
   baseness to deny the appropriateness of modesty as the peculiar and
   constant ornament of virtuous and chaste women, or the duty of all to
   observe moderation. Whatever is opposed to these virtues it will be in
   vain to excuse. He expressly censures certain kinds of superfluity,
   such as curled hair, jewels, and golden rings; not that the use of gold
   or of jewels is expressly forbidden, but that, wherever they are
   prominently displayed, these things commonly draw along with them the
   other evils which I have mentioned, and arise from ambition or from
   want of chastity as their source.

   10 Which becometh women; for undoubtedly the dress of a virtuous and
   godly woman must differ from that of a strumpet. What he has laid down
   are marks of distinction; and if piety must be testified by works, this
   profession ought also to be visible in chaste and becoming dress.

   1 Timothy 2:11-15

   11. Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.

   11. Mulier in quiete discat, cum omni subjectione.

   12. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the
   man, but to be in silence.

   12. Docere autem muliere non permitto, neque auctoritatem sibi sumere
   in virum, sed quietam esse.

   13. For Adam was first formed, then Eve.

   13. Adam enim creatus fuit prior, deinde Eva.

   14. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the
   transgression.

   14. Et Adam no fuit deceptus; sed mulier decepta transgressionis rea
   fuit.

   15. Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they
   continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.

   15. Servabitur autem per generationem, si manserit in fide, et
   caritate, et sanctificatione, cum temperantia.

   11 Let a woman learn in quietness. After having spoken of dress, he now
   adds with what modesty women ought to conduct themselves in the holy
   assembly. And first he bids them learn quietly; for quietness means
   silence, that they may not take upon them to speak in public. This he
   immediately explains more clearly, by forbidding them to teach.

   12 But I suffer not a woman to teach. Not that he takes from them the
   charge of instructing their family, but only excludes them from the
   office of teaching, which God has committed to men only. On this
   subject we have explained our views in the exposition of the First
   Epistle to the Corinthians. [39] If any one bring forward, by way of
   objection, Deborah (Judges 4:4) and others of the same class, of whom
   we read that they were at one time appointed by the command of God to
   govern the people, the answer is easy. Extraordinary acts done by God
   do not overturn the ordinary rules of government, by which he intended
   that we should be bound. Accordingly, if women at one time held the
   office of prophets and teachers, and that too when they were
   supernaturally called to it by the Spirit of God, He who is above all
   law might do this; but, being a peculiar case, [40] this is not opposed
   to the constant and ordinary system of government.

   He adds -- what is closely allied to the office of teaching -- and not
   to assume authority over the man; for the very reason, why they are
   forbidden to teach, is, that it is not permitted by their condition.
   They are subject, and to teach implies the rank of power or authority.
   Yet it may be thought that there is no great force in this argument;
   because even prophets and teachers are subject to kings and to other
   magistrates. I reply, there is no absurdity in the same person
   commanding and likewise obeying, when viewed in different relations.
   But this does not apply to the case of woman, who by nature (that is,
   by the ordinary law of God) is formed to obey; for gunaikokratia (the
   government of women) has always been regarded by all wise persons as a
   monstrous thing; and, therefore, so to speak, it will be a mingling of
   heaven and earth, if women usurp the right to teach. Accordingly, he
   bids them be "quiet," that is, keep within their own rank. [41]

   13 For Adam was first created He assigns two reasons why women ought to
   be subject to men; because not only did God enact this law at the
   beginning, but he also inflicted it as a punishment on the woman.
   (Genesis 3:16.) He accordingly shews that, although mankind had stood
   in their first and original uprightness, the true order of nature,
   which proceeded from the command of God, bears that women shall be
   subject. Nor is this inconsistent with the fact, that Adam, by falling
   from his first dignity, deprived himself of his authority; for in the
   ruins, which followed sin, there still linger some remains of the
   divine blessing, and it was not proper that woman, by her own fault,
   should make her condition better than before. [42]

   Yet the reason that Paul assigns, that woman was second in the order of
   creation, appears not to be a very strong argument in favor of her
   subjection; for John the Baptist was before Christ in the order of
   time, and yet was greatly inferior in rank. But although Paul does not
   state all the circumstances which are related by Moses, yet he intended
   that his readers should take them into consideration. Now Moses shews
   that the woman was created afterwards, in order that she might be a
   kind of appendage to the man; and that she was joined to the man on the
   express condition, that she should be at hand to render obedience to
   him. (Genesis 2:21.) Since, therefore, God did not create two chiefs of
   equal power, but added to the man an inferior aid, the Apostle justly
   reminds us of that order of creation in which the eternal and
   inviolable appointment of God is strikingly displayed.

   14 And Adam was not deceived He alludes to the punishment inflicted on
   the woman:

   "Because thou hast obeyed the voice of the serpent, thou shalt be
   subject to the authority of thy husband, and thy desire shall be to
   him." [43] (Genesis 3:16.)

   Because she had given fatal advice, it was right that she should learn
   that she was under the power and will of another; and because she had
   drawn her husband aside from the command of God, it was right that she
   should be deprived of all liberty and placed under the yoke. Besides,
   the Apostle does not rest his argument entirely or absolutely on the
   cause of the transgression, but founds it on the sentence which was
   pronounced by God.

   Yet it may be thought that these two statements are somewhat
   contradictory: that the subjection of the woman is the punishment of
   her transgression, and yet that it was imposed on her from the
   creation; for thence it will follow, that she was doomed to servitude
   before she sinned. I reply, there is nothing to hinder that the
   condition of obeying should be natural from the beginning, and that
   afterwards the accidental condition of serving should come into
   existence; so that the subjection was now less voluntary and agreeable
   than it had formerly been.

   Again, this passage has given to some people an occasion for affirming
   that Adam did not fall by means of error, but that he was only overcome
   by the allurements of his wife. Accordingly, they think that the woman
   only was deceived by the wiles of the devil, to believe that she and
   her husband would be like the gods; But that Adam was not at all
   persuaded of this, but tasted the fruit in order to please his wife.
   But it is easy to refute this opinion; for, if Adam had not given
   credit to the falsehood of Satan, God would not have reproached him:

   "Behold, Adam is become like one of us." (Genesis 3:22.)

   There are other reasons of which I say nothing; for there needs not a
   long refutation of an error which does not rest on any probable
   conjecture. By these words Paul does not mean that Adam was not
   entangled by the same deceitfulness of the devil, [44] but that the
   cause or source of the transgression proceeded from Eve.

   15 But she shall be saved The weakness of the sex renders women more
   suspicious and timid, and the preceding statement might greatly terrify
   and alarm the strongest minds. For these reasons he modifies what he
   had said by adding a consolation; for the Spirit of God does not accuse
   or reproach us, in order to triumph over us, when we are covered with
   shame, but, when we have been cast down, immediately raises us up. It
   might have the effect (as I have already said) of striking terror into
   the minds of women, [45] when they were informed that the destruction
   of the whole human race was attributed to them; for what will be this
   condemnation? Especially when their subjection, as a testimony of the
   wrath of God, is constantly placed before their eyes. Accordingly,
   Paul, in order to comfort them and render their condition tolerable,
   informs them that they continue to enjoy the hope of salvation, though
   they suffer a temporal punishment. It is proper to observe that the
   good effect of this consolation is twofold. First, by the hope of
   salvation held out to them, they are prevented from falling into
   despair through alarm at the mention of their guilt. Secondly, they
   become accustomed to endure calmly and patiently the necessity of
   servitude, so as to submit willingly to their husbands, when they are
   informed that this kind of obedience is both profitable to themselves
   and acceptable to God. If this passage be tortured, as Papists are wont
   to do, to support the righteousness of works, the answer is easy. The
   Apostle does not argue here about the cause of salvation, and therefore
   we cannot and must not infer from these words what works deserve; but
   they only shew in what way God conducts us to salvation, to which he
   has appointed us through his grace.

   Through child-bearing To censorious men it might appear absurd, for an
   Apostle of Christ not only to exhort women to give attention to the
   birth of offspring, but to press this work as religious and holy to
   such an extent as to represent it in the light of the means of
   procuring salvation. Nay, we even see with what reproaches the conjugal
   bed has been slandered by hypocrites, who wished to be thought more
   holy than all other men. But there is no difficulty in replying to
   these sneers of the ungodly. First, here the Apostle does not speak
   merely about having children, but about enduring all the distresses,
   which are manifold and severe, both in the birth and in the rearing of
   children. Secondly, whatever hypocrites or wise men of the world may
   think of it, when a woman, considering to what she has been called,
   submits to the condition which God has assigned to her, and does not
   refuse to endure the pains, or rather the fearful anguish, of
   parturition, or anxiety about her offspring, or anything else that
   belongs to her duty, God values this obedience more highly than if, in
   some other manner, she made a great display of heroic virtues, while
   she refused to obey the calling of God. To this must be added, that no
   consolation could be more appropriate or more efficacious then to shew
   that the very means (so to speak) of procuring salvation are found in
   the punishment itself.

   If they continue in faith In consequence of the old translation having
   used the expression, "the birth of children," it has been commonly
   thought that this clause refers to the children. But the term used by
   Paul to denote "child-bearing" is a single word, teknogonia, and
   therefore it must refer to the women. As to the verb being plural, and
   the noun singular, this involves no difficulty; for an indefinite noun,
   at least when it denotes a multitude, has the force of a collective
   noun, and therefore easily admits a change from the singular to the
   plural number.

   Besides, that he might not represent all the virtue of women as
   included in the duties of marriage, immediately afterwards he adds
   greater virtues, in which it is proper that godly women should excel,
   that they may differ from irreligious women. Even "child-bearing" is
   obedience acceptable to God, only so far as it proceeds from faith and
   love To these two he adds sanctification, which includes all the purity
   of life which becomes Christian women. Lastly follows sobriety, which
   he formerly mentioned, while he was speaking about dress; but now he
   extends it more widely to the other parts of life.

   1 Timothy 3:1-7

   1. This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he
   desireth a good work.

   1. Certus sermo, si quis episcopatum appetit, praeclarum opus
   desiderat.

   2. A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant,
   sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;

   2. Oportet ergo Episcopum irreprehensibilem esse, unius uxoris maritum,
   sobrium, temperantem, compositum, (vel, honestum,) hospitalem, aptum ad
   docendum.

   3. Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but
   patient, not a brawler, not covetous;

   3. Non vinolentum, (vel, ferocem,) non percussorem, non turpiter lucri
   cupidum, sed aequum, alienum a pugnis, alienum ab avaritia.

   4. One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in
   subjection with all gravity;

   4. Qui domui suae bene praesit, qui filios habeat in subjectione, cum
   omni reverentia.

   1 It is a true saying Chrysostom thinks, that this is the conclusion of
   the preceding doctrine. But I do not approve of the opinion; for Paul
   commonly makes use of this form of expression as a prelude to what he
   is about to introduce, Besides, in the former discourse there was no
   need of so strong an affirmation; but what he is now about to say, is
   somewhat more weighty. Let these words, therefore, be received as a
   preface intended to point out the importance of the subject; for Paul
   now begins a new discourse about ordaining pastors, and appointing the
   government of the Church.

   If any one desireth the office of a bishop [46] Having forbidden women
   to teach, he now takes occasion to speak of the office of a bishop.
   First, that it may be more clearly seen that it was not without reason
   that he refused to allow women to undertake so arduous a work;
   secondly, that it might not be thought that, by excluding women only,
   he admitted all men indiscriminately; and, thirdly, because it was
   highly proper that Timothy and others should be reminded what
   conscientious watchfulness ought to be used in the election of bishops.
   Thus the context, in my opinion, is as if Paul had said, that so far
   are women from being fit for undertaking so excellent an office, that
   not even men ought to be admitted into it without distinction.

   He desireth an excellent work The Apostle affirms that this is no
   inconsiderable work, such as any man might venture to undertake. When
   he says that it is kalos, I have no doubt that he alludes to the
   ancient Greek proverb, often quoted by Plato, duskola ta kala, which
   means that "those things which are excellent, are also arduous and
   difficult;" and thus he unites difficulty with excellence, or rather he
   argues thus, that it does not belong to every person to discharge the
   office of a bishop, because it is a thing of great value.

   I think that Paul's meaning is now sufficiently clear; though none of
   the commentators, so far as I perceive, have understood it. The general
   meaning is, that a selection ought to be made in admitting bishops,
   because it is a laborious and difficult charge; and that they who aim
   at it should carefully consider with themselves, whether or not they
   were able to bear so heavy a burden. Ignorance is always rash; and a
   mature knowledge of things makes a man modest. How comes it that they
   who have neither ability nor wisdom often aspire so confidently to hold
   the reins of government, but because they rush forward with their eyes
   shut? On this subject Quintilian remarked, that the ignorant speak
   boldly, while the greatest orators tremble.

   For the purpose of restraining such rashness in desiring the office of
   a bishop, Paul states, first, that this is not an indolent rank, but a
   work; and next, that it is not any kind of work, but excellent, and
   therefore toilsome and full of difficulty, as it actually is. It is no
   light matter to be a representative of the Son of God, in discharging
   an office of such magnitude, the object of which is to erect and extend
   the kingdom of God, to procure the salvation of souls which the Lord
   himself hath purchased with his own blood, and to govern the Church,
   which is God's inheritance. But it is not my intention at present to
   make a sermon, and Paul will again glance at this subject in the next
   chapter.

   Here a question arises: "Is it lawful, in any way, to desire the office
   of a bishop?" On the one hand, it appears to be highly improper for any
   one to anticipate, by his wish, the calling of God, and yet Paul, while
   he censures a rash desire, seems to permit it to be desired with
   prudence and modesty. I reply, if ambition is condemned in other
   matters, much more severely ought it to be condemned in "the office of
   a bishop." But Paul speaks of a godly desire, by which holy men wish to
   employ that knowledge of doctrine which they possess for the
   edification of the Church. For, if it were altogether unlawful to
   desire the office of a teacher, why should they who spend all their
   youth in reading the Holy Scriptures prepare themselves by learning?
   What are the theological schools but nurseries of pastors?

   Accordingly, they who have been thus instructed not only may lawfully
   devote themselves and their labors to God by a voluntary offering, but
   even ought to do so, and that too, before they have been admitted unto
   the office; provided that, nevertheless, they do not thrust themselves
   forward, and do not, even by their own wish, make themselves bishops,
   but are only ready to discharge the office, if their labors shall be
   required. And if it turn out that, according to the lawful order; they
   are not called, let them know that such was the will of God, and let
   them not take it in that others have been preferred to them. But they
   who, without any selfish motive, shall have no other wish than to serve
   God and the Church, will be affected in this manner; and, at the same
   time, will have such modesty that they will not be at all envious, if
   others be preferred to them as being more worthy.

   If any one object, that the government of the Church is a matter of so
   great difficulty, that it ought rather to strike terror into the minds
   of persons of sound judgment than to excite them to desire it. I reply,
   that the desire of great men does not rest on confidence of their own
   industry or virtue, but on the assistance of

   "God, from whom is our sufficiency,"

   as Paul says elsewhere. (2 Corinthians 3:5.) At the same time, it is
   necessary to observe what it is that Paul calls "the office of a
   bishop;" and so much the more, because the ancients were led away, by
   the custom of their times, from the true meaning; for, while Paul
   includes generally all pastors, they understand a bishop to be one who
   was elected out of each college to preside over his brethren. Let us
   remember, therefore, that this word is of the same import as if he had
   called them ministers, or pastors, or presbyters. [47]

   2 A bishop, therefore, must be blameless The particle therefore
   confirms the exposition which I have given; for, on account of the
   dignity of the office, he concludes that it is requisite that he be a
   man endowed with rare gifts, and not any person taken out of the crowd.
   [48] If the expression used had been "a good work," as the ordinary
   translation has it, or "an honorable work," (honestam,) as Erasmus has
   translated it, the inference would not have been suitable.

   He wishes a bishop to be blameless, [49] instead of which, in the
   Epistle to Titus, He has used (Titus 1:7) the word anenkleton, meaning
   by both words, that he must not be marked by any infamy that would
   lessen his authority. There will be no one found among men that is free
   from every vice; but it is one thing to be blemished with ordinary
   vices, which do not hurt the reputation, because they are found in men
   of the highest excellence, and another thing to have a disgraceful
   name, or to be stained with any baseness. In order, therefore, that a
   bishop may not be without authority, he enjoins that there shall be
   made a selection of one who has a good and honorable reputation, and
   not chargeable with any remarkable vice. Besides, he does not merely
   lay down a rule for Timothy what sort of person he must select, but
   likewise reminds every one of those who aspire to that rank, to
   institute a careful examination of himself and of his life.

   The husband of one wife. It is a childish fancy to interpret this as
   meaning "the pastor of a single church." Another other exposition has
   been more generally received, that the person set apart to that office
   must be one who has not been more than once married, that one wife
   being since dead, so that now he is not a married man. But both in this
   passage and in Titus 1:6, the words of the apostle are, "Who is," and
   not "Who hath been;" and in this very Epistle, where he treats of
   widows, (1 Timothy 3:10,) he expressly makes use of the participle of
   the past tense. Besides, in this way he would contradict himself;
   because elsewhere he declares that he has no wish to lay a snare on the
   consciences.

   The only true exposition, therefore, is that of Chrysostom, that in a
   bishop he expressly condemns polygamy, [50] which at that time the Jews
   almost reckoned to be lawful. This corruption was borrowed by them
   partly from sinful imitation of the Fathers, (for they who read that
   Abraham, Jacob, David, and others of the same class, were married to
   more wives than one at the same time, thought that it was lawful for
   them also to do the same) and partly from neighboring nations; for the
   inhabitants of the East never observed that conscientiousness and
   fidelity in marriage which was proper. However that might be, polygamy
   was exceedingly prevalent among them; [51] and therefore with great
   propriety does Paul enjoin that a bishop should be free from this
   stain.

   And yet I do not disapprove of the opinion of those who think that the
   Holy Spirit intended to guard against the diabolical superstition which
   afterwards arose; as if he had said, "So far is it from being right and
   proper that celibacy should be enforced on bishops, that marriage is a
   state highly becoming in all believers." In this way, he would not
   demand it as a thing necessary for them, but would only praise it as
   not inconsistent with the dignity of the office. Yet the view which I
   have already given is more simple and more solid, that Paul forbids
   polygamy in all who hold the office of a bishop, because it is a mark
   of an unchaste man, and of one who does not observe conjugal fidelity.

   But there it might be objected, that what is sinful in all ought not to
   have been condemned or forbidden in bishops alone. The answer is easy.
   When it is expressly prohibited to bishops, it does not therefore
   follow that it is freely allowed to others. Beyond all doubt, Paul
   condemned universally what was contrary to an unrepealed law of God;
   for it is a settled enactment,

   "They shall be one flesh." (Genesis 2:24.)

   But he might, to some extent, bear with that in others which, in a
   bishop, would have been excessively vile, and therefore not to be
   endured.

   Nor is this a law laid down for the future, that no bishop, who already
   has one wife, shall marry a second or a third, while the first wife is
   still living; but Paul excludes from the office of a bishop any one who
   shall be guilty of such an enormity. Accordingly, what had been once
   done, and could not be corrected, he reluctantly endures, but only in
   the common people. For what was the remedy for those who, under
   Judaism, had fallen into the snare of polygamy? Should they have
   divorced their second and third wives? Such a divorce would not have
   been free from doing wrong. Since, therefore, the deed was done, and
   could not be undone, he left it untouched, but with this exception,
   that no bishop should be blemished by such a stain.

   Sober, temperate, modest The word which we have translated sober,
   Erasmus has translated (vigilantem) watchful. As the Greek word
   nephaleos [52] admits of either signification, the readers may make
   their own choice. I have preferred to translate sophrona, temperate,
   instead of sober, because sophrosune has a more extensive meaning than
   sobriety. Modest means one who conducts himself with decency and
   propriety.

   Hospitable [53] The "hospitality" here spoken of, is toward strangers,
   and this was very common among the ancients; for it would have been
   reckoned disgraceful for respectable persons, and especially for those
   who were well known, to lodge in taverns. In the present day, the state
   of matters is different; but this virtue is and always will be highly
   necessary in a bishop, for many reasons. Besides, during the cruel
   persecution of the godly, many persons must have been constrained
   frequently to change their habitation; and therefore it was necessary
   that the houses of bishops should be a retreat for the exiles. In those
   times hard necessity compelled the churches to afford mutual aid, so
   that they gave lodgings to one another. Now, if the bishops had not
   pointed out the path to others in this department of duty, the greater
   part, following their example, would have neglected the exercise of
   humanity, and thus the poor fugitives would have been greatly
   discouraged. [54]

   Able to teach In the epistle to Titus, doctrine is expressly mentioned;
   here he only speaks briefly about skill in communicating instruction.
   It is not enough to have profound learning, if it be not accompanied by
   talent for teaching. There are many who, either because their utterance
   is defective, or because they have not good mental abilities, or
   because they do not employ that familiar language which is adapted to
   the common people, keep within their own minds the knowledge which they
   possess. Such persons, as the phrase is, ought to Sing to themselves
   and to the muses. [55] They who have the charge of governing the
   people, ought to be qualified for teaching. And here he does not demand
   volubility of tongue, for we see many persons whose fluent talk is not
   fitted for edification; but he rather commends wisdom in applying the
   word of God judiciously to the advantage of the people.

   It is worth while to consider how the Papists hold that the injunctions
   which the apostle gives do not at all belong to them. I shall not enter
   into a minute explanation of all the details; but on this one point
   what sort of diligence do they observe? And, indeed, that gift would be
   superfluous; for they banish from themselves the ministry of teaching
   as low and groveling, although this belonged especially to a bishop.
   But everybody knows how far it is from observing Paul's rule, to assume
   the title of bishop, and boast proudly of enacting a character without
   speaking, provided only that they make their appearance in a theatrical
   dress. As if a horned mitre, a ring richly set in jewels, or a silver
   cross, and other trifles, accompanied by idle display, constituted the
   spiritual government of a church, which can no more be separated from
   doctrine than any one of us can be separated from his own soul.

   3 Not addicted to wine. By the word paroinon, [56] which is here used,
   the Greeks denote not merely drunkenness, but any intemperance in
   guzzling wine. And, indeed, to drink wine excessively is not only very
   unbecoming in a pastor, but commonly draws along with it many things
   still worse; such as quarrels, foolish attitudes, unchaste conduct, and
   other things which it is not necessary to describe. But the contrast
   which is added shortly afterwards, shews that Paul goes farther than
   this.

   Not a striker, not wickedly desirous of gain [57] As he contrasts with
   "a striker" one who is not quarrelsome, and with him who is covetous of
   dishonest gain (aphilarguron) one who is not covetous, so with to
   paroino, him who is addicted to wine, he contrasts one who is gentle or
   kind. The true interpretation is that which is given by Chrysostom,
   that men of a drunken and fierce disposition ought to be excluded from
   the office of a bishop. As to the opinion given by Chrysostom, that "a
   striker" means one who wounds with the tongue, (that is, who is guilty
   of slander or of outrageous reproaches,) I do not admit it. Nor am I
   moved by his argument, that it will be no great matter, if the bishop
   do not strike with the hand; for I think that here he reproves
   generally that fierceness which is often found in the military
   profession, and which is utterly unbecoming in the servants of Christ.
   It is well known to what ridicule they expose themselves, who are more
   ready to strike a blow with the fist, and -- we might even say -- to
   draw the sword, than to settle the disputes of others by their own
   sedate behavior. Strikers is therefore the term which he applies to
   those who deal much in threatenings, and are of a warlike temperament.

   All covetous persons are wickedly desirous of gain; for, wherever
   covetousness is, there will also be that baseness of which the apostle
   speaks. "He who wishes to become rich wishes also to become rich soon."
   [58] The consequence is, that all covetous persons, even though this is
   not openly manifest, apply their minds to dishonest and unlawful gains.
   Accordingly, he contrasts with this vice the contempt of money; as
   there is no other remedy by which it can be corrected. He who will not
   patiently and mildly endure poverty will never escape the disease of
   mean and sordid covetousness.

   Mild and not quarrelsome He contrasts with "the striker" the man who is
   "not quarrelsome." Mild -- which, we have said, is contrasted with
   being "addicted to wine" -- is the term applied to him who knows how to
   bear injuries with a gentle and moderate disposition, who forgives
   much, who passes by insults, who neither makes himself be dreaded
   through harsh severity, nor exacts with full rigor. Not quarrelsome,
   one who avoids disputes and quarrels; for, as he elsewhere writes,

   "the servant of the Lord must not be quarrelsome."
   (2 Timothy 2:24.)

   4 Who ruleth well his own house Hence it is evident, that Paul does not
   demand that a bishop shall be unacquainted within human life, [59] but
   that he shall be a good and praiseworthy master of a household; for,
   whatever may be the admiration commonly entertained for celibacy and a
   philosophical life altogether removed from ordinary custom, yet wise
   and thoughtful men are convinced by experience, that they who are not
   ignorant of ordinary life, but are practiced in the duties of human
   intercourse, are better trained and adapted for governing the Church.
   And, therefore, we ought to observe the reason which is added, (1
   Timothy 3:5,) that he who does not know how to rule his family, Will
   not be qualified for governing the Church. Now, this is the case with
   very many persons, and indeed with almost all who have been drawn out
   of an idle and solitary life, [60] as out of dens and caverns; for they
   are a sort of savages and destitute of humanity.

   Who hath his children in subjection with, all reverence The apostle
   does not recommend a clever man, and deeply skilled in domestic
   matters, but one who has learned to govern a family by wholesome
   discipline. He speaks chiefly of children, who may be expected to
   possess the natural disposition of their father; and therefore it will
   be a great disgrace to a bishop, if he has children who lead a wicked
   and scandalous life. As to wives, he will speak of them afterwards; but
   at present, as I have said, he glances at the most important part of a
   house.

   In the Epistle to Titus, (Titus 1:6,) he shows what is here meant by
   the word reverence; for, after having said that the children of a
   bishop must not be unruly and disobedient, he likewise adds,

   "nor liable to the reproach of profligacy or of intemperance."

   He therefore means, in a word, that their morals shall be regulated by
   all chastity, modesty, and gravity.

   5 And if any one know not how to rule his own house [61] This argument,
   drawn from the less to the greater, is in itself manifest, that he who
   is unfit for governing a family will be altogether unable to govern a
   people. Besides that it is evident that he is destitute of the virtues
   necessary for that purpose, what authority will he have over the
   people, seeing that his own house makes him contemptible?

   6 Not a novice There being many men of distinguished ability and
   learning who at that time were brought to the faith, Paul forbids that
   such persons shall be admitted to the office of a bishop, as soon as
   they have made profession of Christianity. And he shews how great would
   be the danger; for it is evident that they are commonly vain, and full
   of ostentation, and, in consequence of this, haughtiness and ambition
   will drive them headlong. What Paul says we experience; for "novices"
   have not only impetuous fervor and bold daring, but are also puffed up
   with foolish confidence, as if they could fly beyond the clouds.
   Consequently, it is not without reason that they are excluded from the
   honor of a bishopric, till, in process of time their proud temper shall
   be subdued.

   Lest he fall into the condemnation of the devil. The judgment or
   condemnation of the devil may be interpreted in three ways; for some
   take Diabolou (of the devil) to mean Satan; and others, to mean
   slanderers. I give the preference to the former view; because it rarely
   happens that "judgment" means slander. But again, "the judgment of
   Satan" may be taken either actively or passively. This latter sense is
   adopted by Chrysostom, with whom I willingly agree There is an elegant
   contrast, which heightens the enormity of the case, "If he who is
   placed over the Church of God fall, by his pride, into the same
   condemnation with the devil." Yet I do not reject the active
   signification, namely, that he will give the devil occasion for
   accusing him. But the opinion of Chrysostom is more correct. [62]

   7 A good report from those who are without. This appears to be very
   difficult, that a religious man should have, as witnesses of his
   integrity, infidels themselves, who are furiously mad to tell lies
   against us. But the apostle means, that, so far as relates to external
   behavior, even unbelievers themselves shall be constrained to
   acknowledge him to be a good man; for, although they groundlessly
   slander all the children of God, yet they cannot pronounce him to be a
   wicked man, who leads a good and inoffensive life amongst them. Such is
   that acknowledgment of uprightness which Paul here describes. The
   reason is added, --

   Lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil; which I explain
   in this manner: "lest, being subject to reproach, he begin to be
   hardened, and abandon himself the more freely to all iniquity, which is
   to entangle himself in the snares of the devil." For what hope is left
   for him who sins without any shame?

   [47] "Let us know that the Holy Spirit, speaking of those who are
   ordained ministers of the word of God, and who are elected to govern
   the Church, calls them Pastors. And why? Because God wishes us to be a
   flock of sheep, to be guided by him, hearing his voice, following his
   guidance, and living peaceably. Since, therefore the Church is compared
   to a flock, they who have the charge of guiding the Church by the word
   of God are called Pastors. And next, the word Pastor means Elder not by
   age, but by of office: as, at all times, they who govern have been
   called Elders, even among heathen nations. Now the Holy Spirit has
   retained this metaphor, giving the name Elder to those who are chosen
   to proclaim the word of God. He likewise calls them Bishops, that is
   persons who watch over the flock to show that it is not a rank
   unaccompanied by active exertion, when a man is called to that office,
   and that he must not make an idol of it, but must know that he is sent
   to obtain the salvation of souls, and must be employed, and watch, and

   [61] "The house of a believer ought to be like a little church.
   Heathens, who did not know what a church is, said that a house is but
   an image and figure of any public government. A poor man, living with
   his wife and children and servants, ought to be in his house like a
   public governor; but Christians ought to go beyond this. Every father
   of a family should know that God has appointed him to that place, that
   he may know how to govern his wife and children and servants; so that
   God shall be honored in the midst of them, and all shall do Him homage.
   Paul speaks of children; and why? Because he who wishes to discharge
   his duty as pastor of a church must be like a father to all believers.
   Now, let us suppose that a man cannot govern two or three children
   which he has in the house. They are his own children, and yet he cannot
   keep them in subjection; they are deaf to all that he says to them. How
   then shall he be able to govern those who are at a distance, and who
   may be said to be unknown to him, who even refuse to become wiser, and
   think that they have no need of being instructed? How shall he be able
   to keep men in dread when his own wife is not subject to him? Let us
   not, therefore, think it strange if it is required in all pastors, that
   they be good fathers of a family, and know what it is to govern their
   own children well. It is not enough to condemn the children, but we
   must condemn the fathers, when they permit their children to be worse
   than others." -- Fr. Ser.

   [62] "The words eis krima empesHu tou Diabolou are, by most expositors
   ancient and modern, understood of falling into the same condemnation
   and punishment that the devil fell into through pride, which is
   supported by the authority of the Pesch. Syr. Several eminent
   expositors, from Luther and Erasmus downwards, take tou Diabolou to
   mean the "calumniator," or slanderous enemy of the gospel, the noun
   being, they say, used generically of those who seek an occasion to
   calumniate the Christians; but, as Calvin observes, it rarely happens
   that "judgment" means slander.' Moreover, the expression Diabolos would
   thus have to be taken of just condemnation." -- Bloomfield.

   1 Timothy 3:8-13

   8. Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to
   much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;

   8. Diaconos similiter graves, non bilingues, non multo vino deditos,
   non turpiter lucri cupidos:

   9. Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.

   9. Habentes mysterium fidei in pura conscientia.

   10. And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of
   a deacon, being found blameless.

   10. Et hi probentur primum; deinde ministrent ubi irreprehensibiles
   comperti fuerint.

   11. Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful
   in all things.

   11. Uxores similiter graves, non calumniatrices, sobrias, fideles in
   omnibus.

   12. Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children
   and their own houses well.

   12. Diaconi sint unius uxoris mariti, qui honeste praesint liberis et
   domibus suis.

   13. For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to
   themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in
   Christ Jesus.

   13. Nam qui bene ministraverint gradum sibi bonum (vel, honestum)
   acquirunt, et multam libertatem in fide, quae est in Christo Iesu.

   8 Likewise the deacons There is no reason why the diversity of
   interpretations should lead us to entertain any doubt. It is certain
   that time Apostle speaks of those who hold a public office in the
   Church; and this refutes the opinion of those who think that domestic
   servants are here meant. As to the view given by others, that it
   denotes presbyters who are inferior to the bishop, that is without
   foundation; for it is manifest from other passages, that the term
   bishop belongs alike to all presbyters. [63] All are constrained to
   acknowledge this; and more especially a passage in the first chapter of
   the Epistle to Titus proves clearly that this is the meaning. (Titus
   1:7.) It remains to be stated that we understand "the deacons" to be
   those who are mentioned by Luke, (Acts 6:3,) and who had the charge of
   the poor. But those who wish to have a more full account of the duties
   of deacons may consult the Institutes. [64]

   Grave, not double-tongued The first four virtues, with which he wishes
   them to be endowed, are of themselves sufficiently well known. Yet it
   ought to be carefully observed that he advises them not to be
   double-tongued; because it is a vice which it is difficult to avoid in
   the discharge of that office, and yet ought, more than anything else,
   to be kept at a distance from it.

   9 Holding the mystery of faith As if he had said, "Holding the pure
   doctrine of religion, and that from the heart, with a sincere fear of
   God;" or, "Being well instructed in the faith, so as not to be ignorant
   of anything which it is necessary for Christians to know." He gives to
   the sum of Christian doctrine the honorable appellation of a mystery;
   as indeed God, through the gospel, reveals to men on earth a wisdom
   which angels in heaven behold with admiration, and, therefore, we need
   not wonder if it exceed human capacity.

   Let us therefore remember that it ought to be embraced with the deepest
   reverence; and because we could never, by our own strength, ascend to
   such a height, let us humbly entreat God to impart it to us by the
   Spirit of revelation. On the other hand, when we see wicked men either
   ridicule those doctrines or have no relish for them, let us acknowledge
   that it is owing to the grace of God that those things which have been
   hidden from others are in our hearts, and before our eyes, as Moses
   says, (Deuteronomy 30:11.)

   Thus he wishes that deacons should be well instructed in "the mystery
   of faith;" because, although they do not hold the office of teaching,
   yet it would be exceedingly absurd to hold a public office in the
   Church, while they were ill informed in the Christian faith, more
   especially since they must frequently be laid under the necessity of
   administering advice and consolation, if they do not choose to neglect
   their duties. It is added, in a pure conscience, which extends to the
   whole life, but chiefly that they may know how to obey God.

   10 And let those be first tried He wishes that they who are chosen
   should not be unknown, but that their integrity should be ascertained,
   like that of the bishops. And hence it is evident, that they are called
   blameless who are not stained by any marked vice. Besides, this trial
   is not for a single hour, but consists in long experience. In a word,
   when deacons are to be ordained, the choice must not fall at random,
   and without selection, on any that come to hand, but those men are to
   be chosen who are approved by their past life in such a manner that,
   after what may be called full inquiry, they are ascertained to be well
   qualified.

   11. Likewise the wives He means the wives both of deacons and of
   bishops, for they must be aids to their husbands in their office; which
   cannot be, unless their behavior excel that of others.

   Let the deacons be Since he mentioned wives, he lays down the same
   injunction about deacons as he had formerly down about bishops; namely,
   that each of them -- satisfied within having but one wife -- shall set
   an example of a chaste and honorable father of a family, and shall keep
   his children and his whole house under holy discipline. And this
   refutes the error of those who understand this passage as referring to
   domestic servants. [65]

   13. For they who have served well Owing to a practice which came into
   use one or two centuries after the death of the apostles, of choosing
   presbyters from the order of deacons, this passage has been commonly
   interpreted as describing elevation to a higher rank, as if the Apostle
   called to the honor of being presbyters those who had faithfully
   discharged the office of a deacon. For my own part, though I do not
   deny that the order of deacons might sometimes be the nursery out of
   which presbyters were taken, yet I take Paul's words as meaning, more
   simply, that they who have discharged this ministry in a proper manner
   are worthy of no small honor; because it is not a mean employment, but
   a highly honorable office. Now by this expression he intimates how much
   it is for the advantage of the Church to have this office discharged by
   choice men; because the holy discharge of it procures esteem and
   reverence.

   How absurd is it for Papists to maintain that, in making deacons, they
   do what Paul enjoins! First, why do they make deacons but to carry the
   cup in a procession, and to feed the eyes of the ignorant with I know
   not what ridiculous exhibitions? Besides, they do not even observe
   this; for not a single deacon has been made, during the last five
   hundred years, except that, after taking this step, he may immediately
   rise to the priesthood. What impudence is it, to boast of elevating to
   a higher rank those who have ministered well, when they confer their
   priesthood on none but those who have never touched a single part of
   the former office!

   And much liberty in the faith. With good reason does he add this; for
   there is nothing that tends so much to produce liberty as a good
   conscience and a life free from crime and reproach; as, on the
   contrary, timidity must be the lot of those who have a bad conscience.
   And if they sometimes make a valiant boast of liberty, yet it is not
   uniform and constant, nor has it any weight. For this reason he
   describes also the kind of liberty. "In the faith," says he, which is
   in Christ; that is, that they may serve -- Christ with greater
   boldness; as, on the other hand, they who have acted basely in the
   discharge of their office may be said to have their mouth shut and
   their hands tied, and are unfit for doing good; because no reliance --
   no authority is given to them.

   1 Timothy 3:14-16

   14. These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:

   14. Haec tibi scribo, sperans brevi ad te venire.

   15. But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to
   behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living
   God, the pillar and ground of the truth.

   15. Quodsi tardavero, ut videas quomodo oporteat in domo Dei versari,
   quae est Ecclesia Dei viventis, columna et firmamentum veritatis.

   16. And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was
   manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels,
   preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into
   glory.

   16. Et sine controversia magnum est pietatis mysterium; Deus
   manifestatus est in carne, justificatus in Spiritu, visus Angelis,
   praedicatus, Gentibus, fidem obtinuit in mundo receptus est in gloria.

   14 These things I write to thee He holds out to Timothy the hope of his
   coming, partly in order to encourage him, and partly in order to
   repress the insolence of those who grew more haughty on account of his
   absence. And yet he does not make any feigned promise to Timothy, or
   terrify others through false presence; for he fully expected that he
   would come, as it is probable that he came, if he wrote this epistle at
   the time when he passed through Phrygia, as is related by Luke. (Acts
   18:23.) Let us look on this as a proof how great was his anxiety for
   the churches, when he could not endure to delay for a short time a
   remedy for a present evil. Yet immediately afterwards he adds, that he
   wrote this epistle for the purpose of informing Timothy, if it should
   happen that he were delayed longer than he thought.

   15 How thou oughtest to conduct thyself: By this mode of expression he
   commends the weight and dignity of the office; because pastors [66] may
   be regarded as stewards, to whom God has committed the charge of
   governing his house. If any person has the superintendence of a large
   house, he labors night and day with earnest solicitude, that nothing
   may go wrong through his neglect, or ignorance, or carelessness. If
   only for men this is done, how much more should it be done for God?

   In the house of God There are good reasons why God bestows this name on
   his Church; for not only has he received us to be his children by the
   grace of adoption, but he also dwelleth in the midst of us.

   The pillar and foundation of truth No ordinary enhancement is derived
   from this appellation. Could it have been described in loftier
   language? Is anything more venerable, or more holy, than that
   everlasting truth which embraces both the glory of God and the
   salvation of men? Were all the praises of heathen philosophy, with
   which it has been adorned by its followers, collected into one heap,
   what is this in comparison of the dignity of this wisdom, which alone
   deserves to be called light and truth, and the instruction of life, and
   the way, and the kingdom of God? Now it is preserved on earth by the
   ministry of the Church alone. What a weight, therefore, rests on the
   pastors, who have been entrusted with the charge of so inestimable a
   treasure! With what impudent trifling do Papists argue from the words
   of Paul that all their absurdities ought to be held as oracles of God,
   because they are "the pillar of truth," and therefore cannot err!

   First, we ought to see why Paul adorns the Church with so magnificent a
   title. By holding out to pastors the greatness of the office, he
   undoubtedly intended to remind them with what fidelity, and industry,
   and reverence they ought to discharge it. How dreadful is the vengeance
   that awaits them, if, through their fault, that truth which is the
   image of the Divine glory, the light of the world, and the salvation of
   men, shall be allowed to fall! This consideration ought undoubtedly to
   lead pastors to tremble continually, not to deprive them of all energy,
   but to excite them to greater vigilance.

   Hence we may easily conclude in what sense Paul uses these words. The
   reason why the Church is called the "pillar of truth" is, that she
   defends and spreads it by her agency. God does not himself come down
   from heaven to us, nor does he daily send angels to make known his
   truth; but he employs pastors, whom he has appointed for that purpose.
   To express it in a more homely manner, is not the Church the mother of
   all believers? Does she not regenerate them by the word of God, educate
   and nourish them through their whole life, strengthen, and bring them
   at length to absolute perfection? For the same reason, also, she is
   called "the pillar of truth;" because the office of administering
   doctrine, which God hath placed in her hands, is the only instrument of
   preserving the truth, that it may not perish from the remembrance of
   men.

   Consequently this commendation relates to the ministry of the word; for
   if that be removed, the truth of God will fall to the ground. Not that
   it is less strong, if it be not supported by the shoulders of men, as
   the same Papists idly talk; for it is a shocking blasphemy to say, that
   the word of God is uncertain, till it obtain from men what may be
   called a borrowed certainty. Paul simply means what he states elsewhere
   in other words, that since our "faith is by hearing," there will be no
   faith, unless there be preaching. (Romans 10:17.) Accordingly in
   reference to men, the Church maintains the truth, because by preaching
   the Church proclaims it, because she keeps it pure and entire, because
   she transmits it to posterity. And if the instruction of the gospel be
   not proclaimed, if there are no godly ministers who, by their
   preaching, rescue truth from darkness and forgetfulness, instantly
   falsehoods, errors, impostures, superstitions, and every kind of
   corruption, will reign. In short, silence in the Church is the
   banishment and crushing of the truth. Is there anything at all forced
   in this exposition?

   Having ascertained Paul's meaning, let us return to the Papists. First,
   by applying this eulogium to themselves, they act wickedly; because
   they deck themselves with borrowed feathers. For, granting that the
   Church were elevated above the third heaven, I maintain that it has
   nothing to do with them in any manner. Nay, I even turn the whole
   passage against them; for, if the Church "is the pillar of truth," it
   follows that the Church is not with them, when the truth not only lies
   buried, but is shockingly torn, and thrown down, and trampled under
   foot. Is this either a riddle or a quibble? Paul does not wish that any
   society, in which the truth of God does not hold a lofty and
   conspicuous place, shall be acknowledged to be a Church; now there is
   nothing of all this in Popery, but only ruin and desolation; and,
   therefore, the true mark of a Church is not found in it. But the
   mistake arises from this, that they do not consider, what was of the
   greatest importance, that the truth of God is maintained by the pure
   preaching of the gospel; and that the support of it does not depend on
   the faculties or understandings of men, but rests on what is far
   higher, that is, if it does not depart from the simple word of God.

   16 Great is the mystery of godliness Again, here is another
   enhancement. That the truth of God might not, through the ingratitude
   of men, be less esteemed than it ought, he extols its value, by stating
   that

   "great is the secret of godliness;"

   that is, because it does not treat of mean subjects, but of the
   revelation of the Son of God,

   "in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom." (Colossians 2:3.)

   From the greatness and importance of such matters, pastors ought to
   judge of their office, that they may devote themselves to the discharge
   of it with greater conscientiousness and deeper reverence.

   God manifested in the flesh The Vulgate's translator, by leaving out
   the name of God, refers what follows to "the mystery," but altogether
   unskillfully and inappropriately, as will clearly be seen on a bare
   perusal, though he has Erasmus on his side, who, however, destroys the
   authority of his own views, so that it is unnecessary for me to refute
   it. All the Greek copies undoubtedly agree in this rendering, "God
   manifested in the flesh." But granting that Paul did not express the
   name of God, still any one who shall carefully examine the whole
   matter, will acknowledge that the name of Christ ought to be supplied.
   For my own part, I have no hesitation in following the reading which
   has been adopted in the Greek copies. In calling the manifestation of
   Christ, such as he afterwards describes it, a "great mystery," the
   reason is obvious; for this is "the height, depth, and breadth of
   wisdom," which he has elsewhere mentioned, (Ephesians 3:18,) by which
   all our senses must unavoidably be overwhelmed.

   Let us now examine the various clauses in their order. He could not
   have spoken more appropriately about the person of Christ than in these
   words, "God manifested in the flesh." First, we have here an express
   testimony of both natures; for he declares at the same time that Christ
   is true God and true man. Secondly, he points out the distinction
   between the two natures, when, on the one hand, he calls him God, and,
   on the other, expresses his "manifestation, in the flesh." Thirdly, he
   asserts the unity of the person, when he declares, that it is one and
   the same who was God, and who has been manifested in the flesh.

   Thus, by this single passage, the true and orthodox faith is powerfully
   defended against Arius, Marcion, Nestorius, and Eutyches. There is also
   great emphasis in the contrast of the two words, God in flesh How wide
   is the difference between God and man! And yet in Christ we behold the
   infinite glory of God united to our polluted flesh in such a manner
   that they become one. [67]

   Justified in the Spirit As the Son of God "emptied himself,"
   (Philippians 2:7,) by taking upon him our flesh, so there was displayed
   in him a spiritual power which testified that he is God. This passage
   has received various interpretations; but, for my own part, satisfied
   with having explained the Apostle's real meaning, as far as I
   understand it, I shall add nothing more. First, justification here
   denotes an acknowledgment of divine power; as in Psalm 19:9, where it
   is said, that

   "the judgments of God are justified,"

   that is, are wonderfully and absolutely perfect; [68] and in Psalm
   51:5, that "God is justified," meaning that the praise of his justice
   is illustriously displayed. So also, (Matthew 11:19, and Luke 7:35,)
   when Christ says, that

   "Wisdom hath been justified by her children,"

   he means that they have given honor unto her; and when Luke (Luke 7:29)
   relates that the publicans "justified God," he means that they
   acknowledged, with due reverence and gratitude, the grace of God which
   they beheld in Christ. What we read here has, therefore, the same
   meaning as if Paul had said, that he who appeared clothed with human
   flesh was, at the same time, declared to be the Son of God, so that the
   weakness of the flesh made no diminution of his glory.

   Under the word Spirit, he includes everything in Christ that was divine
   and superior to man; and he does so for two reasons: First, because he
   had been humbled in "the flesh," the Apostle now, by exhibiting the
   illustration of his glory, contrasts "the Spirit" with "the flesh."
   Secondly, that glory, worthy of the only-begotten Son of God, which
   John affirms to have been seen in Christ, (John 1:14,) did not consist
   in outward display, or in earthly splendor, but was almost wholly
   spiritual. The same form of expression is used by him, (Romans 1:3-4,)

   "Who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh, and declared
   by the power of the Spirit to be the Son of God;"

   but with this difference, that in that passage he mentions one kind of
   manifestation, namely, the resurrection.

   Seen by angels, preached to the Gentiles All these statements are
   wonderful and astonishing; that God deigned to bestow on the Gentiles,
   who had hitherto wandered in the blindness of their minds, a revelation
   of his Son, which had been unknown even to the angels in heaven. When
   the Apostle says, that he was "seen by angels," he means that the sight
   was such as drew the attention of angels, both by its novelty and by
   its excellence. How uncommon and extraordinary the calling of the
   Gentiles was, we have stated in the exposition of the second chapter of
   the Epistle to the Ephesians. [69] Nor is it wonderful that it was a
   new spectacle to angels, who, though they knew about the redemption of
   mankind, yet did not at first understand the means by which it should
   be accomplished, and from whom it must have been concealed, in order
   that this remarkable display of the goodness of God might be beheld by
   them with greater admiration.

   Obtained belief in the world It was above all things astonishing that
   God made the Gentiles, who were heathens, and the angels, who held
   uninterrupted possession of his kingdom, to be equally partakers of the
   same revelation. But this great efficacy of the preached gospel was no
   ordinary miracle, when Christ, overcoming all obstacles, subdued to the
   obedience of faith those who seemed to be altogether incapable of being
   tamed. Certainly nothing appeared to be less probable -- so completely
   was every entrance closed and shut up. Yet faith vanquished, but by an
   incredible kind of victory.

   Lastly, he says that he was received into glory; that is, from this
   mortal and wretched life. Accordingly, as in the world, so far as
   related to the obedience of faith, so also in the person of Christ, the
   change was wonderful, when, from the mean condition of a servant, he
   was exalted to the right hand of the Father, that every knee may bow to
   him.

   [66] "Les Evesques, e'est a dire, pasteurs de l'Eglise." -- "Bishops,
   that is, pastors of the Church."

   [67] "By the word flesh Paul declares that Christ was true man, and
   that he was clothed with our nature; but, at the same time, by the word
   manifested, he shows that there were two natures. We must not imagine a
   Jesus Christ who is God, and another Jesus Christ who is man; but we
   must know that he alone is both God and man. Let us distinguish his two
   natures, so as to know that this is the Son of God who is our brother.
   Now I have said that God permits the ancient heresies, with which the
   church was troubled, to be revived in our time, in order to excite us
   to greater activity. But, on the other hand, let us observe, that the
   devil is constrained to do his utmost to overthrow this article of
   faith, because he sees clearly that it is the foundation of our
   salvation. For if we have not that mystery of which Paul speaks, what
   will become of us? We are all children of Adam, and therefore we are
   accursed; we are in the pit of death; in short, we are deadly enemies
   of God, and thus there is nothing in us but condemnation and death,
   till we know that God came to seek us, and that, because we could not
   rise to him, he came down to us. Till we have known this, are we not
   more than wretched? For this reason the Devil wished, as far as he
   could, to destroy that knowledge, or rather to mix it with his lies, so
   as to be perverted. On the other hand, when we see that there is such
   majesty in God, how shall we dare to approach unto Him, seeing that we
   are full of misery? We must therefore come to this union of the majesty
   of God with human nature. And thus, in every respect, till we have
   known the divine majesty that is in Jesus Christ, and our human
   weakness which he hath taken upon him, it is impossible for us to have
   any hope, or to be capable of having recourse to the goodness of God,
   or of having the boldness to call upon him, and return to him. In a
   word, we are entirely shut out from the heavenly kingdom, the gate is
   shut against us, and we cannot approach to it in any way whatever." --
   Fr. Ser.

   [68] "When he says, They are justified together,' the meaning is, They

   it is in all points absolutely perfect." -- Calvin's Com. the Book of

   CHAPTER 4
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Timothy 4:1-5

   1. Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some
   shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and
   doctrines of devils;

   1. Spiritus autem clare dicit, quod in posterioribus temporibus
   desciscent quidam a fide, attendentes spiritibus impostoribus, et
   doctrinis daemoniorum.

   2. Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a
   hot iron;

   2. In hypocrisi falsiloquorum, cauterio notatam habentium conscientiam;

   3. Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God
   hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and
   know the truth.

   3. Prohibentium matrimonia contrahere, jubentium abstinere a cibis,
   quos Deus creavit ad percipiendum cum gratiarum actione fidelibus, et
   qui congnoverunt veritatem.

   4. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it
   be received with thanksgiving:

   4. Quod omnis creatura Dei bona, et nihil rejiciendum quod cum
   gratiarum actione sumatur:

   5. For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

   5. Sanctificatur enim per sermonem Dei et precationem.

   1 Now the Spirit plainly saith He had industriously admonished Timothy
   about many things; and now he shews the necessity, because it is proper
   to provide against the danger which the Holy Spirit forewarns to be
   fast approaching, namely, that false teachers will come, who shall hold
   out trifles as the doctrine of faith, and who, placing all holiness in
   outward exercises, shall throw into the shade the spiritual worship of
   God, which alone is lawful. And, indeed, the servants of God have
   always had to contend against such persons as Paul here describes. Men
   being by nature inclined to hypocrisy, Satan easily persuades them that
   God is worshipped aright by ceremonies and outward discipline; and,
   indeed, without a teacher, almost all have this conviction deeply
   rooted in their hearts. Next is added the craftiness of Satan to
   confirm the error: the consequence is, that, in all ages, there have
   been impostors, who recommended false worship, by which true godliness
   was buried. Again, this plague produces another, namely, that, in
   matters indifferent, men are laid under restraint; for the world easily
   permits itself to be hindered from doing that which God had declared to
   be lawful, in order that they may have it in their power to transgress
   with impunity the laws of God.

   Here Paul, therefore, in the person of Timothy, forewarns not only the
   Ephesians, but all the churches throughout the world, about
   hypocritical teachers, who, by setting up false worship, and by
   ensnaring consciences with new laws, adulterate the true worship of
   God, and corrupt the pure doctrine of faith. This is the real object of
   the passage, which it is especially necessary to remark.

   Besides, in order that all may hear with more earnest attention what he
   is going to say, he opens with a preface, that this is an undoubted and
   very clear prophecy of the Holy Spirit. There is, indeed, no reason to
   doubt that he drew all the rest from the same Spirit; but, although we
   ought always to listen to him as communicating the will of Christ, yet
   in a matter of vast importance he wished especially to testify that he
   said nothing but by the Spirit of prophecy. By a solemn announcement,
   therefore, he recommends to us this prophecy; and, not satisfied with
   doing this, he adds that it is plain, and free from all ambiguity.

   In the latter times At that time certainly it could not have been
   expected that, amidst so clear light of the gospel, any would have
   revolted. But this is what Peter says, that, as false teachers formerly
   gave annoyance to the people of Israel, so they will never cease to
   disturb the Christian Church. (2 Peter 3:3.) The meaning is the same as
   if he had said, "The doctrine of the gospel is now in a flourishing
   state, but Satan will not long refrain from laboring to choke the pure
   seed by tares." [70] (Matthew 13:20, 38.)

   This warning was advantageous in the age of the Apostle Paul, that both
   pastors and others might give earnest attention to pure doctrine, and
   not suffer themselves to be deceived. To us in the present day it is
   not less useful, when we perceive that nothing has happened which was
   not foretold by an express prophecy of the Spirit. Besides, we may here
   remark; how great care God exercises about his Church, when he gives so
   early warning of dangers. Satan has, indeed, manifold arts for leading
   us into error, and attacks us by astonishing stratagems; but, on the
   other hand, fortifies us sufficiently, if we did not of our own accord
   choose to be deceived. There is therefore no reason to complain that
   darkness is more powerful than light, or that truth is vanquished by
   falsehood; but, on the contrary, we suffer the punishment of our
   carelessness and indolence, when we are led aside from the right way of
   salvation.

   But they who flatter themselves in their errors object, that it is
   hardly possible to distinguish whom or what kind of persons Paul
   describes. As if it were for nothing that the Spirit uttered this
   prophecy, and published it so long before; for, if there were no
   certain mark, the whole of the present warning would be superfluous,
   and consequently absurd. But far be it from us to think that the Spirit
   of God gives us unnecessary alarm, or does not accompany the
   threatening of danger by shewing how we should guard against it! And
   that slander is sufficiently refuted by the words of Paul; for he
   points out, as with the finger, that evil which he warns us to avoid.
   He does not speak, in general terms, about false prophets, but plainly
   describes the kind of false doctrine; namely, that which, by linking
   godliness with outward elements, perverts and profanes, as I have
   already said, the spiritual worship of God.

   Some will revolt from the faith It is uncertain whether he speaks of
   teachers or of hearers; but I am more disposed to refer it to the
   latter; for he afterwards calls teachers spirits that are impostors.
   And this is (emphatikoteron) more emphatic, that not only will there be
   those who sow wicked doctrines, and corrupt the purity of faith, but
   that they can never want disciples whom they call draw into their sect;
   and when a lie thus gains prevalence, there arises from it greater
   trouble.

   Besides, it is no slight vice which he describes, but a very heinous
   crime -- apostasy from the faith; although, at first sight, in the
   doctrine which he briefly notices there does not appear to be so much
   evil. What is the case? Is faith completely overturned on account of
   the prohibition of marriage, or of certain kinds of food? But we must
   take into view a higher reason, that men pervert and invent at their
   pleasure the worship of God, that they assume dominion over the
   consciences, and that they dare to forbid that use of good things which
   the Lord has permitted. As soon as the purity of the worship of God is
   impaired, there no longer remains anything perfect or sound, and faith
   itself is utterly ruined.

   Accordingly, although Papists laugh at us, when we censure their
   tyrannical laws about outward observances, yet we know that we are
   pleading a cause of the greatest weight and importance; because the
   doctrine of faith is destroyed, as soon as the worship of God is
   infected by such corruptions. The controversy is not about flesh or
   fish, or about a black or ashy color, or about Friday or Wednesday, but
   about the mad superstitions of men, who wish to appease God by such
   trifles, and, by contriving a carnal worship of him, contrive for
   themselves an idol instead of God. Who will deny that this is revolting
   from the faith?

   To deceiving spirits He means prophets or teachers, to whom he gives
   this designation, because they boast of the Spirit, and, under this
   title, insinuate themselves into the favor of the people. This, indeed,
   is true at all times, that men, whatever they are, speak under the
   excitement of the spirit. But it is not the same spirit that excites
   them all; for sometimes Satan is a lying spirit in the mouth of the
   false prophets, in order to deceive unbelievers, who deserve to be
   deceived. (1 Kings 22:21-23.) On the other hand, every one that renders
   due honor to Christ speaks by the Spirit of God, as Paul testifies. (1
   Corinthians 12:3.)

   Now that mode of expression, of which we are now speaking, originated
   at first from this circumstance, that the servants of God professed to
   have from the revelation of the Spirit, everything that they uttered in
   public. This was actually true; and hence they received the name of the
   Spirit, whose organs they were. But the ministers of Satan, by a false
   emulation, like apes, began afterwards to make the same boast, and
   likewise falsely assumed the name. On the same grounds John says,

   "Try the spirits, whether they are of God." (1 John 4:1.)

   Moreover, Paul explains his meaning by adding, to doctrines of devils;
   which is as if he had said, "Attending to false prophets, and to their
   devilish doctrines." Again observe, that it is not an error of small
   importance, or one that ought to be concealed, when consciences are
   bound by the contrivances of men, and at the same time the worship of
   God is corrupted.

   2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy If these words refer to "demons," then
   this word will mean men deceiving through the instigation of the devil.
   But we may also supply the words, "of men speaking." He now descends to
   a particular instance, when he says that they "speak lies in
   hypocrisy," and have their conscience seared with a hot iron And,
   indeed, it ought to be known that these two are so closely Joined
   together that the former springs from the latter; for consciences, that
   are bad and seared with the hot iron of their crimes, always flee to
   hypocrisy as a ready refuge; that is, they contrive hypocritical
   presences, in order to dazzle the eyes of God; and what else is done by
   those who endeavor to appease God by the mask of outward observances?

   The word hypocrisy must therefore be explained agreeably to the passage
   in which it now occurs; for, first, it must relate to doctrine, and,
   next, it denotes that kind of doctrine which adulterates the spiritual
   worship of God by exchanging its genuine purity for bodily exercises;
   and thus it includes all methods contrived by men for appeasing God or
   obtaining his favor. The meaning may be thus summed up; first, that all
   who assume a pretended sanctimoniousness are led by the instigation of
   the devil; because God is never worshipped aright by outward
   ceremonies; for true worshipers

   "worship him in spirit and truth," (John 4:24)

   and, secondly, that this is a useless medicine, by which hypocrites
   mitigate their pains, or rather a plaster by which bad consciences
   conceal their wounds, without any advantage, and to their utter
   destruction.

   3 Forbidding to marry. Having described the class, he next mentions two
   instances, [71] namely, the prohibition of marriage and of some kinds
   of food. They arise from that hypocrisy which, having forsaken true
   holiness, seeks something else for the purpose of concealment and
   disguise; for they who do not keep from ambition, covetousness, hatred,
   cruelty, and such like, endeavor to obtain a righteousness by
   abstaining from those things which God has left at large. Why are
   consciences burdened by those laws, but because perfection is sought in
   something different from the law of God? This is not done but by
   hypocrites, who, in order that they may with impunity transgress that
   righteousness of the heart which the law requires, endeavor to conceal
   their inward wickedness by those outward observances as veils with
   which they cover themselves.

   This was a distinct threatening of danger, so that it was not difficult
   for men to guard against it, at least if they had lent their ears to
   the Holy Spirit, when he gave so express a warning. Yet we see that the
   darkness of Satan generally prevailed, so that the clear light of this
   striking and memorable prediction was of no avail. Not long after the
   death of the apostle, arose Encratites, (who took their name from
   continence,) Tatianists, [72] Catharists, Montanus with his sect, and
   at length Manichaeans, who had extreme aversion to marriage and the
   eating of flesh, and condemned them as profane things. Although they
   were disowned by the Church, on account of their haughtiness, in
   wishing to subject others to their opinions, yet it is evident that
   those who opposed them yielded to their error more than was proper. It
   was not intended by those of whom I am now speaking to impose a law on
   Christians; but yet they attached greater weight than they ought to
   have done to superstitious observances, such as abstaining from
   marriage, and not tasting flesh.

   Such is the disposition of the world, always dreaming that God ought to
   be worshipped in a carnal manner, as if God were carnal. Matters
   becoming gradually worse, this tyranny was established, that it should
   not be lawful for priests or monks to enter into the married state, and
   that no person should dare to taste flesh on certain days. Not
   unjustly, therefore, do we maintain that this prediction was uttered
   against the Papists, since celibacy and abstinence from certain kinds
   of food are enjoined by them more strictly than any commandment of God.
   They think that they escape by an ingenious artifice, when they torture
   Paul's words to direct them against Tatianists or Manichaeans, or such
   like; as if the Tatianists had not the same means of escape open to
   them by throwing back the censure of Paul on the Cataphrygians, and on
   Montanus the author of that sect; or as if the Cataphrygians had it not
   in their power to bring forward the Encratites, in their room, as the
   guilty parties. But Paul does not here speak of persons, but of the
   thing itself; and, therefore although a hundred different sects be
   brought forward, all of which are charged with the same hypocrisy in
   forbidding some kinds of food, they shall all incur the same
   condemnation.

   Hence it follows, that to no purpose do the Papists point to the
   ancient heretics, as if they alone were censured; we must always see if
   they are not guilty in the same manner. They object, that they do not
   resemble the Encratites and Manichaens, because they do not absolutely
   forbid the use of marriage and of flesh, but only on certain days
   constrain to abstinence from flesh, and make the vow of celibacy
   compulsory on none but monks and priests and nuns. But this excuse also
   is excessively frivolous; for, first, they nevertheless make holiness
   to consist in these things; next, they set up a false and spurious
   worship of God; and lastly, they bind consciences by a necessity from
   which they ought to have been free.

   In the fifth book of Eusebius, there is a fragment taken out of the
   writings of Apollonius, in which, among other things, he reproaches
   Montanus with being the first that dissolved marriage, and laid down
   laws for fasting. He does not say, that Montanus absolutely prohibited
   marriage or certain kinds of food. It is enough if he lay a religious
   obligation on the consciences, and command men to worship God by
   observing those things; for the prohibition of things that are
   indifferent, whether it be general or special, is always a diabolical
   tyranny. That this is true in regard to certain kinds of food will
   appear more clearly from the next clause,

   Which God created. It is proper to observe the reason, that, in the use
   of various kinds of food, we ought to be satisfied with the liberty
   which God has granted to us; because He created them for this purpose.
   It yields inconceivable joy to all the godly, when they know that all
   the kinds of food which they eat are put into their hands by the Lord,
   so that the use of them is pure and lawful. What insolence is it in men
   to take away what God bestows! Did they create food? Can they make void
   the creation of God? Let it always be remembered by us, that he who
   created the food, gave us also the free use of it, which it is vain for
   men to attempt to hinder.

   To be received with Thanksgiving God created food to be received; that
   is, that we may enjoy it. This end can ever be set aside by human
   authority. He adds, with thanksgiving; because we can never render to
   God any recompense for his kindness but a testimony of gratitude. And
   thus he holds up to greater abhorrence those wicked lawgivers who, by
   new and hasty enactments, hinder the sacrifice of praise which God
   especially requires us to offer to him. Now, there can be no
   thanksgiving without sobriety and temperance; for the kindness of God
   is not truly acknowledged by him who wickedly abuses it.

   By believers What then? Does not God make his sun to rise daily on the
   good and the bad? (Matthew 5:45.) Does not the earth, by his command,
   yield bread to the wicked? Are not the very worst of men fed by his
   blessing? When David says,

   "He causeth the herb to grow for the service of men, that he may bring
   forth food out of the earth," (Psalm 104:14)

   the kindness which he describes is universal. I reply, Paul speaks here
   of the lawful use, of which we are assured before God. Wicked men are
   in no degree partakers of it, on account of their impure conscience,
   which, as is said,

   "defileth all things." (Titus 1:15,)

   And indeed, properly speaking, God has appointed to his children alone
   the whole world and all that is in the world. For this reason, they are
   also called the heirs of the world; for at the beginning Adam was
   appointed to be lord of all, on this condition, that he should continue
   in obedience to God. Accordingly, his rebellion against God deprived of
   the right, which had been bestowed on him, not only himself but his
   posterity. And since all things are subject to Christ, we are fully
   restored by His mediation, and that through faith; and therefore all
   that unbelievers enjoy may be regarded as the property of others, which
   they rob or steal.

   And by those that know the truth In this clause he defines who they are
   whom he calls "believers," namely, those that have a knowledge of sound
   doctrine; for there is no faith but from the word of God; in order that
   we may not falsely think, as the Papists imagine, that faith is a
   confused opinion.

   4 For every creature of God is good The use of food must be judged,
   partly from its substance, and partly from the person of him who eats
   it. The Apostle therefore avails himself of both arguments. So far as
   relates to food, he asserts that it is pure, because God has created
   it; and that the use of it is consecrated to us by faith and prayer.
   The goodness of the creatures, which he mentions, has relation to men,
   and that not with regard to the body or to health, but to the
   consciences. I make this remark, that none may enter into curious
   speculations unconnected with the scope of the passage; for, in a
   single word, Paul means, that those things which come from the hand of
   God, and are intended for our use, are not unclean or polluted before
   God, but that we may freely eat them with regard to conscience.

   If it be objected, that many animals were formerly pronounced to be
   unclean under the Law, and that fruit, which was yielded by the tree of
   knowledge of good and evil, was destructive to man; the answer is, that
   creatures are not called pure, merely because they are the works of
   God, but because, through his kindness, they have been given to us; for
   we must always look at the appointment of God, both what he commands
   and what he forbids.

   5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer This is the
   confirmation of the preceding clause, if it be received with
   Thanksgiving. And it is an argument drawn from contrast; for "holy" and
   "profane" are things contrary to each other. Let us now see what is the
   sanctification of all good things, which belong to the sustenance of
   the present life. Paul testifies that it consists of "the word of God
   and prayer." But it ought to be observed, that this word must be
   embraced by faith, in order that it may be advantageous; for, although
   God himself sanctifies all things by the Spirit of his mouth, yet we do
   not obtain that benefit but by faith. To this is added "prayer;" for,
   on the one hand, we ask from God our daily bread, according to the
   commandment of Christ, (Matthew 6:11;) and, on the other hand we offer
   thanksgiving to Him for His goodness.

   Now Paul's doctrine proceeds on this principle, that there is no good
   thing, the possession of which is lawful, unless conscience testify
   that it is lawfully our own. And which of us would venture to claim for
   himself a single grain of wheat, if he were not taught by the word of
   God that he is the heir of the world? Common sense, indeed, pronounces,
   that the wealth of the world is naturally intended for our use; but,
   since dominion over the world was taken from us in Adam, everything
   that we touch of the gifts of God is defiled by our pollution; and, on
   the other hand, it is unclean to us, till God graciously come to our
   aid, and by ingrafting us into his Son, constitutes us anew to be lords
   of the world, that we may lawfully use as our own all the wealth with
   which he supplies us.

   Justly, therefore, does Paul connect lawful enjoyment with "the word",
   by which alone we regain what was lost in Adam; for we must acknowledge
   God as our Father, that we may be his heirs, and Christ as our Head,
   that those things which are his may become ours. Hence it ought to be
   inferred that the use of all the gifts of God is unclean, unless it be
   accompanied by true knowledge and calling on the name of God; and that
   it is a beastly way of eating, when we sit down at table without any
   prayer; and, when we have eaten to the full, depart in utter
   forgetfulness of God.

   And if such sanctification is demanded in regard to common food, which,
   together with the belly, is subject to corruption, what must we think
   about spiritual sacraments? If "the word," and calling on God through
   faith, be not there, what remains that is not profane? Here we must
   attend to the distinction between the blessing of the sacramental table
   and the blessing of a common table; for, as to the food which we eat
   for the nourishment of our body, we bless it for this purpose, that we
   may receive it in a pure and lawful manner; but we consecrate, in a
   more solemn manner, the bread and wine in the Lord's Supper, that they
   may be pledges to us of the body and blood of Christ.

   1 Timothy 4:6-10

   6. If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt
   be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith
   and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.

   6. Haec suggerens fratribus, bonus eris Iesu Christi minister,
   innutritus sermonibus fidei, et bonae doctrinae quam sequutus es.

   7. But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself
   rather unto godliness.

   7. Profanas autem et aniles fabulas devita, quin potius exerce te ipsum
   ad pietatem.

   8. For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable
   unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that
   which is to come.

   8. Nam corporalis exercitatio paululum habet utilitatis; at pietas ad
   omnia utilis est, ut quae promissiones habeat vitae praesentis et
   futurae.

   9. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation.

   9. Fidelis sermo, dignusque qui modis onmibus approbetur.

   10. For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust
   in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those
   that believe.

   10. Nam in hoc et laboramus, et probris afficimur, quod spem fixam
   habemus in Deo vivente, qui servator est omnium hominum, maxime
   fidelium.

   6 Exhibiting these things to the brethren By this expression he exhorts
   Timothy to mention those things frequently; and he afterwards repeats
   this a second and a third time; for they are things of such a nature as
   it is proper to call frequently to remembrance. And we ought to make
   the contrast which is implied; for the doctrine which he commends is
   here contrasted by him not with false or wicked doctrines, but with
   useless trifles which do not edify. He wishes that those trifles may be
   entirely buried in forgetfulness, when he enjoins Timothy to be earnest
   in exhibiting other things.

   Thou shalt be a good minister Men frequently aim at something else than
   to approve themselves to Christ; and consequently many are desirous of
   being applauded for genius, eloquence, and profound knowledge. And that
   is the very reason why they pay less attention to necessary things,
   which do not tend to procure the admiration of the common people. But
   Paul enjoins Timothy to be satisfied with this alone, to be a faithful
   minister of Christ. And certainly we ought to look on this as a far
   more honorable title than to be a thousand times called seraphic and
   subtle doctors. Let us, therefore, remember, that as it is the highest
   honor of a godly pastor to be reckoned a good servant of Christ, so he
   ought to aim at nothing else during his whole ministry; for whoever has
   any other object in view, will have it in his power to obtain applause
   from men, but will not please God. Accordingly, that we may not be
   deprived of so great a blessing, let us learn to seek nothing else, and
   to account nothing so valuable, and to treat everything as worthless in
   comparison of this single object.

   Nourished The Greek word entrephomenos being a participle in the Middle
   Voice, might also have been translated in an active signification,
   nourishing; but as there is no noun governed by the verb, I think that
   this would be rather a forced construction; and, therefore, I prefer to
   take it in a passive sense, as confirming the preceding exhortation by
   the education of Timothy. As if he had said, "As thou hast been, from
   thy infancy, properly instructed in the faith, and, so to speak, hast
   sucked along with the milk sound doctrine, and hast made continual
   progress in it hitherto, endeavor, by faithful ministration, to prove
   that thou art such." This meaning agrees also with the composition of
   the word entrephomenos

   In the words of faith and of good doctrine. Faith is here taken for the
   sum of Christian doctrine; and what he immediately adds, about good
   doctrine, is for the sake of explanation; [73] for he means, that all
   other doctrines, how plausible so ever they may be, are not at all
   profitable.

   Which thou hast followed This clause denotes perseverance; for many
   who, from their childhood, had purely learned Christ, afterwards
   degenerate in process of time; and the Apostle says, that Timothy was
   very unlike these persons.

   7 Exercise thyself to godliness [74] After having instructed him as to
   doctrine, what it ought to be, he now also admonishes him what kind of
   example he ought to give to others. He says, that he ought to be
   employed in "godliness;" for, when he says, Exercise thyself, he means
   that this is his proper occupation, his labor, his chief care. As if he
   had said, "There is no reason why you should weary yourself to no
   purpose about other matters; you will do that which is of the highest
   importance, if you devote yourself, with all your zeal, and with all
   your ability, to godliness alone." By the word godliness, he means the
   spiritual worship of God which consists in purity of conscience; which
   is still more evident from what follows, when it is contrasted with
   bodily exercise.

   8 For bodily exercise is of little profit. By the exercise "of the
   body," he does not mean that which lies in hunting, or in the
   race-course, or in wrestling, or in digging, or in the mechanical
   occupations; but he gives that name to all the outward actions that are
   undertaken, for the sake of religion, such as watchings, long fasts,
   lying on the earth, and such like. Yet he does not here censure the
   superstitious observance of those things; otherwise he would totally
   condemn them, as he does in the Epistle to the Colossians, (Colossians
   2:21,) but at present he only speaks slightingly of them, and says that
   they are of little advantage. So, then though the heart be altogether
   upright, and the object proper, yet, in outward actions, Paul finds
   nothing that he can value highly.

   This is a very necessary warning; for the world will always lean to the
   side of wishing to worship God by outward services; which is an
   exceedingly dangerous imagination. But -- to say nothing about the
   wicked opinion of merit -- our nature always disposes us strongly to
   attribute more than we ought to austerity of life; as if it were no
   ordinary portion of Christian holiness. A clearer view of this cannot
   be adduced, than the fact, that, shortly after the publication of this
   command, the whole world was ravished with immoderate admiration of the
   empty form of bodily exercises. Hence arose the order of monks and
   nuns, and nearly all the most excellent discipline of the ancient
   Church, or, at least, that part of it which was most highly esteemed by
   the common people. If the ancient monks had not dreamed that there was
   some indescribably divine or angelical perfection in their austere
   manner of living, they would never have pursued it with so much ardor.
   In like manner, if pastors had not attached undue value to the
   ceremonies which were then observed for the mortification of the flesh,
   they would never have been so rigid in exacting them. And what does
   Paul say on the other hand? That, when any one shall have labored much
   and long in those exercises, the profit will be small and
   inconsiderable; for they are nothing but the rudiments of childish
   discipline.

   But godliness is profitable for all things That is, he who has
   godliness wants nothing, though he has not those little aids; for
   godliness alone is able to conduct a man to complete perfection. It is
   the beginning, the middle, and the end, of Christian life; and,
   therefore, where that is entire, nothing is imperfect. Christ did not
   lead so austere a manner of life as John the Baptist; was he,
   therefore, any whit inferior? Let the meaning be thus summed up. "We
   ought to apply ourselves altogether to piety alone; because when we
   have once attained it, God asks nothing more from us; and we ought to
   give attention to bodily exercises in such a manner as not to hinder or
   retard the practice of godliness."

   Which hath the promises It is a very great consolation, that God does
   not wish the godly to be in want of anything; for, having made our
   perfection to consist in godliness, he now makes it the perfection of
   all happiness. As it is the beginning of happiness in this life, so he
   likewise extends to it the promise of divine grace, which alone makes
   us happy, and without which we are very miserable; for God testifies
   that, even in this life, he will be our Father.

   But let us remember to distinguish between the good things of the
   present and of the future life; for God bestows kindness on us in this
   world, in order that he may give us only a taste of his goodness, and
   by such a taste may allure us to the desire of heavenly benefits, that
   in them we may find satisfaction. The consequence is, that the good
   things of the present life are not only mingled with very many
   afflictions, but, we may almost say, overwhelmed by them; for it is not
   expedient for us to have abundance in this world, lest we should
   indulge in luxury. Again, lest any one should found on this passage the
   merits of works, we ought to keep in mind what we have already said,
   that godliness includes not only a good conscience toward men, and the
   fear of God, but likewise faith and calling upon him.

   9 This is a faithful saying He now sets down, at the conclusion of the
   argument, what he stated twice at the beginning of it; and he appears
   to do so expressly, because he will immediately subjoin the contrary
   objection. Yet it is not without good reason that he employs so strong
   an assertion; for it is a paradox strongly at variance with the feeling
   of the flesh, that God supplies his people, in this world, with
   everything that is necessary for a happy and joyful life; since they
   are often destitute of all good things, and, on that account, appear to
   be forsaken by God. Accordingly, not satisfied with the simple
   doctrine, he wards off all opposing temptations by this shield, and in
   this manner instructs believers to open the door to the grace of God,
   which our unbelief shuts out; for, undoubtedly if we were willing to
   receive God's benefits, [75] he would use greater liberality toward us.

   10 For in this we both labor and suffer reproaches This is an
   anticipation by which he solves that question, "Are not believers the
   most miserable of all men, because they are oppressed by tribulations
   of every kind?" In order to show, therefore, that their condition must
   not be judged from outward appearance, he distinguishes them from
   others, first in the cause, and next in the result. Hence it follows,
   that they lose nothing of the promises which he has mentioned, when
   they are tried by adversity. The sum is, that believers are not
   miserable in afflictions, because a good conscience supports them, and
   a blessed and joyful end awaits them.

   Now, since the happiness of the present life consists chiefly of two
   parts, honor and conveniences, he contrasts them within two evils,
   toils and reproach, meaning by the former words, inconveniences and
   annoyances of every kind, such as poverty, cold, nakedness, hunger,
   banishments, spoliations, imprisonments, scourgings, and other
   persecutions.

   We have hope fixed on the living God This consolation refers to the
   cause; for so far are we from being miserable, when we suffer on
   account of righteousness, that it is rather a just ground of
   thanksgiving. Besides, our afflictions are accompanied by hope in the
   living God, and, what is more, hope may be regarded as the foundation;
   but it never maketh ashamed, (Romans 5:5,) and therefore everything
   that happens to the godly ought to be reckoned a gain.

   Who is the Savior [76] This is the second consolation, though it
   depends on the former; for the deliverance of which he speaks may be
   viewed as the fruit of hope. To make this more clear, it ought to be
   understood that this is an argument drawn from the less to the greater;
   for the word soter [77] is here a general term, and denotes one who
   defends and preserves. He means that the kindness of God extends to all
   men. And if there is no man who does not feel the goodness of God
   towards him, and who is not a partaker of it, how much more shall it be
   experienced by the godly, who hope in him? Will he not take peculiar
   care in them? Will he not more freely pour out his bounty on them? In a
   word, will he not, in every respect, keep them safe to the end?

   for the purpose of explaining more clearly and fully the preceding
   word."

   [74] "He who wishes to be faithfully employed in the service of God
   must not only avoid, as Paul says, the lies and superstitions that tend
   to poison souls; but he must avoid profane fables, that is, subtleties
   that cannot edify, and that contain no instruction which is good for
   the salvation of souls. Here is a passage that well deserves to be
   considered; for we see that it was a part of the corruptions which came
   into the world, and which, even at the present day, prevail in Popery.
   True, there will be doctrines in the highest degree absurd, and errors
   most foolish and debasing. We know that idolatry is as gross and
   flagrant among them as it ever was among the heathens, that the whole
   worship of God is corrupted, and, in short, that there is nothing which
   is not spurious. Such errors ought to be held in abhorrence by us; but
   there is an evil which is still more concealed, and which is unknown to
   the common people. For although the doctrine of the Papists were not
   false as it really is, though it were not perverse; yet it is
   "profane," as Paul calls it here. And why? They have questions which
   they debate, about things in which there is no profit. Were a man to
   know all the questions that are debated in the schools of theology of
   Popery, there would be nothing but wind. Yet they give themselves the
   greatest trouble about these matters, and can never succeed; for they
   put forward questions that cannot be answered but by divination; and
   though a man should wish to search out the secrets of God, about which
   nothing is said in the Holy Scripture, does he not plunge into an
   abyss? Now the Papists have had that pride and audacity, to wish to
   inquire into those matters which ought to be unknown to us. And thus it
   was that God withdrew his truth, when the world so corrupted it." --
   Fr. Ser.

   [75] "Si les benefices de Dieu trouvoyent entree a nous, et que nous
   fussion disposez a les recevoir." -- "If God's benefits found admission
   to us, and if we were disposed to receive them."

   [76] "The word Savior is not here taken in what we call its proper and
   strict meaning, in regard to the eternal salvation which God promises
   to his elect, but it is taken for one who delivers and protects. Thus
   we see that even unbelievers are protected by God, as it is said
   (Matthew 5:46) that "he maketh his sun to shine on the good and the
   bad;" and we see that all are fed by his goodness, that all are
   delivered from many dangers. In this sense he is called "the Savior of
   all men," not in regard to the spiritual salvation of their souls, but
   because he supports all his creatures. In this way, therefore, our Lord
   is the Savior of all men, that is, his goodness extends to the most
   wicked, who are estranged from him, and who do not deserve to have any
   intercourse with him, who ought to have been struck off from the number
   of the creatures of God and destroyed; and yet we see how God hitherto
   extends his grace to them; for the life which he gives to them is a
   testimony of his goodness. Since, therefore God shows such favor
   towards those who are strangers to him, how shall it be with us who are
   members of his household? Not that we are better or more excellent than
   those whom we see to be cast off by him, but the whole proceeds from
   his mercy and free grace, that he is reconciled to us through our Lord
   Jesus Christ, since he hath called us to the knowledge of the gospel,
   and then confirms us, and seals his bounty toward us, so that we ought
   to be convinced that he reckons us to be his children. Since,
   therefore, we see that he nourishes those who are estranged from him,
   let us go and hide ourselves under his wings; for, having taken us
   under his protection, he has declared that he will show himself to be a
   Father toward us." -- Fr. Ser.

   1 Timothy 4:11-16

   11. These things command and teach.

   11. Praecipe haec et doce.

   12. Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the
   believers, in word, in conversation, in sermon, in conversations, in
   charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.

   12. Nemo tuam juventutem despiciat; sed esto exemplar fidelium, in
   sermone, in conversatione, in caritate, in spiritu, in fide, in
   castitate.

   13. Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to
   doctrine.

   13. Donec venio, attende lectioni, exhortationi, doctrinae.

   14. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by
   prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.

   14. Ne donum, quod in te est, negligas, quod tibi datum est per
   prophetiam cum impositione manuum presbyterii.

   15. Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy
   profiting may appear to all.

   15. Haec cura, in his esto; ut profectus tuus in omnibus manifestus
   fiat.

   16. Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them:
   for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear
   thee.

   16. Attende tibi ipsi et doctrinae, permane in his; hoc enim si
   feceris, et te ipsum servabis, et eos qui te audiunt.

   11 Instruct and teach these things He means that the doctrine is of
   such a kind, that men ought not to be weary of it, though they heard it
   every day. There are, no doubt, other things to be taught; but there is
   emphasis in the demonstrative these; for it means that they are not
   things of small importance, of which it is enough to take a passing and
   brief notice; but, on the contrary, that they deserve to be repeated
   every day, because they cannot be too much inculcated. A prudent pastor
   ought, therefore, to consider what things are chiefly necessary, that
   he may dwell on them. Nor is there reason to dread that it shall become
   wearisome; for whosoever is of God will gladly hear frequently those
   things which need to be so often uttered.

   12 Let no man despise thy youth He says this, both in regard to others,
   and to Timothy himself. As to others, he does not wish that the age of
   Timothy should prevent him from obtaining that reverence which he
   deserves, provided that, in other respects, he conduct himself as
   becomes a minister of Christ. And, at the same time, he instructs
   Timothy to supply by gravity of demeanor what is wanting in his age. As
   if he had said, "Take care that, by gravity of demeanor, thou procure
   for thyself so great reverence, that thy youthful age, which, in other
   respects lays one open to contempt, may take nothing from thy
   authority." Hence we learn that Timothy was still young, though he held
   a place of distinguished excellence among many pastors; and that it is
   a grievous mistake to estimate by the number of years how much is due
   to a person.

   But be an example of the believers [78] He next informs him what are
   the true ornaments; not external marks, such as the crosier, the ring,
   the cloak, and such like trifles, or children's rattles; but soundness
   of doctrine and holiness of life. When he says, by speech and
   conversation, the meaning is the same as if he had said, "by words and
   actions," and therefore by the whole life.

   Those which follow are parts of a godly conversation -- charity, spirit
   faith, chastity. By the word spirit, I understand ardor of zeal for
   God, if it be not thought better to interpret it more generally, to
   which I have no objection. Chastity is not merely contrasted with
   uncleanness, but denotes purity of the whole life. Hence we learn, that
   they act a foolish and absurd part, who complain that no honor is paid
   to them, while they have nothing about them that is worthy of applause,
   but, on the contrary, expose themselves to contempt, both by their
   ignorance, and by a detestable example of life, or by levity or other
   abominations. The only way of procuring reverence is, by excellent
   virtues, to guard ourselves against contempt.

   13 Attend to reading He knew Timothy's diligence, and yet he recommends
   to him diligent reading of the Scriptures. How shall pastors teach
   others if they be not eager to learn? And if so great a man is advised
   to study to make progress from day to day, how much more do we need
   such an advice? Woe then to the slothfulness of those who do not peruse
   the oracles of the Holy Spirit by day and night, [79] in order to learn
   from them how to discharge their office!

   Till I come This reference to the time gives additional weight to the
   exhortation; for, while Paul hoped that he would come soon, yet he was
   unwilling, meanwhile, that Timothy should remain unemployed even for a
   short time; how much more ought we to look forward diligently to our
   whole life!

   To exhortation, to doctrine Lest it should be thought that careless
   reading was enough, he, at the same time, shews that it must be
   explained with a view to usefulness when he enjoins him to give earnest
   attention "to doctrine and exhortation;" as if he enjoined him to learn
   in order to communicate to others. It is proper, also, to attend to
   this order, that he places reading before doctrine and exhortation;
   for, undoubtedly, the Scripture is the fountain of all wisdom, from
   which pastors must draw all that they place before their flock.

   14 Neglect not the gift that is in thee The Apostle exhorts Timothy to
   employ, for the edification of the Church, that grace with which he was
   endued. God does not wish that talents -- which he has bestowed on any
   one, that they may bring gain -- should either be lost, or be hidden in
   the earth without advantage. (Matthew 25:18, 25.) To neglect a gift is
   carelessly to keep it unemployed through slothfulness, so that, having
   contracted rust it is worn away without yielding any profit. Let each
   of us, therefore, consider what gift he possesses, that he may
   diligently apply it to use.

   He says that grace was given to him by prophecy. How was this? It was
   because, as we have already said, the Holy Spirit marked out Timothy by
   revelation, that he might be admitted into the rank of pastors; for he
   had not only been chosen by the judgment of men, in the ordinary way,
   but had previously been named by the Spirit.

   With the laying on of the hands of the presbytery He says that it was
   conferred "with the laying on of hands;" by which he means, that, along
   with the ministry, he was also adorned with the necessary gifts. It was
   the custom and ordinary practice of the Apostles to ordain ministers
   "by the laying on of hands." As to this ceremony, and its origin and
   meaning, I have formerly given a brief explanation of them, and the
   rest may be learned from the Institutes (Book 4: chap. 3.)

   They who think that presbytery is here used as a collective noun, for
   "the college of presbyters or elders," [80] are, I think, correct in
   their opinion; although, after weighing the whole matter, I acknowledge
   that a different meaning is not inapplicable, that is, that presbytery
   or eldership -- is the name of an office. He put the ceremony for the
   very act of ordination; and therefore the meaning is, that Timothy --
   having been called to the ministry by the voice of the prophets, and
   having afterwards been solemnly ordained was, at the same time, endued
   with the grace of the Holy Spirit for the discharge of his office.
   Hence we infer that it was not a useless ceremony, because God by his
   Spirit, accomplished that consecration which men expressed symbolically
   "by the laying on of hands."

   15 Take heed to these things [81] The greater the difficulty in
   faithfully discharging the ministry of the Church, so much the more
   ought a pastor to apply himself earnestly, and with his whole might;
   and that not only for a short time, but with unfailing perseverance.
   [82] Paul therefore reminds Timothy that this work leaves no room for
   indolence, or for slackening his labors, but demands the utmost
   industry and constant application.

   That thy profiting may be manifest By adding these words, he means,
   that he ought to labor to this purpose, that by his agency the
   edification of the Church may be more and more advanced, and that
   corresponding results may be visible; for it is not the work of a
   single day, and therefore he should strive to make daily progress. Some
   refer this to Timothy, that he may profit more and more; but I choose
   rather to interpret it as referring to the effect of his ministry.

   The Greek words, en pasin, may either be translated, to all men, or, in
   all things. There will thus be a twofold meaning; either, "that all may
   see the progress which springs from his labors", or, "that in all
   respects, or in every possible way, (which is the same thing,) they may
   be visible." I prefer the latter view.

   16 Give heed to thyself, and to the doctrine There are two things of
   which a good pastor should be careful; to be diligent in teaching, and
   to keep himself pure. [83] It is not enough if he frame his life to all
   that is good and commendable, and guard against giving a bad example,
   if he do not likewise add to a holy life continual diligence in
   teaching; and, on the other hand, doctrine will be of little avail, if
   there be not a corresponding goodness and holiness of life. With good
   reason, therefore, does Paul urge Timothy to "give heed," both to
   himself personally, and to doctrine, for the general advantage of the
   Church. On the other hand, he commends his constancy, that he may never
   grow weary; for there are many things that frequently happen, which may
   lead us aside from the right course, if we do not set our foot firmly
   to resist.

   If thou shalt do these things, thou shalt both save thyself and them
   that hear thee It is no ordinary spur to excite the thoughtfulness of
   pastors, when they learn that their own salvation, as well as that of
   the people, depends on the industry and perseverance with which they
   devote themselves to their office. And as doctrine, which solidly
   edifies, is commonly attended by little display, Paul says that he
   ought to consider what is profitable. As if he had said, "Let men who
   are desirous of glory be fed by their ambition, let them applaud
   themselves for their ingenuity; to you, let it be enough to devote
   yourself to your own salvation and that of the people."

   Now, this exhortation applies to the whole body of the Church, that
   they, may not take offense at the simplicity which both quickens souls
   and preserves them in health. Nor ought they to think it strange that
   Paul ascribes to Timothy the work of saving the Church; for, certainly,
   all that is gained to God is saved, and it is by the preaching of the
   gospel that we are gathered to Christ. And as the unfaithfulness or
   carelessness of the pastor is ruinous to the Church, so the cause of
   salvation is justly ascribed to his faithfulness and diligence. True,
   it is God alone that saves; and not even the smallest portion of his
   glory can lawfully be bestowed on men. But God parts with no portion of
   his glory when he employs the agency of men for bestowing salvation.

   Our salvation is, therefore, the gift of God alone, because from him
   alone it proceeds, and by his power alone it is performed; and
   therefore, to him alone, as the author, it must be ascribed. But the
   ministry of men is not on that account excluded, nor does all this
   interfere with the salutary tendency of that government on which, as
   Paul shews, the prosperity of the Church depends. (Ephesians 4:11.)
   Moreover, this is altogether the work of God, because it is he who
   forms good pastors, and guides them by his Spirit, and blesses their
   labor, that it may not be ineffectual.

   If thus a good pastor is the salvation of his hearers, let bad and
   careless men know that their destruction must be ascribed to those who
   have the charge of them; for, as the salvation of the flock is the
   crown of the pastor, so from careless pastors all that perishes will be
   required. Again, a pastor is said to save himself, when, by faithfully
   discharging the office committed to him, he serves his calling; not
   only because he avoids that terrible vengeance which the Lord threatens
   by Ezekiel, -- "His blood will I require at thy hand," (Ezekiel 33:8,)
   but because it is customary to speak of believers as performing their
   salvation when they walk and persevere [84] in the course of their
   salvation. Of this mode of expression we have spoken in our exposition
   of the Epistle to the Philippians, (Philippians 2:12.)

   CHAPTER 5
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Timothy 5:1-4

   1. Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger
   men as brethren;

   1. Seniorem ne aspere objurges sed hortare ut patrem, juniores ut
   fratres;

   2. The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.

   2. Mulieres natu grandiores, ut matres; juniores, ut sorores, cum omni
   castitate.

   3. Honour widows that are widows indeed.

   3. Viduas honora, quae vere sunt viduae.

   4. But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to
   shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and
   acceptable before God.

   4. Porro si qua vidua liberos aut nepotes habet, discunt primum erga
   propriam domum pietatem colere, et mutuum rependere progenitoribus; hoc
   enim bonum et acceptum est coram Deo.

   1 Do not harshly rebuke an elder He now recommends to Timothy
   gentleness and moderation in correcting faults. Correction is a
   medicine, which has always some bitterness, and consequently is
   disagreeable. Besides, Timothy being a young man, his severity would
   have been less tolerable, if it had not been somewhat moderated.

   But exhort him as a father The Apostle enjoins him to reprove elder
   persons as parents; and he even employs the milder term, exhort It is
   impossible not to be moved with reverence, when we place before our
   eyes our father or our mother; in consequence of which, instead of
   harsher vehemence, we are immediately influenced by modesty. Yet it
   ought to be observed, that he does not wish old men to be spared or
   indulged in such a manner as to sin with impunity and without
   correction; he only wishes that some respect should be paid to their
   age, that they may more patiently bear to be admonished.

   The younger as brethren Even towards younger persons he wishes
   moderation to be used, though not in an equal degree; for the vinegar
   must always be mingled with oil, but with this difference, that
   reverence should always be shewn to older persons, and equals should be
   treated with brotherly gentleness. Hence pastors are taught, that they
   must not only take into account their office, but must also see
   particularly what is due to the age of individuals; for the same things
   are not applicable to all. Let it therefore be remembered, that, if
   dramatic performers attend to decorum on the stage, it ought not to be
   neglected by pastors, who occupy so lofty a station.

   2 The younger as sisters, with all chastity The phrase, with all
   chastity, relates to younger women; for at that age they ought always
   to dread every kind of suspicion. Yet Paul does not forbid Timothy to
   have any criminal or immodest conduct towards young women, (for there
   was no need of such a prohibition,) but only enjoins him to beware of
   giving to wicked men any handle for laughter. For this purpose, he
   demands a chaste gravity, which shall shine throughout all their
   intercourse and conversation; so that he may more freely converse with
   young persons, without any unfavorable reports.

   3 Honor widows that are really widows. By the word honor he does not
   mean any expression of respect, but that special care of them which
   bishops [85] took in the ancient Church; for widows were taken under
   the protection of the Church, that they might be supported out of the
   common funds. The meaning of this mode of expression is as if he had
   said, "For selecting widows that are to be taken under your care and
   that of the deacons, you ought to consider who they are that are really
   widows [86] What was their condition we shall afterwards explain more
   fully. But we must here attend to the reason why Paul does not admit
   any but those who are absolutely widows, and, at the same time, widows
   without children; for, in that condition, they dedicated themselves to
   the Church, that they might withdraw from all the private concerns of a
   family, and might lay aside every hindrance. Justly, therefore, does
   Paul forbid to receive the mothers of families, who are already bound
   by a charge of a different kind. When he calls them "really widows", he
   alludes to the Greek word chera, which is derived apo tou cherousthai,
   from a verb which signifies to be "deprived" or "destitute."

   4 If any widow There are various ways of explaining this passage; and
   the ambiguity arises from this circumstance, that the latter clause may
   refer either to widows or to their children. Nor is this consistent
   with the verb (let them learn) being plural, while Paul spoke of a
   widow in the singular number; for a change of number is very customary
   in a general discourse, that is, when the writer speaks of a whole
   class, and not of an individual. They who think that it relates to
   widows, are of the opinion that the meaning is, "let them learn, by the
   pious government of their family, to repay to their successors the
   education that they received from their ancestors." This is the
   explanation given by Chrysostom and some others. But others think that
   it is more natural to interpret it as relating to children and
   grandchildren. Accordingly, in their opinion, the Apostle teaches that
   the mother or grandmother is the person towards whom they should
   exercise their piety; for nothing is more natural than (antipelargia)
   the return of filial for parental affection; and it is very
   unreasonable that it should be excluded from the Church. Before the
   Church is burdened with them, let them do their duty.

   Hereto I have related the opinion of others. But I wish my readers to
   consider if it would not agree better with the context in this manner:
   "Let them learn to conduct themselves in a godly manner at home." As if
   he had said, that it would be valuable as a preparatory instruction,
   that they should train themselves to the worship of God, by performing
   godly offices at home towards their relatives; for nature commands us
   to love our parents next to God; that this secondary piety leads to the
   highest piety. And as Paul saw that the very rights of nature were
   violated under the pretense of religion, [87] in order to correct this
   fault, he commanded that widows should be trained by domestic
   apprenticeship to the worship of God.

   To shew piety towards their own house Almost all the commentators take
   the verb eusebein in an active sense, because it is followed by an
   accusative; but that is not a conclusive argument, for it is customary
   with the Greek authors to have a preposition understood. And this
   exposition agrees well with the context, that, by cultivating human
   piety, they should train themselves in the worship of God; lest a
   foolish and silly devotion should divest them of human feelings. Again,
   let widows learn to repay what they owe to their ancestors by educating
   their own offspring.

   For this is good and acceptable before God Not to shew gratitude to our
   ancestors is universally acknowledged to be monstrous; for that is a
   lesson taught us by natural reason. And not only is this conviction
   natural to all, that affection towards our parents is the second degree
   of piety; but the very storks teach us gratitude by their example; and
   that is the etymology of the word anipelargia [88] But Paul, not
   satisfied with this, declares that God hath sanctioned it; as if he had
   said, "There is no reason why any one should think that it has its
   origin in the opinion of men; but God hath so ordained."

   [85] "Les Pasteurs et Evesques." -- "Pastors and bishops."

   [86] "From what the Fathers and Greek commentators tell us, it appears
   that those persons were maintained from the funds of the Church; and
   from what follows, it is clear that they filled an office; the name
   cherai being as much one of office as diachones, though the exact
   nature of its duties has not been determined. That the persons who held
   it instructed the younger females in the principles of the Christian
   faith, is pretty certain; but whether they were, as some say, the same
   as the deaconesses,' is yet a disputed point. It would seem that they
   were not necessarily the same; but that, having once been such, during
   the life of their husbands, they were not removed from that office.
   Otherwise, it would seem their duties were different from those of the
   deaconesses; and if we were to call them by such a name as would
   designate their chief duties, we might call them Female Catechists.'
   That these differed from the deaconesses is certain from the positive
   testimony of Epiphanius. Yet they might occasionally assist them in
   their duty of visiting the sick. Be that as it may, the existence of
   such an order as the cherai requires no very strong testimony from
   ecclesiastical history; since, from the extremely retired life of the
   women in Greece and other parts of the East, and their almost total
   separation from the other sex, they would much need the assistance of
   such a person, who might either convert them to the Christian faith, or
   farther instruct them in its doctrines and duties." -- Bloomfield

   [87] "C'est a dire, qu'on oublivit l'amour que nature enseigne." --
   "That is, that they forgot the love which nature teaches."

   [88] "This word is compounded of anti, (instead of,' or, in return
   for,') and pelargos, a stork.' The stork is a bird of passage, and is
   mentioned, along with the crane and the swallow, as knowing the
   appointed time, (Jeremiah 8:7.) Its name, in the Hebrew, means Mercy,
   or Piety; and its English name, taken (indirectly at least) from the
   Greek storge, signifying natural affection. This accords with our
   knowledge of its character, which is remarkable for tenderness,
   especially in the young towards the old birds. It is not uncommon to
   see several of the old birds, which are tired and feeble with the long
   flight, supported at times on the backs of the young; and the peasants
   (of Jutland) speak of it as well know that such are carefully laid in
   their old nests, and cherished by the young ones whom they reared the
   spring before. The stork has long been a peculiar emblem of filial
   duty." -- Eadie's Cyclopoedia. "The stork's an emblem of true piety,
   Because when age has seized and made its dame
   Unfit for flight, the grateful young one takes
   His mother on his back, provides her food,
   Repaying thus her tender care of him
   Ere he was fit to fly." -- Beaumont.

   1 Timothy 5:5-8

   5. Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and
   continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.

   5. Porro quae vere vidua est ac desolata, sperat in Deo, et perseverat
   in orationibus et obsecrationibus noctu et die.

   6. But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.

   6. Quae autem in deliciis versatur, vivens mortua est.

   7. And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.

   7. Et haec praecipe, ut irreprehensibiles sint.

   8. But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his
   own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.

   8. Quod si quis suis et maxime familiaribus non providet, fidem
   abnegavit, et est infideli deterior.

   5 She who is really a widow He expresses his meaning more clearly than
   before; for he shews that they are really widows who are solitary and
   have no children. He says that such persons hope in God Not that this
   is done by all, or by them alone; for we may see many widows that are
   childless, and that have no relatives whatever, who nevertheless are
   haughty and insolent, and altogether ungodly both in heart and in life.
   On the other hand, then, are those who have many children, and who are
   not prevented from having their hope placed in God; such as Job and
   Jacob and David. But for this, (poluteknia) a multitude of children
   would be a curse, whereas Scripture always reckons it among the
   remarkable blessings of God. But Paul says here that widows "hope in
   God," in the same manner as he elsewhere writes, that the unmarried
   study only to please God, because their affections are not divided like
   those of married persons. (1 Corinthians 7:32.) The meaning therefore
   is, that they have nothing to disturb their thoughts, from looking to
   God alone; because they find nothing in the world on which they can
   rely. By this argument he commends them; for, when human aid and every
   refuge fails them, it is the duty of the Church to stretch forth her
   hand to render assistance; and thus the condition of the widow, who is
   childless and desolate, implores the aid of the pastor.

   Continueth in prayers. This is the second ground of commendation, that
   they continually devote themselves to prayer. Hence it follows, that
   they ought to be relieved and supported at the expense of the Church.
   At the same time, by these two marks he distinguishes between the
   worthy and the unworthy; for these words are of the same import as if
   he enjoined that they only shall be received who look for no aid from
   men, but rely on God alone, and, laying aside other cares and
   employments, are earnestly devoted to prayer; and that others are ill
   qualified and of no advantage to the Church. Again, this constancy in
   prayer demands freedom from other cares; for they who are occupied with
   the government of a family have less freedom and leisure. We are all,
   indeed, commanded to pray continually; but it ought to be considered
   what is demanded by every person's condition, when, in order to pray,
   retirement and exemption from all other cares are demanded.

   What Paul praises in widows, Luke (Luke 2:36) asserts as to Anna, the
   daughter of Phanuel; but the same thing would not apply to all, on
   account of the diversity in their manner of life. There will be foolish
   women -- apes, and not imitators, of Anna -- who will run from altar to
   altar, and will do nothing but sigh and mutter till noon. On this
   presence, they will rid themselves of all domestic affairs; and, having
   returned home, if they do not find everything arranged to their wish,
   they will disturb the whole family by outrageous cries, and will
   sometimes proceed to blows. Let us therefore remember that there are
   good reasons why it is the peculiar privilege of those who are widows
   and childless, to have leisure for praying by night and by day; because
   they are free from lawful hindrances, which would not permit those who
   govern a family to do the same.

   And yet this passage lends no countenance to monks or nuns, who sell
   their mutterings or their loud noises for the sake of leading an easy
   and idle life. Such were anciently the Euchites or Psallians; for monks
   and Popish priests differ in no respect, except that the former, by
   continually praying, thought that none but themselves were pious and
   holy, while the latter, with inferior industry, imagined that they
   sanctify both themselves and others. Paul had no thought of anything of
   this sort, but only intended to shew how much more freely they may have
   leisure for prayer who have nothing else to disturb them.

   6. She who is in luxury. After having described the marks by which real
   widows may be known, he now contrasts them with others that ought not
   to be received. The Greek participle which he employs, spatalosa, means
   one who allows herself every indulgence, and leads an easy and
   luxurious life. Accordingly, Paul (in my opinion) censures those who
   abuse their widowhood for this purpose, that, being loosed from the
   marriage yoke, and freed from every annoyance, they may lead a life of
   pleasant idleness; for we see many who seek their own freedom and
   convenience, and give themselves up to excessive mirth.

   Is dead while she liveth When Paul says that such persons "are dead
   while they live," this is supposed by some to mean that they are
   unbelievers; an opinion with which I do not at all agree. I think it
   more natural to say that a woman "is dead," when she is useless, and
   does no good; for to what purpose do we live, if it be not that our
   actions may yield some advantage? And what if we should say that the
   emphasis lies in the word liveth? For they who covet an indolent life,
   that they may live more at their ease, have constantly in their mouth
   the proverbial saying: --

   "For life is not to live, but to be well." [89]

   The meaning would therefore be: "If they reckon themselves happy, when
   they have everything to their heart's wish, and if they think that
   nothing but repose and luxury can be called life, for my part, I
   declare that they are dead." But as this meaning might seem liable to
   the charge of excessive ingenuity, I wished merely to give a passing
   glimpse of it, without making any positive assertion. This at least is
   certain, that Paul here condemns indolence, when he calls those women
   dead who are of no use.

   7 And command these things He means, that not only does he prescribe to
   Timothy the course which he ought to follow, but the women also must be
   carefully taught not to be stained with such vices. It is the duty of
   the pastor not only to oppose the wicked practices or ambition of those
   who act an unreasonable part, but to guard against every danger, as far
   as lies in his power, by instruction and constant warnings.

   That they may be blameless. It was the natural result of prudence and
   steadfastness not to admit widows, unless they were worthy; but yet it
   was proper to assign a reason why they were not admitted; and it was
   even necessary to forewarn the Church that unworthy persons should not
   be brought forward, or should not offer themselves. Again, Paul
   commends this part of instruction on the ground of utility; as if he
   had said, that it must by no means be despised, because it is common,
   since it aims at the chief part of a good and perfect life. Now there
   is nothing that ought to be more diligently learned in God's school
   than the study of a holy and upright life. In a word, moral instruction
   is compared with ingenious speculations, which are of no visible
   advantage, agreeably to that saying,

   "All Scripture is profitable, that the man of God may become perfect,"
   etc. (2 Timothy 3:16.)

   8 And if any person do not provide for his own Erasmus has translated
   it, "If any woman do not provide for her own," making it apply
   exclusively to females. But I prefer to view it as a general statement;
   for it is customary with Paul, even when he is treating of some
   particular subject, to deduce arguments from general principles, and,
   on the other hand, to draw from particular statements a universal
   doctrine. And certainly it will have greater weight, if it apply both
   to men and to women.

   He hath denied the faith [90] He says that they who do not care about
   any of their relatives, and especially about their own house, have
   "denied the faith." And justly; for there is no piety towards God, when
   a person can thus lay aside the feelings of humanity. Would faith,
   which makes us the sons of God, render us worse than brute beasts? Such
   inhumanity, therefore, is open contempt of God, and denying of the
   faith.

   Not content with this, Paul heightens the criminality of their conduct,
   by saying, that he who forgets his own is worse than an infidel This is
   true for two reasons. First, the further advanced any one is in the
   knowledge of God, the less is he excused; and therefore, they who shut
   their eyes against the clear light of God are worse than infidels.
   Secondly, this is a kind of duty which nature itself teaches; for they
   are (storgai phusikai) natural affections. And if, by the mere guidance
   of nature, infidels are so prone to love their own, what must we think
   of those who are not moved by any such feeling? Do they not go even
   beyond the ungodly in brutality? If it be objected, that, among
   unbelievers, there are also many parents that are cruel and savage; the
   explanation is easy, that Paul is not speaking of any parents but those
   who, by the guidance and instruction of nature, take care of their own
   offspring; for, if any one have degenerated from that which is so
   perfectly natural, he ought to be regarded as a monster.

   It is asked, Why does the Apostle prefer the members of the household
   to the children? I answer, when he speaks of his own and especially
   those of his household, by both expressions he denotes the children and
   grandchildren. For, although children may have been transferred, or may
   have passed into a different family by marriage, or in any way may have
   left the house of the parents; yet the right of nature is not
   altogether extinguished, so as to destroy the obligation of the older
   to govern the younger as committed to them by God, or at least to take
   care of them as far as they can. Towards domestics, the obligation is
   more strict; for they ought to take care of them for two reasons, both
   because they are their own blood, and because they are a part of the
   family which they govern.

   9. Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old,
   having been the wife of one man,

   9. Vidua deligatur non minor annis sexaginta, quae fuerit inius viri
   uxor.

   10. Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children,

   11. But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax
   wanton against Christ, they will marry;

   11. Porro juniores viduas rejice; quum enim lascivire coeperint
   adversus Christum, nubere volunt;

   12. Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.

   12. Habentes condemnationem, quod primam fidem rejecerint.

   13. And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to
   house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking
   things which they ought not.

   13. Simul autem et otiosae discunt circuire domos; nec solum otiosae,
   verum etiam garrulae et curiosae, loquentes quae non oportet.

   9 Let a widow be chosen. He again points out what kind of widows should
   be taken under the care of the Church; [91] and more clearly than he
   had formerly done.

   Not under sixty years of age First, he describes the age, sixty years;
   for, being supported at the public expense, it was proper that they
   should have already reached old age. Besides, there was another and
   stronger reason; for they consecrated themselves to the ministry of the
   Church, which would have been altogether intolerable, if there were
   still a likelihood of their being married. They were received on the
   condition that the Church should relieve their poverty, and that, on
   their part, they should be employed in ministering to the poor, as far
   as the state of their health allowed. Thus there was a mutual
   obligation between them and the Church. It was unreasonable that those
   who were under that age, and who were still in the vigor of life,
   should be a burden to others. Besides, there was reason to fear that
   they would change their mind and think of being married again. These
   are two reasons why he does not wish any to be admitted "under sixty
   years of age."

   Who hath been the wife of one man As to the desire of marrying, that
   danger had been sufficiently guarded against, when a woman was more
   than sixty years old; especially if, during her whole life, she had not
   been married to more than one husband. It may be regarded as a sort of
   pledge of continence and chastity, when a woman has arrived at that
   age, satisfied with having had but one husband. Not that he disapproves
   of a second marriage, or affixes a mark of ignominy to those who have
   been twice married; (for, on the contrary, he advises younger widows to
   marry;) but because he wished carefully to guard against laying any
   females under a necessity of remaining unmarried, who felt it to be
   necessary to have husbands. On this subject we shall afterwards speak
   more fully.

   10 For good works Those qualifications which are next enumerated relate
   partly to honor, and partly to labor. There can be no doubt that the
   assemblies of widows were honorable, and highly respectable; and,
   therefore, Paul does not wish that any should be admitted into them,
   but those who had excellent attestations of the whole of their past
   life. Besides, they were not appointed in order to lazy and indolent
   inactivity, but to minister to the poor and the sick, until, being
   completely worn out, they should be allowed honorably to retire.
   Accordingly, that they may be better prepared for the discharge of
   their office, he wishes them to have had long practice and experience
   in all the duties which belong to it; such as -- labor and diligence in
   bringing up children, hospitality, ministering to the poor, and other
   charitable works.

   If it be now asked, Shall all that are barren be rejected, because they
   have never borne any children? We must reply, that Paul does not here
   condemn barrenness, but the daintiness of mothers, who, by refusing to
   endure the weariness of bringing up their children, sufficiently shew
   that they will be very unkind to strangers. And at the same time he
   holds out this as an honorable reward to godly matrons, who have not
   spared themselves, that they, in their turn, shall be received into the
   bosom of the Church in their old age.

   By a figure of speech, in which a part is taken for the whole, he means
   by the washing of the feet all the services which are commonly rendered
   to the saints; for at that time it was customary to "wash the feet."
   [92] An employment of this nature might have the appearance of being
   mean and almost servile; and therefore he makes use of this mark for
   describing females who were industrious, and far from being fastidious
   or dainty. What next follows relates to liberality; and, lastly, he
   expresses the same thing in general terms, when he says, if she hath
   been diligent in every good work; for here he speaks of acts of
   kindness.

   11 Refuse younger widows He does not enjoin that they be excommunicated
   from the Church, or have any mark of disgrace put upon them; but he
   only asserts that they must not be rewarded by obtaining that honor
   which he has already mentioned. And if the Spirit of God, by the mouth
   of Paul, declares that no woman under sixty years of age deserves to be
   admitted into that order, because at that age the unmarried state was
   dangerous; what effrontery was it, afterwards, to lay down a law of
   celibacy for young women in all the warmth of youthful years? Paul, I
   say, does not allow of abstaining from marriage till they are in
   extreme old age, and altogether beyond the danger of incontinence. They
   afterwards came to forty years as the age for putting the veil on
   virgins, and next to thirty; and at length they began to put the veil
   -- indiscriminately, and without exception -- on females of any age.
   They allege, that continence is much easier for virgins, who have never
   had a husband, than it is for widows. But they will never succeed in
   proving, that there is no reason to dread that danger against which
   Paul guards and commands others to guard. Accordingly, it is rash, and
   even cruel, to lay a snare for those who still are young girls, and who
   would have been fitter for the married state.

   For when they have begun to be wanton against Christ He says that they
   are "wanton against Christ," who, forgetting the condition to which
   they were called, indulge in unbecoming mirth; for they ought to have
   kept themselves under the yoke of modesty, as becomes grave and
   respectable females. Accordingly, a more luxurious and abandoned course
   of life is a sort of wantonness against Christ, to whom they had
   pledged their fidelity. As Paul had seen many instances of this kind,
   he meets it by a general remedy, that none should be admitted who were
   of an age that could ever induce them to desire to be married.

   How many monsters of crimes are produced every day in Popery by that
   compulsory celibacy of nuns! What barriers does it not deliberately
   break through! And therefore, although this course had at first
   appeared to be commendable, yet, taught by experiments so many and so
   terrible, they ought to have somewhat complied with in the counsel of
   Paul. But they are so far from doing this, that they provoke the wrath
   of God more and more, from day to day, by their obstinacy. Nor do I
   speak of nuns only, but priests and monks are also compelled by them to
   observe perpetual celibacy. Yet disgraceful lusts rage amongst them, so
   that hardly one in ten lives chastely; and in monasteries, the least of
   the evils is ordinary fornication. If they would incline their heart to
   hear God speaking by the mouth of Paul, they would instantly have
   recourse to this remedy which he prescribes; but so great is their
   pride, that they furiously persecute all who remind them of it.

   Some read the words thus: -- "When they become wanton, they will marry
   in opposition to Christ." Although this makes little difference as to
   Paul's meaning, the former view is preferable.

   12 Having condemnation, because they have renounced their first faith.
   "To have condemnation," is interpreted by some as signifying "to
   deserve reproof." But I take it to be a statement of greater severity,
   that Paul terrifies them by the damnation of eternal death; as if he
   reproved them by saying that that excellent order, which ought rather
   to have united them to Christ, was the very ground of their
   condemnation. And the reason is added, that they entirely "revolt from
   the faith" of baptism and from Christianity. I am aware that there are
   some who interpret it differently; that is, that they break the pledge
   which they gave to the Church by marrying, having formerly promised
   that they would live unmarried till death. This is exceedingly absurd.
   Besides, why should he call it their first faith?

   Accordingly, Paul rises to greater vehemence against them, and
   magnifies the enormity of the offense, by saying that not only would
   they bring disgrace on Christ and his Church by departing from the
   condition to which they had agreed, but they likewise broke their
   "first faith" by wicked revolt. Thus it usually happens, that he who
   has once transgressed the bounds of modesty gives himself up to all
   impudence. It grieved him that the levity of those women was a reproach
   to the godly, and that their lustfulness was reproved, or, at least,
   was liable to reproof. This led them to proceed to greater and greater
   degrees of licentiousness, till they renounced Christianity. That
   amplification is exceedingly appropriate; for is there anything more
   absurd than that they should, through a wish to promote the advantage
   of persons, open the door to the denial of Christ?

   The attempt of the Papists to support, by means of this passage, a vow
   of perpetual celibacy, is absurd. Granting that it was customary to
   exact from the widows an engagement in express terms, still they would
   gain nothing by this admission. First, we must consider the end. The
   reason why widows formerly promised to remain unmarried, was not that
   they might lead a holier life than in a state of marriage, but because
   they could not, at the same time, be devoted to husbands and to the
   Church; but in Popery, they make a vow of continence, as if it were a
   virtue acceptable to God on its own account. Secondly, in that age they
   renounced the liberty of marrying at the time when they ceased to be
   marriageable; for they must have been, at least, sixty years old, and,
   by being satisfied with being once married, must have already given a
   proof of their chastity. But now, vows are made among the Papists to
   renounce marriage, either before the time, or in the midst of time
   ardor of youthful years.

   Now we disapprove of the tyrannical law about celibacy, chiefly for two
   reasons. First, they pretend that it is meritorious worship before God;
   and secondly, by rashness in vowing, they plunge souls into
   destruction. Neither of these was to be found in the ancient
   institution. They did not make a direct vow of continence, as if the
   married life were less acceptable to God, but only, so far as it was
   rendered necessary by the office to which they were elected, they
   promised to keep from the tie of marriage for their whole life; nor did
   they deprive themselves of the liberty of marrying, till the time when,
   though they had been ever so free, it was foolish and unreasonable for
   them to marry. In short, those widows differed as much from the nuns,
   as Anna the prophetess from Claude the Vestal. [93]

   13 And not only so, but they grow idle Nothing is more becoming in
   women than keeping the house; and hence, among the ancients, a tortoise
   [94] was the image of a good and respectable mother of a family. But
   there are many who are diseased with the opposite vice. Nothing
   delights them more than the liberty of running from one place to
   another, and especially when, being freed from the burden of a family,
   they have nothing to do at home.

   Tattlers and busybodies Besides, those widows, under the pretense of
   the respect due to the public character which they sustained, had more
   easy access to many persons. This opportunity, obtained through the
   kindness of the Church, they abused for purposes of "idleness;" and
   next, as usually happens, from slothfulness sprung curiosity, which is
   also the mother of talkativeness. Most true is the saying of Horace:
   "Shun an inquisitive person, for he is always a tattler." [95] "No
   trust should be placed," as Plutarch says, "in inquisitive persons,
   for, as soon as they have heard anything, they are never at rest till
   they have blabbed it out." This is especially the case with women, who,
   by nature, are prone to talkativeness, and cannot keep a secret. With
   good reason, therefore, has Paul joined together these three things,
   sloth, inquisitiveness, and tattling.

   15. For some are already turned aside after Satan.

   15. Nonnullae enim jam deflexerunt post Satanam.

   16. If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve
   them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that
   are widows indeed.

   16. Quodsi quis fidelis, aut si qua fidelis habet viduas, suppeditet
   illis, et non oneretur Ecclesia, ut iis, quae vere viduae sunt,
   suppetat.

   14 I wish the younger (widows) to marry. Censorious men laugh at this
   injunction of the Apostle. "As if," say they, "it had been necessary to
   stimulate their excessively strong desire; for who does not know that
   almost all widows have naturally a wish to be married?" Superstitious
   men, on the other hand, would reckon that this doctrine concerning
   marriage is highly unsuitable to an Apostle of Christ. But, after a
   careful examination of the whole matter, men of sound judgment will
   acknowledge that Paul teaches nothing here but what is necessary and
   highly useful. For, on the one hand, there are many to whom widowhood
   gives the opportunity of greater licentiousness; and, on the other
   hand, there are always arising spirits speaking lies in hypocrisy, who
   make holiness to consist in celibacy, as if it were angelical
   perfection, and either totally condemn marriage, or despise it as if it
   savored of the pollution of the flesh. There are few either of men or
   women that consider their calling. How rarely do you find a man who
   willingly bears the burden of governing a wife! The reason is, that it
   is attended by innumerable vexations. How reluctantly does a woman
   submit to the yoke!

   Consequently, when Paul bids the younger widows marry, he does not
   invite them to nuptial delights; and, when he bids them bear children,
   he does not exhort them to indulge lust; but, taking into account the
   weakness of the sex, and the slipperiness of the age, he exhorts them
   to chaste marriage, and, at the same time, to the endurance of those
   burdens which belong to holy marriage. And he does this, especially, in
   order that he may not be thought to have acted contemptuously in
   excluding them from the rank of widows; for he means, that their life
   will be not less acceptable to God than if they remained in widowhood.
   And, indeed, God pays no regard to the superstitious opinions of men,
   but values this obedience more highly than all things else, when we
   comply with our calling, instead of permitting ourselves to be carried
   along by the wish of our own heart.

   Having heard that consolation, they have no reason to complain that
   injury is done to them, or to take it in that they are excluded from
   one kind of honor; for they learn that, in the married state, they are
   not less acceptable to God, because they obey his calling. When he
   speaks of bearing children, he includes, under a single word, all the
   annoyances that must be endured in bringing up children; in the same
   manner as, under the government of the house, he includes all that
   belongs to household management.

   To give no occasion to the adversary For, as the husband may be said to
   be the covering of the wife, so widowhood is liable to many unfavorable
   suspicions. And what purpose does it serve, to arm the enemies of the
   gospel with calumnies, without any necessity? But it is very difficult
   for a widow, in the flower of her age, to act with such caution that
   wicked men shall not find some pretext for slandering her; and,
   therefore, if they sincerely desire edification, let them, in order to
   shut the mouth of evil speakers, choose a way of life that is less
   liable to suspicion. Here, I suppose, the common adversaries of the
   gospel to be meant, rather than the private adversaries of any woman;
   for Paul speaks indefinitely. [96]

   15 For some have already turned aside It is certain, that there is no
   ordinance so holy that some evil may not arise out of it through the
   wickedness of men. Yet those things which are necessary ought to remain
   unmoved, whatever may happen to them, although the sky should fall. But
   when we are at liberty to choose either way, and when this or that has
   been found by experience to be advantageous, it is a matter of prudence
   to lay aside what was formerly approved, as in the present case. It was
   not at all necessary that women, who were still young, should be
   admitted into the rank of widows; experience shewed that it was
   dangerous and hurtful; and, therefore, Paul justly advises to take care
   for the future that nothing of this kind may happen.

   If the revolt of some women was regarded by him as a sufficiently
   strong argument for seeking a universal remedy, how many arguments
   would the Papists have for abolishing their filthy celibacy, if they
   had any regard to edification! But they choose rather to strangle
   millions of souls by the cruel cords of a wicked and diabolical law
   than to loose a single knot; and this makes it evident how widely their
   cruelty differs from the holy zeal of Paul.

   After Satan The expression is worthy of notice; because no one can turn
   aside from Christ, in the smallest degree, without following Satan; for
   he has dominion over all who do not belong to Christ. We learn from
   this how destructive is turning aside from the right course, since,
   from being children of God, it makes us slaves of Satan, and, by
   withdrawing us from the government of Christ, places Satan over us as
   our guide. [97]

   16 If any believer. It being customary for every one willingly to throw
   his own burdens on the whole Church, on this account he expressly
   enjoins that it be guarded against. He speaks of believers who ought to
   support their widows; for, as to those widows who renounced a wicked
   relationship, it was proper that they should be received by the Church.
   And if they act a sinful part, who, by sparing themselves, allow the
   Church to be burdened with expense, let us learn from this in what
   aggravated sacrilege they are involved, who, by fraud or robbery,
   profane what was once dedicated to the Church.

   [96] "Let us ponder well this doctrine of Paul; for, although he treats
   here of widows in particular yet we are all admonished, that, in order
   to perform our duty towards God, it is not enough that our conscience
   be pure and clean, and that we walk without any bad disposition; but we
   ought likewise to add such prudence that enemies shall have their mouth
   shut when they wish to slander us, that their impudence may be known,
   and that we may always be ready to give an account of what we have
   done, and that they may have no presence for blaspheming against the
   name of God and his word, because there will be no appearance of evil
   in us. True, we cannot avoid being slandered; but let us always attend
   to this, that no occasion may be given on our part, or by our
   imprudence." -- Fr. Ser.

   [97] "Since the gospel is preached to us, it is Jesus Christ who holds
   out his scepter, and shews us that he wishes to be our king, and to
   take us for his people. When we have thus made profession of the
   gospel, if we do not persevere till the end, if it happen that we
   debauch ourselves in any way, not only do we refuse to be in obedience
   to the Son of God, but we give to Satan all mastery over us, and he
   will seize it, and we must be in his service in spite of our teeth. If
   this is dreadful and absolutely shocking, ought we not to be better
   advised than we have been to conceal ourselves under the wings of our
   God, and to suffer ourselves to be governed by him, till he renew us by
   his Holy Spirit in such a manner that we shall not be so giddy and
   foolish as we have been? For that purpose, let us consider that we must
   have our Lord Jesus Christ for our guide; for if we wish to be truly
   the people of God, the saying of the Prophet must be fulfilled in us,
   that the people shall walk, and David their king shall go before them.
   Let us always have his doctrine before our eyes, and let us follow him
   step by step, hearing his voice as that of our good Shepherd, (John
   10:4)." -- Fr. Ser.

   1 Timothy 5:17-21

   17. Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour,
   especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.

   17. Presbyteri, qui bene praesunt, duplici honore digni habeantur;
   maxime qui laborant in verbo et doctrina.

   18. For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth
   out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.

   18. Dicit enim scriptura: Non obligabis os bovi trituranti,
   (Deuteronomy 25:4) et, Dignus est operarius mercede sua, (Matthew
   10:10).

   19. Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three
   witnesses.

   19. Adversus presbyterum accusationem ne admittas, nisi sub duobus aut
   tribus testibus.

   20. Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.

   20. Peccantes coram omnibus argue, ut et caeteri timorem habeant.

   21. I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect
   angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before
   another, doing nothing by partiality.

   21. Contestor coram Deo, et Domino Iesu Christo, et electis angelis, ut
   haec custodias absque praecipitatione judicii, nihil faciens, alteram
   in partem declinando.

   17 Elders [98] For preserving the good order of the Church, it is
   likewise highly necessary that elders should not be neglected, but that
   due regard should be paid to them; for what could be more unfeeling
   than to have no care about those who have the care of the whole Church?
   Here presbuteros (elder) is not a name of age, but of office.

   Accounted worthy of double honor Chrysostom interprets "double honor"
   as meaning "support and reverence." I do not oppose his opinion; let it
   be adopted by any one that chooses. But for my own part, I think it is
   more probable that a comparison is here drawn between widows and
   elders. Paul had formerly enjoined that honor should be paid -- to
   widows; but elders are more worthy of being honored than widows, and,
   with respect to them, ought therefore to receive double honor.

   But in order to shew that he does not recommend masks, he adds, who
   rule well; that is, who faithfully and laboriously discharge their
   office. For, granting that a person should a hundred times obtain a
   place, and though he should boast of his title; yet, if he do not also
   perform his duty, he will have no right to demand that he shall be
   supported at the expense of the Church. In short, he means that honor
   is not due to the title, but to the work performed by those who are
   appointed to the office.

   Yet he prefers those who labor in word and doctrine, that is, those who
   are diligent in teaching the word; for those two terms, word and
   doctrine, signify the same thing, namely, the preaching of the word.
   But lest any one should suppose him to mean by the word an indolent,
   and, as it is called, a speculative study of it, he adds doctrine [99]

   We may learn from this, that there were at that time two kinds of
   elders; for all were not ordained to teach. The words plainly mean,
   that there were some who "ruled well" and honorably, but who did not
   hold the office of teachers. And, indeed, there were chosen from among
   the people men of worth and of good character, who, united with the
   pastors in a common council and authority administered the discipline
   of the Church, and were a kind of censors for the correction of morals.
   Ambrose complains that this custom had gone into disuse, through the
   carelessness, or rather through the pride, of the doctors, who wish to
   possess undivided power.

   To return to Paul, he enjoins that support shall be provided chiefly
   for pastors, who are employed in teaching. Such is the ingratitude of
   the world, that very little care is taken about supporting the
   ministers of the word; and Satan, by this trick, endeavors to deprive
   the Church of instruction, by terrifying many, through the dread of
   poverty and hunger, from bearing that burden. [100]

   18 Thou shalt not muzzle the ox This is a political precept which
   recommends to us equity and humanity [101] in general; as we have said
   in expounding the First Epistle to the Corinthians; [102] for, if he
   forbids us to be unkind to brute animals, how much greater humanity
   does he demand towards men! The meaning of this statement, therefore,
   is the same as if it had been said in general terns, that they must not
   make a wrong use of the labor of others. At the present day, the custom
   of treading out the corn is unknown in many parts of France, where they
   thresh the corn with flails. None but the inhabitants of Provence know
   what is meant by "treading it out." But this has nothing to do with the
   meaning; for the same thing may be said about ploughing.

   The laborer is worthy of his hire He does not quote this as a passage
   of Scripture, but as a proverbial saying, which common sense teaches to
   all. In like manner, when Christ said the same thing to the Apostles,
   (Matthew 10:10,) he brought forward nothing else than a statement
   approved by universal consent. It follows that they are cruel, and have
   forgotten the claims of equity, who permit cattle to suffer hunger; and
   incomparably worse are they that act the same part towards men, whose
   sweat they suck out for their own accommodation. And how intolerable is
   the ingratitude of those who refuse support to their pastors, to whom
   they cannot pay an adequate salary!

   19 Against an elder receive not an accusation After having commanded
   that salaries should be paid to pastors, he likewise instructs Timothy
   not to allow them to be assailed by calumnies, or loaded with any
   accusation but what is supported by sufficient proof. But it may be
   thought strange, that he represents, as peculiar to elders, a law which
   is common to all. God lays down, authoritatively, this law as
   applicable to all cases, that they shall be decided "by the mouth of
   two or three witnesses." (Deuteronomy 17:6; Matthew 18:16.) Why then
   does the Apostle protect elders alone by this privilege, as if it were
   peculiar to them, that their innocence shall be defended against false
   accusations?

   I reply, this is a necessary remedy against the malice of men; for none
   are more liable to slanders and calumnies than godly teachers. [103]
   Not only does it arise from the difficulty of their office, that
   sometimes they either sink under it, or stagger, or halt, or blunder,
   in consequence of which wicked men seize many occasions for finding
   fault with them; but there is this additional vexation, that, although
   they perform their duty correctly, so as not to commit any error
   whatever, they never escape a thousand censures. And this is the
   craftiness of Satan, to draw away the hearts of men from ministers,
   that instruction may gradually fall into contempt. Thus not only is
   wrong done to innocent persons, in having their reputation unjustly
   wounded, (which is exceedingly base in regard to those who hold so
   honorable a rank,) but the authority of the sacred doctrine of God is
   diminished.

   And this is what Satan, as I have said, chiefly labors to accomplish;
   for not only is the saying of Plato true in this instance, that "the
   multitude are malicious, and envy those who are above them," but the
   more earnestly any pastor strives to advance the kingdom of Christ, so
   much the more is he loaded with envy, and so much the fiercer are the
   assaults made on him. Not only so, but as soon as any charge against
   the ministers of the word has gone abroad, it is believed as fully as
   if they were already convicted. This is not merely owing to the higher
   degree of moral excellence which is demanded from them, but because
   almost all are tempted by Satan to excessive credulity, so that,
   without making any inquiry, they eagerly condemn their pastors, whose
   good name they ought rather to have defended.

   On good grounds, therefore, Paul opposes so heinous iniquity, and
   forbids that elders shall be subjected to the slanders of wicked men
   till they have been convicted by sufficient proof. We need not wonder,
   therefore, if they whose duty it is to reprove the faults of all, to
   oppose the wicked desires of all, and to restrain by their severity
   every person whom they see going astray, have many enemies. What, then,
   will be the consequence; if we shall listen indiscriminately to all the
   slanders that are spread abroad concerning them?

   20 Those that sin rebuke before all [104] Whenever any measure is taken
   for the protection of good men, it is immediately seized by bad men to
   prevent them from being condemned. Accordingly, what Paul had said
   about repelling unjust accusations he modifies by this statement, so
   that none may, on this presence, escape the punishment due to sin. And,
   indeed, we see how great and diversified are the privileges by which
   Popery surrounds its clergy; so that, although their life be ever so
   wicked, [105] still they are exempted from all reproof. Certainly, if
   regard be had to the cautions which are collected by Gratian, [106]
   (Caus. 2, Quest. 4 and Quest. 7,) there will be no danger of their
   being ever compelled to give an account of their life. Where will they
   find the seventy-two witnesses for condemning a bishop, which are
   demanded by the disgusting bull issued by Pope Sylvester? Moreover,
   seeing that the whole order of laymen is debarred from accusing, and as
   the inferior orders, even of the clergy, are forbidden to give any
   annoyance to the higher classes of them, what shall hinder them from
   fearlessly mocking at all decisions?

   It is therefore proper, carefully to observe this moderation, that
   insolent tongues shall be restrained from defaming elders by false
   accusations, and yet that every one of them who conducts himself badly
   shall be severely corrected; for I understand this injunction to relate
   to elders, that they who live a dissolute life shall be openly
   reproved.

   That others also may fear Wherefore? That others, warned by such an
   example, may fear the more, when they perceive that not even those who
   are placed above them in rank and honor are spared; for as elders ought
   to lead the way to others by the example of a holy life, so, if they
   commit crime, it is proper to exercise severity of discipline toward
   them, that it may serve as an example to others. And why should greater
   forbearance be used toward those whose offenses are much more hurtful
   than those of others? Let it be understood that Paul speaks of crimes
   or glaring transgressions, which are attended by public scandal; for,
   if any of the elders shall have committed a fault, not of a public
   nature, it is certain that he ought to be privately admonished and not
   openly reproved.

   21 I adjure thee before God Paul introduced this solemn appeal, not
   only on account of the very great importance of the subject, but
   likewise on account of its extreme difficulty. Nothing is more
   difficult than to discharge the office of a public judge with so great
   impartiality as never to be moved by favor for any one, or to give rise
   to suspicions, or to be influenced by unfavorable reports, or to use
   excessive severity, and in every cause to look at nothing but the cause
   itself; for only when we shut our eyes to persons [107] do we pronounce
   an equitable judgment.

   Let us remember that, in the person of Timothy, all pastors are
   admonished, and that Timothy is armed, as with a shield, against wicked
   desires, which not infrequently occasion much trouble even to some
   excellent persons. He therefore places God before the eyes of Timothy,
   that he may know that he ought to execute his office not less
   conscientiously than if he were in the presence of God and of his
   angels.

   And the Lord Jesus Christ. After having named God, he next mentions
   Christ; for he it is to whom the Father hath given all power to judge,
   (John 5:22,) and before whose tribunal we shall one day appear.

   And the elect angels. To "Christ" he adds "angels," not as judges, but
   as the future witnesses of our carelessness, or rashness, or ambition,
   or unfaithfulness. They are present as spectators, because they have
   been commanded to take care of the Church. And, indeed, he must be
   worse than stupid, and must have a heart of stone, whose indolence and
   carelessness are not shaken off by this single consideration, that the
   government of the Church is under the eye of God and the angels; and
   when that solemn appeal is added, our fear and anxiety must be
   redoubled. He calls them "elect angels," [108] not only to distinguish
   them from the reprobate angels, but on account of their excellence, in
   order that their testimony may awaken deeper reverence.

   Without hastiness of judgment [109] . The Greek word prokrima, to
   translate it literally, answers to the Latin word proejudicium, "a
   judgment beforehand." But it rather denotes excessive haste, [110] as
   when we pronounce a decision at random, without having fully examined
   the matter; or it denotes immoderate favor, when we render to persons
   more than is proper, or prefer some persons as being more excellent
   than others; which, in the decisions of a judge, is always unjust.
   Paul, therefore, condemns here either levity or acceptance of persons.

   To the same purpose is that which immediately follows, that there must
   be no turning to this side or that; for it is almost impossible to tell
   how difficult it is, for those who hold the office of a judge, to keep
   themselves unmoved, amidst assaults so numerous and so diversified.
   Instead of kata prosklisin, [111] some copies have kata prosklesin But
   the former reading is preferable.

   [99] "He shews that we might do many other things, and might allege

   which God calls us. They who would wish to be reckoned pastors ought to
   devote themselves especially to that word. And how? In order to study
   it secretly in their closet? Not at all; but for the general
   instruction of the Church. That is the reason why Paul chose to add the
   term doctrine. It was quite enough to have said, word; but he shews
   that we must not privately speculate what we shall think fit, but that,
   when we have studied, it is that others may profit along with us, and
   that the instruction may be common to the whole Church. -- This is the

   and let us know that there is no accepting of persons, but that,

   nature. They were angels of God, but they were not elected to
   persevere, and so they fell. Thus God reserved what he chose among the
   angels. And so we have already a mirror of God's election of us to
   heaven, by free grace before we came into the world. Now, if we see the
   grace of God displayed even to angels, what shall become of us? For all
   mankind were lost and ruined in Adam, and we are an accursed, and, as
   the Scripture tells us, are born "children of wrath." (Ephesians 2:3.)

   1 Timothy 5:22-25

   22. Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's
   sins: keep thyself pure.

   22. Manus cito ne cui imponas; neque communices peccatis alienis;
   temetipsum purum custodi.

   23. Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake
   and thine often infirmities.

   23. Ne posthac bibas aquam; sed paululo vino utere propter stomachum
   tuum, et crebras tuas infirmitates.

   24. Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and
   some men they follow after.

   24. Quorundam hominum peccata ante manifestata sunt, festinantia ad
   judicium, in quibusdam vero etiam subsequuntur.

   25. Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and
   they that are otherwise cannot be hid.

   25. Similiter et bona opera ante manifesta sunt; et quae secus habent
   latere nequeunt.

   22 Lay not hands suddenly on any man There can be no doubt that he
   intended to guard Timothy against ill-will, and to obviate many
   complaints, which are continually arising against the godly servants of
   Christ, who refuse to comply with the ambitious requests of any. For
   some accuse them of sternness; others of envy; and some exclaim that
   they are cruel, because they do not at once receive those who boast of
   having some recommendatory qualities. This is what we abundantly
   experience in the present day. Paul therefore exhorts Timothy not to
   lay aside judicious caution, and not to suffer himself to be
   overpowered by improper feelings; not that Timothy needed such an
   admonition, but to restrain, by his authority, those who otherwise
   might have given annoyance to Timothy,

   First, the "laying on of hands" means Ordination: [112] that is, the
   sign is put for the thing signified; for he forbids him to receive too
   easily any one that has not been fully tried. There are some who,
   through a desire of novelty, would wish to receive into the ministerial
   office, some person hardly at all known, as soon as he has given one or
   two exhibitions that are reckoned good. It is the duty of a wise and
   thoughtful bishop, to resist this troublesome feeling, in the same
   manner as Paul here bids Timothy do.

   Neither partake of other men's sins He means that he who consents to an
   unlawful act of ordination is involved in the same guilt as the chief
   actors in it. Yet some explain it thus: "If he admit unworthy persons,
   whatever faults they may afterwards commit, to him will be imputed the
   blame or a part of the blame." But I think that this is a more simple
   view of it: "Though others rush forth to such rashness, do not make
   thyself a partaker with them, lest thou share in their guilt." Even
   where our judgment is otherwise sound, it often happens that we are
   carried away by the folly and levity of others. [113]

   Keep thyself pure I consider this also to have the same reference as
   the preceding clause. As if he had said, "If others do anything that is
   wrong, beware lest any contagion reach you, either by consent or by
   approbation. If you cannot hinder them from polluting themselves, it is
   at least your duty to have your counsels at all times separated from
   theirs, so that you may keep yourself pure." If any prefer to view it
   as a general statement, let him enjoy his opinion; but, for my own
   part, I reckon it to be more suitable to limit it to the present
   context.

   23 No longer drink water There are some who conjecture that this
   sentence, which breaks off the train of thought, was not written by
   Paul. But we see that Paul was not so anxious about keeping up the
   close connection of a discourse, and that it was very customary with
   him to intermingle a variety of statements without any arrangement.
   Besides, it is possible that what had been formerly written in the
   margin of the Epistle afterwards found its way into this passage
   through the mistake of the transcribers. Yet there is no necessity for
   giving ourselves much trouble on that point, if we consider Paul's
   custom, which I have mentioned, of sometimes mingling various subjects.

   What is said amounts to this, that Timothy should accustom himself to
   drink a little wine, for the sake of preserving his health; for he does
   not absolutely forbid him to "drink water," but to use it as his
   ordinary beverage; and that is the meaning of the Greek word
   hudropotein

   But why does he not simply advise him to drink wine? For when he adds,
   a little, he appears to guard against intemperance, which there was no
   reason to dread in Timothy. I reply, this was rather expressed, in
   order to meet the slanders of wicked men, who would otherwise have been
   ready to mock at his advice, on this or some such pretext: "What sort
   of philosophy is this, which encourages to drink wine? Is that the road
   by which we rise to heaven?" In order to meet jeers of this kind, he
   declares that he provides only for a case of necessity; and at the same
   time he recommends moderation.

   Now it is evident that Timothy was not only frugal, but even austere,
   in his mode of living; so much so as even not to take care of his
   health; and it is certain that this was done, neither through ambition
   nor through superstition. Hence we infer, that not only was he very far
   from indulging in luxury and superfluities, but that, in order that he
   might be better prepared for doing the work of the Lord, he retrenched
   a portion even of his ordinary food; for it was not by natural
   disposition, but through a desire of temperance, that he was
   abstemious.

   How few are there at the present day, who need to be forbidden the use
   of water; or rather how many are there that need to be limited to drink
   wine soberly! It is also evident how necessary it is for us, even when
   we are desirous to act right, to ask from the Lord the spirit of
   prudence, that he may teach us moderation. Timothy was, indeed, upright
   in his aims; but, because he is reproved by the Spirit of God, we learn
   that excess of severity of living was faulty in him. At the same time a
   general rule is laid down, that, while we ought to be temperate in
   eating and drinking, every person should attend to his own health, not
   for the sake of prolonging life, but that, as long as he lives, he may
   serve God, and be of use to his neighbors.

   And if excessive abstinence is blamed, when it brings on or promotes
   diseases, how much more should superstition be avoided? What judgment
   shall we form as to the obstinacy of the Carthusians, [114] who would
   sooner have died than taste the smallest morsel of flesh in extreme
   necessity? And if those who live sparingly and soberly are commanded
   not to injure their health by excessive parsimony, no slight punishment
   awaits the intemperate, who, by cramming their belly, waste their
   strength. Such persons need not only to be advised, but to be kept back
   from their fodder like brute beasts.

   24 The sins of some men are visible beforehand As there is nothing that
   distresses more the faithful ministers of the Church, than to see no
   way of correcting evils, and to be compelled to endure hypocrites, of
   whose wickedness they are aware and to be unable to banish from the
   Church many who are destructive plagues, or even to hinder them from
   spreading their venom by secret arts; [115] Paul supports Timothy by
   this consolation, that, when it shall please God, they, will one day be
   brought to public view. Thus he strengthens him for the exercise of
   patience; because he ought calmly to await the fit time which God in
   his wisdom has appointed.

   There is another kind of base conduct that sorely distresses good and
   holy pastors. When they have most conscientiously discharged their
   duty, they are provoked by many unfair statements, are loaded with much
   ill-will, and perceive that those actions which deserved praise are
   turned into blame. Paul meets this case also, by informing Timothy,
   that there are some good works which are reserved for being brought to
   light at a future period; and consequently that, if their praise is, as
   it were, buried under ground by the ingratitude of men, that also ought
   to be patiently endured, till the time of revelation have arrived.

   Yet not only does he provide a remedy for these evils, but, because it
   often happens that we are mistaken in choosing ministers, unworthy
   persons insinuating themselves cunningly, and the good being unknown to
   us; and even though we do not go wrong in judging, but still cannot
   bring others to approve of our judgment, the most excellent being
   rejected, notwithstanding all our efforts to the contrary, while bad
   men either insinuate or force themselves forward; it is impossible that
   our condition and that of the Church should not occasion great anguish.
   Accordingly, Paul strenuously endeavors to remove, or at least to
   alleviate, this cause of uneasiness. The meaning may be thus summed up.
   "We must bear what cannot be immediately corrected; we must sigh and
   groan, while the time for the remedy is not fully come; and we must not
   apply force to diseases, till they are either ripened or laid open. On
   the other hand, when virtue does not receive the honor which it
   deserves, we must wait for the full time of revelation, and endure the
   stupidity of the world, and wait quietly in darkness till the day
   dawn."

   Hastening to judgment I now come to the words, after having given a
   brief illustration of the subject. When he says that the sins of some
   men are visible beforehand, he means that they are discovered early,
   and come to the knowledge of men, as it were, before the time. He
   expresses the same thing by another comparison, that they run, as it
   were, and "hasten to their judgment;" for we see that many run
   headlong, and, of their own accord, bring damnation on themselves,
   though the whole world is desirous to save them. Whenever this happens,
   let us remember that the reprobate are prompted by an unseen movement
   of Providence, to throw out their foam.

   In some they follow after The rendering given by Erasmus, "Some they
   follow after," I do not approve. Although it seems to be more in
   accordance with the Greek construction, yet the sense requires that the
   preposition en be understood; for the change of case does not destroy
   the contrast. As he had said that the sins of some men hasten rapidly
   to their judgment; so now, on the other hand, he adds, that the sins of
   some men (or, of others) come slowly to be known. But instead of the
   genitive "of some," he uses the dative "in some" (or "in others.") He
   means that, although the sins of some men may be concealed longer than
   we would wish, and are slowly brought to light, yet they shall not
   always be concealed; for they too shall have their own time. And if the
   version of Erasmus be preferred, still the meaning must be the same,
   that, although the vengeance of God does not hasten, yet it follows
   slowly behind them.

   25 In like manner also the good works He means, that sometimes piety
   and other virtues obtain early and speedily their applause among men;
   so that great men are held in estimation; and that, if it happen
   otherwise, the Lord will not suffer innocence and uprightness to be
   always oppressed; for it is often obscured by calumnies, or by clouds,
   but at length shall be fulfilled the prediction, (Daniel 12:3; Matthew
   13:43,) that God will cause them to shine forth like the dawn of the
   day. But we have need of a calm spirit to endure; and therefore we must
   always consider what is the limit of our knowledge, that we may not go
   beyond it; for that would be to assume to ourselves the prerogative of
   God.

   No, but to all Christians, great and small. It is then said, that we
   must not partake of the sins of others. And in what manner? By
   reproving them. (Ephesians 5:11.) And so he who intends to flatter his
   neighbor, and who shuts his eyes when he sees that God is offended, and
   especially he who consents to it will be still more blamable. Let us
   seriously think, that we shall have a hard account to render to God, if
   we have walked amidst the corruptions of the world, so as to make it
   appear that we approved of them. And so much the more ought we to
   meditate on this doctrine, when we see that there is such boldness in
   sinning, that custom appears to have become the law. Let a man be
   convinced that he is doing wrong, yet provided that he has many
   companions, he thinks that he is excused. Among wolves we must howl,'

   rest in the extravagant austerity of their manners and discipline, was
   Bruno, a native of Cologne, and canon of the cathedral of Rheims in
   France. This zealous ecclesiastic, who had neither power to reform, nor

   obtained the permission of Hugh, bishop of Grenoble, fixed his

   first the rule of St. Benedict, to which he added a considerable number
   of severe and rigorous precepts. His successors, however, went still

   CHAPTER 6
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Timothy 6:1-2

   1. Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters
   worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not
   blasphemed.

   1. Quicunque sub jugo sunt servi, suos dominos omni honore dignos
   existiment; ut ne Dei nomen et doctrina blasphemetur.

   2. And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them,
   because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are
   faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and
   exhort.

   2. Qui autem fideles habent dominos, ne despiciant eò quòd fratres
   sunt; sed magis serviant, quod fideles sint et dilecti, et
   beneficentiae participes. Haec doce, et exhortare.

   It appears that, at the beginning of the gospel, slaves cheered their
   hearts, as if the signal had been given for their emancipation; for
   Paul labors hard, in all his writings, to repress that desire; and
   indeed the condition of slavery was so hard that we need not wonder
   that it was exceedingly hateful. Now, it is customary to seize, for the
   advantage of the flesh, everything that has the slightest appearance of
   being in our favor. Thus when they were told that we are all brethren,
   they instantly concluded that it was unreasonable that they should be
   the slaves of brethren. But although nothing of all this had come into
   their mind, still wretched men are always in need of consolation, that
   may allay the bitterness of their afflictions. Besides, they could not
   without difficulty be persuaded to bend their necks, willingly and
   cheerfully, to so harsh a yoke. Such, then, is the object of the
   present doctrine.

   1 They who are slaves under the yoke Owing to the false opinion of his
   own excellence which every person entertains, there is no one who
   patiently endures that others should rule over him. They who cannot
   avoid the necessity do, indeed, reluctantly obey those who are above
   them; but inwardly they fret and rage, because they think that they
   suffer wrong. The Apostle cuts off, by a single word, all disputes of
   this kind, by demanding that all who live "under the yoke" shall submit
   to it willingly. He means that they must not inquire whether they
   deserve that lot or a better one; for it is enough that they are bound
   to this condition.

   When he enjoins them to esteem worthy of all honor the masters whom
   they serve, he requires them not only to be faithful and diligent in
   performing their duties, but to regard and sincerely respect them as
   persons placed in a higher rank than themselves. No man renders either
   to a prince or to a master what he owes to them, unless, looking at the
   eminence to which God has raised them, he honor them, because he is
   subject to them; for, however unworthy of it they may often be, still
   that very authority which God bestows on them always entitles them to
   honor. Besides, no one willingly renders service or obedience to his
   master, unless he is convinced that he is bound to do so. Hence it
   follows, that subjection begins with that honor of which Paul wishes
   that they who rule should be accounted worthy.

   That the name and doctrine of God may not be blasphemed We are always
   too ingenious in our behalf. Thus slaves, who have unbelieving masters,
   are ready enough with the objection, that it is unreasonable that they
   who serve the devil should have dominion over the children of God. But
   Paul throws back the argument to the opposite side, that they ought to
   obey unbelieving masters, in order that the name of God and the gospel
   may not be evil spoken of; as if God, whom we worship, incited us to
   rebellion, and as if the gospel rendered obstinate and disobedient
   those who ought to be subject to others.

   2 Who have believing masters The name of brother may be thought to
   constitute equality, and consequently to take away dominion. Paul
   argues, on the contrary, that slaves ought the more willingly to
   subject themselves to believing masters, because they acknowledge them
   to be children of God, and are bound to them by brotherly love, and are
   partakers of the same grace. [116] It is no small honor, that God has
   made them equal to earthly lords, in that which is of the highest
   importance; for they have the same adoption in common with them; and
   therefore this ought to be no slight inducement to bear slavery with
   patience.

   They are believers and beloved It is an additional argument, that
   slavery is much more easily endured under mild lords, who love us, and
   whom we love in return. There is also the bond of faith which binds
   very closely together those who are of different conditions.

   These things teach and exhort. He means that these are matters on the
   teaching of which he ought to dwell largely, and wishes that doctrine
   should be accompanied by exhortations. It is as if he had said, that
   this kind of instruction ought to be daily repeated, and that men need
   not only to be taught, but likewise to be roused and urged by frequent
   exhortations.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [116] "Let us learn to honor the graces of God when they shall be
   placed before our eyes; and when we shall see a man who has some token
   of the fear of God and of faith, let us value him so much the more,
   that we may seek to cherish the closest friendship with him, that we
   may bear with him as far as we are able, and that we may desire to be
   on good terms with him. And let every one consider what is said here,
   that, since God has thus brought us together, it is that we may know
   that it is in order that he may make us all his heirs, that we have one
   Spirit to guide us, one faith, one Redeemer, one baptism, for all this
   is included in the word Benefit. Since therefore we have that, let us
   learn to esteem the graces of God, in order that they may lead us to
   all mutual kindness, and that we may act in accordance with the lesson
   which Paul teaches us in another passage, (Ephesians 4:2,) namely, that
   we owe to each other brotherly love for that is "a bond' which ought to
   be reckoned sufficient for uniting us.' -- Fr. Ser.

   1 Timothy 6:3-5

   3. If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even
   the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is
   according to godliness;

   3. Si quis aliter (vel, alia) docet, nec acquiescit sanis sermonibus
   Domini nostri Iesu Christi, et ei quae secundum pietatem est doctrinae,

   4. He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes
   of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,

   4. Inflatus est, nihil sciens, sed languens circa quaestiones et pugnas
   verborum, ex quibus oritur invidia, contentio, maledicentiae,
   suspiciones malae,

   5. Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the
   truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.

   5. Supervacuae conflictationes hominum mente corruptorum, et qui
   veritate privati sunt, existimantium quaestum esse pietatum; sejunge te
   a talibus.

   3 If anyone teacheth differently The word heterodidaskalei, being a
   compound, may also, not improperly, be translated, teacheth other
   things Yet there is no ambiguity as to the meaning; for he condemns all
   those who do not agree with this manner of teaching, although they do
   not openly and avowedly oppose sound doctrine. It is possible that he
   who does not profess any wicked or open error may yet, by endeavoring
   to insinuate himself by means of silly babbling, corrupt the doctrine
   of godliness; for, when there is no progress, and no edification in the
   doctrine itself, there is already a departure from the ordinance of
   Christ. Now although Paul does not speak of the avowed supporters of
   wicked doctrines, but of vain and irreligious teachers, who, by their
   ambition or covetousness, disfigure the plain and simple doctrine of
   godliness, yet we see with what sharpness and severity he attacks them.
   Nor need we wonder at this; for it is almost impossible to tell how
   much injury is done by preaching that is hypocritical and altogether
   framed for the purposes of ostentation and of idle display. But who
   they are that are blamed by him, appears more clearly from what
   immediately follows --

   And consenteth not to sound words This clause is intended to explain
   the former. It frequently happens that such men as are here described,
   carried away by foolish curiosity, despise everything that is useful
   and solid, and thus indulge in wanton freaks, like unruly horses. And
   what is this but to reject the sound words of Christ? for they are
   called "sound" or "healthful," because they give health to us, or are
   fitted to promote it.

   And to the doctrine which is according to godliness This has the same
   meaning with the former clause; for the "doctrine" will not be
   consistent with "godliness," if it do not instruct us in the fear and
   worship of God, if it do not edify our faith, if it do not train us to
   patience, humility, and all the duties of that love which we owe to our
   fellowmen. Whoever, therefore, does not strive to teach usefully, does
   not teach as he ought to do; and not only so, but that doctrine is
   neither godly nor sound, whatever may be the brilliancy of its display,
   that does not tend to the profit of the hearers.

   4 He is puffed up, knowing nothing Such persons Paul first charges with
   pride, foolish and empty pride. Next, because no punishment can be
   imagined that is better adapted to chastise ambitious persons than to
   declare that all that they delight in proves their ignorance, Paul
   pronounces that they know nothing, though they are swelled with many
   subtleties; for they have nothing that is solid, but mere wind. At the
   same time, he instructs all believers not to be carried away by that
   windy ostentation, but to remain steadfast in the simplicity of the
   gospel.

   But languishing after questions and debates of words There is an
   indirect contrast between "the soundness of the doctrine of Christ,"
   and that "languishing;" for, when they have wearied themselves much and
   long with ingenious questions, what advantage do they reap from their
   labor, but that the disease continually grows? Thus not only do they
   consume their strength to no purpose, but their foolish curiosity
   begets this languishing; and hence it follows, that they are very far
   from profiting aright, as the disciples of Christ ought to do.

   Not without reason does the Apostle connect "questions and disputes of
   words;" for by the former term he does not mean every kind of
   questions, which either arise from a sober and moderate desire to
   learn, or contribute to clear explanation of useful things, but to such
   questions as are agitated, in the present day, in the schools of the
   Sorbonne, for displaying acuteness of intellect. There one question
   gives rise to another; for there is no limit to them, when every
   person, desiring to know more than is proper, indulges his vanity; and
   hence, there afterwards arise innumerable quarrels. As the thick
   clouds, during hot weather, are not dispelled without thunder, so those
   thorny questions must burst into disputes.

   He gives the name logomachias (logomachies, or disputes about words) to
   contentious disputes about words rather than things, or, as it is
   commonly expressed, without substance or foundation; for if any person
   carefully inquire what sort of contentions are burning among the
   sophists, he will perceive that they do not arise from realities, but
   are framed out of nothing. In a word, Paul intended to condemn all
   questions which sharpen us for disputes that are of no value.

   From which arises envy He demonstrates from the effects how much an
   ambitious desire of knowledge ought to be avoided; for ambition is the
   mother of envy. Where envy reigns, there also rage brawlings,
   contentions, and other evils, which are here enumerated by Paul.

   5 Of men corrupt in understanding, and that are destitute of the truth
   It is certain that here he censures the sophists, who, neglecting
   edification, turn the word of God into trivial distinctions, and an art
   of ingenious discussion. If the Apostle only shewed that the doctrine
   of salvation is thus rendered useless, even that would be an
   intolerable profanation; but far heavier and fiercer is that reproof,
   when he says that evils so pernicious, and plagues so hurtful, spring
   from it. From this passage, therefore, let us learn to detest
   (sophistiken) sophistry as a thing more destructive to the Church of
   God than can easily be believed.

   That godliness is gain The meaning is, that godliness is a gainful art;
   that is, because they measure the whole of Christianity by gain. Just
   as if the oracles of the Holy Spirit had been recorded with no other
   design than to serve the purposes of their covetousness, they traffic
   in it as merchandise exposed to sale.

   Withdraw thyself from such. Paul forbids the servants of Christ to have
   any intercourse with such persons. He not only warns Timothy not to
   resemble them, but exhorts him to avoid them as dangerous plagues; for,
   although they do not openly resist the gospel, but, on the contrary,
   make a false profession of adhering to it, yet their society is
   infectious. Besides, if the multitude see that we are on familiar terms
   with those men, the danger is, lest they insinuate themselves under the
   guise of our friendship. [117] We should therefore, labor to the
   utmost, that all may know, that so far are we from being agreed with
   them, that they have no communication with us. [118]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [117] "Il y a danger que nostre amitie ne leur serve d'une couverture
   pour avoir entree a abuser les gens." -- "There is danger lest our
   friendship serve as a disguise for obtaining access to deceive people."

   [118] "When we hear that they who thus misrepresent the word of God
   make merchandise of our souls, as the Apostle Peter says (2 Peter 2:3,)
   and that they make traffic of us and of our salvation, without any
   conscience, and that they make no scruple of plunging us into hell, and
   even to set aside the price which was paid for our redemption, it is
   certain that they ruin souls, and also mock at the blood of our Lord
   Jesus Christ. When we hear all this, ought we not to hold such teachers
   in abhorrence? Besides, experience shews us that we have good reason
   for attending to this warning of the Apostle Paul. For to what a pitch
   has religion arrived! Has it not been made like a public fair? What has
   it become in Popery? The Sacraments are exposed to sale, and everything
   else belonging to our religion has a fixed price put upon it. Not more
   did Judas sell the Son of God in his own person than the Pope and all
   that filth of his clergy have sold the graces of the Holy Spirit, and
   all that belonged to his office and to our salvation. When we see this,
   have we not good reason for being on our guard?" -- Fr. Ser.

   1 Timothy 6:6-10

   6. But godliness with contentment is great gain.

   6. Est autem quaestus magnus pietas cum sufficientia.

   7. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can
   carry nothing out.

   7. Nihil enim intulimus in mundum; certum quòd neque efferre quicquam
   possumus.

   8. And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.

   8. Habentes autem alimenta et tegmina, his contenti erimus.

   9. But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and
   into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and
   perdition.

   9. Nam qui volunt ditescere incidunt in tentationem et laqueum, et
   stupiditates multas et noxias, quae demergunt homines in exitium et
   interitum.

   10. For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some
   coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves
   through with many sorrows.

   10. Radix enim omnium malorum est avaritia; cui addicti quidam
   aberrarunt a fide, et se ipsos implicuerunt doloribus multis.

   6 But godliness with sufficiency is great gain In an elegant manner,
   and with an ironical correction, he instantly throws back those very
   words in an opposite meaning, as if he had said -- "They do wrong and
   wickedly, who make merchandise of the doctrine of Christ, as if
   godliness were gain;' though, undoubtedly, if we form a correct
   estimate of it, godliness is a great and abundant gain." And he so
   calls it, because it brings to us full and perfect blessedness. Those
   men, therefore, are guilty of sacrilege, who, being bent on acquiring
   money, make godliness contribute to their gain. [119] But for our part,
   godliness is a very great gain to us, because, by means of it, we
   obtain the benefit, not only of being heirs of the world, but likewise
   of enjoying Christ and all his riches.

   With sufficiency. [120] This may refer either to the disposition of the
   heart, or to the thing itself. If it be understood as referring to the
   heart, the meaning will be, that "godly persons, when they desire
   nothing, but are satisfied with their humble condition, have obtained
   very great gain." If we understand it to be "sufficiency of wealth"
   (and, for my own part, I like this view quite as well as the other,) it
   will be a promise, like that in the book of Psalms,

   "The lions wander about hungry and famished; but they that seek the
   Lord shall not be in want of any good thing."
   (Psalm 34:10.)

   The Lord is always present with his people, and, as far as is
   sufficient for their necessity, out of his fullness he bestows on each
   his portion. Thus true happiness consists in piety; and this
   sufficiency may be regarded as an increase of gain.

   7 For we brought nothing into the world., He adds this for the purpose
   of setting a limit to the sufficiency. Our covetousness is an
   insatiable gulf, if it be not restrained; and the best bridle is, when
   we desire nothing more than the necessity of this life demands; for the
   reason why we transgress the bounds, is, that our anxiety extends to a
   thousand lives which we falsely imagine. Nothing is more common, and
   indeed nothing is more generally acknowledged, than this statement of
   Paul; but as soon as all have acknowledged it, (as we see every day
   with our eyes,) every man swallows up with his wishes his vast
   possessions, in the same manner as if he had a belly able to contain
   half of the world. And this is what is said, that,

   "although the folly of the fathers appears in hoping that they will
   dwell here for ever, nevertheless their posterity approve of their
   way." [121] (Psalm 49:13.)

   In order, therefore, that we may be satisfied with a sufficiency, let
   us learn to have our heart so regulated, as to desire nothing but what
   is necessary for supporting life.

   8 Having food and raiment When he mentions food and raiment, he
   excludes luxuries and overflowing abundance; for nature is content with
   a little [122] and all that goes beyond the natural use is superfluous.
   Not that to use them more largely ought to be condemned on its own
   account, but lusting after them is always sinful.

   9 They who wish to be rich After having exhorted him to be content, and
   to despise riches, he now explains how dangerous is the desire of
   having them, and especially in the ministers of the Church, of whom he
   expressly speaks in this passage. Now the cause of the evils, which the
   Apostle here enumerates, is not riches, but an eager desire of them,
   even though the person should be poor. And here Paul shews not only
   what generally happens, but what must always happen; for every man that
   has resolved to become rich gives himself up as a captive to the devil.
   Most true is that saying of the heathen poet, -- "He who is desirous of
   becoming rich is also desirous of acquiring riches soon." [123] Hence
   it follows, that all who are violently desirous of acquiring wealth
   rush headlong.

   Hence also those foolish, or rather, mad desires, which at length
   plunge them into perdition. This is, indeed, a universal evil; but in
   the pastors of the Church it is more easily seen; for they are so
   maddened by avarice, that they stick at nothing, however foolish,
   whenever the glitter of gold or silver dazzles their eyes.

   10 For the root of all evils is avarice [124] There is no necessity for
   being too scrupulous in comparing other vices with this. It is certain
   that ambition and pride often produce worse fruits than covetousness
   does; and yet ambition does not proceed from covetousness. The same
   thing may be said of the sins forbidden by the seventh commandment. But
   Paul's intention was not to include under covetousness every kind of
   vices that can be named. What then? He simply meant, that innumerable
   evils arise from it; just as we are in the habit of saying, when we
   speak of discord, or gluttony, or drunkenness, or any other vice of
   that kind, that there is no evil which it does not produce. And,
   indeed, we may most truly affirm, as to the base desire of gain, that
   there is no kind of evils that is not copiously produced by it every
   day; such as innumerable frauds, falsehoods, perjury, cheating,
   robbery, cruelty, corruption in judicature, quarrels, hatred,
   poisonings, murders; and, in short, almost every sort of crime.

   Statements of this nature occur everywhere in heathen writers; and,
   therefore, it is improper that those persons who would applaud Horace
   or Ovid, when speaking in that manner, should complain of Paul as
   having used extravagant language. I wish it were not proved by daily
   experience, that this is a plain description of facts as they really
   are. But let us remember that the same crimes which spring from
   avarice, may also arise, as they undoubtedly do arise, either from
   ambition, or from envy, or from other sinful dispositions.

   Which some eagerly desiring The Greek word oregomenoi is overstrained,
   when the Apostle says that avarice is "eagerly desired;" but it does
   not obscure the sense. He affirms that the most aggravated of all evils
   springs from avarice -- revolting from the faith; for they who are
   diseased with this disease are found to degenerate gradually, till they
   entirely renounce the faith. Hence those sorrows, which he mentions; by
   which term I understand frightful torments of conscience, which are
   wont to befall men past all hope; though God has other methods of
   trying covetous men, by making them their own tormentors.

   1 Timothy 6:11-16

   11. But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after
   righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.

   11. Tu vero, o homo Dei, haec fuge; sectare vero justitiam, pietatem,
   fidem, caritatem, patientiam, mansuetudinem.

   12. Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto
   thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many
   witnesses.

   12. Certa bonum certamen fidei; apprehende vitam aeternam, ad quam
   etiam vocatus es, et confessus bonam confessionem coram multis
   testibus.

   13. I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things,
   and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good
   confession;

   13. Denuntio (vel, proecipio) tibi coram Deo qui vivificat omnia, et
   Christo Iesu, qui testificatus est bonam confesionem coram Pontio
   Pilato,

   14. That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until
   the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:

   14. Ut serves mandatum immaculatus et irreprehensibilis, usque ad
   revelationem Domini nostri Iesu Christi;

   15. Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only
   Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;

   15. Quam suis temporibus manifestabit beatus et solus princeps, Rex
   regnantium et Dominus dominantium,

   16. Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can
   approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour
   and power everlasting. Amen.

   16. Qui solus habet immortalitatem, qui lumen habitat inaccessum, quem
   vidit nullus hominum, nec videre potest, cui honor et potentia aeterna
   (vel, imperium oeternum.) Amen.

   11 But thou, O man of God, flee these things By calling him man of God
   he adds weight to the exhortation. If it be thought proper to limit to
   the preceding verse the injunction which he gives to follow
   righteousness, piety, faith, patience, this is an instruction which he
   gives, by contrast, for correcting avarice, by informing him what kind
   of riches he ought to desire, namely, spiritual riches. Yet this
   injunction may also be extended to other clauses, that Timothy,
   withdrawing himself from all vanity, may avoid that (periepgian) vain
   curiosity which he condemned a little before; for he who is earnestly
   employed about necessary employments will easily abstain from those
   which are superfluous. He names, by way of example, some kinds of
   virtues, under which we may suppose others to be included.
   Consequently, every person who shall be devoted to the pursuit of
   "righteousness," and who shall aim at "piety, faith, charity," and
   shall follow patience and gentleness, cannot but abhor avarice and its
   fruits. [125]

   12 Fight the good fight of faith In the next epistle he says,

   "He who hath become a soldier doth not entangle himself with matters
   inconsistent with his calling." (2 Timothy 2:4.)

   In like manner, in order to withdraw Timothy from excessive solicitude
   about earthly things, he reminds him that he must "fight;" for
   carelessness and self-indulgence arise from this cause, that the
   greater part wish to serve Christ at ease, and as if it were pastime,
   whereas Christ calls all his servants to warfare.

   For the purpose of encouraging him to fight such a fight courageously,
   he calls it good; that is, successful, and therefore not to be shunned;
   for, if earthly soldiers do not hesitate to fight, when the result is
   doubtful, and when there is a risk of being killed, [126] how much more
   bravely ought we to do battle under the guidance and banner of Christ,
   when we are certain of victory? More especially, since a reward awaits
   us, not such as other generals are wont to give to their soldiers, but
   a glorious immortality and heavenly blessedness; it would certainly be
   disgraceful that we, who have such a hope held out to us, should grow
   weary or give way. And that is what he immediately afterwards adds, --

   Lay hold on eternal life As if he had said, "God calls thee to eternal
   life, and therefore, despising the world, strive to obtain it." When he
   commands them to "lay hold on it," he forbids them to pause or slacken
   in the middle of their course; as if he had said, that "nothing has
   been done, [127] till we have obtained the life to come, to which God
   invites us." In like manner, he affirms that he strives to make
   progress, because he has not yet laid hold. (Philippians 3:12.)

   To which also thou, hast been called Because men would run at random,
   and to no purpose, if they had not God as the director of their course,
   for the purpose of promoting their cheerful activity, he mentions also
   the calling; for there is nothing that ought to animate us with greater
   courage than to learn that we have been "called" by God; for we
   conclude from this, that our labor, which God directs, and in which he
   stretches out his hand to us, will not be fruitless. Besides, to have
   rejected the calling of God would be a disgraceful reproach; and,
   therefore, this ought to be a very powerful excitement: "God calls thee
   to eternal life; beware of being drawn aside to anything else, or of
   falling short in any way, before thou hast attained it."

   And hast confessed a good confession By mentioning his former life, the
   Apostle excites him still more to persevere; for to give way, after
   having begun well, is more disgraceful than never to have begun. To
   Timothy, who had hitherto acted valiantly, and had obtained applause,
   he addresses this powerful argument, that the latter end should
   correspond to the beginning. By the word confession I understand not
   that which is expressed in words, but rather what is actually
   performed; and that not in a single instance merely, but throughout his
   whole ministry. The meaning therefore is: "Thou hast many witnesses of
   thy illustrious confession, both at Ephesus and in other countries, who
   have beheld thee acting faithfully and sincerely in the profession of
   the gospel; and, therefore, having given such a proof of fidelity, thou
   canst not, without the greatest shame and disgrace, shew thyself to be
   anything else than a distinguished soldier of Christ." By this passage
   we are taught in general, that the more any of us excels, the less
   excusable is he if he fail, and the stronger are his obligations to God
   to persevere in the right course.

   13 I charge thee The great vehemence of solemn appeal, which Paul
   employs, is a proof how rare and hard a virtue it is, to persevere in
   the ministry, in a proper manner, till the end; for, although he
   exhorts others, in the person of Timothy, yet he addresses him also.

   Before God, who quickeneth all things What he affirms concerning Christ
   and concerning God, has an immediate relation to the present subject;
   for, when he ascribes this to God, that he quickeneth all things, he
   wishes to meet the offense of the cross, which presents to us nothing
   but the appearance of death. He therefore means, that we should shut
   our eyes, when ungodly men hold out and threaten death; or rather, that
   we should fix our eyes on God alone, because it is he who restoreth the
   dead to life. The amount of the whole is, that, turning away our gaze
   from the world, we should learn to look at God alone.

   And Christ Jesus, who testified a good confession before Pontius
   Pilate. What he now adds about Christ contains a remarkable
   confirmation; for we are taught, that we are not in the school of
   Plato, to learn philosophy from him, and to hear him discoursing in the
   shade about idle disputes; but that the doctrine which Timothy
   professes was ratified by the death of the Son of God. Christ made his
   confession before Pilate, not in a multitude of words, but in reality;
   that is, by undergoing a voluntary death; for, although Christ chose to
   be silent before Pilate, rather than speak in his own defense, because
   he had come thither -- devoted already to a certain condemnation; yet
   in his silence there was a defense of his doctrine not less magnificent
   than if he had defended himself with a loud voice. He ratified it by
   his blood, and by the sacrifice of his death, better than he could have
   ratified it by his voice. [128]

   This confession the Apostle calls good. For Socrates also died; and yet
   his death was not a satisfactory proof of the doctrine which he held.
   But when we hear that the blood of the Son of God was shed, that is an
   authentic seal which removes all our doubt. Accordingly, whenever our
   hearts waver, let us remember that we should always go to the death of
   Christ for confirmation. What cowardice would there be in deserting
   such a leader going before us to show us the way!

   14 That thou, keep the commandment. By the word commandment he means
   all that he hath hitherto said about the office of Timothy, the sum of
   which was, that he should show himself to be a faithful minister to
   Christ and to the Church. What is the use of extending this to the
   whole law? But perhaps it will be thought preferable to view it as
   denoting the office which he had received by divine authority; for we
   are appointed to be ministers of the Church on no other condition than
   this, that God enjoins upon us whatever he wishes us to do. Thus to
   "keep the commandment" would be nothing else than to discharge honestly
   the office committed to him. I certainly view it as referring
   altogether to the ministry of Timothy.

   Spotless and unblameable [129] Whether we consider the case or the
   termination [130] of the two Greek adjectives which are thus
   translated, they may apply either to the commandment given, or to the
   person of Timothy; but the meaning which I have assigned is much more
   appropriate. [131] Paul informs Timothy, that he must he wish to
   discharge his office in a proper manner.

   Till the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ It is impossible to tell
   how necessary it was to all the godly, at that time, to have their mind
   entirely fixed on the day of Christ; because innumerable offenses
   existed everywhere in the world. They were assailed on every hand, were
   universally hated and abhorred, were exposed to the mockeries of all,
   were oppressed every day with new calamities; and yet they saw no fruit
   of so many toils and annoyances. What then remained, but that in
   thought they should fly away to that blessed day of our redemption?

   Yet the same reason is in force with regard to us in the present day,
   and indeed applies equally to almost every age. How many things does
   Satan constantly present to our eyes, which, but for this, would a
   thousand times draw us aside from the right course! I say nothing about
   fires, and swords, and banishments, and all time furious attacks of
   enemies. I say nothing about slanders and other vexations. How many
   things are within, that are far worse! Ambitious men openly attack us,
   Epicureans and Lucianists jeer at us, impudent men provoke us,
   hypocrites murmur at us, they who are wise after the flesh secretly
   bite us, we are harassed by various methods in every direction. In
   short, it is a great miracle that any man perseveres steadfastly in an
   office so difficult and so dangerous. The only remedy for all these
   difficulties is, to cast our eyes towards the appearing of Christ, and
   to keep them fixed on it continually. [132]

   15 Which in his seasons he will show We are commonly hasty in our
   wishes, and not far from prescribing a day and hour to God, as if we
   should say, that he must not delay to perform anything that he has
   promised; and for that reason the Apostle takes an early opportunity of
   restraining excessive haste, by expecting the coming of Christ. For
   that is the meaning of the words, "which in his seasons he will show."
   When men know that the proper time for anything is not fully come, they
   wait for it more patiently. How comes it that we are so patient in
   bearing with the order of nature, but because we are restrained by this
   consideration, that we shall act unreasonably, if we struggle against
   it with our desires? Thus we know, that the revelation of Christ has
   its appointed time, for which we must wait patiently.

   The blessed and only Prince Those splendid titles are here employed in
   exalting the princely authority of God, in order that the brilliancy of
   the princes of this world may not dazzle our eyes. And such instruction
   was, at that time, especially necessary; for by how much all kingdoms
   were then great and powerful, by so much were the majesty and glory of
   God thrown into the shade. For all that governed the kingdoms of the
   world not only were deadly enemies of the kingdom of God, but proudly
   mocked at God, and trampled his sacred name under their feet; and the
   greater the haughtiness with which they despised true religion, the
   more happy did they imagine themselves to be. From such an aspect of
   things who would not have concluded that God was miserably vanquished
   and oppressed? We see to what a pitch of insolence Cicero rises against
   the Jews on account of their humbled condition, in his oration for
   Flaccus.

   When good men see that the wicked are puffed up with prosperity, they
   are sometimes cast down; and therefore Paul, for the purpose of
   withdrawing the eyes of the godly from that transitory splendor,
   ascribes to God alone "blessedness, principality, and kingly power."
   When he calls God the only prince, he does not overthrow civil
   government, as if there ought to be no magistrates or kings in the
   world, but means that it is He alone who reigns from himself and from
   his own power. This is evident from what follows, which he adds by way
   of exposition, --

   King of kings, and Lord of lords The sum of it is, that all the
   governments of the world are subject to his dominion, depend upon him,
   and stand or fall at his bidding, but that the authority of God is
   beyond all comparison, because all the rest are nothing as compared
   with his glory, and while they fade and quickly perish, his authority
   will endure for ever.

   16 Who alone hath immortality Paul labors to demonstrate that there is
   no happiness, no dignity or excellence, no life, out of God.
   Accordingly, he now says that God alone is immortal, in order to inform
   us, that we and all the creatures do not, strictly speaking, live, but
   only borrow life from Him. Hence it follows that, when we look up to
   God as the fountain of immortal life, we should reckon this present
   life as of no value.

   But it is objected, that the human soul and angels have their
   immortality, and therefore this cannot be truly affirmed of God alone.
   I reply, when it is said, that God alone possesses immortality, it is
   not here denied that he bestows it, as he pleases, on any of his
   creatures. The meaning is the same as if Paul had said that God alone
   is immortal from himself and from his own nature, but has immortality
   in his power; so that it does not belong to creatures, except so far as
   he imparts to them power and vigor; for if you take away the power of
   God which is communicated to the soul of man, it will instantly fade
   away; and the same thing may be said about angels. Strictly speaking,
   therefore, immortality does not subsist in the nature of souls or of
   angels, but comes from another source, namely, from the secret
   inspiration of God, agreeably to that saying,

   "In him we live, and move, and are." (Acts 17:28.)

   If any one wish to have a larger and more acute discussion of this
   subject, let him consult the twelfth book of Augustine "On the City of
   God."

   Who inhabiteth unapproachable light He means two things, that God is
   concealed from us, and yet that the cause of obscurity is not in
   himself, as if he were hidden in darkness, but in ourselves, who, on
   account of the weak vision, or rather the dullness of our
   understanding, cannot approach to his light. We must understand that
   the light of God is unapproachable, if any one endeavor to approach to
   it in his own strength; for, if God did not open up the entrance to us
   by his grace, the prophet would not say:

   "They who draw near to him are enlightened." (Psalm 34:5.)

   Yet it is true that, while we are surrounded by this mortal flesh, we
   never penetrate so far into the deepest secrets of God as to have
   nothing hidden from us; for

   "we know in part, and we see as by a mirror, and in a riddle."
   (1 Corinthians 13:9-12.)

   By faith, therefore, we enter into the light of God, but only in part.
   Still it is true, that it is a "light unapproachable" by man.

   Whom no man hath seen or can see This is added for the sake of
   additional explanation, that men may learn to look by faith to him,
   whom they cannot see with the bodily eyes, or even with the powers of
   their understanding; for I view this as referring not only to the
   bodily eyes, but also to the faculties of the soul. We must always
   consider what is the Apostle's design. It is difficult for us to
   overlook and disregard all those things of which we have immediate
   vision, that we may endeavor to come to God, who is nowhere to be seen.
   For this thought always comes into our mind: "How knowest thou if there
   is a God, seeing that thou only hearest that he is, and dost not see
   him?" The Apostle fortifies us against this danger, by affirming that
   it ought not to be judged according to our senses, because it exceeds
   our capacity; for the reason why we do not see is, that our sight is
   not so keen as to ascend to so great a height.

   There is a long dispute in Augustine on this point, because it appears
   to contradict what is said, in the first Epistle,

   "Then shall we see him as he is, because we shall be like him."
   (1 John 3:2.)

   While he reasons on this subject in many passages, there appears to me
   to be none in which he explains it more clearly than in the letter
   which he writes to the widow Paulina.

   So far as relates to the meaning of the present passage, the answer is
   easy, that we cannot see God in this nature, as it is said elsewhere,

   "Flesh and blood shall not possess the kingdom of God."
   (1 Corinthians 15:50.)

   We must be renewed, that we may be like God, before it be granted to us
   to see him. And that our curiosity may not be beyond measure, let us
   always remember, that the manner of living is of more importance in
   this inquiry than the manner of speaking. At the same time, let us
   remember the judicious caution which Augustine gives us, to be on our
   guard lest, while we are keenly disputing how God can be seen, we lose
   both peace and sanctification, without which no man can ever see God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [125] "And thus we see that not without reason does Paul add this word
   piety, which means religion and the fear of God, and that he connects
   it with faith, saying that, when we have put our confidence in God, and
   when we expect from him the means of our support, we must also attend
   to this, not to live in this world as if it were our end, and not to
   fix our heart upon it, but to look upwards to the heavenly kingdom.
   Having said this, he next leads us onwards to the love of our
   fellow-men and to meekness, as we are also bound to walk in all good
   friendship with our neighbors; otherwise we shall not shew that we have
   the righteousness which he has mentioned. And thus let us see that, by
   all these words, he means nothing more than to confirm the exhortation
   which he had given, to follow righteousness and sincerity. And how
   shall we follow it? First, by placing our confidence in God; secondly,
   by raising our thoughts to the heavenly kingdom; and thirdly, by living
   in good friendship with each other." -- Fr. Ser.

   [126] "We see princes whose ambition leads them to risk all that they
   have, and to place themselves in danger of being stripped of all their
   power. We see soldiers, who, instead of earning wages by laboring in
   vineyards or in the fields, go and expose their life at a venture. And
   what leads them to this? A doubtful hope, nothing certain. And though
   they have gained, and have obtained a victory over their enemies, what
   advantage do they reap from it? But when God calls us to fight, and
   wishes us to be soldiers under his banner, it is on no such condition,
   but we are made certain that the war will be good and successful. And
   thus Paul intended to comfort believers while he exhorted them, as God
   also condescends to us by shewing to us what is our duty, and, at the
   same time, declaring that, when we shall do what he commands us, all
   will turn to our profit and salvation." -- Fr. Ser.

   [127] "Nihil actuam esse." The expression reminds us of the beautiful
   encomium pronounced by the poet Lucan on the unwearied activity of
   Julius Caesar, that he "thought nothing done, while aught remained to
   do." "Nil aetum reputans, dum quid superesset agendum." -- Ed.

   [128] "By his silence he confirmed the truth of God his Father, and the
   death which he underwent was intended to give authority to the gospel;
   so that, when the doctrine of salvation is preached at the present day,
   in order that we may be confirmed in the faith of it, we must direct
   our view to the blood of the Lamb without spot, which was shed. As
   anciently, under the Law, the book was sprinkled with the blood of the
   sacrifice, so now, whenever we are spoken to in the name of God, the
   blood of Christ must be brought to our remembrance, and we must know
   that the gospel is sprinkled with it, and that our faith rests upon it
   in such a manner, that the utmost efforts of Satan cannot shake it." --
   Fr. Ser.

   [129] "Sans macule et sans reprehension:" -- "Without spot and without
   censure."

   [130] That is, they may be either in the accusative case masculine,
   agreeing with Timotheon, or in the accusative case feminine, agreeing
   with entolen. -- Ed.

   [131] "Nonobstant il est beaucoup plus propre de les rapporter a sa
   personne." -- "Nevertheless it is much more suitable to view them. as
   relating to his person."

   [132] "Believers might, indeed, be weakened in their faith, when they
   looked at present things. For, as to the great people in this world,
   what would they wish but to rise above the Church, and trample God
   under their feet? We see that they sport with religion as with a ball.
   We even see that they are deadly enemies of it, and that they persecute
   it with such rage that everybody is terrified at them. We see these
   things. Yet what shall be said of the children of God? They are pointed
   at with the finger, they are thought to be fools, so that what is said
   by the Prophet Isaiah is today fulfilled in us, that unbelievers reckon
   us to be monsters. (Isaiah 8:18.) What? These poor fools? What are they
   thinking about? What do they mean? We must live with the living, and
   howl with the wolves. They wish to be always in a state of perplexity.
   They speak of nothing but eternal life, and have no leisure for
   enjoyment.' Thus it is that we are accounted fools and madmen by
   unbelievers. And Peter says, (2 Peter 3:2-4,) that this must be
   fulfilled in us, as the prophet Isaiah had made the complaint in his
   time; Christians must experience the like in the present day." -- Fr.
   Ser.

   1 Timothy 6:17-21

   17. Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not
   highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who
   giveth us richly all things to enjoy;

   17. Iis, qui divites sunt in hoc saeculo, praecipe (vel, denuntia) ne
   efferantur, neve sperent in divitiarum incertitudine, sed in Deo vivo,
   qui abundè suppeditat omnia ad fruendum;

   18. That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to
   distribute, willing to communicate;

   18. Ut benefaciant, ut divites sint in operibus bonis, faciles ad
   largiendum (vel, ad communicationem,) libenter communicantes.

   19. Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the
   time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.

   19. Recondentes sibi ipsis fundamentum bonum in posterum, ut vitam
   aeternum apprehendant.

   20. O Timothy keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding
   profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so
   called:

   20. O Timothee, depositum custodi, devitans profanas clamorum
   inanitates, vaniloquia et oppositiones falsò nominatae scientiae.

   21. Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be
   with thee. Amen.

   21. Quam quidam profitentes aberrarunt a fide. Gratia tecum. Amen.

   The first to Timothy was written from Laodicea, which is the chiefest
   city of Phrygia Pacatiana.

   Ad Timotheum prima missa fuit ex Laodicea, quae est metropolis Phrygiae
   Pacatianae.

   17 Command (or charge) those who are rich There being many among
   Christians who were poor and in a mean condition, it is probable that
   they were despised (as usually happens) by the rich; and especially
   this might be common at Ephesus, which was a wealthy city; for in such
   cities, for the most part, pride is more extensively prevalent. And
   hence we infer how dangerous is a great abundance of riches. Nor are
   there wanting good reasons why Paul addresses so severe an admonition
   to the rich; but it is for the purpose of remedying faults which almost
   always follow riches in the same manner as the shadow follows the body;
   and that through the depravity of our natural disposition, for out of
   the gifts of God we always draw an occasion for sinning.

   That they be not haughty, nor hope in the uncertainty of riches He
   expressly mentions two things against which rich men ought to be on
   their guard, pride and deceitful hope, of which the former springs from
   the latter. Accordingly, Paul appears to have added, in the same place,
   "nor hope in the uncertainty of riches," in order to point out the
   source of all pride. For whence comes it, that rich men grow insolent,
   and take extreme delight in despising others, but because they imagine
   that they are supremely happy? Vain confidence goes first, and then
   arrogance follows.

   Rich in this world When Paul wishes to correct those faults, he first
   speaks contemptuously of riches; for the phrase, in this world, is
   intended to lower them in our esteem. All that is in the world has the
   taste of its nature; so that it is fading, and quickly passes away. The
   uncertainty and vanity of the hope that is placed in riches are shewn
   by him from this consideration, that the possession of them is so
   transitory that it is like a thing unknown; for, while we think that we
   hold them, they slip out of our hands in a moment. How foolish is it,
   therefore, to place our hope in them!

   But in the living God He who understands this will find no difficulty
   in withdrawing his hope from riches; for, if it is God alone who
   supplies us with everything for the necessary purposes of life, we
   transfer to riches what is this prerogative, when we place hope in
   them. Now observe that there is an implied contrast, when he affirms
   that God giveth abundantly to all. The meaning is, that, although we
   have a full and overflowing abundance of all things, yet we have
   nothing but from the blessing of God alone; for it is that blessing
   alone which imparts to us all that is needful.

   Hence it follows, that they are egregiously mistaken, who rely on
   riches, and do not depend entirely on the blessing of God, in which
   consists a sufficiency of food and of everything else. Hence also we
   conclude, that we are forbidden to trust in riches, not only because
   they belong to the use of mortal life, but likewise because they are
   nothing but smoke; for we are fed, not by bread only, but by the
   blessing of God. (Deuteronomy 8:3.) [133]

   When he says plousios eis apolausin, abundantly for enjoyment, he
   describes how kind God is to us, and even to all men, and to the brute
   beasts; for his kindness extends far and wide beyond our necessity.
   (Psalm 36:6.)

   18 To do good He adds another remedy to the former, for correcting the
   sinful dispositions of rich men, by stating authoritatively what is the
   lawful use of riches; for the richer any man is, the more abundant are
   his means of doing good to others; and because we are always more tardy
   than we ought to be in giving to the poor, he employs many words in
   commendation of that virtue.

   19 Laying up for themselves a good foundation Besides, he adds an
   incitement drawn from the promise of a reward; that, by bestowing and
   communicating, they will procure for themselves a better treasure than
   they can have on earth. By the word foundation he means a firm and
   lasting duration; for the spiritual riches which we "lay up for
   ourselves" in heaven, are not exposed to the ravages of worms or
   thieves, (Matthew 6:20,) or fires, but continue always to be placed
   beyond all danger. On the contrary, nothing on earth is solidly
   founded; but everything may be said to be in a floating condition.

   The inference drawn by Papists from this passage, that we therefore
   obtain eternal life by the merit of good works, is excessively
   frivolous. It is true that God accepts as given to himself everything
   that is bestowed on the poor. (Matthew 25:40.) But even the most
   perfect hardly perform the hundredth part of their duty; and therefore
   our liberality, does not deserve to be brought into account before God.
   So far are we from rendering full payment, that, if God should call us
   to a strict account, there is not one of us who would not be a
   bankrupt. But, after having reconciled us to himself by free grace, he
   accepts our services, such as they are, and bestows on them a reward
   which is not due. This recompense, therefore, does not depend on
   considerations of merit, but on God's gracious acceptance, and is so
   far from being inconsistent with the righteousness of faith, that it
   may be viewed as an appendage to it.

   20 O Timothy, guard that which is committed, to thee Though
   interpreters differ in expounding paratheken, a thing committed, yet,
   for my part, I think that it denotes that grace which had been
   communicated to Timothy for the discharge of his office. It is called
   "a thing committed," for the same reason that it is called (Matthew
   25:15,) "a talent;" for all the gifts which God bestows on us are
   committed to us on this condition, that we shall one day give an
   account of them, if the advantage which they ought to have yielded be
   not lost through our negligence. The Apostle therefore exhorts him to
   keep diligently what had been given to him, or rather, what had been
   committed to him in trust; that he may not suffer it to be corrupted or
   adulterated, or may not deprive or rob himself of it through his own
   fault. It frequently happens that our ingratitude or abuse of the gifts
   of God causes them to be taken from us; and therefore Paul exhorts
   Timothy to endeavor to preserve, by a good conscience and by proper
   use, that which had been "committed" to him.

   Avoiding profane vanities of noises The object of the admonition is,
   that he may be diligent in imparting solid instruction; and this cannot
   be, unless he detest ostentation; for, where an ambitious desire to
   please prevails, there is no longer any strong desire of edification.
   For this reason, when he spoke of "guarding the thing committed," he
   very appropriately added this caution about avoiding profane
   talkativeness. As to the rendering which the Vulgate gives to
   kenophosias, "vanities of voices," I do not so much object to it,
   except on the ground of an ambiguity which has led to a wrong
   exposition; for "Voces" is commonly supposed to have the same meaning
   here as "Vocabula," "Words," such as Fate or Fortune.

   But, for my part, I think that he describes the high-sounding and
   verbose and bombastic style of those who, not content with the
   simplicity of the gospel, turn it into profane philosophy.

   The kenophobiai [134] consist, not in single words, but in that
   swelling language which is so constantly and so disgustingly poured out
   by ambitious men, who aim at applause rather than the profit of the
   Church. And most accurately has Paul described it; for, while there is
   a strange sound of something lofty, there is nothing underneath but
   "empty" jingle, which he likewise calls "profane;" for the power of the
   Spirit is extinguished as soon as the Doctors blow their flutes in this
   manner, to display their eloquence.

   In the face of a prohibition so clear and distinct, which the Holy
   Spirit has given, this plague has nevertheless broken out; and, indeed,
   it showed itself at the very beginning, but, at length, has grown to
   such a height in Popery, that the counterfeit mark of theology which
   prevails there -- is a lively mirror of that "profane" and "empty
   noise" of which Paul speaks. I say nothing about the innumerable errors
   and follies and blasphemies with which their books and their noisy
   disputes abound. But even although they taught nothing that was
   contrary to godliness, yet, because their whole doctrine contains
   nothing else than big words and bombast, because it is inconsistent
   with the majesty of Scripture, the efficacy of the Spirit, the gravity
   of the prophets, and the sincerity of the apostles, it is, on that
   account, an absolute profanation of real theology.

   What, I ask, do they teach about faith, or repentance, or calling on
   God; about the weakness of men, or the assistance of the Holy Spirit,
   or the forgiveness of sins by free grace, or about the office of
   Christ, that can be of any avail for the solid edification of
   godliness? But on this subject we shall have occasion to speak again in
   expounding the Second Epistle. Undoubtedly, any person who possesses a
   moderate share of understanding and of candor; will acknowledge that
   all the high-sounding terms of Popish Theology, and all the
   authoritative decisions that make so much noise in their schools, are
   nothing else than "profane kenophoniai," (empty words,) and that it is
   impossible to find more accurate terms for describing them than those
   which the Apostle has employed. And certainly it is a most righteous
   punishment of human arrogance, that they who swerve from the purity of
   Scripture become profane. The doctors of the Church, therefore, cannot
   be too earnestly attentive to guard against such corruptions, and to
   defend the youth from them.

   The old translation, adopting the reading of kainophonias instead of
   kenophonias, rendered it novelties of words; and it is evident from the
   commentaries of the ancients, that this rendering, which is even now
   found in some Greek copies, was at one time extensively approved; but
   the former, which I have followed, is far better.

   And contradictions of science falsely so called This also is highly
   exact and elegant; for so swollen are the subtleties on which men
   desirous of glory plume themselves, that they overwhelm the real
   doctrine of the gospel, which is simple and unpretending. That pomp,
   therefore, which courts display, and which is received with applause by
   the world, is called by the Apostle "contradictions." Ambition, indeed,
   is always contentious, and is the mother of disputes; and hence it
   arises that they who are desirous to display themselves are always
   ready to enter into the arena of debate on any subject. But Paul had
   this principally in view, that the empty doctrine of the sophists,
   rising aloft into airy speculations and subtleties, not only obscures
   by its pretensions the simplicity of true doctrine, but also oppresses
   and renders it contemptible, as the world is usually carried away by
   outward show.

   Paul does not mean that Timothy should be moved by emulation to attempt
   something of the same kind, but, because those things which have an
   appearance of subtlety, or are adapted to ostentation, are more
   agreeable to human curiosity, Paul, on the contrary, pronounces that
   "science" which exalts itself above the plain and humble doctrine of
   godliness -- to be falsely called and thought a science. This ought to
   be carefully observed, that we may learn boldly to laugh at and despise
   all that hypocritical wisdom which strikes the world with admiration
   and amazement, although there is no edification in it; for, according
   to Paul, no science is truly and justly so called but that which
   instruct us in the confidence and fear of God; that is, in godliness.

   21 Which some professing, have erred concerning the faith. From the
   result, also, he demonstrates how dangerous a thing it is, and how much
   it ought to be avoided. The way in which God punishes the haughtiness
   of those who, through the desire of obtaining reputation, corrupt and
   disfigure the doctrine of godliness, is, that he allows them to fall
   away from soundness of understanding, so that they involve themselves
   in many absurd errors. We see that this has taken place in Popery; for,
   after they began to speculate in profane manner, about the mysteries of
   our religion, there followed innumerable monsters of false opinions.
   Faith is here taken, as in some former passages, for the summary of
   religion and sound doctrine. Warned by such examples, if we abhor
   revolt from "the faith," let us adhere to the pure word of God, and let
   us detest sophistry and all useless subtleties, because they are
   abominable corruptions of religion.

   END OF THE FIRST EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY.

   [133] "It will be useless to say to us, What are the riches of this
   world? We see that there is no certainty of them. What are honors? They
   are but smoke. What is even this life? It is but a dream. There is but
   a turn of the hand, and we become dust and ashes. It will be useless to
   argue with us on these grounds. All this will serve no purpose, till
   God has been presented to our minds, till it has been demonstrated to
   us that we must direct all our affections and confidence to him alone.
   And that is the reason why all the fine remonstrances urged by the
   philosophers had no effect. For they spoke of the frailty of this
   earthly life and the uncertain condition of men. They showed that it
   was vain to think of finding happiness in our possessions, in our
   lordships, or in anything else. They showed that it is delusive to
   think of having anything here below on which we might vaunt ourselves.
   Those great philosophers knew nothing about God, yet being convinced by
   experience, discussed and argued ably on these subjects. But still they
   did no good, because they did not seek the true remedy, to fix the
   hearts of men on God, and to inform them, that it is He alone in whom
   they can find contentment, and till we have come to this, we shall
   always be involved in many perplexities." -- Fr. Ser.

   THE ARGUMENT

   ON

   THE SECOND EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY

   IT cannot be absolutely ascertained from Luke's history at what time
   the former Epistle was written. But I have no doubt that, after that
   time, Paul had personal communication with Timothy; and it is even
   possible (if the generally received opinion be believed) that Paul had
   him for a companion and assistant in many places. Yet it may readily be
   concluded that he was at Ephesus when this Epistle was written to him;
   because, towards the close of the Epistle, (2 Timothy 4:19,) Paul
   "salutes Priscilla, and Aquila, and Onesiphorus," the last of whom was
   an Ephesian, and Luke informs us that the other two remained at Ephesus
   when Paul sailed to Judea, (Acts 18:18,19.)

   The chief point on which it turns is to confirm Timothy, both in the
   faith of the gospel, and in the pure and constant preaching of it. But
   yet these exhortations derive no small weight from the consideration of
   the time when he wrote them. Paul had before his eyes the death which
   he was prepared to endure for the testimony of the gospel. All that we
   read here, therefore, concerning the kingdom of Christ, the hope of
   eternal life, the Christian warfare, confidence in confessing Christ,
   and the certainty of doctrine, ought to be viewed by us as written not
   with ink but with Paul's own blood; for nothing is asserted by him for
   which he does not offer the pledge of his death; and therefore this
   Epistle may be regarded as a solemn subscription and ratification of
   Paul's doctrine.

   It is of importance to remember, however, what we stated in the
   exposition of the former Epistle, that the Apostle did not write it
   merely for the sake of one man, but that he exhibited, under the person
   of one man, a general doctrine, which should afterwards be transmitted
   from one hand to another. And first, having praised the faith of
   Timothy, in which he had been educated from his childhood, he exhorts
   him to persevere faithfully in the doctrine which he had learned, and
   in the office intrusted to him; and, at the same time, lest Timothy
   should be discouraged on account of Paul's imprisonment, or the
   apostasy of others, he boasts of his apostleship and of the reward laid
   up for him. He likewise praises Onesiphorus, in order to encourage
   others by his example; and because the condition of those who serve
   Christ is painful and difficult, he borrows comparisons both from
   husbandmen and from soldiers, the former of whom do not hesitate to
   bestow much labor on the cultivation of the soil before any fruit is
   seen, while the latter lay aside all cares and employments, in order to
   devote themselves entirely to the life of a soldier and to the command
   of their general.

   Next, he gives a brief summary of his gospel, and commands Timothy to
   hand it down to others, and to take care that it shall be transmitted
   to posterity. Having taken occasion from this to mention again his own
   imprisonment, he rises to holy boldness, for the purpose of animating
   others by his noble courage; for he invites us all to contemplate,
   along with him, that crown which awaits him in heaven.

   He bids him also abstain from contentious disputes and vain questions,
   recommending to him, on the contrary, to promote edification; and in
   order to shew more clearly how enormous an evil it is, he relates that
   some have been ruined by it, and particularly mentions two, Hymenaeus
   and Philetus who, having fallen into monstrous absurdity, so as to
   overturn the faith of the resurrection, suffered the horrible
   punishment of their vanity. But because falls of that kind, especially
   of distinguished men and those who enjoyed some reputation are usually
   attended by great scandal, he shews that believers ought not to be
   distressed on account of them, because they who possess the name of
   Christ do not all belong actually to Christ, and because the Church
   must be exposed to the misery of dwelling among wicked and ungodly
   persons in this world. Yet that this may not unduly terrify weak minds,
   he prudently softens it, by saying that the Lord will preserve till the
   end his own, whom he has elected.

   He afterwards returns to exhort Timothy to persevere faithfully in the
   discharge of his ministry; and in order to make him more careful, he
   foretells what dangerous times await the good and the pious, and what
   destructive men shall afterwards arise; but, in opposition to all this,
   he confirms him by the hope of a good and successful result. More
   especially, he recommends to him to be constantly employed in teaching
   sound doctrine, pointing out the proper use of Scripture, that he may
   know that he will find in it everything that is necessary for the solid
   edification of the Church.

   Next, he mentions that his own death is at hand, but he does so in the
   manner of a conqueror hastening to a glorious triumph, which is a clear
   testimony of wonderful confidence. Lastly, after having besought
   Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, he points out the necessity
   arising from his present condition. This is the principal subject in
   the conclusion of the Epistle.

   COMMENTARIES

   ON THE

   SECOND EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY

   CHAPTER 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Timothy 1:1-2

   1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to
   the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,

   1. Paulus apostolus Iesu Christi per voluntatem Dei, secundum
   promissionem vitae, quae est in Christo Iesu,

   2. To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy; and peace, from God
   the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

   2. Timotheo dilecto filio gratia, misericordia, pax a Deo Patre, et
   Christo Iesu Domino nostro.

   1 Paul an Apostle From the very preface we already perceive that Paul
   had not in view Timothy alone; other wise he would not have employed
   such lofty titles in asserting his apostleship; for what purpose would
   it have served to employ these ornaments of language in writing to one
   who was fully convinced of the fact? He, therefore, lays claim to that
   authority over all which belonged to his public character and he does
   this the more diligently, because, being near death, he wishes to
   secure the approbation of the whole course of his ministry, [135] and
   to seal his doctrine which he had labored so hard to teach, that it may
   be held sacred by posterity, and to leave a true portrait of it in
   Timothy.

   Of Jesus Christ by the will of God First, according to his custom, he
   calls himself an "Apostle of Christ." Hence it follows, that he does
   not speak as a private person, and must not be heard slightly, and for
   form's sake, [136] like a man, but as one who is a representative of
   Christ. But because the dignity of the office is too great to belong to
   any man, except by the special gift and election of God, he at the same
   time pronounces a eulogy on his calling, by adding that he was ordained
   by the will of God His apostleship, therefore, having God for its
   author and defender, is beyond all dispute.

   According to the promise of life That his calling may be the more
   certain, he connects it with the promises of eternal life; as if he had
   said, "As from the beginning God promised eternal life in Christ, so
   now he has appointed me to be the minister for proclaiming that
   promise." Thus also he points out the design of his apostleship,
   namely, to bring men to Christ, that in him they may find life.

   Which is in Christ Jesus He speaks with great accuracy, when he
   mentions that "the promise of life" was indeed given, in ancient times,
   to the fathers. (Acts 26:6.) But yet he declares that this life is in
   Christ, in order to inform us that the faith of those who lived under
   the Law must nevertheless have looked towards Christ; and that life,
   which was contained in promises, was, in some respects, suspended, till
   it was exhibited in Christ.

   2 My beloved son By this designation he not only testifies his love of
   Timothy, but procures respect and submission to him; because he wishes
   to be acknowledged in him, as one who may justly be called his son,
   [137] The reason of the appellation is, that he had begotten him in
   Christ; for, although this honor belongs to God alone, yet it is also
   transferred to ministers, whose agency he employs for regenerating us.

   Grace, mercy The word mercy, which he employs here, is commonly left
   out by him in his ordinary salutations. I think that he introduced it,
   when he poured out his feelings with more than ordinary vehemence.
   Moreover, he appears to have inverted the order; for, since "mercy" is
   the cause of "grace," it ought to have come before it in this passage.
   But still it is not unsuitable that it should be put after "grace", in
   order to express more clearly what is the nature of that grace, and
   whence it proceeds; as if he had added, in the form of a declaration,
   that the reason why we are loved by God is, that he is merciful. Yet
   this may also be explained as relating to God's daily benefits, which
   are so many testimonies of his "mercy"; for, whenever he assists us,
   whenever he delivers us from evils, pardons our sins, and bears with
   our weakness, he does so, because he has compassion on us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [135] "Although, in all that Paul has left us in writing, we must
   consider that it is God who speaks to us by the mouth of a mortal man,
   and that all his doctrine ought to be received with such authority and
   reverence as if God visibly appeared from heaven, yet still there is in
   this epistle a special object to be kept in view, that Paul, being in
   prison and perceiving his death to be at hand, wished to ratify his
   faith, as if he had sealed it with his blood. So then, as often as we
   read this epistle, let the condition in which Paul was at that time
   come before our eyes, namely, that he was looking for nothing but to
   die for the testimony of the gospel (which he actually did) as its
   standard-bearer, in order to give us stronger assurance of his
   doctrine, and that will affect us in a more lively manner. Indeed, if
   we read this epistle carefully, we shall find that the Spirit of God
   has expressed himself in it in such a manner, with such majesty and
   power, that we are constrained to be captivated and overwhelmed. For my
   own part, I know that this epistle has been more profitable to me than
   any other book of Scripture, and still is profitable to me every day;
   and if any person shall examine it carefully, there can be no doubt
   that he will experience the same effect. And if we desire to have a
   testimony of the truth of God, which pierces our heart, we may well fix
   on this epistle; for a man must be in a profound sleep, and remarkably
   stupid, if God do not work in his soul, when he hears the doctrine that
   shall be drawn from it."-Fr. Ser.

   [136] "Oui par acquit."

     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Timothy 1:3-5

   3. I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience,
   that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and
   day;

   3. Gratias ago Deo, quem colo a progenitoribus in conscientia, ut
   assiduam tui mentionem facio in pecibus meis die et noctu,

   4. Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may
   be filled with joy;

   4. Desiderans to videre, memor tuarum lacrymarum, ut gaudio implear,

   5. When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee,
   which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I
   am persuaded that in thee also.

   5. Memoria repetens eam, quae in to est, sinceram fidem, quae et
   habitavit primum in avia tua Loide, et in matre tua Eunice; persuasum
   habeo quòd etiam in to.

   3 I give thanks The meaning usually assigned to these words is, that
   Paul "gives thanks to God," and next assigns the cause or ground of
   thanksgiving; namely, that he is unceasingly mindful of Timothy. But
   let my readers consider whether the following sense do not suit equally
   well and even better: "Whenever I remember thee in my prayers, (and I
   do so continually,) I also give thanks concerning thee;" for the
   particle hos most frequently has that meaning; [138] and, indeed, any
   meaning that can be drawn from a different translation is exceedingly
   meager. According to this exposition, prayer will be a sign of
   carefulness, and thanksgiving a sign of joy; that is, he never thought
   of Timothy without calling to remembrance the eminent virtues with
   which he was adorned. Hence arises ground of thanksgiving; for the
   recollection of the gifts of God is always pleasant and delightful to
   believers. Both are proofs of real friendship. He calls the mention of
   him (adialeipton) unceasing, because he never forgets him when he
   prays.

   Whom I worship from my ancestors This declaration he made in opposition
   to those well-known calumnies with which the Jews everywhere loaded
   him, as if he had forsaken the religion of his country, and apostatized
   from the law of Moses. On the contrary, he declares that he worships
   God, concerning whom he had been taught by his ancestors, that is, the
   God of Abraham, who revealed himself to the Jews, who delivered his law
   by the hand of Moses; and not some pretended God, whom he had lately
   made for himself.

   But here it may be asked, "Since Paul glories in following the religion
   handed down from his ancestors, is this a sufficiently solid
   foundation? For hence it follows, that this will be a plausible
   presence for excusing all superstitions, and that it will be a crime,
   if any one depart, in the smallest degree, from the institutions of his
   ancestors, whatever these are." The answer is easy. He does not here
   lay down a fixed rule, that every person who follows the religion that
   he received from his fathers is believed to worship God aright, and, on
   the other hand, that he who departs from the custom of his ancestors is
   at all to blame for it. For this circumstance must always be taken into
   account, that Paul was not descended from idolaters, but from the
   children of Abraham, who worshipped the true God. We know what Christ
   says, in disapproving of all the false worship of the Gentiles, that
   the Jews alone maintained the true method of worship. Paul, therefore,
   does not rest solely on the authority of the fathers, nor does he speak
   indiscriminately of all his ancestors; but he removes that false
   opinion, with which he knew that he was unjustly loaded, that he had
   forsaken the God of Israel, and framed for himself a strange god.

   In a pure conscience It is certain that Paul's conscience was not
   always pure; for he acknowledges that he was deceived by hypocrisy,
   while he gave loose reins to sinful desire. [139] (Romans 7:8.) The
   excuse which Chrysostom offers for what Paul did while he was a
   Pharisee, on the ground that he opposed the gospel, not through malice,
   but through ignorance, is not a satisfactory reply to the objection;
   for "a pure conscience" is no ordinary commendation, and cannot be
   separated from the sincere and hearty fear of God. I, therefore, limit
   it to the present time, in this manner, that he worships the same God
   as was worshipped by his ancestors, but that now he worships him with
   pure affection of the heart, since the time when he was enlightened by
   the gospel.

   This statement has the same object with the numerous protestations of
   the apostles, as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles:

   "I serve the God of my fathers, believing all things that are written
   in the law and in the prophets." (Acts 24:14.)

   Again,

   "And now I stand to be judged concerning the hope of the promise which
   was made to our fathers, to which hope our twelve tribes hope to come."
   (Acts 26:6.)

   Again,

   "On account of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain." (Acts
   28:20.)

   In my prayers night and day Hence we see how great was his constancy in
   prayer; and yet he affirms nothing about himself but what Christ
   recommends to all his followers. We ought, therefore, to be moved and
   inflamed by such examples to imitate them, so far, at least, that an
   exercise so necessary may be more frequent among us. If any one
   understand this to mean the daily and nightly prayers which Paul was
   wont to offer at stated hours, there will be no impropriety in that
   view; though I give a more simple interpretation, that there was no
   time when he was not employed in prayer.

   5 Calling to remembrance that unfeigned faith Not so much for the
   purpose of applauding as of exhorting Timothy, the Apostle commends
   both his own faith and that of his grandmother and mother; for, when
   one has begun well and valiantly, the progress he has made should
   encourage him to advance, and domestic examples are powerful
   excitements to urge him forward. Accordingly, he sets before him his
   grandmother Lois and his mother Eunice, by whom he had been educated
   from his infancy in such a manner that he might have sucked godliness
   along with his milk. By this godly education, therefore, Timothy is
   admonished not to degenerate from himself and from his ancestors.

   It is uncertain whether, on the one hand, these women were converted to
   Christ, and what Paul here applauds was the commencement of faith, or
   whether, on the other hand, faith is attributed to them apart from
   Christianity. The latter appears to me more probable; for, although at
   that time everything abounded with many superstitions and corruptions,
   yet God had always his own people, whom he did not suffer to be
   corrupted with the multitude, but whom he sanctified and separated to
   himself, that there might always exist among the Jews a pledge of this
   grace, which he had promised to the seed of Abraham. There is,
   therefore, no absurdity in saying that they lived and died in the faith
   of the Mediator, although Christ had not yet been revealed to them. But
   I do not assert anything, and could not assert without rashness.

   And I am persuaded that in thee also This clause confirms me in the
   conjecture which I have just now stated; for, in my opinion, he does
   not here speak of the present faith of Timothy. It would lessen that
   sure confidence of the former eulogium, if he only said that he
   reckoned the faith of Timothy to resemble the faith of his grandmother
   and mother. But I understand the meaning to be, that Timothy, from his
   childhood, while he had not yet obtained a knowledge of the gospel, was
   imbued with the fear of God, and with such faith as proved to be a
   living seed, which afterwards manifested itself.

   2 Timothy 1:6-12

   6. Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of
   God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.

   6. Propterea commonefacio to, ut exsuscites donum Dei, quod in to est,
   per impositionem manuum mearum

   7. For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of
   love, and of a sound mind.

   7. Non enim dedit nobis Deus spiritum timiditatis, sed pontenia et
   dilectionis et sobrietatis.

   8. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of
   me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel
   according to the power of God;

   8. Non ergo to pudeat testimonii Domini nostri, neque mei, qui sum
   vinctus ipsius; sed esto particeps aflictionum Evangelii, secundum
   potentiam Dei,

   9. Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according
   to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was
   given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,

   9. Qui nos servavit ac vocavit vocatione sancta; non secundum opera
   nostra, sed secundum propositum suum et gratiam, quae data fuit nobis
   in Christo Iesu ante tempora saecularia

   10. But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus
   Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality
   to light through the gospel:

   10. Revelata autem nunc fuit per apparitionem Servatoris nostri Iesu
   Christi, qui mortem quidem abolevit, illuminavit autem vitam et
   immortalitatem per Evangelium

   11. Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher
   of the Gentiles.

   11. In quod positus sum ego praeco et apostolus et Doctor Gentium,

   12. For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am
   not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he
   is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.

   12. Quam etiam ob causam haec patior, sed non pudefio; novi enim, cui
   crediderim, et persuasus sum quod potens sit, depositum meum servare in
   diem illum.

   6 For which cause I advise thee The more abundantly that Timothy had
   received the grace of God, the more attentive (the Apostle intimates)
   he ought to be in making progress from day to day. It deserves notice
   that the words "for which cause" introduce this advice as a conclusion
   from what has been already said.

   To stir up the gift of God. This exhortation is highly necessary; for
   it usually happens, and may be said to be natural, that the excellence
   of gifts produces carelessness, which is also accompanied by sloth; and
   Satan continually labors to extinguish all that is of God in us. We
   ought, therefore, on the other hand, to strive to bring to perfection
   everything that is good in us, and to kindle what is languid; for the
   metaphor, which Paul employs, is taken from a fire which was feeble, or
   that was in course of being gradually extinguished, if strength and
   flame were not added, by blowing upon it and by supplying new fuel. Let
   us therefore remember that we ought to apply to use the gifts of God,
   lest, being unemployed and concealed, they gather rust. Let us also
   remember that we should diligently profit by them, lest they be
   extinguished by our slothfulness.

   Which is in thee by the laying on of my hands There can be no doubt
   that Timothy was invited by the general voice of the Church, and was
   not elected by the private wish of Paul alone; but there is no
   absurdity in saying, that Paul ascribes the election to himself
   personally, because he was the chief actor in it. Yet here he speaks of
   ordination, that is, of the solemn act of conferring the office of the
   ministry, and not of election. Besides, it is not perfectly clear
   whether it was the custom, when any minister was to be set apart, that
   all laid their hands on his head, or that one only did so, in the room
   and name of all. I am more inclined to the conjecture, that it was only
   one person who laid on his hands.

   So far as relates to the ceremony, the apostles borrowed it from an
   ancient custom of their nation; or rather, in consequence of its being
   in use, they retained it; for this is a part of that decent and orderly
   procedure which Paul elsewhere recommends. (1 Corinthians 14:40.) Yet
   it may be doubted if that "laying on of hands" which is now mentioned
   refers to ordination; because, at that time, the graces of the Spirit,
   of which he speaks in the 12th chapter of the Epistle to the Romans
   (Romans 12), and in the 13th of the First Epistle to the Corinthians (1
   Corinthians 13), were bestowed on many others who were not appointed to
   be pastors. But, for my own part, I think that it may be easily
   inferred from the former Epistle, that Paul here speaks of the office
   of a pastor, for this passage agrees with that,

   "Do not neglect the grace which was given to thee with the laying on of
   the hands of the eldership." (1 Timothy 4:14.)

   That point being settled, it is asked, "Was grace given by the outward
   sign?" To this question I answer, whenever ministers were ordained,
   they were recommended to God by the prayers of the whole Church, and in
   this manner grace from God was obtained for them by prayer, and was not
   given to them by virtue of the sign, although the sign was not
   uselessly or unprofitably employed, but was a sure pledge of that grace
   which they received from God's own hand. That ceremony was not a
   profane act, invented for the sole purpose of procuring credit in the
   eyes of men, but a lawful consecration before God, which is not
   performed but by the power of the Holy Spirit. Besides, Paul takes the
   sign for the whole matter or the whole transaction; for he declares
   that Timothy was endued with grace, when he was offered to God as a
   minister. Thus in this mode of expression there is a figure of speech,
   in which a part is taken for the whole.

   But we are again met by another question; for if it was only at his
   ordination that Timothy obtained the grace necessary for discharging
   his office, of what nature was the election of a man not yet fit or
   qualified, but hitherto void and destitute of the gift of God? I
   answer, it was not then so given to him that he had it not before; for
   it is certain that he excelled both in doctrine and in other gifts
   before Paul ordained him to the ministry. But there is no inconsistency
   in saying, that, when God wished to make use of his services, and
   accordingly called him, he then fitted and enriched him still more with
   new gifts, or doubled those which he had previously bestowed. It does
   not therefore follow that Timothy had not formerly any gift, but it
   shone forth the more when the duty of teaching was laid upon him.

   7 For God hath not given to us a spirit of cowardice It is a
   confirmation of what he had said immediately before; and thus he
   continues to urge Timothy to display the power of the gifts which he
   had received. He makes use of this argument, that God governs his
   ministers by the Spirit of power, which is the opposite of cowardice.
   Hence it follows, that they ought not to lie down through slothfulness,
   but, sustained by great confidence and cheerfulness, should exhibit and
   display, by visible effects, that power of the Spirit.

   The following passage occurs in the Epistle to the Romans:

   "For we have not received a spirit of bondage, to be again in terror;
   but we have received the spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba,
   Father." (Romans 8:15.)

   That passage is, at first sight, nearly similar to this; but yet the
   context shews that the meaning is different. There he treats of the
   confidence of adoption which all believers have; but here he speaks
   particularly about ministers, and exhorts them, in the person of
   Timothy, to arouse themselves actively to deeds of valor; because God
   does not wish them to perform their office in a cold and lifeless
   manner, but to press forward powerfully, relying on the efficacy of the
   Spirit.

   But of power, and of love, and of soberness Hence we are taught, first,
   that not one of us possesses that firmness and unshaken constancy of
   the Spirit, which is requisite for fulfilling our ministry, until we
   are endued from heaven with a new power. And indeed the obstructions
   are so many and so great, that no courage of man will be able to
   overcome them. It is God, therefore, who endues us with "the spirit of
   power;" for they who, in other respects, give tokens of much strength,
   fall down in a moment, when they are not upheld by the power of the
   Divine Spirit.

   Secondly, we gather from it, that they who have slavish meanness and
   cowardice, so that they do not venture to do anything in defense of the
   truth, when it is necessary, are not governed by that Spirit by whom
   the servants of Christ are guided. Hence it follows, that there are
   very few of those who bear the title of ministers, in the present day,
   who have the mark of sincerity impressed upon them; for, amongst a vast
   number, where do we find one who, relying on the power of the Spirit,
   boldly despises all the loftiness which exalts itself against Christ?
   Do not almost all seek their own interest and their leisure? Do they
   not sink down dumb as soon as any noise breaks out? The consequence is,
   that no majesty of God is seen in their ministry. The word Spirit is
   here employed figuratively, as in many other passages. [140]

   But why did he afterwards add love and soberness? In my opinion, it was
   for the purpose of distinguishing that power of the Spirit from the
   fury and rage of fanatics, who while they rush forward with reckless
   impulse, fiercely boast of having the Spirit of God. For that reason he
   expressly states that this powerful energy is moderated by "soberness
   and love," that is, by a calm desire of edifying. Yet Paul does not
   deny that prophets and teachers were endued with the same Spirit before
   the publication of the gospel; but he declares that this grace ought
   now to be especially powerful and conspicuous under the reign of
   Christ.

   8 Be not ashamed, therefore He said this, because the confession of the
   gospel was accounted infamous; and therefore he forbids that either
   ambition or the fear of disgrace shall prevent or retard him from the
   liberty of preaching the gospel. And he infers this from what has been
   already said; for he who is armed with the power of God will not
   tremble at the noise raised by the world, but will reckon it honorable
   that wicked men mark them with disgrace.

   And justly does he call the gospel the testimony of our Lord; because,
   although he has no need of our assistance, yet he lays upon us this
   duty, that we shall give "testimony" to him for maintaining his glory.
   It is a great and distinguished honor which he confers upon us, and,
   indeed, upon all, (for there is no Christian that ought not to reckon
   himself a witness of Christ,) but chiefly pastors and teachers, as
   Christ said to the apostles, --

   "Ye shall be witnesses to me," (Acts 1:8.)

   Accordingly, the more hateful the doctrine of the gospel is in the
   world, the more earnestly should they labor to confess it openly.

   When he adds, nor of me; by this word he reminds Timothy not to refuse
   to be his companion, as in a cause common to both of them; for, when we
   begin to withdraw from the society of those who, for the name of
   Christ, suffer persecution, what else do we seek than that the gospel
   shall be free from all persecution? Now, though there were not wanting
   many wicked men who thus ridiculed Timothy, -- "Do you not see what has
   befallen your master? Do you not know that the same reward awaits you
   also? Why do you press upon us a doctrine which you see is hissed at by
   the whole world?" -- still he must have been cheered by this
   exhortation, -- "You have no reason to be ashamed of me, in that which
   is not shameful, for I am Christ's prisoner;" that is, "Not for any
   crime or evil deed, but for his name I am kept in prison."

   But be thou a partaker of the afflictions of the gospel He lays down a
   method by which that which he enjoins may be done; that is, if Timothy
   shall prepare himself for enduring the afflictions which are connected
   with the gospel. Whosoever shall revolt at and shrink from the cross
   will always be ashamed of the gospel. Not without good reason,
   therefore, does Paul, while he exhorts to boldness of confession, in
   order that he may not exhort in vain, speak to him also about bearing
   the cross. [141]

   He adds, according to the power of God; because, but for this, and if
   he did not support us, we should immediately sink under the load. And
   this clause contains both admonition and consolation. The admonition
   is, to turn away his eyes from his present weakness, and, relying on
   the assistance of God, to venture and undertake what is beyond his
   strength. The consolation is, that, if we endure anything on account of
   the gospel, God will come forth as our deliverer, that by his power, we
   may obtain the victory.

   9 Who hath saved us From the greatness of the benefit he shews how much
   we owe to God; for the salvation which he has bestowed on us easily
   swallows up all the evils that must be endured in this world. The word
   saved, though it admit of a general signification, is here limited, by
   the context, to denote eternal salvation. So then he means that they
   who, having obtained through Christ not a fading or transitory, but an
   eternal salvation, shall spare their fleeting life or honor rather than
   acknowledge their Redeemer; are excessively ungrateful.

   And hath called us with a holy calling He places the sealing of
   salvation [142] in the calling; for, as the salvation of men was
   completed in the death of Christ, so God, by the gospel, makes us
   partakers of it. In order to place in a stronger light the value of
   this "calling," he pronounces it to be holy. This ought to be carefully
   observed, because, as salvation must not be sought anywhere but in
   Christ; so, on the other hand, he would have died and risen again
   without any practical advantage, unless so far as he calls us to a
   participation of this grace. Thus, after having procured salvation for
   us, this second blessing remains to be bestowed, that, ingrafting us
   into his body, he may communicate his benefits to be enjoyed by us.

   Not according to our works, but according to his purpose and grace He
   describes the source both of our calling and of the whole of our
   salvation. We had not works by which we could anticipate God; but the
   whole depends on his gracious purpose and election; for in the two
   words purpose and grace there is the figure of speech called Hypallage,
   [143] and the latter must have the force of an objection, as if he had
   said, -- "according to his gracious purpose." Although Paul commonly
   employs the word "purpose" to denote the secret decree of God, the
   cause of which is in his own power, yet, for the sake of fuller
   explanation, he chose to add "grace," that he might more clearly
   exclude all reference to works. And the very contrast proclaims loudly
   enough that there is no room for works where the grace of God reigns,
   especially when we are reminded of the election of God, by which he was
   beforehand with us, when we had not yet been born. On this subject I
   have spoken more fully in my exposition of the first chapter of the
   Epistle to the Ephesians; and at present I do nothing more than glance
   briefly at that which I have there treated more at large. [144]

   Which was given to us From the order of time he argues, that, by free
   grace, salvation was given to us which we did not at all deserve; for,
   if God chose us before the creation of the world, he could not have
   regard to works, of which we had none, seeing that we did not then
   exist. As to the cavil of the sophists, that God was moved by the works
   which he foresaw, it does not need a long refutation. What kind of
   works would those have been if God had passed us by, seeing that the
   election itself is the source and beginning of all good works?

   This giving of grace, which he mentions, is nothing else than
   predestination, by which we were adopted to be the sons of God. On this
   subject I wished to remind my readers, because God is frequently said
   actually to "give" his grace to us when we receive the effect of it.
   But here Paul sets before us what God purposed with himself from the
   beginning. He, therefore, gave that which, not induced by any merit, he
   appointed to those who were not yet born, and kept laid up in his
   treasures, until he made known by the fact itself that he purposeth
   nothing in vain.

   Before eternal ages He employs this phrase in the same sense in which
   he elsewhere speaks of the uninterrupted succession of years from the
   foundation of the world. (Titus 1:2.) For that ingenious reasoning
   which Augustine conducts in many passages is totally different from
   Paul's design. The meaning therefore is, -- "Before times began to take
   their course from all past ages." Besides, it is worthy of notice, that
   he places the foundation of salvation in Christ; for, apart from him,
   there is neither adoption nor salvation; as was indeed said in
   expounding the first chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians.

   10 But hath now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus
   Christ Observe how appropriately he connects the faith which we have
   from the gospel within God's secret election, and assigns to each of
   them its own place. God has now called us by the gospel, not because he
   has suddenly taken counsel about our salvation, but because he had so
   determined from all eternity. Christ hath now "appeared" [145] for our
   salvation, not because the power of saving has been recently bestowed
   on him, but because this grace was laid up in him for us before the
   creation of the world. The knowledge of those things is revealed to us
   by faith; and so the Apostle judiciously connects the gospel with the
   most ancient promises of God, that novelty may not render it
   contemptible.

   But it is asked; "Were the fathers under the Law ignorant of this
   grace?" for if it was not revealed but by the coming of Christ, it
   follows that, before that time, it was concealed. I reply, Paul speaks
   of the full exhibition of the thing itself on which depended also the
   faith of the fathers, so that this takes nothing from them. The reason
   why Abel, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, and all believers, obtained the
   same faith with us, was, that they placed their confidence in this
   "appearance." Thus, when he says that "grace hath been revealed to us
   by the appearing of Christ," he does not exclude from communion with
   that grace the fathers who are made partakers with us of this appearing
   by the same faith. Christ (Hebrews 13:8) was yesterday as he is today;
   but he did not manifest himself to us, by his death and resurrection,
   before the time appointed by the Father. To this, as the only pledge
   and accomplishment of our salvation, both our faith and that of the
   fathers look with one accord.

   Who hath indeed destroyed death When he ascribes to the gospel the
   manifestation of life, he does not mean that we must begin with the
   word, leaving out of view the death and resurrection of Christ, (for
   the word, on the contrary, rests on the subject-matter,) but he only
   means that the fruit of this grace comes to men in no other way than by
   the gospel, in accordance with what is said,

   "God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, and hath
   committed to us the ministry of reconciliation."
   (2 Corinthians 5:19.)

   And hath brought to light life and immortality by the gospel It is a
   high and remarkable commendation of the gospel, that it "bringeth life
   to light." To life he adds immortality; as if he had said, "a true and
   immortal life." But, perhaps, it may be thought better, that by life we
   understand regeneration, that is followed by a blessed immortality
   which is also the object of hope. And, indeed, this is our "life," not
   that which we have in common with brute beasts, but that which consists
   in partaking of the image of God. But because in this world

   "it doth not appear" (1 John 3:2)

   what is the nature, or what is the value of that "life," for the sake
   of more full expression he has most properly added, "immortality,"
   which is the revelation of that life which is now concealed.

   11 To which I have been appointed Not without good reason does he so
   highly commend the gospel along with his apostleship. Satan labors,
   beyond all things else, to banish from our hearts, by every possible
   method, the faith of sound doctrine; and as it is not always easy for
   him to do this if he attack us in open war, he steals upon us by secret
   and indirect methods; for, in order to destroy the credibility of
   doctrine, he holds up to suspicion the calling of godly teachers. [146]
   Paul, therefore, having death before his eyes, and knowing well the
   ancient and ordinary snares of Satan, determined to assert not only the
   doctrine of the gospel in general, but his own calling. Both were
   necessary; for, although there be uttered long discourses concerning
   the dignity of the gospel, they will not be of much avail to us, unless
   we understand what is the gospel. Many will agree as to the general
   principle of the undoubted authority of the gospel, who afterwards will
   have nothing certain that they can follow. This is the reason why Paul
   expressly wishes to be acknowledged to be a faithful and lawful
   minister of that life-giving doctrine which he had mentioned.

   A herald, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles For the reasons
   now stated, he adorns himself with various titles for expressing one
   and the same thing. He calls himself a herald, whose duty it is, to
   publish the commands of princes and magistrates. The word apostle is
   here used in its ordinary and restricted meaning. Moreover, because
   there is a natural relation between a teacher and his disciples, he
   takes to himself also this third name, that they who learn from him may
   know that they have a master who has been appointed to them by God. And
   to whom does he declare that he was appointed? To the Gentiles; for the
   main hinge of the controversy was about them, because the Jews denied
   that the promises of life belonged to any others than to the fleshly
   children of Abraham. In order, therefore, that the salvation of the
   Gentiles may not be called in question, he affirms that to them he has
   been especially sent by God.

   12 For which cause also I suffer these things It is well known that the
   rage of the Jews was kindled against Paul, for this reason more than
   any other, that he made the gospel common to the Gentiles. Yet the
   phrase for which cause relates to the whole verse, and therefore must
   not be limited to the last clause about "the Gentiles."

   But I am not ashamed That the prison in which he was bound might not in
   any degree lessen his authority, he contends, on the contrary, by two
   arguments. First, he shows that the cause, far from being disgraceful,
   was even honorable to him; for he was a prisoner, not on account of any
   evil deed, but because he obeyed God who called him. It is an
   inconceivable consolation, when we are able to bring a good conscience
   in opposition to the unjust judgments of men. Secondly, from the hope
   of a prosperous issue he argues that there is nothing disgraceful in
   his imprisonment. He who shall avail himself of this defense will be
   able to overcome any temptations, however great they may be. And when
   he says, that he "is not ashamed," he stimulates others, by his
   example, to have the same courage.

   For I know whom I have believed This is the only place of refuge, to
   which all believers ought to resort, whenever the world reckons them to
   be condemned and ruined men; namely, to reckon it enough that God
   approves of them; for what would be the result, if they depended on
   men? And hence we ought to infer how widely faith differs from opinion;
   because, when Paul says, "I know whom I have believed," he means that
   it is not enough if you believe, unless you have the testimony of God,
   and unless you have full certainty of it. Faith, therefore, neither
   leans on the authority of men, nor rests on God, in such a manner as to
   hesitate, but must be joined with knowledge; otherwise it would not be
   sufficiently strong against the innumerable assaults of Satan. He who
   with Paul enjoys this knowledge, will know, by experience, that, on
   good grounds, our faith is called

   "the victory that overcometh the world," (1 John 5:4)

   and that on good grounds, it was said by Christ,

   "The gates of hell shall not prevail against it."
   (Matthew 16:18.)

   Amidst every storm and tempest, that man will enjoy undisturbed repose,
   who has a settled conviction that God,

   "who cannot lie," (Titus 1:2)

   or deceive, hath spoken, and will undoubtedly perform what he hath
   promised. On the other hand, he who has not this truth sealed on his
   heart, will be continually shaken hither and thither like a reed.

   This passage is highly worthy of attention; because it expresses
   admirably the power of faith, when it shows that, even in desperate
   affairs, we ought to give to God such glory as not to doubt that he
   will be true and faithful; and when it likewise shows that we ought to
   rely on the word as fully as if God had manifested himself to us from
   heaven; for he who has not this conviction understands nothing. Let us
   always remember that Paul does not pursue philosophical speculations in
   the shade, but, having the reality before his eyes, solemnly declares,
   how highly valuable is a confident hope of eternal life.

   And am persuaded that he is able Because the power and greatness of
   dangers often fill us with dismay, or at least tempt our hearts to
   distrust, for this reason we must defend ourselves with this shield,
   that there is sufficient protection in the power of God. In like manner
   Christ, when he bids us cherish confident hope, employs this argument,

   "The Father, who gave you to me, is greater than all,"
   (John 10:29)

   by which he means, that we are out of danger, seeing that the Lord, who
   hath taken us under his protection, is abundantly powerful to put down
   all opposition. True, Satan does not venture to suggest this thought in
   a direct form, that God cannot fulfill, or is prevented from
   fulfilling, what he has promised, (for our senses are shocked by so
   gross a blasphemy against God,) but, by preoccupying our eyes and
   understandings, he takes away from us all sense of the power of God.
   The heart must therefore be well purified, in order that it may not
   only taste that power, but may retain the taste of it amidst
   temptations of every kind.

   Now, whenever Paul speaks of the power of God, understand by it what
   may be called his actual or (energoumenmn) "effectual" power, as he
   calls it elsewhere. (Colossians 1:29) Faith always connects the power
   of God with the word, which it does not imagine to be at a distance,
   but, having inwardly conceived it, possesses and retains it. Thus it is
   said of Abraham:

   "He did not hesitate or dispute, but gave glory to God, being fully
   convinced that what he had promised he was able also to perform,"
   (Romans 4:20,21.)

   What I have intrusted to him Observe that he employs this phrase to
   denote eternal life; for hence we conclude, that our salvation is in
   the hand of God, in the same manner as there are in the hand of a
   depository those things which we deliver to him to keep, relying on his
   fidelity. If our salvation depended on ourselves, [147] to how many
   dangers would it be continually exposed? But now it is well that,
   having been committed to such a guardian, it is out of all danger.

   [141] "He shews, in the first place, that the gospel cannot be without
   afflictions. Not that God does not call all men to unity in the faith,
   and the doctrine of the gospel is the message of reconciliation; but
   yet, on the one hand, there are those who are drawn by the power of his
   Holy Spirit, while unbelievers remain in their hardness; and, on the
   other hand, there is the fire that is kindled, as, when thunders are
   generated in the air, there must be great troubles, so is it when the
   gospel is preached. And now, if the gospel brings afflictions, and if
   our Lord Jesus Christ wishes that what he endured in his person shall
   be fulfilled in his members, and that every day he shall be, as it
   were, crucified, is it lawful for us to withdraw from that condition?
   Since, therefore, all our hope lies in the gospel, and since we ought
   to lean upon it, let us ponder what Paul says, that we must lend
   support to our brethren, when we see that they are assailed, that men
   trample them under their feet, spit in their face, and insult them, let
   us choose to be their companions for enduring the reproaches and base

   2 Timothy 1:13-18

   13. Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in
   faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

   13. Formam habe sanorum sermonum, quos a me audisti in fide et
   caritate, in Christo Iesu.

   14. That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy
   Ghost which dwelleth in us.

   14. Eregium depositum custodi per Spiritum Sanctum, qui inhabitat in
   nobis.

   15. This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away
   from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.

   15. Nosti hoc, quod aversati me fuerint omnes, qui sunt in Asia, quorum
   sunt Phygelus et Hermogenes.

   16. The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft
   refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:

   16. Det misericordiam Dominus Onesiphori familiae; quoniam saepe me
   refocillait, et de catena mea non erubuit:

   17. But when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and
   found me

   17. Sed quum esset Romae, studiosus quaesivit me, et invenit.

   18. The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that
   day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou
   knowest very well.

   18. Det ei Dominus invenire misericordiam a Domino in illa die et
   quanta Ephesi ministravit melius tu nosti.

   13 Hold the form of sound words Some explain it thus: "Let thy doctrine
   be, as it were, a pattern which others may imitate." I do not approve
   of that view. Equally removed from Paul's meaning is Chrysostom's
   exposition, that Timothy should have at hand the image of virtues
   engraven on his heart by Paul's doctrine. I rather think that Paul
   commands Timothy to hold fast the doctrine which he had learned, not
   only as to substance, but as to the very form of expression; for
   hupotuposis -- the word which Paul employs on this occasion -- denotes
   a lively picture of objects, as if they were actually placed before the
   eyes. Paul knew how ready men are to depart or fall off from pure
   doctrine. For this reason he earnestly cautions Timothy not to turn
   aside from that form of teaching which he had received, and to regulate
   his manner of teaching by the rule which had been laid down; not that
   we ought to be very scrupulous about words, but because to misrepresent
   doctrine, even in the smallest degree, is exceedingly injurious. [148]

   Hence we see what kind of theology there is in Popery, which has
   degenerated so far from the pattern which Paul recommends, that it
   resembles the riddles of diviners or soothsayers rather than a doctrine
   taken from the word of God. What taste of Paul's writings, I ask, is
   there in all the books of the schoolmen? This licentiousness in
   corrupting doctrine shews that there are great reasons why Paul invites
   Timothy to hold fast the original and natural form. And he contrasts
   sound words not only with doctrines manifestly wicked, but within
   useless questions, which, instead of health, bring nothing but disease.

   In faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus I am aware that the
   preposition en, agreeably to the idiom of the Hebrew language, v is
   often taken for with; but here, I think, the meaning is different Paul
   has added this as a mark of sound doctrine, in order that we may know
   what it contains, and what is the summary of it, the whole of which,
   according to his custom, he includes under "faith and love." He places
   both of them in Christ; as, indeed, the knowledge of Christ consists
   chiefly of these two parts; for, although the words, which is, are in
   the singular number, agreeing with the word love, yet it must also be
   understood as applying to faith.

   Those who translate it, "with faith and love," make the meaning to be,
   that Timothy should add to sound doctrine the affections of piety and
   love. I do acknowledge that no man can persevere faithfully in sound
   doctrine unless he is endued with true faith and unfeigned love. But
   the former exposition, in my opinion, is more appropriate, namely, that
   Paul employs these terms for describing more fully what is the nature
   of "sound words" and what is the subject of them. Now he says that the
   summary consists in "faith and love" of which the knowledge of Christ
   is the source and beginning.

   14 Keep the excellent thing committed to thee This exhortation is more
   extensive than the preceding. He exhorts Timothy to consider what God
   has given to him, and to bestow care and application in proportion to
   the high value of that which has been committed; for, when the thing is
   of little value, we are not wont to call any one to so strict an
   account.

   By "that which hath been committed," I understand him to mean both the
   honor of the ministry and all the gifts with which Timothy was endued.
   Some limit it to the ministry alone; but I think that it denotes
   chiefly the qualifications for the ministry, that is, all the gifts of
   the Spirit, in which he excelled. The word "committed" is employed also
   for another reason, to remind Timothy that he must, one day, render an
   account; for we ought to administer faithfully what God has committed
   to us.

   To Kalon [149] denotes that which is of high or singular value; and,
   therefore, Erasmus has happily translated it (egregium) "excellent,"
   for the sake of denoting its rare worth. I have followed that version.
   But what is the method of keeping it? It is this. We must beware lest
   we lose by our indolence what God has bestowed upon us, or lest it be
   taken away, because we have been ungrateful or have abused it; for
   there are many who reject the grace of God, and many who, after having
   received it, deprive themselves of it altogether. Yet because the
   difficulty of keeping it is beyond our strength, he therefore adds, --

   By the Holy Spirit As if he had said, "I do ask from thee more than
   thou canst, for what thou hast not from thyself the Spirit of God will
   supply to thee." Hence it follows, that we must not judge of the
   strength of men from the commandments of God; because, as he commands
   by words, so he likewise engraves his words on our hearts, and, by
   communicating strength, causes that his command shall not be in vain.

   Who dwelleth in us [150] By this he means, that the assistance of the
   Holy Spirit is present to believers, provided that they do not reject
   it when it is offered to them.

   15 Thou knowest that all that are in Asia have forsaken me Those
   apostasies which he mentions might have shaken the hearts of many, and
   given rise, at the same time, to many suspicions; as we commonly look
   at everything in the worst light. Paul meets scandals of this kind with
   courage and heroism, that all good men may learn to abhor the treachery
   of those who had thus deserted the servant of Christ, when he alone, at
   the peril of his life, was upholding the common cause; and that they
   may not on that account give way, when they learn that Paul is not left
   destitute of divine assistance.

   Of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes He names two of them, who were
   probably more celebrated than the rest, that he may shut the door
   against their slanders; for it is customary with revolters and
   deserters from the Christian warfare, [151] in order to excuse their
   own baseness, to forge as many accusations as they can against the good
   and faithful ministers of the gospel. "Phygellus and Hermogenes,"
   knowing that their cowardice was justly reckoned infamous by believers,
   and that they were even condemned as guilty of base treachery, would
   not have hesitated to load Paul with false accusations, and impudently
   to attack his innocence. Paul, therefore, in order to take away all
   credit from their lies, brands them with the mark which they deserve.

   Thus also, in the present day, there are many who, because they are not
   here admitted into the ministry, or are stripped of the honor on
   account of their wickedness, [152] or because we do not choose to
   support them while they do nothing, or because they have committed
   theft or fornication, are compelled to fly, and forthwith wander
   through France and other countries, and, by throwing upon us all the
   accusations [153] that they can, borrow from them an attestation of
   their innocence. And some brethren are so silly as to accuse us of
   cruelty, if any of us paints such persons in their true colors. But it
   were to be wished that all of them had their forehead marked with a hot
   iron, that they might be recognized at first sight.

   16 May the Lord grant mercy From this prayer we infer, that the good
   offices done to the saints are not thrown away, even though they cannot
   recompense them; for, when he prays to God to reward them, this carries
   in it the force of a promise. At the same time, Paul testifies his
   gratitude, by desiring that God will grant the remuneration, because he
   is unable to pay. What if he had possessed abundant means of
   remuneration? Undoubtedly he would have manifested that he was not
   ungrateful.

   To the family of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me It is worthy of
   attention, that although he praises the kindness of Onesiphorus alone,
   yet, on his account, he prays for mercy to the whole family Hence we
   infer, that "the blessing of God rests, not only on the head of the
   righteous man," but on all his house. So great is the love of God
   toward his people, that it diffuses itself over all who are connected
   with them.

   And was not ashamed of my chain This is a proof, not only of his
   liberality, but likewise of his zeal; seeing that he cheerfully exposed
   himself to danger and to the reproach of men, in order to assist Paul.

   18 May the Lord grant to him Some explain it thus: -- "May God grant to
   him that he may find mercy with Christ the Judge." And, indeed, this is
   somewhat more tolerable than to interpret that passage in the writings
   of Moses:

   "The Lord rained fire from the Lord," (Genesis 19:24,)

   as meaning, -- "The Father rained from the Son." [154] Yet it is
   possible that strong feeling may have prompted Paul, as often happens,
   to make a superfluous repetition.

   That he may find mercy with the Lord on that day [155] This prayer
   shews us how much richer a recompense awaits those who, without the
   expectation of an earthly reward, perform kind offices to the saints,
   than if they received it immediately from the hand of men. And what
   does he pray for? "That he may find mercy;" for he who hath been
   merciful to his neighbors will receive such mercy from God to himself.
   And if this promise does not powerfully animate and encourage us to the
   exercise of kindness, we are worse than stupid. Hence it follows, also,
   that when God rewards us, it is not on account of our merits or of any
   excellence that is in us; but that the best and most valuable reward
   which he bestows upon us is, when he pardons us, and shews himself to
   be, not a stern judge, but a kind and indulgent Father.

   [148] "He was not barely to assert the words of Scripture, but he was
   to hold fast the summary, or system of the truths he had heard from his
   spiritual father, and, in a way of dependence on Christ, to show his
   fidelity and love to his Redeemer. This system of doctrine he was to
   keep, as a pledge committed to his trust, by the help of the Holy
   Spirit. Ministers are to hold fast every truth, but, above all, those
   particular truths which are the peculiar butt of the devil's
   opposition, and meet with rough treatment in the times in which they
   live; so doing, they comply with the command which their exalted Master
   laid upon the pastor of the Church at Philadelphia, and then they may

   that he will not keep us in certain possession of the benefits which we
   have received from his hand? True, the devil will labor to deprive us
   of it, but, as our souls will not be a prey to him, because our Lord
   Jesus Christ has taken them under his protection, having been committed
   to him by God the Father; so nothing that God has appointed for our
   salvation will be a prey to Satan. And why? Because we have the Spirit
   to defend us against all his efforts. And where is that Spirit? We must
   not go to seek him above the clouds. It is true that he fills the whole
   earth, and that his majesty dwells above the heavens; but if we feel
   that he dwells in us, since he has been pleased to exercise his power
   on such poor creatures as we are, let us know that that power will be
   sufficient for defending us against the assaults of Satan; that is,
   provided that we, on our part, are not negligent. For we must not
   flatter ourselves in our sins, so as to be careless, but must pray to
   God, committing everything to him, and hoping that he will always
   strengthen us more and more. And because he has begun to make us
   ministers of his grace, let us know that he will continue, and in such
   a way that our salvation and that of our neighbor's shall always be
   carried forward more and more to his glory."-Fr. Ser.

   affected by it; for we see that Paul was, as it were, transported, when
   he spoke of that coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the final
   resurrection. He does not say, "May the Lord grant that he may find
   favor at his coming, on the day of our redemption, when he shall appear
   again to judge the world!" But he says, "On that day;" as if he
   presented the Lord Jesus visibly, with his angels. Paul did not speak
   those things coldly, or like a man, but he rose above all men, that he
   might be able to exclaim, "That day, that day!" And where is it? True,
   none of those who wish to be wise in themselves will take any pains to
   find it; for that saying must be fulfilled, -- "Eye hath not seen, ears

   power, not for his own sake, but to gather together all his members,

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Timothy 2:1-7

   1. Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ
   Jesus.

   1. Tu ergo, fili mi, fortis esto in gratia, quae est in Christo Iesu.

   2. And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the
   same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others
   also.

   2. Et quae a me audisti per multos testes, haec commenda fidelibus
   hominibus, qui idonei erunt ad alios etiam docendos.

   3. Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

   3. Tu igitur feras afflictions, ut bonus miles Iesu Christi.

   4. No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this
   life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

   4. Nemo, qui militat, implicator vitae negotiis, ut imperatori placeat.

   5. And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned,
   except he strive lawfully.

   5. Quodsi quis etiam certaverit, non coronatur, nisi legitime
   certaverit.

   6. The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.

   6. Laborare prius agricolam oportet, quam fructus percipiat.

   7. Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all
   things.

   7. Intellege quae dico; det enim tibi Dominus intellectum in omnibus.

   1 Be strong in the grace As he had formerly commanded him to keep, by
   the Spirit, that which was committed to him, so now he likewise enjoins
   him "to be strengthened in grace." By this expression he intends to
   shake off sloth and indifference; for the flesh is so sluggish, that
   even those who are endued with eminent gifts are found to slacken in
   the midst of their course, if they be not frequently aroused.

   Some will say: "Of what use is it to exhort a man to be strong in
   grace,' unless free-will have something to do in cooperation?" I reply,
   what God demands from us by his word he likewise bestows by his Spirit,
   so that we are strengthened in the grace which he has given to us. And
   yet the exhortations are not superfluous, because the Spirit of God,
   teaching us inwardly, causes that they shall not sound in our ears
   fruitlessly and to no purpose. Whoever, therefore, shall acknowledge
   that the present exhortation could not have been fruitful without the
   secret power of the Spirit, will never support free-will by means of
   it.

   Which is in Christ Jesus. This is added for two reasons; to shew that
   the grace comes from Christ alone, and from no other, and that no
   Christian will be destitute of it; for, since there is one Christ
   common to all, it follows that all are partakers of his grace, which is
   said to be in Christ, because all who belong to Christ must have it.

   My son. This kind appellation, which he employs, tends much to gain the
   affections, that the doctrine may more effectually obtain admission
   into the heart.

   2 And which thou hast heard from me. He again shews how earnestly
   desirous he is to transmit sound doctrine to posterity; and he exhorts
   Timothy, not only to preserve its shape and features, (as he formerly
   did,) but likewise to hand it down to godly teachers, that, being
   widely spread, it may take root in the hearts of many; for he saw that
   it would quickly perish if it were not soon scattered by the ministry
   of many persons. And, indeed, we see what Satan did, not long after the
   death of the Apostles; for, just as if preaching had been buried for
   some centuries, he brought in innumerable reveries, which, by their
   monstrous absurdity, surpassed the superstitions of all the heathens.
   We need not wonder, therefore, if Paul, in order to guard against an
   evil of such a nature and of such magnitude, earnestly desires that his
   doctrines shall be committed to all godly ministers, who shall be
   qualified to teach it. As if he had said, -- "See that after my death
   there may remain a sure attestation of my doctrine; and this will be,
   if thou not only teach faithfully what thou hast learned from me, but
   take care that it be more widely published by others; therefore,
   whomsoever thou shalt see fitted for that work, commit to their trust
   this treasure."

   Commit to believing men He calls them believing men, not on account of
   their faith, which is common to all Christians, but on account of their
   pre-eminence, as possessing a large measure of faith. We might even
   translate it "faithful men;" [156] for there are few who sincerely
   labor to preserve and perpetuate the remembrance of the doctrine
   intrusted to them. Some are impelled by ambition, and that of various
   kinds, some by covetousness, some by malice, and others are kept back
   by the fear of dangers; and therefore extraordinary faithfulness is
   here demanded.

   By many witnesses [157] He does not mean that he produced witnesses in
   a formal and direct manner [158] in the case of Timothy; but, because
   some might raise a controversy whether that which Timothy taught had
   proceeded from Paul, or had been forged by himself, he removes all
   doubt by this argument, that he did not speak secretly in a corner, but
   that there were many alive who could testify that Timothy spoke nothing
   which they had not formerly heard from the mouth of Paul. The doctrine
   of Timothy would therefore be beyond suspicion, seeing that they had
   many fellow-disciples, who could bear testimony to it. Hence we learn
   how greatly a servant of Christ should labor to maintain and defend the
   purity of doctrine, and not only while he lives, but as long as his
   care and labor can extend it.

   3 Do thou therefore endure afflictions Not without strong necessity has
   he added this second exhortation; for they who offer their obedience to
   Christ must be prepared for "enduring afflictions;" and thus, without
   patient endurance of evils, there will never be perseverance. And
   accordingly he adds, "as becomes a good soldier of Jesus Christ." By
   this term he means that all who serve Christ are warriors, and that
   their condition as warriors consists, not in inflicting evils, but
   rather in patience.

   These are matters on which it is highly necessary for us to meditate.
   We see how many there are every day, that throw away their spears, who
   formerly made a great show of valor. Whence does this arise? Because
   they cannot become inured to the cross. First, they are so effeminate
   that they shrink from warfare. Next, they do not know any other way of
   fighting than to contend haughtily and fiercely with their adversaries;
   and they cannot bear to learn what it is to

   "possess their souls in patience." (Luke 21:19)

   4 No man who warreth He continues to make use of the metaphor which he
   had borrowed from warfare. Yet, strictly speaking, he formerly called
   Timothy "a soldier of Christ" metaphorically; but now he compares
   profane warfare with spiritual and Christian warfare in this sense.
   "The condition of military discipline is such, that as soon as a
   soldier has enrolled himself under a general, he leaves his house and
   all his affairs, and thinks of nothing but war; and in like manner, in
   order that we may be wholly devoted to Christ, we must be free from all
   the entanglements of this world."

   With the affairs of life By "the affairs of life", [159] he means the
   care of governing his family, and ordinary occupations; as farmers
   leave their agriculture, and merchants their ships and merchandise,
   till they have completed the time that they agreed to serve in war. We
   must now apply the comparison to the present subject, that every one
   who wishes to fight under Christ must relinquish all the hindrances and
   employments of the world, and devote himself unreservedly to the
   warfare. In short, let us remember the old proverb, Hoc age, [160]
   which means, that in the worship of God, we ought to give such
   earnestness of attention that nothing else should occupy our thoughts
   and feelings. The old translation has, "No man that fights for God,"
   etc. But this utterly destroys Paul's meaning.

   Here Paul speaks to the pastors of the Church in the person of Timothy.
   The statement is general, but is specially adapted to the ministers of
   the word. First, let them see what things are inconsistent within their
   office, that, freed from those things, they may follow Christ. Next,
   let them see, each for himself, what it is that draws them away from
   Christ; that this heavenly General may not have less authority over us
   than that which a mortal man claims for himself over heathen soldiers
   who have enrolled under him.

   5 And if any one strive He now speaks of perseverance, that no man may
   think that he has done enough when he has been engaged in one or two
   conflicts. He borrows a comparison from wrestlers, not one of whom
   obtains the prize till he has been victorious in the end. Thus he says:

   "In a race all run, but one obtaineth the prize;
   run so that ye may obtain." (1 Corinthians 9:24.)

   If any man, therefore, wearied with the conflict, immediately withdraw
   from the arena to enjoy repose, he will be condemned for indolence
   instead of being crowned. Thus, because Christ wishes us to strive
   during our whole life, he who gives way in the middle of the course
   deprives himself of honor, even though he may have begun valiantly. To
   strive lawfully is to pursue the contest in such a manner and to such
   an extent as the law requires, that none may leave off before the time
   appointed.

   6 The husbandman must labor before he receive the fruits I am well
   aware that others render this passage differently; and I acknowledge
   that they translate, word for word, what Paul has written in Greek; but
   he who shall carefully examine the context will assent to my view.
   [161] Besides, the use of (kopionta) to labor instead of (kopian) to
   labor, is a well-known Greek idiom; for Greek writers often make use of
   the participle in place of the infinitive. [162]

   The meaning therefore, is, that husbandmen do not gather the fruit,
   till they have first toiled hard in the cultivation of the soil, by
   sowing and by other labors. And if husbandmen do not spare their toils,
   that one day they may obtain fruit, and if they patiently wait for the
   season of harvest; how much more unreasonable will it be for us to
   refuse the labors which Christ enjoins upon us, while he holds out so
   great a reward?

   7 Understand what I say [163] He added this, not on account of the
   obscurity of the comparisons which he has set forth, but that Timothy
   himself might ponder, how much more excellent is the warfare under the
   direction of Christ, and how much more abundant the reward; for, when
   we have studied it incessantly, we scarcely arrive at a full knowledge
   of it.

   The Lord give thee understanding in all things The prayer, which now
   follows, is added by way of correction. Because our minds do not easily
   rise to that "incorruptible crown" (1 Corinthians 9:25) of the life to
   come, [164] Paul betakes himself to God, to "give understanding" to
   Timothy. And hence we infer, that not less are we taught in vain, if
   the Lord do not open our understandings, than the commandments would be
   given in vain, if he did not impart strength to perform them. For who
   could have taught better than Paul? And yet, in order that he may teach
   with any advantage, he prays that God may train his disciple.

   2 Timothy 2:8-13

   8. Remember that Jesus Christ the seed of David was raised from the
   dead according to my gospel:

   8. Memonto Iesum Christum excitatum a mortuis, ex semine David,
   secundum evangelium meum,

   9. Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the
   word of God is not bound.

   9. In quo laboro usque ad vincula, tanquam maleficus; sed sermo Dei non
   est vinctus.

   10. Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may
   also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

   10. Quamobrem omnia tolero propter electos, ut ipsi quoque salutem
   consequantur, quae est in Christo Iesu, cum gloria aeterna.

   11 It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also
   live with him:

   11. Fidelis sermo: si enim commortui sumus, etiam simul cum ipso
   vivemus:

   12. If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also
   will deny us:

   12. Si sufferimus, etiam simul regnabimus; si negamus, ille quoque
   negabit nos:

   13 If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.

   13. Si increduli sumus, ille fidelis manet; negare se ipsum non potest.

   8 Remember that Jesus Christ, being raised from the dead. He expressly
   mentions some part of his doctrine, which he wished to go down to
   posterity, entire and uncorrupted. It is probable that he glances
   chiefly at that part about which he was most afraid; as will also
   appear clearly from what follows, when he comes to speak about the
   error of "Hymenaeus and Philetus," (2 Timothy 2:17;) for they denied
   the resurrection, of which we have a sure pledge in this confession,
   when they falsely said that it was already past.

   How necessary this admonition of Paul was, the ancient histories shew;
   for Satan put forth all his strength, in order to destroy this article
   of our faith. There being two parts of it, that Christ was born "of the
   seed of David," and that he rose from the dead; immediately after the
   time of the Apostles, arose Marcion, who labored to destroy the truth
   of the human nature in Christ; and afterwards he was followed by the
   Manichaeans; and even, in the present day, this plague is still
   spreading.

   So far as relates to the resurrection, how many have been employed, and
   with what diversified schemes, in laboring to overthrow the hope of it!
   This attestation, therefore, means as much as if Paul had said, "Let no
   one corrupt or falsify my gospel by slanders; I have thus taught, I
   have thus preached, that Christ, who was born a man of the seed of
   David, rose from the dead."

   According to my gospel He calls it "his gospel," not that he professes
   to be the author but the minister of it. Now, in the resurrection of
   Christ we all have a sure pledge of our own resurrection. Accordingly,
   he who acknowledges that Christ has risen affirms that the same thing
   will take place with us also; for Christ did not rise for himself, but
   for us. The head must not be separated from his members. Besides, in
   the resurrection of Christ is contained the fulfillment of our
   redemption and salvation; for it is added, from the dead. Thus Christ,
   who was dead, arose. Why? and for what purpose? Here we must come to
   ourselves, and here too is manifested the power and fruit of both,
   namely, of his resurrection and of his death; for we must always hold
   by this principle, that Scripture is not wont to speak of these things
   coldly, and as matters of history, but makes indirect reference to the
   fruit.

   Of the seed of David This clause not only asserts the reality of human
   nature in Christ, but also claims for him the honor and name of the
   Messiah. Heretics deny that Christ was a real man, others imagine that
   his human nature descended from heaven, and others think that there was
   in him nothing more than the appearance of a man. [165] Paul exclaims,
   on the contrary, that he was "of the seed of David;" by which he
   undoubtedly declares that he was a real man, the son of a human being,
   that is, of Mary. This testimony is so express, that the more heretics
   labor to get rid of it, the more do they discover their own impudence.
   The Jews and other enemies of Christ deny that he is the person who was
   formerly promised; but Paul affirms that he is the son of David, and
   that he is descended from that family from which the Messiah ought to
   descend. [166]

   9 In which I am a sufferer This is an anticipation, for his
   imprisonment lessened the credit due to his gospel in the eyes of
   ignorant people. He, therefore, acknowledges that, as to outward
   appearance, he was imprisoned like a criminal; but adds, that his
   imprisonment did not hinder the gospel from having free course; and not
   only so, but that what he suffers is advantageous to the elect, because
   it tends to confirm them. Such is the unshaken courage of the martyrs
   of Christ, when the consciousness of being engaged in a good cause
   lifts them up above the world; so that, from a lofty position, they
   look down with contempt, not only on bodily pains and agonies, but on
   every kind of disgrace.

   Moreover, all godly persons ought to strengthen themselves with this
   consideration, when they see the ministers of the gospel attacked and
   outraged by adversaries, that they may not, on that account, cherish
   less reverence for doctrine, but may give glory to God, by whose power
   they see it burst through all the hindrances of the world. And, indeed,
   if we were not excessively devoted to the flesh, this consolation alone
   must have been sufficient for us in the midst of persecutions, that, if
   we are oppressed by the cruelty of the wicked, the gospel is
   nevertheless extended and more widely diffused; for, whatever they may
   attempt, so far are they from obscuring or extinguishing the light of
   the gospel, that it burns the more brightly. Let us therefore bear
   cheerfully, or at least patiently, to have both our body and our
   reputation shut up in prison, provided that the truth of God breaks
   through those fetters, and is spread far and wide.

   10 Wherefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect From the
   elect he shews, that his imprisonment is so far from being a ground of
   reproach, that it is highly profitable to the elect. When he says that
   he endures for the sake of the elect, [167] this demonstrates how much
   more he cares for the edification of the Church than for himself; for
   he is prepared, not only to die, but even to be reckoned in the number
   of wicked men, that he may promote the salvation of the Church.

   In this passage Paul teaches the same doctrine as in Colossians 1:24,
   where he says, that he

   "fills up what is wanting in the sufferings of Christ, for his body,
   which is the Church."

   Hence the impudence of the Papists is abundantly refuted, who infer
   from these words that the death of Paul was a satisfaction for our
   sins; as if he claimed anything else for his death, than that it would
   confirm the faith of the godly, for he immediately adds an exposition,
   by affirming that the salvation of believers is found in Christ alone.
   But if any of my readers wishes to see a more extended illustration of
   this subject, let him consult my Commentary on the chapter which I have
   just now quoted -- the first of the Epistle to the Colossians.

   With eternal glory This is the end of the salvation which we obtain in
   Christ; for our salvation is to live to God, which salvation begins
   with our regeneration, and is completed by our perfect deliverance,
   when God takes us away from the miseries of this mortal life, and
   gathers us into his kingdom. To this salvation is added the
   participation of heavenly, that is, divine glory; and, therefore, in
   order to magnify the grace of Christ, he gave to salvation the name of
   "eternal glory."

   11 A faithful saying He makes a preface to the sentiment which he is
   about to utter; because nothing is more opposite to the feeling of the
   flesh, than that we must die in order to live, and that death is the
   entrance into life; for we may gather from other passages, that Paul
   was wont to make use of a preface of this sort, in matters of great
   importance, or hard to be believed.

   If we die with him, we shall also live with him The general meaning is,
   that we shall not be partakers of the life and glory of Christ, unless
   we have previously died and been humbled with him; as he says, that all
   the elect were

   "predestinated that they might be conformed to his image." (Romans
   8:29.)

   This is said both for exhorting and comforting believers. Who is not
   excited by this exhortation, that we ought not to be distressed on
   account of our afflictions, which shall have so happy a result? The
   same consideration abates and sweetens all that is bitter in the cross;
   because neither pains, nor tortures, nor reproaches, nor death ought to
   be received by us with horror, since in these we share with Christ;
   more especially seeing that all these things are the forerunners of a
   triumph.

   By his example, therefore, Paul encourages all believers to receive
   joyfully, for the name of Christ, those afflictions in which they
   already have a taste of future glory. If this shocks our belief, and if
   the cross itself so overpowers and dazzles our eyes, that we do not
   perceive Christ in them, let us remember to present this shield, "It is
   a faithful saying." And, indeed, where Christ is present, we must
   acknowledge that life and happiness are there. We ought, therefore, to
   believe firmly, and to impress deeply on our hearts, this fellowship,
   that we do not die apart, but along with Christ, in order that we may
   afterwards have life in common with him; that we suffer with him, in
   order that we may be partakers of his glory. By death he means all that
   outward mortification of which he speaks in 2 Corinthians 4:10. [168]

   12 If we deny him, he will also deny us A threatening is likewise
   added, for the purpose of shaking off sloth; for he threatens that they
   who, through the dread of persecution, leave off the confession of his
   name, have no part or lot with Christ. How unreasonable is it, that we
   should esteem more highly the transitory life of this world than the
   holy and sacred name of the Son of God! And why should he reckon among
   his people those who treacherously reject him? Here the excuse of
   weakness is of no value; [169] for, if men did not willingly deceive
   themselves with vain flatteries, they would constantly resist, being
   endued with the spirit of strength and courage. Their base denial of
   Christ proceeds not only from weakness, but from unbelief; because it
   is in consequence of being blinded by the allurement of the world, that
   they do not at all perceive the life which is in the kingdom of God.
   But this doctrine has more need of being meditated on than of being
   explained; for the words of Christ are perfectly clear,

   "Whoever shall deny me, him will I also deny" (Matthew 10:33.)

   It remains that every one consider with himself, that this is no
   childish terror, but the judge seriously pronounces what will be found,
   at the appointed time, to be true.

   13 If we are unbelieving, he remaineth faithful The meaning is, that
   our base desertion takes nothing from the Son of God or from his glory;
   because, having everything in himself, he stands in no need of our
   confession. As if he had said, "Let them desert Christ who will, yet
   they take nothing from him; for when they perish, he remaineth
   unchanged."

   He cannot deny himself This is a still stronger expression. "Christ is
   not like us, to swerve from his truth." Hence it is evident, that all
   who deny Christ are disowned by him. And thus he drives away from
   wicked apostates the flatteries with which they soothe themselves;
   because, being in the habit of changing their hue, according to
   circumstances, they would willingly imagine that Christ, in like
   manner, assumes various forms, and is liable to change; which Paul
   affirms to be impossible. Yet, at the same time, we must firmly believe
   what I stated briefly on a former passage, that our faith is founded on
   the eternal and unchangeable truth of Christ, in order that it may not
   waver through the unsteadfastness or apostasy of men.

   [165] "Que seulement il y avoit en luy une apparence d'homme, et non
   pas une vraye nature humaine." -- "That there was in him only an
   appearance of man, and not a real human nature."

   [166] "If we wish to be victorious over all the temptations of Satan,
   we must have great steadfastness, and must know that it is not at
   random that we believe in Jesus Christ, that this is not a doubtful
   matter, but that he came to us from God to be our Redeemer. And for
   this reason Paul here points out that he is of the lineage of David,
   and of his seed, for we know the promises that are contained in the
   Holy Scriptures, namely, that the whole world should be blessed in the
   seed of Abraham. Now, God confirmed this to David, by shewing that from
   him the Redeemer should proceed, that is, from the tribe of Judah, and
   from the house of David. Thus, the reason why Paul claims for him this
   title is, that, having the promises which God had formerly made to the
   fathers, concerning that Redeemer who hath been given to us, we may not
   doubt that we ought to receive him with full conviction, and have no
   reason to doubt whether he is, or is not, the Messiah. Why? He is
   descended from the house of David; and, although at that time, it had
   no royal dignity, yet that defect could not lessen the glory of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, but, on the contrary, was fitted to confirm more
   fully our belief that it was he who should be sent. And why? The
   Prophet Isaiah did not say that he would be born in a palace, or that
   he would be brought up in great splendor; but he said, that he would
   grow as a small twig (Isaiah 11:1) from the root of Jesse; as if he had
   said, that, although Jesus Christ was of royal lineage, nevertheless
   his parents were poor, and were held of no account in worldly matters,
   having no rank or grandeur." -- Fr. Ser.

   [167] "It might be replied, that it is superfluous that Paul should
   endure for the elect.' Cannot God save those whom he elected and
   adopted before the creation of the world, without the assistance of
   men? Has the immutable decree of God any need of human help, or of
   creatures? Why then does Paul say that he endures on account of the
   elect?' Now, it us true that God will conduct his people to the
   inheritance which is prepared for them but yet he is pleased to make
   use of the labor of men. Not that he is under a necessity of borrowing
   anything from us, but he confers on us this honor by his undeserved
   goodness, and wishes that we should be instruments of his power. Thus
   Paul does not boast that the salvation of the children of God depends
   on his steadfastness or on the afflictions which he had to endure; but
   he only means that God wishes to conduct his people by means of the
   word, and that he employs men whom he has chosen for that purpose, as
   for his own work, and makes them instruments of the power of his Holy
   Spirit." -- Fr. Ser.

   [168] The reader will do well to consider the author's [12]Commentary
   on that remarkable passage. -- Ed.

   [169] "On ne gaigne rien yci de se defendre et excuser, en alleguant
   son infirmite." -- "Here nothing is gained by defending and excusing
   ourselves on the ground of our weakness."

   2 Timothy 2:14-18

   14. Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the
   Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the
   subverting of the hearers.

   14. Haec admone, contestans coram Domino, ne verbis disceptent, ad
   nullam utilitatem, ad subversionem audientium

   15. Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not
   to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

   15. Stude to ipsum probatum exhibere Deo, operarioum non erubescentem,
   recte secanem sermonem vertitatis.

   16. But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto
   more ungodliness.

   16. Caeterum profanas clamorum inanitates omitte; ad majorem enim
   proficiunt impietatem.

   17. And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenæus and
   Philetus;

   17. Et sermo eorum, ut gangraena, pastionem habebit, quorum de numero
   est Hymeneus et Philetus

   18. Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection
   is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.

   18. Qui circa veritatem aberrarunt, dicentes resurrectionem jam esse
   factam, et subvertunt quorundam fidem.

   14 Remind them of these things. The expression (tauta) these things, is
   highly emphatic. It means that the summary of the gospel which he gave,
   and the exhortations which he added to it, are of so great importance,
   that a good minister ought never to be weary of exhibiting them; for
   they are things that deserve to be continually handled, and that cannot
   be too frequently repeated. "They are things" (he says) "which I wish
   you not only to teach once, but to take great pains to impress on the
   hearts of men by frequent repetition." A good teacher ought to look at
   nothing else than edification, and to give his whole attention to that
   alone. [170] On the contrary, he enjoins him not only to abstain from
   useless questions, but likewise to forbid others to follow them. [171]

   Solemnly charging them before the Lord, not to dispute about words.
   Logomachein means to engage earnestly in contentious disputes, which
   are commonly produced by a foolish desire of being ingenious. Solemn
   charging before the Lord is intended to strike terror; [172] and from
   this severity we learn how dangerous to the Church is that knowledge
   which leads to debates, that is, which disregards piety, and tends to
   ostentation; of this nature is the whole of that speculative theology,
   as it is called, that is found among the Papists.

   For no use, On two grounds, logomachia, or "disputing about words," is
   condemned by him. It is of no advantage, and it is exceedingly hurtful,
   by disturbing weak minds. Although in the version I have followed
   Erasmus, because it did not disagree with Paul's meaning, yet I wish to
   inform my readers that Paul's words may be explained in this manner,
   "That which is useful for nothing." The Greek words are, eis ouden
   chresimon, and I read chresimon in the accusative case, and not in the
   nominative. The style will thus flow more agreeably; as if he had said,
   "Of what use is it, when no good comes from it, but much evil? for the
   faith of many is subverted."

   Let us remark, first, that, when a manner of teaching does no good, for
   that single reason it is justly disapproved; for God does not wish to
   indulge our curiosity, but to instruct us in a useful manner. Away with
   all speculations, therefore, which produce no edification!

   But the second is much worse, when questions are raised, which are not
   only unprofitable, but tend to the subversion of the hearers I wish
   that this were attended to by those who are always armed for fighting
   with the tongue, and who, in every question are looking for grounds of
   quarreling, and who go so far as to lay snares around every word or
   syllable. But they are carried in a wrong direction by ambition, and
   sometimes by an almost fatal disease; which I have experienced in some.
   What the Apostle says about subverting is shown, every day, by actual
   observation, to be perfectly true; for it is natural, amidst disputes,
   to lose sight of the truth; and Satan avails himself of quarrels as a
   presence for disturbing weak persons, and overthrowing their faith.

   15 Study to shew thyself to be approved by God Since all disputes about
   doctrine arise from this source, that men are desirous to make a boast
   of ingenuity before the world, Paul here applies the best and most
   excellent remedy, when he commands Timothy to keep his eyes fixed on
   God; as if he had said; "Some aim at the applause of a crowded
   assembly, but do thou study to approve thyself and thy ministry to
   God." And indeed there is nothing that tends more to check a foolish
   eagerness for display, than to reflect that we have to deal with God.

   A workman that doth not blush Erasmus translates anepaischunton "that
   ought not to blush." I do not find fault with that rendering, but
   prefer to explain it actively, "that doth not blush;", both because
   that is the more ordinary meaning of the word as used by Greek writers,
   and because I consider it to agree better with the present passage.
   There is an implied contrast. Those who disturb the Church by
   contentions break out into that fierceness, because they are ashamed of
   being overcome, and because they reckon it disgraceful that there
   should be anything that they do not know. Paul, on the contrary, bids
   them appeal to the judgment of God.

   And first, he bids them be not lazy disputants, but workmen. By this
   term he indirectly reproves the foolishness of those who so greatly
   torment themselves by doing nothing. Let us therefore be "workmen" in
   building the Church, and let us be employed in the work of God in such
   a manner that some fruit shall be seen then we shall have no cause to
   "blush;" for, although in debating we be not equal to talkative
   boasters, yet it will be enough that we excel them in the desire of
   edification, in industry, in courage, and in the efficacy of doctrine.
   In short, he bids Timothy labor diligently, that he may not be ashamed
   before God; whereas ambitious men dread only this kind of shame, to
   lose nothing of their reputation for acuteness or profound knowledge.

   Dividing aright the word of truth. This is a beautiful metaphor, and
   one that skillfully expresses the chief design of teaching. "Since we
   ought to be satisfied with the word of God alone, what purpose is
   served by having sermons every day, or even the office of pastors? Has
   not every person an opportunity of reading the Bible?" [173] But Paul
   assigns to teachers the duty of dividing or cutting, [174] as if a
   father, in giving food to his children, were dividing the bread, by
   cutting it into small pieces.

   He advises Timothy to "cut aright," lest, when he is employed in
   cutting the surface, as unskillful people are wont to do, he leave the
   pith and marrow untouched. Yet by this term I understand, generally, an
   allotment of the word which is judicious, and which is well suited to
   the profit of the hearers. Some mutilate it, others tear it, others
   torture it, others break it in pieces, others, keeping by the outside,
   (as we have said,) never come to the soul of doctrine. [175] To all
   these faults he contrasts time "dividing aright," that is, the manner
   of explaining which is adapted to edification; for that is the rule by
   which we must try all interpretation of Scripture.

   16 But avoid profane and unmeaning noises My opinion as to the import
   of these words has been stated in my commentary on the last chapter of
   the First Epistle to Timothy; and my readers will find it there. [176]

   For they will grow to greater ungodliness. That he may more effectually
   deter Timothy from that profane and noisy talkativeness, he states that
   it is a sort of labyrinth, or rather a deep whirlpool, from which they
   cannot go out, but into which men plunge themselves more and more.

   17 And their word will eat as a gangrene I have been told by Benedict
   Textor, a physician, that this passage is badly translated by Erasmus,
   who, out of two diseases quite different from each other, has made but
   one disease; for, instead of "gangrene," he has used the word "cancer."
   Now Galen, in many passages throughout his writings, and especially
   where he lays down definitions in his small work "On unnatural
   swellings," distinguishes the one from the other. Paul Aegineta, too,
   on the authority of Galen, thus in his sixth book defines a "cancer;"
   that it is "an unequal swelling, with inflated extremities, loathsome
   to the sight, of a leaden color, and unaccompanied by pain." Next, he
   enumerates two kinds, as other physicians do; for he says that some
   "cancers" are concealed and have no ulcer; while others, in which there
   is a preponderance of the black bile from which they originate, are
   ulcerous.

   Of the "gangrene," on the other hand, Galen, both in the small work
   already quoted, and in his second book to Glauco, Aetius in his
   fourteenth book, and the same Ægineta in his fourth book, speak to the
   following effect; that it proceeds from great phlegmons or
   inflammations, if they fall violently on any member, so that the part
   which is destitute of heat and vital energy tends to destruction. If
   that part be quite dead, the Greek writers call the disease sphakelos
   the Latins sideratio, and the common people call it St. Anthony's fire.

   I find, indeed, that Cornelius Celsius draws the distinction in this
   manner, that "cancer "is the genus, and "gangrene" the species; but his
   mistake is plainly refuted from numerous passages in the works of
   physicians of high authority. It is possible, also, that he was led
   astray by the similarity between the Latin words "cancer" and
   "gangræna." But in the Greek words there can be no mistake of that
   kind; for karkinos is the name which corresponds to the Latin word
   "cancer," and denotes both the animal which we call a crab, and the
   disease; while grammarians think that gangraina is derived apo tou
   grainein which means "to eat." We must therefore abide by the word
   "gangrene," which Paul uses, and which best agrees with what he says as
   to "eating" or "consuming."

   We have now explained the etymology; but all physicians pronounce the
   nature of the disease to be such, that, if it be not very speedily
   counteracted, it spreads to the adjoining parts, and penetrates even to
   the bones, and does not cease to consume, till it has killed the man.
   Since, therefore, "gangrene" is immediately followed by (nekrosis)
   mortification, which rapidly infects the rest of the members till it
   end in the universal destruction of the body; to this mortal contagion
   Paul elegantly compares false doctrines; for, if you once give entrance
   to them, they spread till they have completed the destruction of the
   Church. The contagion being so destructive, we must meet it early, and
   not wait till it has gathered strength by progress; for there will then
   be no time for rendering assistance. The dreadful extinction of the
   gospel among the Papists arose from this cause, that, through the
   ignorance or slothfulness of the pastors, corruptions prevailed long
   and without control, in consequence of which the purity of doctrine was
   gradually destroyed.

   Of the number of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus He points out with the
   finger the plagues themselves, that all may be on their guard against
   them; for, if those persons who aim at the ruin of the whole Church are
   permitted by us to remain concealed, then to some extent we give them
   power to do injury. It is true that we ought to conceal the faults of
   brethren, but only those faults the contagion of which is not widely
   spread. But where there is danger to many, our dissimulation is cruel,
   if we do not expose in proper time the hidden evil. And why? Is it
   proper, for the sake of sparing one individual, that a hundred or a
   thousand persons shall perish through my silence? Besides, Paul did not
   intend to convey this information to Timothy alone, but he intended to
   proclaim to all ages and to all nations the wickedness of the two men,
   in order to shut the door against their base and ruinous doctrine.

   18 Who, concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection
   is already past After having said that they had departed from "the
   truth," he specifies their error, which consisted in this, that they
   gave out that "the resurrection was already past." In doing this, they
   undoubtedly contrived a sort of allegorical resurrection, which has
   also been attempted in this age by some filthy dogs. By this trick
   Satan overthrows that fundamental article of our faith concerning the
   resurrection of the flesh. Being an old and worthless dream, and being
   so severely condemned by Paul, it ought to give us the less uneasiness.
   But when we learn that, from the very beginning of the gospel, the
   faith of some was subverted, such an example ought to excite us to
   diligence, that we may seize an early opportunity of driving away from
   ourselves and others so dangerous a plague; for, in consequence of the
   strong inclination of men to vanity, there is no absurdity so monstrous
   that there shall not be some men who shall lend their ear to it.

   something that tickles the ears, or that gives pleasure; but let it be
   to make progress in the fear of God, and in humility, and to excite to
   prayer, and to confirm him in patience. If we have heard an exhortation
   today, and if tomorrow it is repeated to us, let us not think that this
   is superfluous, let us not be annoyed at it; for every person who
   carefully examines this subject will find it to be highly necessary for
   him to be reminded of the lesson which he had learned, that he may
   practice it well. If, therefore, God refreshes our memory with it, he
   has conferred on us a great favor. That is what we have to remark on
   this passage, when Paul says, Remind them of these things.' For
   undoubtedly he intended to prevent what we frequently meet with, when
   it is said, We have heard this before. Is not that a very common
   remark? Where is the little child that does not know it?" Such things
   are said by those who would wish to be fed with useless questions. But
   here the Holy Spirit desires that what is useful should be brought
   forward every day, because we have not sufficiently understood it, and
   because it must be put in practice." -- Fr. Ser.

   come to the church to be taught. What? Is not all the doctrine of God
   contained in the Bible? What more can be said on the subject?' It is
   making them little children (they will say) to come here to be taught;
   but grown people may dispense with it. What? Must there be all this
   preaching? There are but two points in Scripture, that we ought to love
   God and to love our neighbor. We have not heard these things merely
   from those who come to relate them; but the most distinguished scholars
   of those who vomited out these blasphemies have themselves declared
   them to us. I could name the day when it was said, and the houses, and
   the hour, and the people who were present, and how wicked men poured
   out their venom and their passion against God, to overthrow and destroy
   all religion, if it were possible; that is but too well known. On the
   contrary, Paul shews us here, that if we have only the Holy Scripture,

   drawn from it must be preached to us in order that we may be well
   informed" -- Fr. Ser.

   2 Timothy 2:19-21

   19. Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal,
   The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the
   name of Christ depart from iniquity.

   19. Firmum tamen fundamentum Dei stat, habens sigillum hoc, Novit
   Dominus, qui sint sui; et, Discedat ab injustitia, quicunque invocat
   nomen Christi.

   20. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of
   silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to
   dishonour.

   20. In magna quidem domo non solum sunt vasa aurea et argentea, sed
   etiam lignea et fictilia, et alia quidem in honorem, alia in
   contumeliam.

   21. If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel
   unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared
   unto every good work.

   21. Si quis ergo expurgaverit se ipsum ab his, erit vas in honorem
   sanctificatum, et utile Domino ad omne opus bonum comparatum.

   19 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth firm. We know too well,
   by experience, how much scandal is produced by the apostasy of those
   who at one time professed the same faith with ourselves. This is
   especially the case with those who were extensively known, and who had
   a more brilliant reputation than others; for, if any of the common
   people apostatize, we are not so deeply affected by it. But they who in
   the ordinary opinion of men held a distinguished rank, having been
   formerly regarded as pillars, cannot fall in this manner, without
   involving others in the same ruin with themselves; at least, if their
   faith has no other support. This is the subject which Paul has now in
   hand; for he declares that there is no reason why believers should lose
   heart, although they see those persons fall, whom they were wont to
   reckon the strongest.

   He makes use of this consolation, that the levity or treachery of men
   cannot hinder God from preserving his Church to the last. And first he
   reminds us of the election of God, which he metaphorically calls a
   foundation, expressing by this word the firm and enduring constancy of
   it. Yet all this tends to prove the certainty of our salvation, if we
   are of the elect of God. As if he had said, "The elect do not depend on
   changing events, but rest on a solid and immovable foundation; because
   their salvation is in the hand of God." For as

   "every plant which the heavenly Father hath not planted
   must be rooted up," (Matthew 15:13,)

   so a root, which has been fixed by his hand, is not liable to be
   injured by any winds or storms.

   First of all, therefore, let us hold this principle, that, amidst so
   great weakness of our flesh, the elect are nevertheless beyond the
   reach of danger, because they do not stand by their own strength, but
   are founded on God. And if foundations laid by the hand of men have so
   much firmness, how much more solid will be that which has been laid by
   God himself? I am aware that some refer this to doctrine, "Let no man
   judge of the truth of it from the unsteadfastness of men;" but it may
   easily be inferred from the context, that Paul speaks of the Church of
   God, or of the elect.

   Having this seal The word signaculum (which denotes either "a seal" or
   "the print of a seal") having led into a mistake some people who
   thought that it was intended to denote a mark or impress, I have
   translated it sigillum (a seal,) which is less ambiguous. And, indeed,
   Paul means, that under the secret guardianship of God, as a signet, is
   contained the salvation of the elect, as Scripture testifies that they
   are

   "written in the book of life." (Psalm 69:28; Philippians 4:3.)

   The Lord knoweth who are his This clause, together with the word seal,
   reminds us, that we must not judge, by our own opinion, whether the
   number of the elect is great or small; for what God hath sealed he
   wishes to be, in some respect, shut up from us. Besides, if it is the
   prerogative of God to know who are his, we need not wonder if a great
   number of them are often unknown to us, or even if we fall into
   mistakes in making the selection.

   Yet we ought always to observe why and for what purpose he makes
   mention of a seal; that is, when we see such occurrences, let us
   instantly call to remembrance what we are taught by the Apostle John,
   that

   "they who went out from us were not of us." (1 John 2:19.)

   Hence arises a twofold advantage. First, our faith will not be shaken,
   as if it depended on men; nor shall we be even dismayed, as often
   happens, when unexpected events take place. Secondly, being convinced
   that the Church shall nevertheless be safe, we shall more patiently
   endure that the reprobate go away into their own lot, to which they
   were appointed; because there will remain the full number, with which
   God is satisfied. Therefore, whenever any sudden change happens among
   men, contrary to our opinion and expectation, let us immediately call
   to remembrance, "The Lord knoweth who are his."

   Let every one that calleth on the name of Christ depart from iniquity
   As he formerly met the scandal by saying, "Let not the revolt of any
   man produce excessive alarm in believers;" so now, by holding out this
   example of hypocrites, he shews that we must not sport with God by a
   feigned profession of Christianity. As if he had said, "Since God thus
   punishes hypocrites by exposing their wickedness, let us learn to fear
   him with a sincere conscience, lest anything of that kind should happen
   to us. Whoever, therefore, calleth upon God, that is, professeth to be,
   and wisheth to be reckoned, one of the people of God, let him keep at a
   distance from all iniquity." [177] For to "call on the name of Christ"
   means here to glory in Christ's honorable title, and to boast of
   belonging to his flock; in the same manner as to have

   "the name of a man called on a woman" (Isaiah 4:1)

   the woman is accounted to be his lawful wife; and to have "the name of
   Jacob called on" all his posterity (Genesis 48:16) means that the name
   of the family shall be kept up in uninterrupted succession, because the
   race is descended from Jacob.

   20 In a great house He now goes farther, and demonstrates by a
   comparison, that when we see some who, for a time, made a show of
   distinguished piety and zeal, fall back shamefully, so far from being
   troubled on account of it, we ought rather to acknowledge that this
   arrangement is seemly and adapted to the providence of God. Who will
   find fault with a large house, in which there is abundance of every
   kind of furniture, and which accordingly contains not only those
   articles which are fitted for purposes of display, but likewise those
   which are of a meaner sort? This diversity is even ornamental, if,
   while the sideboard and the table glitter with gold and silver, the
   kitchen is furnished with vessels of wood and of earthenware. Why then
   should we wonder if God, the head of the family, so rich and so
   abundantly supplied with everything, has in this world, as in a large
   house, various kinds of men, as so many parts of furniture?

   Commentators are not agreed, however, whether the "great house" means
   the Church alone, or the whole world. And, indeed, the context rather
   leads us to understand it as denoting the Church; for Paul is not now
   reasoning about strangers, but about God's own family. Yet what he says
   is true generally, and in another passage the same Apostle extends it
   to the whole world; that is, at Romans 9:21, where he includes all the
   reprobate under the same word that is here used. We need not greatly
   dispute, therefore, if any person shall apply it simply to the world.
   Yet there can be no doubt that Paul's object is to shew that we ought
   not to think it strange, that bad men are mixed with the good, which
   happens chiefly in the Church.

   21 If any man shall cleanse himself from these If the reprobate are
   "vessels for dishonor," they have that dishonor confined to themselves,
   but they do not disfigure the house, or bring any disgrace on the head
   of the family, who, while he has a variety of articles of furniture,
   appropriates each vessel to its proper use. But let us learn, by their
   example, to apply them to better and worthier uses; for in the
   reprobate, as in mirrors, we perceive how detestable is the condition
   of man, if he do not sincerely promote the glory of God. Such examples,
   therefore, afford to us good ground for exhortation to devote ourselves
   to a holy and blameless life.

   There are many who misapply this passage, for the sake of proving that
   what Paul elsewhere (Romans 9:16) declares to belong "to God that
   sheweth mercy," is actually within the power of "him that willeth and
   him that runneth." This is exceedingly frivolous; for Paul does not
   here argue about the election of men, in order to shew what is the
   cause of it, as he does in the ninth chapter of the Epistle to the
   Romans (Romans 9); but only means that we are unlike wicked men, whom
   we perceive to have been born to their perdition. It is consequently
   foolish to draw an inference from these words, about the question
   whether it is in a man's power to place himself in the number of the
   children of God, and to be the author of his own adoption. That is not
   the present question. Let this short warning suffice against those who
   bid a man cause himself to be predestinated; as if Paul enjoined men to
   do what they must have done before they were born, and even before the
   foundations of the world were laid.

   Others, who infer from these words that free-will is sufficient for
   preparing a man, that he may be fit and qualified for obeying God, do
   not at first sight appear to be so absurd as the former, yet there is
   no solidity in what they advance. The Apostle enjoins that men who
   desire to consecrate themselves to the Lord cleanse themselves from the
   pollution of wicked men; and throughout the Scriptures God gives the
   same injunction; for we find nothing here but what we have seen in many
   passages of Paul's writings, and especially in the Second Epistle to
   the Corinthians,

   "Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord." [178]

   Beyond all controversy, we are called to holiness. But the question
   about the calling and duty of Christians is totally different from the
   question about their power or ability. We do not deny that it is
   demanded from believers that they purify themselves; but elsewhere the
   Lord declares that this is their duty, while he promises by Ezekiel
   that he will send

   "clean waters, that we may be cleansed." (Ezekiel 36:25.)

   Wherefore we ought to supplicate the Lord to cleanse us, instead of
   vainly trying our strength in this matter without his assistance.

   A vessel sanctified for honor means, set apart for honorable and
   magnificent purposes. In like manner, what is useful to the head of the
   family is put for that which is applied to agreeable purposes. He
   afterwards explains the metaphor, when he adds, that we must be
   prepared for every good work. Away with the wild language of fanatics,
   "I will contribute to the glory of God, as Pharaoh did; for is it not
   all one, provided that God be glorified?" For here God explicitly
   states in what manner he wishes us to serve him, that is, by a
   religious and holy life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [177] "Let us not therefore be distressed by all the scandals that may
   arise. And yet let us study to walk in fear, not abusing the goodness
   of our God but knowing that, since he hath separated us from the rest
   of the world we must live as being in his house and as being his, in
   the same manner as he hath given to us the onward mark of baptism, that
   we may also have the signature of his holy Spirit, for he is "the
   earnest," as Paul calls him, of our election, he is the pledge which we
   possess that we are called to the heavenly inheritance. Let us
   therefore pray to God that he may sign and seal in our hearts his
   gracious election, by his holy Spirit, and, at the same time, that he
   may keep us sealed and as shut up under the shadow of his wings; and if
   poor reprobates go astray and are lost, and if the devil drives them
   along, and if they do not rise again when they fall, but are cast down
   and ruined, let us, on our part, pray to God to keep us under his
   protection, that we may know what it is to obey his will, and to be
   supported by him. Though the world strive to shake us, let us lean on
   this foundation, that the Lord knoweth who are his; and let us never be
   drawn aside from this, but let us persevere and profit more and more,
   till God withdraw us from the present state into his kingdom, which is
   not liable to change." -- Fr. Ser.

   2 Timothy 2:22-26

   22. Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity,
   peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

   22. Juvenilis cupiditates fuge; sequere autem justitiam, fidem,
   dilecgionem, pacem cum omnibus invocantibus Dominum ex puro corde.

   23. But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do
   gender strifes.

   23. Stultas vero et ineruditas quaestiones vita, sciens quod generant
   pungas.

   24. And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all
   men, apt to teach, patient,

   24. Atqui servum Domini non oportet pugnare; sed placidum esse erga
   omnes, propensum ad docendum, tolerantem malorum,

   25. In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God
   peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the
   truth;

   25. Cum mansuetudine erudientem (vel, castigantem) eos qui obsistunt,
   si quando det illis Deus paenitentiam in agnititonem veritatis,

   26. And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil,
   who are taken captive by him at his will.

   26. Et excitationen (vel, reditum ad sanam menten) a laque diaboli, a
   quo capti tenentur ad ipsius voluntatem.

   22 Flee youthful desires. This is an inference from what goes before;
   for, after mentioning useless questions, and having been led by this
   circumstance to censure Hymenaeus and Philetus, whose ambition and vain
   curiosity had led them away from the right faith, he again exhorts
   Timothy to keep at a distance from so dangerous a plague, and for this
   purpose he advises him to avoid "youthful desires."

   By this term he does not mean either a propensity to uncleanness, or
   any of those licentious courses or sinful lusts in which young men
   frequently indulge, but any impetuous passions to which the excessive
   warmth of that age is prone. If some debate has arisen, young men more
   quickly grow warm, are more easily irritated, more frequently blunder
   through want of experience, and rush forward with greater confidence
   and rashness, than men of riper age. With good reason, therefore, does
   Paul advise Timothy, being a young man, to be strictly on his guard
   against the vices of youth, which otherwise might easily drive him to
   useless disputes.

   But follow righteousness He recommends the opposite feelings, that they
   may restrain his mind from breaking out into any youthful excesses; as
   if he had said, "These are the things to which thou oughtest to give
   thy whole attention, and thy whole exertions." And first he mentions
   righteousness, that is, the right way of living; and afterwards he adds
   faith and love, in which it principally consists. Peace is closely
   connected with the present subject; for they who delight in the
   questions which he forbids must be contentious and fond of debating.

   With all that call on the Lord Here, by a figure of speech, in which a
   part is taken for the whole, "calling on God" is taken generally for
   worship, if it be not thought preferable to refer it to profession. But
   this is the chief part of the worship of God, and for that reason
   "calling on God" often signifies the whole of religion or the worship
   of God. But when he bids him seek "peace with all that call upon the
   Lord," it is doubtful whether, on the one hand, he holds out all
   believers as an example, as if he had said, that he ought to pursue
   this in common with all the true worshippers of God, or, on the other
   hand, he enjoins Timothy to cultivate peace with them. The latter
   meaning appears to be more suitable.

   23 But avoid foolish and uninstructive questions He calls them foolish,
   because they are uninstructive; that is, they contribute nothing to
   godliness, whatever show of acuteness they may hold out. When we are
   wise in a useful manner, then alone are we truly wise. This ought to be
   carefully observed; for we see what foolish admiration the world
   entertains for silly trifles, and how eagerly it runs after them. That
   an ambition to please may not urge us to seek the favor of men by such
   display, let us always remember this remarkable testimony of Paul, that
   questions, which are held in high estimation, are nevertheless foolish,
   because they are unprofitable.

   Knowing that they beget quarrels Next, he expresses the evil which they
   commonly produce. And here he says nothing else than what we experience
   every day, that they give occasion for jangling and debates. And yet
   the greater part of men, after having received so many instructions, do
   not at all profit by them.

   24 But the servant of the Lord must not fight Paul's argument is to
   this effect: "The servant of God must stand aloof from contentions; but
   foolish questions are contentions; therefore whoever desires to be a
   servant of God,' and to be accounted such, ought to shun them." And if
   superfluous questions ought to be avoided on this single ground, that
   it is unseemly for a servant of God to fight, how impudently do they
   act, who have the open effrontery of claiming applause for raising
   incessant controversies? Let the theology of the Papists now come
   forth; what else will be found in it than the art of disputing and
   fighting? The more progress any man has made in it, the more unfit will
   he be for serving, Christ.

   But gentle towards all, [179] qualified for teaching When he bids the
   servant of Christ be "gentle," he demands a virtue which is opposite to
   the disease of contentions. To the same purpose is what immediately
   follows, that he be didaktikos, "qualified for teaching." There will be
   no room for instruction, if he have not moderation and some equability
   of temper. What limit will be observed by a teacher, when he is warmed
   for fighting? The better a man is qualified for teaching, the more
   earnestly does he keep aloof from quarrels and disputes.

   Patient to the bad [180] The importunity of some men may sometimes
   produce either irritation or weariness; and for that reason he adds,
   "bearing with them," at the same time pointing out the reason why it is
   necessary; namely, because a godly teacher ought even to try whether it
   be possible for him to bring back to the right path obstinate and
   rebellious persons, which cannot be done without the exercise of
   gentleness.

   25 If sometime God grant to them repentance This expression, "If
   sometime," or "If perhaps," points out the difficulty of the case, as
   being nearly desperate or beyond hope. Paul therefore means that even
   towards the most unworthy we must exercise meekness; and although at
   first there be no appearance of having gained advantage, still we must
   make the attempt. For the same reason he mentions that "God will grant
   it." Since the conversion of a man is in the hand of God, who knows
   whether they who today appear to be unteachable shall be suddenly
   changed by the power of God, into other men? Thus, whoever shall
   consider that repentance is the gift and work of God, will cherish more
   earnest hope, and, encouraged by this confidence, will bestow more toil
   and exertion for the instruction of rebels. We should view it thus,
   that our duty is, to be employed in sowing and watering, and, while we
   do this, we must look for the increase from God. (1 Corinthians 3:6.)
   Our labors and exertions are thus of no advantage in themselves; and
   yet, through the grace of God, they are not fruitless.

   To the knowledge of the truth We may learn from this what is the actual
   repentance of those who for a time were disobedient to God; for Paul
   declares that it begins with "the knowledge of the truth." By this he
   means that the understanding of man is blinded, so long as it stands
   out fiercely against God and his doctrine.

   26 And deliverance from the snare of the devil Illumination is followed
   by deliverance from the bondage of the devil; for unbelievers are so
   intoxicated by Satan, that, being asleep, they do not perceive their
   distresses. On the other hand, when the Lord shines upon us by the
   light of his truth, he wakens us out of that deadly sleep, breaks
   asunder the snares by which we were bound, and, having removed all
   obstacles, trains us to obedience to him.

   By whom they are held captive A truly shocking condition, when the
   devil has so great power over us, that he drags us, as captive slaves,
   here and there at his pleasure. Yet such is the condition of all those
   whom the pride of their heart draws away from subjection to God. And
   this tyrannical dominion of Satan we see plainly, every day, in the
   reprobate; for they would not rush with such fury and with brutal
   violence into every kind of base and disgraceful crimes, if they were
   not drawn by the unseen power of Satan. That is what we saw at
   Ephesians 2:2, [181] that, Satan exerts his energy in unbelievers.

   Such examples admonish us to keep ourselves carefully under the yoke of
   Christ, and to yield ourselves to be governed by his Holy Spirit. And
   yet a captivity of this nature does not excuse wicked men, so that they
   do not sin, because it is by the instigation of Satan that they sin;
   for, although their being carried along so resistlessly to that which
   is evil proceeds from the dominion of Satan, yet they do nothing by
   constraint, but are inclined with their whole heart to that to which
   Satan drives them. The result is, that their captivity is voluntary.

   [179] "When he says, that we must be "gentle towards all, "he means
   that we ought to be easy and affable in receiving all who come to be
   taught in the gospel, for if we do not give them access it is like
   shutting the door against them, so that they shall never have it in
   their power to approach to God. We must, therefore, have that mildness
   and humanity dwelling in us, so as to be ready to receive all who wish
   to be instructed. And therefore, he adds, that we must be `qualified
   for teaching,' as if he had said, that those things are connected with
   each other, gentleness and skill in teaching. The reason is, if a man
   be fierce and inaccessible, it will never be possible for us to receive
   instruction from him. He who wishes to be a good teacher must conduct
   himself with civility, and must have some way of drawing those who come
   to him, so as to gain their affections; and that cannot be, unless he
   have that gentleness' of which Paul speaks. Thus we see how he intended
   to confirm what he had briefly stated, that a man who is quarrelsome,
   and addicted to disputes and contentions, is in no degree a servant of
   God. And why? As servants of God, must we not labor to gain poor
   ignorant persons? And that cannot be, unless we are mild, unless we
   hear patiently what they say, unless we bear with their weakness, until
   by little and little they are edified. If we have not that, it is like
   casting them off." -- Fr. Ser.

   CHAPTER 3
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Timothy 3:1-7

   1. This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come:

   1. Illhud autem scito, quod in exremis diebus instabunt tempora
   periculosa (vel. gravia)

   2. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters,
   proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

   2. Erunt enim homines sui amantes, avari, fastuosi, superbi, maledici,
   parentibus immorigeri, ingrati, impii,

   3. Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers,
   incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,

   3. Carentes affectu, nescii faederis, calumniatores, intermperantes,
   inmites, negligentes bonorum,

   4. Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
   God;

   4. Proditores protervi tumidi voluptatium amatores magis quam Dei

   5. Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such
   turn away.

   5. Habentes speciem quidem pietatis virtutem autem eius abnegantes et
   hos devita

   6. For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive
   silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,

   6. Ex iis enim sunt qui subintrant in familias, et captivas ducunt
   mulierculas oneratas peccatis, quae ducuntur concupiscentiis variis,

   7. Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

   7. Semper discentes, quum tamen numquam ad cognitionem veritatis
   pervenire valeant.

   1 But know this By this prediction he intended still more to sharpen
   his diligence; for, when matters go on to our wish, we become more
   careless; but necessity urges us keenly. Paul, therefore informs him,
   that the Church will be subject to terrible diseases, which will
   require in the pastors uncommon fidelity, diligence, watchfulness,
   prudence, and unwearied constancy; as if he enjoined Timothy to prepare
   for arduous and deeply anxious contests which awaited him. And hence we
   learn, that, so far from giving way, or being terrified, on account of
   any difficulties whatsoever, we ought, on the contrary. to arouse our
   hearts for resistance.

   In the last days Under "the last days," he includes the universal
   condition of the Christian Church. Nor does he compare his own age with
   ours, but, on the contrary, informs Timothy what will be the future
   condition of the kingdom of Christ; for many imagined some sort of
   condition that would be absolutely peaceful, and free from any
   annoyance. [182] In short, he means that there will not be, even under
   the gospel, such a state of perfection, that all vices shall be
   banished, and virtues of every kind shall flourish; and that therefore
   the pastors of the Christian Church will have quite as much to do with
   wicked and ungodly men as the prophets and godly priests had in ancient
   times. Hence it follows, that there is no time for idleness or for
   repose.

   2 For men will be It is proper to remark, first, in what he makes the
   hardship of those "dangerous" or "troublesome" times to consist; not in
   war, nor in famine, nor in diseases, nor in any calamities or
   inconveniences to which the body is incident, but in the wicked and
   depraved actions of men. And, indeed, nothing is so distressingly
   painful to godly men, and to those who truly fear God, as to behold
   such corruptions of morals; for, as there is nothing which they value
   more highly than the glory of God, so they cannot but suffer grievous
   anguish when it is attacked or despised.

   Secondly, it ought to be remarked, who are the persons of whom he
   speaks. They whom he briefly describes are not external enemies, who
   openly assail the name of Christ, but domestics, who wish to be
   reckoned among the members of the Church; for God wishes to try his
   Church to such an extent as to carry within her bosom such plagues,
   though she abhors to entertain them. So then, if in the present day
   many whom we justly abhor are mingled within us, let us learn to groan
   patiently under that burden, when we are informed that this is the lot
   of the Christian Church.

   Next, it is wonderful that those persons, whom Paul pronounces to be
   guilty of so many and so aggravated acts of wickedness, can keep up the
   appearance of piety, as he also declares. But daily experience shows
   that we ought not to regard this as so wonderful; for such is the
   amazing audacity and wickedness of hypocrites, that, even in excusing
   the grossest crimes, they are excessively impudent, after having once
   learned falsely to shelter themselves under the name of God. In ancient
   times, how many crimes abounded in the life of the Pharisees? And yet,
   as if they had been pure from every stain, they enjoyed a reputation of
   eminent holiness.

   Even in the present day, although the lewdness of the Popish clergy is
   such that it stinks in the nostrils of the whole world, still, in spite
   of their wickedness, they do not cease to arrogate proudly to
   themselves all the rights and titles of saints. Accordingly, when Paul
   says that hypocrites, though they are chargeable with the grossest
   vices, nevertheless deceive under a mask of piety, this ought not to
   appear strange, when we have examples before our eyes. And, indeed, the
   world deserves to be deceived by those wicked scoundrels, when it
   either despises or cannot endure true holiness. Besides, Paul
   enumerates those vices which are not visible at first sight, and which
   are even the ordinary attendants of pretended holiness. Is there a
   hypocrite who is not proud, who is not a lover of himself, who is not a
   despiser of others, who is not fierce and cruel, who is not
   treacherous? But all these are concealed from the eyes of men. [183]

   To spend time in explaining every word would be superfluous; for the
   words do not need exposition. Only let my readers observe that
   philautia, self-love, which is put first, may be regarded as the source
   from which flow all the vices that follow afterwards. He who loveth
   himself claims a superiority in everything, despises all others, is
   cruel, indulges in covetousness, treachery, anger, rebellion against
   parents, neglect of what is good, and such like. As it was the design
   of Paul to brand false prophets with such marks, that they might be
   seen and known by all; it is our duty to open our eyes, that we may see
   those who are pointed out with the finger.

   5 From those turn away. This exhortation sufficiently shows that Paul
   does not speak of a distant posterity, nor foretell what would happen
   many ages afterwards; but that, by pointing out present evils, he
   applies to his own age what he had said about "the last times;" for how
   could Timothy "turn away" from those who were not to arise till many
   centuries afterwards? So then, from the very beginning of the gospel,
   the Church must have begun to be affected by such corruptions.

   6 Of those are they who creep into families You would say, that here
   Paul intentionally draws a lively picture of the order of monks. But
   without saying a single word about monks, those marks by which Paul
   distinguishes false and pretended teachers are sufficiently clear;
   creeping into houses, snares for catching silly women, mean flattery,
   imposing upon people by various superstitions. These marks it is proper
   to observe carefully, if we wish to distinguish between useless drones
   and faithful ministers of Christ. These former are here marked by so
   black a coal, that it is of no use for them to shuffle. To "creep into
   families" means to enter stealthily, or to seek an entrance by cunning
   methods.

   And lead captive silly women laden with sins Now, he speaks of "women"
   rather than men, because the former are more liable to be led astray in
   this manner. He says that they "are led captive," because false
   prophets of this sort, through various tricks, gain their ear, partly
   by prying curiously into all their affairs, and partly by flattery. And
   this is what he immediately adds, "laden with sins;" for, if they had
   not been bound by the chain of a bad conscience, they would not have
   allowed themselves to be led away, in every possible manner, at the
   will of others.

   By various sinful desires I consider "sinful desires" to denote
   generally those foolish and light desires by which women, who do not
   seek God sincerely, and yet wish to be reckoned religious and holy, are
   carried away. There is no end of the methods adopted by them, when,
   departing from a good conscience, they are constantly assuming new
   masks. Chrysostom is more disposed to refer it to disgraceful and
   immodest desires; but, when I examine the context, I prefer the former
   exposition; for it immediately follows --

   7 Always learning, while yet they never can come to the knowledge of
   the truth That fluctuation between various desires, of which he now
   speaks, is when, having nothing solid in themselves, they are tossed
   about in all directions. They "learn," he says, as people do who are
   under the influence of curiosity, and with a restless mind, but in such
   a manner as never to arrive at any certainty or truth. It is
   ill-conducted study, and widely different from knowledge. And yet such
   persons think themselves prodigiously wise; but what they know is
   nothing, so long as they do not hold the truth, which is the foundation
   of all knowledge.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [182] "Why does the holy Apostle, both here and elsewhere, speak of the
   last days,' when he forewarns believers that they must prepare
   themselves, and make provision for many troubles and annoyances? It is
   because this fancy was so common, that matters would go much better
   than before; because, formerly, the prophets, when speaking of the
   kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, said that everything would be
   astonishingly reformed, that the world would obey God, that his majesty
   would be adored by the high and the low, that every mouth would sing
   his praise, and every knee would bow before him. In short, when we hear
   such promises, we think that we must be in a state of angelical
   holiness, now that Christ has appeared. Many concluded, in their
   mistaken fancy, that, since the coming of the Redeemer, nothing but the
   most correct virtue and modesty would ever be seen, and that everything
   would be so thoroughly regulated, that there would be no more vices in
   the world." -- Fr. Ser.

   [183] "Mais ce sont tous vices cachez, et qui n'apparoissent pas devant
   les yeux des hommes." -- "But all these are concealed vices, and do not
   show themselves before the eyes of men."

   2 Timothy 3:8-12

   8. Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist
   the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.

   8. Quemadmodum autem Iannes et Iambres restiterunt Mosi, ita et hi
   resistunt veritati, homines corrupti mente, reprobi circa fidem.

   9. But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest
   unto all men, as theirs also was.

   9. Sed non proficient amplius; amentia enim eorum manifesta erit
   omnibus, sicut et illorum fuit.

   10. But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose,
   faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,

   10. Tu autem assectatus es meam doctrinam institutionem, propositum,
   fidem, tolerantiam, dilectionem, patientiam,

   11. Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at
   Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all
   the Lord delivered me.

   11. Persequutiones, afflictiones, quae mihi acciderunt Antiochae,
   Iconii, Lystris, quas, inquam, persequutiones sustinuerim; sed ex
   omnibus me Dominus

   12. Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
   persecution.

   12. Et omnes, qui piè volunt in Christo Iesu, persequutionem patientur.

   8 And as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses This comparison confirms
   what I have already said about the "last times", for he means that the
   same thing happens to us under the gospel, which the Church experienced
   almost from her very commencement, or at least since the law was
   published. In like manner the Psalmist also speaks largely about the
   unceasing battles of the Church.

   "Often did they fight against me from my youth, now let Israel say. The
   wicked ploughed upon my back, they made long their furrows." (Psalm
   129:1,3)

   Paul reminds us, that we need not wonder if adversaries rise up against
   Christ to oppose his gospel, since Moses likewise had those who
   contended with him; for these examples drawn from a remote antiquity
   yield us strong consolation.

   It is generally believed; that the two who are mentioned, "Jannes and
   Jambres," were magicians put forward by Pharaoh. But from what source
   Paul learned their names is doubtful, except that it is probable, that
   many things relating to those histories were handed down, the memory of
   which God never permitted to perish. It is also possible that in Paul's
   time there were commentaries on the prophets that gave more fully those
   narratives which Moses touches very briefly. However that may be, it is
   not at random that he calls them by their names. The reason why there
   were two of them may be conjectured to have been this, that, because
   the Lord had raised up for his people two leaders, Moses and Aaron,
   Pharaoh determined to place against them the like number of magicians.

   9 But they shall not proceed further He encourages Timothy for the
   contest, by the confident hope of victory; for, although false teachers
   give him annoyance, he promises that they shall be, within a short
   time, disgracefully ruined. [184] Yet the event does not agree with
   this promise; and the Apostle appears to make a totally different
   declaration, a little afterwards, when he says that they will grow
   worse and worse. Nor is there any force in the explanation given by
   Chrysostom, that they will grow worse every day, but will do no injury
   to any person; for he expressly adds, "deceived and deceiving;" and,
   indeed, the truth of this is proved by experience. It is more correct
   to say, that he looked at them in various aspects; for the affirmation,
   that they will not make progress, is not universal; but he only means,
   that the Lord will discover their madness to many whom they had, at
   first, deceived by their enchantments.

   For their folly shall be manifest to all When he says, to all, it is by
   a figure of speech, in which the whole is taken for a part. And,
   indeed, they who are most successful in deceiving do, at first, make
   great boasting, and obtain loud applause; and, in short, it appears as
   if nothing were beyond their power. But speedily their tricks vanish
   into air; for the Lord opens the eyes of many, so that they begin to
   see what was concealed from them for a time. Yet never is the "folly"
   of false prophets discovered to such an extent as to be known to all.
   Besides, no sooner is one error driven away than new errors continually
   spring up.

   Both admonitions are therefore necessary. That godly teachers may not
   despair, as if it were in vain for them to make war against error, they
   must be instructed about the prosperous success which the Lord will
   give to his doctrine. But that they may not think, on the other hand,
   that they are discharged from future service, after one or two battles,
   they must be reminded that there will always be new occasion for
   fighting. But on this second point we shall speak afterwards; at
   present, let it suffice us, that he holds out to Timothy the sure hope
   of a successful issue, that he may be time more encouraged to fight,
   And he confirms this by the example which he had quoted; for, as the
   truth of God prevailed against the tricks of the magicians, so he
   promises that the doctrine of the gospel shall be victorious against
   every kind of errors that may be invented.

   10 But thou hast followed [185] In order to urge Timothy, he employs
   this argument also, that he is not an ignorant and untaught soldier,
   because Paul carried him through a long course of training. Nor does he
   speak of doctrine only; for those things which he likewise enumerates
   add much weight, and he gives to us, in this sentence, a very lively
   picture of a good teacher, as one who does not, by words only, train
   and instruct his disciples, but, so to speak, opens his very breast to
   them, that they may know, that whatever he teaches, he teaches
   sincerely. This is what is implied in the word purpose He likewise adds
   other proofs of sincere and unfeigned affection, such as faith,
   mildness, love, patience Such were the early instructions which had
   been imparted to Timothy in the school of Paul. Yet he does not merely
   bring to remembrance what he had learned from him, but bears testimony
   to his former life, that in this manner he may urge him to
   perseverance; for he praises him as an imitator of his own virtues; as
   if he had said, "Thou hast been long accustomed to follow my
   instructions; I ask nothing more than that thou shouldst go on as thou
   hast begun." It is his wish, however; that the example of his "faith,
   love, and patience" should be constantly before the eyes of Timothy;
   and for that reason he dwells chiefly on his persecutions, which were
   best known to him.

   11 But out of them all the Lord delivered me It is a consolation which
   mitigates the bitterness of afflictions, that they always have a happy
   and joyful end. If it be objected, that the success of which he boasts
   is not always visible, I acknowledge that this is true, so far as
   relates to the feeling of the flesh; for Paul had not yet been
   delivered. But when God sometimes delivers us, he testifies, in this
   manner, that he is present with us, and will always be present; for
   from the feeling, or actual knowledge, of present aid, our confidence
   ought to be extended to the future. The meaning, therefore, is as if he
   had said, "Thou hast known by experience that God hath never forsaken
   me, so that thou hast no right to hesitate to follow my example."

   12 And all who wish to live a godly life [186] Having mentioned his own
   persecutions, he likewise adds now, that nothing has happened to him
   which does not await all the godly. [187] And he says this, partly that
   believers may prepare themselves for submitting to this condition, and
   partly that good men may not view him with suspicion on account of the
   persecutions which he endures from wicked persons; as it frequently
   happens that the distresses to which men are subjected lead to
   unfavorable opinions concerning them; for he whom men regard with
   aversion is immediately declared by the common people to be hated by
   God.

   By this general statement, therefore, Paul classes himself with the
   children of God, and, at the same time, exhorts all the children of God
   to prepare for enduring persecutions; for, if this condition is laid
   down for "all who wish to live a godly life in Christ," they who wish
   to be exempt from persecutions must necessarily renounce Christ. In
   vain shall we endeavor to detach Christ from his cross; for it may be
   said to be natural that the world should hate Christ even in his
   members. Now hatred is attended by cruelty, and hence arise
   persecutions. In short, let us know that we are Christians on this
   condition, that we shall be liable to many tribulations and various
   contests.

   But it is asked, Must all men be martyrs? for it is evident that there
   have been many godly persons who have never suffered banishment, or
   imprisonment, or flight, or any kind of persecution. I reply, it is not
   always in one way that Satan persecutes the servants of Christ. But yet
   it is absolutely unavoidable that all of them shall have the world for
   their enemy in some form or other, that their faith may be tried and
   their steadfastness proved; for Satan, who is the continual enemy of
   Christ, will never suffer any one to be at peace during his whole life;
   and there will always be wicked men that are thorns in our sides.
   Moreover, as soon as zeal for God is manifested by a believer, it
   kindles the rage of all ungodly men; and, although they have not a
   drawn sword, yet they vomit out their venom, either by murmuring, or by
   slander, or by raising a disturbance, or by other methods. Accordingly,
   although they are not exposed to the same assaults, and do not engage
   in the same battles, yet they have a warfare in common, and shall never
   be wholly at peace and exempt from persecutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [184] "Thus we see, that the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of Paul, holds
   out two reasons to fortify us. When we see that Satan opposes, and that
   the truth of God is not received by all, but that there are bad men who
   labor to pervert everything, and who slander and falsify the truth,
   here are consolations provided for us. In the first place, that our
   Lord treats us in the same manner as he has treated the Church in all
   ages, that those who lived before us were not better situated in this
   respect; for God tried them by sending false pastors, or rather by
   giving free scope to Satan for sending them. Let us know what has
   happened since the law was published. Here is Moses, who was before the
   other prophets. Yet already the war was begun, and that evil has never
   ceased. If we must now endure the like, let us bear it with patience;
   for it is not reasonable to expect that our condition shall be better
   or easier than that of Moses, and of others who followed him. That is
   one argument. The second is that the result shall be prosperous and
   successful. Although we dislike fighting, and though it appears as if
   the truth of God were about to perish utterly, let us wait till God
   come forth in defense of it, for he will cause wicked men to be
   completely disgraced. After they have triumphed, God will, undoubtedly,
   discover their baseness, and we shall see how God takes care to support
   his cause, though that may not be evident for a time." -- Fr. Ser.

   [185] "Having spoken of the troubles which were to befall the Church,
   and having exhorted Timothy to be firm, so as not to shrink from them,
   the Apostle adds, that now, for a long time, he must have been prepared
   for all this, because he had been taught in a good school. Thou hast
   known intimately,' like one who had followed him step by step; for such
   is the import of the word which Paul uses: Thou hast known well the
   course which I have pursued.'" -- Fr. Ser.

   [186] "Et tous ceux aussi qui veulent vivre en la crainte de Dieu." --
   "And all those also who wish to live in the fear of God."

   [187] "Que rien ne luy est advenu que tous fideles ne doyvent aussi
   attendre." -- "That nothing has happened to him which all believers
   must not also look for."

   2 Timothy 3:13-17

   13. But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and
   being deceived.

   13. Mali autem homines et impostores proficient in pejus, errantes, et
   in errorem.

   14 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast
   been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;

   14. Tu autem mane in iis, quae didicisti, et quae credita sunt tibi,
   sciens a quo didiceris;

   15. And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which
   are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in
   Christ Jesus.

   15. Et quòd a pueritia Sacras litteras novisti, quae to eruditum
   reddere ad salutem per fidem, quae est in Christo Iesu.

   16. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
   doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
   righteousness:

   16. Omnis Scriptura divinitus inspirata est ac utilis ad doctrinam, ad
   redargutionem, ad correctionem, ad institutionem, qua est in justitia.

   17. That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all
   good works.

   17. Ut integer sit Dei homo, ad omne opus bonum formatus.

   13 But wicked men and impostors This is the most bitter of all
   persecutions, when we see wicked men, with their sacrilegious
   hardihood, with their blasphemies and errors, gathering strength. Thus
   Paul says elsewhere, that Ishmael persecuted Isaac, not by the sword,
   but by mockery (Galatians 4:29.) Hence also we may conclude, that in
   the preceding verse, it was not merely one kind of persecution that was
   described, but that the Apostle spoke, in general terms, of those
   distresses which the children of God are compelled to endure, when they
   contend for the glory of their Father.

   I stated, a little before, in what respect they shall grow worse and
   worse; for he foretells not only that they will make obstinate
   resistance, but that they will succeed in injuring and corrupting
   others. One worthless person will always be more effectual in
   destroying, than ten faithful teachers in building, though they labor
   with all their might. Nor are there ever wanting the tares which Satan
   sows for injuring the pure corn; and even when we think that false
   prophets are driven away, others continually spring up in other
   directions.

   Again, as to the power of doing injury, [188] it is not because
   falsehood, in its own nature, is stronger than truth, or that the
   tricks of Satan exceed the energy of the Spirit of God; but because
   men, being naturally inclined to vanity and errors, embrace far more
   readily what agrees with their natural disposition, and also because,
   being blinded by a righteous vengeance of God, they are led, as captive
   slaves, at the will of Satan. [189] And the chief reason, why the
   plague of wicked doctrines is so efficacious, is, that the ingratitude
   of men deserves that it should be so. It is highly necessary for godly
   teachers to be reminded of this, that they may be prepared for
   uninterrupted warfare, and may not be discouraged by delay, or yield to
   the haughtiness and insolence of adversaries.

   14 But as for thee, continue in those things which thou hast learned
   Although wickedness prevail, and push its way forward, he advises
   Timothy nevertheless to stand firm. And undoubtedly this is the actual
   trial of faith, when we offer unwearied resistance to all the
   contrivances of Satan, and do not alter our course for every wind that
   blows, but remain steadfast on the truth of God, as on a sure anchor.

   Knowing from whom thou hast learned them This is said for the purpose
   of commending the certainty of the doctrine; for, if any one has been
   wrong instructed, he ought not to persevere in it. On the contrary, we
   ought to unlearn all that we have learned apart from Christ, if we wish
   to be his disciples; as, for example, it is the commencement of our
   pure instruction in the faith to reject and forget all the instruction
   of Popery. The Apostle therefore does not enjoin Timothy to defend
   indiscriminately the doctrine which has been delivered to him, but only
   that which he knows to be truth; by which he means, that he must make a
   selection. [190] Besides, he does not claim this as a private
   individual, that what he has taught shall be reckoned to be a divine
   revelation; but he boldly asserts his own authority to Timothy, who, he
   was aware, knew that his fidelity and his calling had been proved. And
   if he was fully convinced that he had been taught by an Apostle of
   Christ, he concluded that therefore it was not a doctrine of man, but
   of Christ.

   This passage teaches us, that we ought to be as careful to guard
   against obstinacy in matters that are uncertain, (such as all the
   doctrines of men are,) as to hold within unshaken firmness the truth of
   God. Besides, we learn from it, that faith ought to be accompanied by
   prudence, that it may distinguish between the word of God and the word
   of men, so that we may not adopt at random everything that is brought
   forward. Nothing is more inconsistent with the nature of faith than
   light credulity, which allows us to embrace everything
   indiscriminately, whatever it may be, and from whomsoever it proceeds;
   because it is the chief foundation of faith, to know that it has God
   for its author.

   And which have been intrusted to thee [191] When he adds, that the
   doctrine had been intrusted to Timothy, this gives (auxesin) additional
   force to the exhortation; for to "commit a thing in trust" is something
   more than merely to deliver it. Now Timothy had not been taught as one
   of the common people, but in order that he might faithfully deliver
   into the hands of others what he had received.

   15 And that from (thy) childhood This was also no ordinary addition,
   that he had been accustomed, from his infancy, to the reading of the
   Scripture; for this long habit may make a man much more strongly
   fortified against every kind of deception. It was therefore a judicious
   caution observed in ancient times, that those who were intended for the
   ministry of the word should be instructed, from their infancy, in the
   solid doctrine of godliness, that, when they came to the performance of
   their office, they might not be untried apprentices. And it ought to be
   reckoned a remarkable instance of the kindness of God, if any person,
   from his earliest years, has thus acquired a knowledge of the
   Scriptures.

   Which are able to make thee wise unto salvation It is a very high
   commendation of the Holy Scriptures, that we must not seek anywhere
   else the wisdom which is sufficient for salvation; as the next verse
   also expresses more fully. But he states, at the same time, what we
   ought to seek in the Scripture; for the false prophets also make use of
   it as a pretext; and therefore, in order that it may be useful to us
   for salvation, it is necessary to understand the right use of it.

   Through faith, which is in Christ Jesus What if any one give his whole
   attention to curious questions? What if he adhere to the mere letter of
   the law, and do not seek Christ? What if he pervert the natural meaning
   by inventions that are foreign to it? For this reason he directs us to
   the faith of Christ as the design, and therefore as the sum, of the
   Scriptures; for on faith depends also what immediately follows.

   16 All Scripture; or, the whole of Scripture; though it makes little
   difference as to the meaning. He follows out that commendation which he
   had glanced at briefly. First, he commends the Scripture on account of
   its authority; and secondly, on account of the utility which springs
   from it. In order to uphold the authority of the Scripture, he declares
   that it is divinely inspired; for, if it be so, it is beyond all
   controversy that men ought to receive it with reverence. This is a
   principle which distinguishes our religion from all others, that we
   know that God hath spoken to us, and are fully convinced that the
   prophets did not speak at their own suggestion, but that, being organs
   of the Holy Spirit, they only uttered what they had been commissioned
   from heaven to declare. Whoever then wishes to profit in the
   Scriptures, let him first of all, lay down this as a settled point,
   that the Law and the Prophets are not a doctrine delivered according to
   the will and pleasure of men, but dictated by the Holy Spirit.

   If it be objected, "How can this be known?" I answer, both to disciples
   and to teachers, God is made known to be the author of it by the
   revelation of the same Spirit. Moses and the prophets did not utter at
   random what we have received from their hand, but, speaking at the
   suggestion of God, they boldly and fearlessly testified, what was
   actually true, that it was the mouth of the Lord that spake. The same
   Spirit, therefore, who made Moses and the prophets certain of their
   calling, now also testifies to our hearts, that he has employed them as
   his servants to instruct us. Accordingly, we need not wonder if there
   are many who doubt as to the Author of the Scripture; for, although the
   majesty of God is displayed in it, yet none but those who have been
   enlightened by the Holy Spirit have eyes to perceive what ought,
   indeed, to have been visible to all, and yet is visible to the elect
   alone. This is the first clause, that we owe to the Scripture the same
   reverence which we owe to God; because it has proceeded from him alone,
   and has nothing belonging to man mixed with it.

   And is profitable Now follows the second part of the commendation, that
   the Scripture contains a perfect rule of a good and happy life. When he
   says this, he means that it is corrupted by sinful abuse, when this
   usefulness is not sought. And thus he indirectly censures those
   unprincipled men who fed the people with vain speculations, as with
   wind. For this reason we may in the present day, condemn all who,
   disregarding edification, agitate questions which, though they are
   ingenious, are also useless. Whenever ingenious trifles of that kind
   are brought forward, they must be warded off by this shield, that
   "Scripture is profitable." Hence it follows, that it is unlawful to
   treat it in an unprofitable manner; for the Lord, when he gave us the
   Scriptures, did not intend either to gratify our curiosity, or to
   encourage ostentation, or to give occasion for chatting and talking,
   but to do us good; and, therefore, the right use of Scripture must
   always tend to what is profitable. [192]

   For instruction Here he enters into a detailed statement of the various
   and manifold advantages derived from the Scriptures. And, first of all,
   he mentions instruction, which ranks above all the rest; for it will be
   to no purpose that you exhort or reprove, if you have not previously
   instructed. But because "instruction," taken by itself, is often of
   little avail, he adds reproof and correction

   It would be too long to explain what we are to learn from the
   Scriptures; and, in the preceding verse, he has given a brief summary
   of them under the word faith. The most valuable knowledge, therefore,
   is "faith in Christ." Next follows instruction for regulating the life,
   to which are added the excitements of exhortations and reproofs. Thus
   he who knows how to use the Scriptures properly, is in want of nothing
   for salvation, or for a Holy life. Reproof and correction differ little
   from each other, except that the latter proceeds from the former; for
   the beginning of repentance is the knowledge of our sinfulness, and a
   conviction of the judgment of God. Instruction in righteousness means
   the rule of a good and holy life.

   17 That the man of God may be perfect. Perfect means here a blameless
   person, one in whom there is nothing defective; for he asserts
   absolutely, that the Scripture is sufficient for perfection.
   Accordingly, he who is not satisfied with Scripture desires to be wiser
   than is either proper or desirable.

   But here an objection arises. Seeing that Paul speaks of the
   Scriptures, which is the name given to the Old Testament, how does he
   say that it makes a man thoroughly perfect? for, if it be so, what was
   afterwards added by the apostles may be thought superfluous. I reply,
   so far as relates to the substance, nothing has been added; for the
   writings of the apostles contain nothing else than a simple and natural
   explanation of the Law and the Prophets, together with a manifestation
   of the things expressed in them. This eulogium, therefore, is not
   inappropriately bestowed on the Scriptures by Paul; and, seeing that
   its instruction is now rendered more full and clear by the addition of
   the Gospel, what can be said but that we ought assuredly to hope that
   the usefulness, of which Paul speaks, will be much more displayed, if
   we are willing to make trial and receive it?

   likewise reminded not to read the Holy Scripture so as to gratify our
   fancies, or to draw from it useless questions. Why? Because it is
   profitable for salvation, says Paul. Thus, when I expound the Holy
   Scripture, I must be guided by this consideration, that those who hear
   me may receive profit from the doctrine which I teach, that they may be
   edified for salvation. If I have not that desire, and do not aim at the
   edification of those who hear me, I am a sacrilegious person, profaning
   the word of God. On the other hand, they who read the Scripture, or who
   come to the sermon to listen, if they are in search of some foolish
   speculation, if they come here to take their amusement, are guilty of
   having profaned a thing so holy." -- Fr. Ser.

   CHAPTER 4
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Timothy 4:1-4

   1. I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who
   shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;

   1. Obtestor igitur ego coram Deo et Domino Iesu Christo, qui
   judicaturus est vivos et mortuos in apparitione sua et in regno suo;

   2. Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove,
   rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and doctrine.

   2. Praedica sermonem, insta tempestivè, intempestivè; argue, increpa,
   hortare cum omni lenitate et doctrina.

   3. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but
   after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having
   itching ears;

   3. Nam erit tempus, quum sanam doctrinam non sustinebunt; sed juxta
   concupiscentias suas coacervabunt sibi doctores, ut qui prurient
   auribus,

   4. And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be
   turned unto fables.

   4. Et a veritate quidem aures avertent, ad fabulas autem convertentur.

   1 I charge thee, therefore, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ It is
   proper to observe carefully the word therefore, by means of which he
   appropriately connects Scripture with preaching. This also refutes
   certain fanatics, who haughtily boast that they no longer need the aid
   of teachers, because the reading of scripture is abundantly sufficient.
   But Paul, after having spoken of the usefulness of Scripture, infers
   not only that all ought to read it, but that teachers ought to
   administer it, which is the duty enjoined on them. Accordingly, as all
   our wisdom is contained in the Scriptures, and neither ought we to
   learn, nor teachers to draw their instructions, from any other source;
   so he who, neglecting the assistance of the living voice, shall satisfy
   himself with the silent Scripture, will find how grievous an evil it is
   to disregard that way of learning which has been enjoined by God and
   Christ. Let us remember, I say, that the reading of Scripture is
   recommended to us in such a manner as not to hinder, in the smallest
   degree, the ministry of pastors; and, therefore, let believers endeavor
   to profit both in reading and in hearing; for not in vain hath God
   ordained both of them.

   Here, as in a very weighty matter, Paul adds a solemn charge,
   exhibiting to Timothy, God as the avenger, and Christ as the judge, if
   he shall cease to discharge his office of teaching. And, indeed, in
   like manner as God showed by an inestimable pledge, when he spared not
   his only-begotten Son, how great is the care which he has for the
   Church, so he will not suffer to remain unpunished the negligence of
   pastors, through whom souls, which he hath redeemed at so costly a
   price, perish or are exposed as a prey.

   Who shall judge the living and the dead More especially the Apostle
   fixes attention on the judgment of Christ; because, as we are his
   representatives, so he will demand a more strict account of evil
   administration. By "the living and the dead" are meant those whom he
   shall find still alive at his coming, and likewise those who shall have
   died. There will therefore be none that escape his judgment.

   The appearance of Christ and his kingdom mean the same thing; for
   although he now reigns in heaven and earth, yet hitherto his reign is
   not clearly manifested, but, on the contrary, is obscurely hidden under
   the cross, and is violently assailed by enemies. His kingdom will
   therefore be established at that time when, having vanquished his
   enemies, and either removed or reduced to nothing every opposing power,
   he shall display his majesty.

   2 Be instant in season, out of season By these words he recommends not
   only constancy, but likewise earnestness, so as to overcome all
   hindrances and difficulties; for, being, by nature, exceedingly
   effeminate or slothful, we easily yield to the slightest opposition,
   and sometimes we gladly seek apologies for our slothfulness. Let us now
   consider how many arts Satan employs to stop our course, and how slow
   to follow, and how soon wearied are those who are called. Consequently
   the gospel will not long maintain its place, if pastors do not urge it
   earnestly.

   Moreover, this earnestness must relate both to the pastor and to the
   people; to the pastor, that he may not devote himself to the office of
   teaching merely at his own times and according to his own convenience,
   but that, shrinking neither from toils nor from annoyances, he may
   exercise his faculties to the utmost. So far as regards the people,
   there is constancy and earnestness, when they arouse those who are
   asleep, when they lay their hands on those who are hurrying in a wrong
   direction, and when they correct the trivial occupations of the world.
   To explain more fully in what respects the pastor must "be instant,"
   the Apostle adds --

   Reprove, rebuke, exhort By these words he means, that we have need of
   many excitements to urge us to advance in the right course; for if we
   were as teachable as we ought to be, a minister of Christ would draw us
   along by the slightest expression of his will. But now, not even
   moderate exhortations, to say nothing of sound advices, are sufficient
   for shaking off our sluggishness, if there be not increased vehemence
   of reproofs and threatenings.

   With all gentleness and doctrine. A very necessary exception; for
   reproofs either fall through their own violence, or vanish into smoke,
   if they do not rest on doctrine Both exhortations and reproofs are
   merely aids to doctrine, and, therefore, have little weight without it.
   We see instances of this in those who have merely a large measure of
   zeal and bitterness, and are not furnished with solid doctrine. Such
   men toil very hard, utter loud cries, make a great noise, and all to no
   purpose, because they build without a foundation. I speak of men who,
   in other respects, are good, but with little learning, and excessive
   warmth; for they who employ all the energy that they possess in
   battling against sound doctrine, are far more dangerous, and do not
   deserve to be mentioned here at all.

   In short, Paul means that reproofs are founded on doctrine, in order
   that they may not be justly despised as frivolous. Secondly, he means
   that keenness is moderated by gentleness; for nothing is more difficult
   than to set a limit to our zeal, when we have once become warm. Now
   when we are carried away by impatience, our exertions are altogether
   fruitless. Our harshness not only exposes us to ridicule, but also
   irritates the minds of the people. Besides, keen and violent men seem
   generally unable to endure the obstinacy of those with whom they are
   brought into intercourse, and cannot submit to many annoyances and
   insults, which nevertheless must be digested, if we are desirous to be
   useful. Let severity be therefore mingled with this seasoning of
   gentleness, that it may be known to proceed from a peaceful heart.

   3 For there will be a time [193] From the very depravity of men he
   shews how careful pastors ought to be; for soon shall the gospel be
   extinguished, and perish from the remembrance of men, if godly teachers
   do not labor with all their might to defend it. But he means that we
   must avail ourselves of the opportunity, while there is any reverence
   for Christ; as if one should say that, when a storm is at hand, we must
   not labor remissly, but must hasten with all diligence, because there
   will not afterwards be an equally fit season.

   When they will not endure sound doctrine This means that they will not
   only dislike and despise, but will even hate, sound doctrine; and he
   calls it "sound (or healthful) doctrine," with reference to the effect
   produced, because it actually instructs to godliness. In the next verse
   he pronounces the same doctrine to be truth, and contrasts it with
   fables, that is, useless imaginations, by which the simplicity of the
   gospel is corrupted.

   First, let us learn from it, that the more extraordinary the eagerness
   of wicked men to despise the doctrine of Christ, the more zealous
   should godly ministers be to defend it, and the more strenuous should
   be their efforts to preserve it entire; and not only so, but also by
   their diligence to ward off the attacks of Satan. And if ever this
   ought to have been done, the great ingratitude of men has now rendered
   it more than necessary; for they who at first receive the gospel
   warmly, and make a show of some kind of uncommon zeal, afterwards
   contract dislike, which is by and by followed by loathing; others, from
   the very outset, either reject it furiously, or, contemptuously lending
   an ear, treat it with mockery; while others, not suffering the yoke to
   be laid on their neck, kick at it, and, through hatred of holy
   discipline, are altogether estranged from Christ and, what is worse,
   from being friends become open enemies. So far from this being a good
   reason why we should be discouraged and give way, we ought to fight
   against such monstrous ingratitude, and even to strive with greater
   earnestness than if all were gladly embracing Christ offered to them.

   Secondly, having been told that men will thus despise and even reject
   the word of God, we ought not to stand amazed as if it were a new
   spectacle, when we see actually accomplished that which the Holy Spirit
   tells us will happen. And indeed, being by nature prone to vanity, it
   is no new or uncommon timing, if we lend an ear more willingly to
   fables than to truth.

   Lastly, the doctrine of the gospel, being plain and mean in its aspect,
   is unsatisfactory partly to our pride, and partly to our curiosity. And
   how few are there who are endued with spiritual taste, so as to relish
   newness of life and all that relates to it! Yet Paul foretells some
   greater impiety of one particular age, against which he bids Timothy be
   early on his guard.

   Shall heap up to themselves teachers It is proper to observe the
   expression, heap up, by which he means that the madness of men will be
   so great, that they will not be satisfied with a few deceivers, but
   will desire to have a vast multitude; for, as there is an unsatiable
   longing for those things which are unprofitable and destructive, so the
   world seeks, on all sides and without end, all the methods that it can
   contrive and imagine for destroying itself; and the devil has always at
   hand a sufficiently large number of such teachers as the world desires
   to have. There has always been a plentiful harvest of wicked men, as
   there is in the present day; and therefore Satan never has any lack of
   ministers to deceive men, as he never has any lack of the means of
   deceiving.

   Indeed, this monstrous depravity, which almost constantly prevails
   among men, deserves that God, and his healthful doctrine, should be
   either rejected or despised by them, and that they should more gladly
   embrace falsehood. Accordingly, that false teachers frequently abound,
   and that they sometimes multiply like a nest of hornets, should be
   ascribed by us to the righteous vengeance of God. We deserve to be
   covered and choked by that kind of filth, seeing that the truth of God
   finds no place in us, or, if it has found entrance, is immediately
   driven from its possession; and since we are so much addicted to
   fabulous notions, that we never think that we have too great a
   multitude of deceivers. Thus what all abomination of Monks is there in
   Popery! If once godly pastor were to be supported, instead of ten Monks
   and as many priests, we should presently hear nothing else than
   complaints about the great expense. [194]

   The disposition of the world is therefore such that, by "heaping up"
   with insatiable desire innumerable deceivers, it desires to banish all
   that belongs to God. Nor is there any other cause of so many errors
   than that men, of their own accord, choose to be deceived rather than
   to be properly instructed. And that is the reason why Paul adds the
   expression, itching ears. [195] When he wishes to assign a cause for so
   great an evil, he makes use of an elegant metaphor, by which he means,
   that the world will have ears so refined, and so excessively desirous
   of novelty, that it will collect for itself various instructors, and
   will be incessantly carried away by new inventions. The only remedy for
   this vice is, that believers be instructed to adhere closely to the
   pure doctrine of the gospel.

   grace of God. For we are not speaking about Papists only, who fight
   furiously against us, but of those who adhere to the Protestant
   Reformation of the Gospel. We see that they would wish to be like
   unbridled calves. (They care not about a yoke, or government, or

   5 But watch thou in all things. He proceeds with the former
   exhortation, to the effect that the more grievous the diseases are, the
   more earnestly Timothy may labor to cure them; and that the nearer
   dangers are at hand, the more diligently he may keep watch. And because
   the ministers of Christ, when they faithfully discharge their office,
   are immediately called to engage in combats, he at the same time
   reminds Timothy to be firm and immovable in enduring adversity. [196]

   Do the work of an Evangelist That is, "Do that which belongs to an
   evangelist." Whether he denotes generally by this term any ministers of
   the gospel, or whether this was a special office, is doubtful; but I am
   more inclined to the second opinion, because from Ephesians 4:11 it is
   clearly evident that this was an intermediate class between apostles
   and pastors, so that the evangelists ranked as assistants next to the
   apostles. It is also more probable that Timothy, whom Paul had
   associated with himself as his closest companion in all things,
   surpassed ordinary pastors in rank and dignity of office, than that he
   was only one of their number. Besides, to mention an honorable title of
   office tends not only to encourage him, but to recommend his authority
   to others; and Paul had in view both of these objects.

   Render thy ministry approved If we read this clause as in the old
   translation, "Fulfill thy ministry," the meaning will be: "Thou canst
   not fully discharge the office intrusted to thee but by doing those
   things which I have enjoined. Wherefore see that you fail not in the
   middle of the course." But because plerophorein commonly means "to
   render certain" or "to prove," I prefer the following meaning, which is
   also most agreeable to the context, -- that Timothy, by watching, and
   by patiently enduring afflictions, and by constant teaching, will
   succeed in having the truth of his ministry established, because from
   such marks all will acknowledge him to be a good and faithful minister
   of Christ.

   6 For I am now offered as a sacrifice He assigns the reason for the
   solemn protestation which he employed. As if he had said, "So long as I
   lived, I stretched out my hand to thee; my constant exhortations were
   not withheld from thee; thou hast been much aided by my advices, and
   much confirmed by my example; the time is now come, that thou shouldst
   be thine own teacher and exhorter, and shouldst begin to swim without
   support: beware lest any change in thee be observed at my death."

   And the time of my dissolution is at hand [197] We must attend to the
   modes of expression by which he denotes his death. By the word
   dissolution he means that we do not altogether perish when we die;
   because it is only a separation of the soul from the body. Hence we
   infer, that death is nothing else than a departure of the soul from the
   body -- a definition which contains a testimony of the immortality of
   the soul.

   "Sacrifice" was a term peculiarly applicable to the death of Paul,
   which was inflicted on him for maintaining the truth of Christ; for,
   although all believers, both by their obedient life and by their death,
   are victims or offerings acceptable to God, yet martyrs are sacrificed
   in a more excellent manner, by shedding their blood for the name of
   Christ. Besides, the word spendesthai which Paul here employs, does not
   denote every kind of sacrifice, but that which serves for ratifying
   covenants. Accordingly, in this passage, he means the same thing which
   he states more clearly when he says,

   "But if I am offered on the sacrifice of your faith, I rejoice."
   (Philippians 2:17.)

   For there he means that the faith of the Philippians was ratified by
   his death, in precisely the same manner that covenants were ratified in
   ancient times by sacrifices of slain beasts; not that the certainty of
   our faith is founded, strictly speaking, on the steadfastness of the
   martyrs, but because it tends greatly to confirm us. Paul has here
   adorned his death by a magnificent commendation, when he called it the
   ratification of his doctrine, that believers, instead of sinking into
   despondency -- as frequently happens -- might be more encouraged by it
   to persevere.

   The time of dissolution This mode of expression is also worthy of
   notice, because he beautifully lessens the excessive dread of death by
   pointing out its effect and its nature. How comes it that men are so
   greatly dismayed at any mention of death, but because they think that
   they perish utterly when they die? On the contrary, Paul, by calling it
   "Dissolution," affirms that man does not perish, but teaches that the
   soul is merely separated from the body. It is with the same object that
   he fearlessly declares that "the time is at hand," which he could not
   have done unless he had despised death; for although this is a natural
   feeling, which can never be entirely taken away, that man dreads and
   shrinks from death, yet that terror must be vanquished by faith, that
   it may not prevent us from departing form this world in an obedient
   manner, whenever God shall call us.

   7 I have fought the good fight Because it is customary to form a
   judgment from the event, Paul's fight might have been condemned on the
   ground that it did not end happily. He therefore boasts that it is
   excellent, whatever may be the light in which it is regarded by the
   world. This declaration is a testimony of eminent faith; for not only
   was Paul accounted wretched in the opinion of all, but his death also
   was to be ignominious. Who then would not have said that he fought
   without success? But he does not rely on the corrupt judgments of men.
   On the contrary, by magnanimous courage he rises above every calamity,
   so that nothing opposes his happiness and glory; and therefore he
   declares "the fight which he fought" to be good and honorable.

   I have finished my course He even congratulates himself on his death,
   because it may be regarded as the goal or termination of his course. We
   know that they who run a race have gained their wish when they have
   reached the goal. In this manner also he affirms that to Christ's
   combatants death is desirable, because it puts an end to their labors;
   and, on the other hand, he likewise declares that we ought never to
   rest in this life, because it is of no advantage to have run well and
   constantly from the beginning to the middle of the course, if we do not
   reach the goal.

   I have kept the faith [198] This may have a twofold meaning, either
   that to the last he was a faithful soldier to his captain, or that he
   continued in the right doctrine. Both meanings will be highly
   appropriate; and indeed he could not make his fidelity acceptable to
   the Lord in any other way then by constantly professing, the pure
   doctrine of the gospel. Yet I have no doubt that he alludes to the
   solemn oath taken by soldiers; as if he had said that he was a good and
   faithful soldier to his captain.

   8 Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness Having
   boasted of having fought his fight and finished his course, and kept
   the faith, he now affirms that he has not labored in vain. Now it is
   possible to put forth strenuous exertion, and yet to be defrauded of
   the reward which is due. But Paul says that his reward is sure. This
   certainty arises from turning his eyes to the day of the resurrection,
   and this is what we also ought to do; for all around we see nothing but
   death, and therefore we ought not to keep our eye fixed on the outward
   appearance of the world, but, on the contrary, to hold out to our minds
   the coming of Christ. The consequences will be, that nothing can
   detract from our happiness.

   Which the Lord the righteous Judge will render to me Because he
   mentions "the crown of righteousness" and "the righteous Judge," and
   employs the word "render," the Papists endeavor, by means of this
   passage, to build up the merits of works in opposition to the grace of
   God. But their reasoning is absurd. Justification by free grace, which
   is bestowed on us through faith, is not at variance within the
   rewarding of works, but, on the contrary, those two statements
   perfectly agree, that a man is justified freely through the grace of
   Christ, and yet that God will render to him the reward of works; for as
   soon as God has received us into favor, he likewise accepts our works,
   so as even to deign to give them a reward, though it is not due to
   them.

   Here two blunders are committed by the Papists; first, in arguing that
   we deserve something from God, because we do well by virtue of our
   freewill; and secondly, in holding that God is bound to us, as if our
   salvation proceeded from anything else than from his grace. But it does
   not follow that God owes anything to us, because he renders righteously
   what he renders; for he is righteous even in those acts of kindness
   which are of free grace. And he "renders the reward" which he has
   promised, not because we take the lead by any act of obedience, but
   because, in the same course of liberality in which he has begun to act
   toward us, he follows up his former gifts by those which are afterwards
   bestowed. In vain, therefore, and to no purpose, do the Papists labor
   to prove from this, that good works proceed from the power of freewill;
   because there is no absurdity in saying that God crowns in us his own
   gifts. Not less absurdly and foolishly do they endeavor, by means of
   this passage, to destroy the righteousness of faith; since the goodness
   of God -- by which he graciously embraces a man, not imputing to him
   his sins -- is not inconsistent with that rewarding of works which he
   will render by the same kindness with which he made the promise. [199]

   And not to me only That all the rest of the believers might fight
   courageously along with him, he invites them to a participation of the
   crown; for his unshaken steadfastness could not have served for an
   example to us, if the same hope of obtaining the crown had not been
   held out to us.

   To all who love his coming [200] This is a singular mark which he
   employs in describing believers. And, indeed, wherever faith is strong,
   it will not permit their minds to fall asleep in this world, but will
   elevate them to the hope of the last resurrection. His meaning
   therefore is, that all who are so much devoted to the world, and who
   love so much this fleeting life, as not to care about the coming of
   Christ, and not to be moved by any desire of it, deprive themselves of
   immortal glory. Woe to our stupidity, therefore, which exercises such
   power over us, that we never think seriously about the coming of
   Christ, to which we ought to give our whole attention. Besides, he
   excludes from the number of believers those in whom the coming of
   Christ produces terror and alarm; for it cannot be loved unless it be
   regarded as pleasant and delightful.

   [196] "When the devil has raised his standard, and when scandals and
   disturbances abound everywhere, we cannot be sufficiently attentive to
   guard against them, unless we are fortified by patience, and are not
   discouraged by the adversity which we must endure. If this warning ever
   was advantageous, how exceedingly necessary is it at the present day!
   Has not the world arrived at the highest pitch of iniquity? We see that
   the majority furiously reject the gospel. As to others who pretend to
   welcome the gospel, what sort of obedience do they render to it? There
   is so much contempt and so much pride, that, as soon as vices are
   reproved, or more sharpness is used than suits the taste of those who
   would wish to have full permission to act wickedly, and whose sole aim
   is to destroy everything, they are filled with spite. Although Papists
   will permit their preaching Friars to cry out and storm against them,
   and at the same time do nothing but steep themselves in lies to their
   destruction, they who openly declare that they wish the reformation of
   the gospel cannot endure to be reproved when it is necessary, but gnash
   their teeth against God, and fulfill what Paul says to the Corinthians,
   that if deceivers came to impose upon them, they would bear with all
   tyranny, and would be quiet when they were buffeted; but if we teach
   them faithfully in the name of God and for their salvation, they are so
   fastidious that a single word will provoke them to rebellion; and if we
   persevere in doing our duty, war will be immediately declared. Would to
   God that these things were not so visible amongst us as they are!" --
   Fr. Ser.

   [197] "Car de moy je m'en vay maintenant estre sacrifie." -- "For, for
   my part, I am going to be now sacrificed."

   [198] "This word Faith' may indeed be taken for Fidelity; as if he had
   said that he was loyal to our Lord Jesus Christ, and that he never
   flinched, that he always performed what belonged to his office. But we
   may also take this word faith in its ordinary meaning, that Paul did
   not turn aside from the pure simplicity of the gospel, and even that he
   relied on the promises of salvation which had been given to him, and,
   having preached to others, shewed that he was in earnest in what he
   spoke. For, indeed, all the loyalty which God demands from us proceeds
   from our adhering firmly to his word, and being founded on it in such a
   manner that we shall not be moved by any storm or tempest that may
   arise." -- Fr. Ser.

   [199] "The Papists themselves ought to observe carefully what was said
   by one of those whom they call their Doctors. How would God render the
   crown as a righteous Judge, if he had not first given grace as a
   merciful Father? And how would there have been righteousness in us, had
   it not been preceded by the grace which justifies us? And how would
   that crown have been rendered as due, had not all that we have -- been
   given when it was not due?' These are the words of Augustin; and
   although the Papists do not choose to keep by the Holy Scripture, they
   ought at least not to be so base as to renounce that which they pretend
   to hold. But even this is not all. It is true that it is a doctrine
   which well deserves to be embraced, that God cannot be a righteous
   Judge to save us, unless he have been previously declared to be in the
   highest degree a merciful Father; that there will be no righteousness
   in us but that which he has placed there; and that he cannot reward us
   but by crowning his gifts. But it is also true, that, though God has
   given us grace to serve him, though we have laboriously done, according
   to our ability, all that was possible for us, though we have done so
   well that God accepts of it all; still there will be much to censure in
   all the best works that we have done, and the greatest virtue that can
   be perceived in us will be vicious." -- Fr. Ser.

   [200] "Son apparition." -- "His appearing."

   2 Timothy 4:9-13

   9. Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:

   9. Da operam, ut ad me venias cito.

   10. For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is
   departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.

   10. Demas enim me reliquit, amplexus hoc saeculum, et profectus est
   Thessalonicam, Crescens in Galliam, Titus in Dalmatiam.

   11. Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is
   profitable to me for the ministry.

   11. Lucas est solus mecum. Marcum assume, ut tecum adducas; est enim
   mihi utilis in ministerium.

   12. And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.

   12. Tychicum autem misi Ephesum.

   13. The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring
   with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.

   13. Paenulam, quam Troade reliqui apud Carpum, quum veniens, affer, et
   libros et membranas.

   9 Make haste, to come to me quickly. As he knew that the time of his
   death was at hand, there were many subjects -- I doubt not -- on which
   he wished to have a personal interview with Timothy for the good of the
   Church; and therefore he does not hesitate to desire him to come from a
   country beyond the sea. Undoubtedly there must have been no trivial
   reason why he called him away from a church over which he presided, and
   at so great a distance. Hence we may infer how highly important are
   conferences between such persons; for what Timothy had learned in a
   short space of time would be profitable, for a long period, to all the
   churches; so that the loss of half a year, or even of a whole year, was
   trivial compared with the compensation gained. And yet it appears from
   what follows, that Paul called Timothy with a view to his own
   individual benefit likewise; although his own personal matters were not
   preferred by him to the advantage of the Church, but it was because it
   involved the cause of the gospel, which was common to all believers;
   for as he defended it from a prison, so he needed the labors of others
   to aid in that defense.

   10 Having embraced this world It was truly base in such a man to prefer
   the love of this world to Christ. And yet we must not suppose that he
   altogether denied Christ or gave himself up either to ungodliness or to
   the allurements of the world; but he merely preferred his private
   convenience, or his safety, to the life of Paul. He could not have
   assisted Paul without many troubles and vexations, attended by imminent
   risk of his life; he was exposed to many reproaches, and must have
   submitted to many insults, and been constrained to leave off the care
   of his own affairs; and, therefore being overcome by his dislike of the
   cross, he resolved to consult his own interests. Nor can it be doubted,
   that he enjoyed a propitious gale from the world. That he was one of
   the leading men may be conjectured on this ground, that Paul mentions
   him amidst a very few at (Colossians 4:14,) and likewise in the Epistle
   to Philemon, (Philemon 1:24,) where also he is ranked among Paul's
   assistants; and, therefore, we need not wonder if he censures him so
   sharply on this occasion, for having cared more about himself than
   about Christ.

   Others, whom he afterwards mentions, had not gone away from him but for
   good reasons, and with his own consent. Hence it is evident that he did
   not study his own advantage, so as to deprive churches of their
   pastors, but only to obtain from them some relief. Undoubtedly he was
   always careful to invite to come to him, or to keep along with him,
   those whose absence would not be injurious to other churches. For this
   reason he had sent Titus to Dalmatia, and some to one place and some to
   another, when he invited Timothy to come to him. Not only so, but in
   order that the church at Ephesus may not be left destitute or forlorn
   during Timothy's absence, he sends Tychicus thither, and mentions this
   circumstance to Timothy, that he may know that that church will not be
   in want of one to fill his place during his absence.

   Bring the cloak which I left at Troas As to the meaning of the word
   phelone, [201] commentators are not agreed; for some think that it is a
   chest or box for containing books, and others that it is a garment used
   by travelers, and fitted for defending against cold and rain. Whether
   the one interpretation or the other be adopted, how comes it that Paul
   should give orders to have either a garment or a chest brought to him
   from a place so distant, as if there were not workmen, or as if there
   were not abundance both of cloth and timber? If it be said, that it was
   a chest filled with books, or manuscripts, or epistles, the difficulty
   will be solved; for such materials could not have been procured at any
   price. But, because many will not admit the conjecture, I willingly
   translate it by the word cloak. Nor is there any absurdity in saying
   that Paul desired to have it brought from so great a distance, because
   that garment, through long use, would be more comfortable for him, and
   he wished to avoid expense. [202]

   Yet (to own the truth) I give the preference to the former
   interpretation; more especially because Paul immediately afterwards
   mentions books and parchments. It is evident from this, that the
   Apostle had not given over reading, though he was already preparing for
   death. Where are those who think that they have made so great progress
   that they do not need any more exercise? Which of them will dare to
   compare himself with Paul? Still more does this expression refute the
   madness of those men who -- despising books, and condemning all reading
   -- boast of nothing but their own enthousiasmous divine inspirations.
   [203] But let us know that this passage gives to all believers [204] a
   recommendation of constant reading, that they may profit by it. [205]

   Here some one will ask, "What does Paul mean by asking for a robe or
   cloak, if he perceived that his death was at hand?" This difficulty
   also induces me to interpret the word as denoting a chest, though there
   might have been some use of the "cloak" which is unknown in the present
   day; and therefore I give myself little trouble about these matters.

   The second epistle unto Timotheus, ordained the first bishop of the
   church of the Ephesians, was written from Rome, when Paul was brought
   before Nero the second time.

   Scripta e Roma secunda ad Timotheum, qui primus Ephesi ordinatus fuit
   Episcopus, quum, Paulus iterum sisteretur Caesari Neroni.

   14 Alexander the coppersmith In this man was exhibited a shocking
   instance of apostasy. He had made profession of some zeal in advancing
   the reign of Christ, against which he afterwards carried on open war.
   No class of enemies is more dangerous or more envenomed than this. But
   from the beginning, the Lord determined that his Church should not be
   exempted from this evil, lest our courage should fail when we are tried
   by any of the same kind.

   Hath done me many evil things It is proper to observe, what are the
   "many evils" which Paul complains that Alexander brought upon him. They
   consisted in this, that he opposed his doctrine. Alexander was an
   artificer, not prepared by the learning of the schools for being a
   great disputer; but domestic enemies have always been abundantly able
   to do injury. And the wickedness of such men always obtains credit in
   the world, so that malicious and impudent ignorance sometimes creates
   trouble and difficulty greater than the highest abilities accompanied
   by learning. Besides, when the Lord brings his servants into contest
   with persons of this low and base class, he purposely withdraws them
   from the view of the world, that they may not indulge in ostentatious
   display.

   From Paul's words, (ver. 15,) for he vehemently opposed our discourses,
   we may infer that he had committed no greater offense than an attack on
   sound doctrine; for if Alexander had wounded his person, or committed
   an assault on him, he would have endured it patiently; but when the
   truth of God is assailed, his holy breast burns with indignation,
   because, in all the members of Christ that saying must hold good,

   "The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up." (Psalm 69:9.)

   And this is also the reason of the stern imprecation into which he
   breaks out, that the Lord may reward him according to his works. A
   little afterwards, when he complains that all had forsaken him, (Psalm
   69:9,) still he does not call down the vengeance of God on them, but,
   on the contrary, appears as their intercessor, pleading that they may
   obtain pardon. So mild and so merciful to all others, how comes it that
   he shows himself so harsh and inexorable towards this individual? The
   reason is this. Because some had fallen through fear and weakness, he
   desires that the Lord would forgive them; for in this manner we ought
   to have compassion on the weakness of brethren. But because this man
   rose against God with malice and sacrilegious hardihood, and openly
   attacked known truth, such impiety had no claim to compassion.

   We must not imagine, therefore, that Paul was moved by excessive warmth
   of temper, when he broke out into this imprecation; for it was from the
   Spirit of God, and through a well regulated zeal, that he wished
   eternal perdition to Alexander, and mercy to the others. Seeing that it
   is by the guidance of the Spirit that Paul pronounces a heavenly
   judgment from on high, we may infer from this passage, how dear to God
   is his truth, for attacking which he punishes so severely. Especially
   it ought to be observed how detestable a crime it is, to fight with
   deliberate malice against the true religion

   But lest any person, by falsely imitating the Apostle, should rashly
   utter similar imprecations, there are three things here that deserve
   notice. First, let us not avenge the injuries done to ourselves, lest
   self-love and a regard to our private advantage should move us
   violently, as frequently happens. Secondly, while we maintain the glory
   of God, let us not mingle with it our own passions, which always
   disturb good order. Thirdly, let us not pronounce sentence against
   every person without discrimination, but only against reprobates, who,
   by their impiety, give evidence that such is their true character; and
   thus our wishes will agree with God's own judgment otherwise there is
   ground to fear that the same reply may be made to us that Christ made
   to the disciples who thundered indiscriminately against all who did not
   comply with their views,

   "Ye know not of what spirit ye are." (Luke 9:55.)

   They thought that they had Elijah as their supporter, (2 Kings 1:10,)
   who prayed to the Lord in the same manner; but because they differed
   widely from the spirit of Elijah, the imitation was absurd. It is
   therefore necessary, that the Lord should reveal his judgment before we
   burst forth into such imprecations; and wish that by his Spirit he
   should restrain and guide our zeal. And whenever we call to our
   remembrance the vehemence of Paul against a single individual, let us
   also recollect his amazing meekness towards those who had so basely
   forsaken him, that we may learn, by his example, to have compassion on
   the weakness of our brethren.

   Here I wish to put a question to those who pretend that Peter presided
   over the church at Rome. Where was he at that time? According to their
   opinion, he was not dead; for they tell us, that exactly a year
   intervened between his death and that of Paul. Besides, they extend his
   pontificate to seven years. Here Paul mentions his first defense: his
   second appearance before the court would not be quite so soon. In order
   that Peter may not lose the title of Pope, must he endure to be charged
   with the guilt of so shameful a revolt? Certainly, when the whole
   matter has been duly examined, we shall find that everything that has
   been believed about his Popedom is fabulous.

   17 But the Lord assisted me He adds this, in order to remove the
   scandal which he saw might arise from that base desertion of his cause.
   [206] Though the church at Rome had failed to perform its duty, he
   affirms that the gospel had suffered no loss by it, because, leaning on
   heavenly power, he was himself fully able to bear the whole burden, and
   was so far from being discouraged by the influence of that fear which
   seized on all, that it became only the more evident that the grace of
   God has no need of receiving aid from any other quarter. He does not
   boast of his courage, but gives thanks to the Lord; that, when reduced
   to extremities, he did not give way nor lose heart under so dangerous a
   temptation. He therefore acknowledges that he was supported by the arm
   of the Lord, and is satisfied with this, that the inward grace of God
   served for a shield to defend him against every assault. He assigns the
   reason --

   That the proclamation might be confirmed The word "proclamation" is
   employed by him to denote the office of publishing the gospel among the
   Gentiles, which was especially assigned to him; [207] for the preaching
   of others did not so much resemble a proclamation, in consequence of
   being confined to the Jews. And with good reason does he make use of
   this word in many passages. It was no small confirmation of his
   ministry, that, when the whole world foamed with madness against him,
   and on the other hand, all human assistance failed him, still he
   remained unshaken. Thus he gave practical demonstration that his
   apostleship was from Christ.

   He now describes the manner of the confirmation, that all the Gentiles
   might hear that the Lord had so powerfully assisted him; for from this
   event they might infer that both their own calling and that of Paul
   were from the Lord.

   And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. By the word "lion,"
   many suppose that he means Nero. For my part, I rather think that he
   makes use of this expression to denote danger in general; as if he had
   said, "out of a blazing fire," or "out of the jaws of death." He means
   that it was not without wonderful assistance from God, that he escaped,
   the danger being so great that but for this he must have been
   immediately swallowed up.

   18 And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work He declares, that
   he hopes the same for the future; not that he will escape death, but
   that he will not be vanquished by Satan, or turn aside from the right
   course. This is what we ought chiefly to desire, not that the interests
   of the body may be promoted, but that we may rise superior to every
   temptation, and may be ready to suffer a hundred deaths rather than
   that it should come into our mind to pollute ourselves by any "evil
   work." Yet I am well aware, that there are some who take the expression
   evil work in a passive sense, as denoting the violence of wicked men,
   as if Paul had said, "The Lord will not suffer wicked men to do me any
   injury." But the other meaning is far more appropriate, that he will
   preserve him pure and unblemished from every wicked action; for he
   immediately adds, to his heavenly kingdom, by which he means that that
   alone is true salvation, when the Lord -- either by life or by death --
   conducts us into his kingdom.

   This is a remarkable passage for maintaining the uninterrupted
   communication of the grace of God, in opposition to the Papists. After
   having confessed that the beginning of salvation is from God, they
   ascribe the continuation of it to freewill; so that in this way
   perseverance is not a heavenly gift, but a virtue of man. And Paul, by
   ascribing to God this work of "preserving us to his kingdom," openly
   affirms that we are guided by his hand during the whole course of our
   life, till, having discharged the whole of our warfare, we obtain the
   victory. And we have a memorable instance of this in Demas, whom he
   mentioned a little before, because, from being a noble champion of
   Christ, he had become a base deserter. All that follows has been seen
   by us formerly, and therefore does not need additional exposition.

   END OF THE SECOND EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY.

   TO TWO EMINENT SERVANTS OF CHRIST,

   WILLIAM FARELL AND PETER VIRET,

   HIS DEARLY BELOVED BRETHREN AND COLLEAGUES,

   JOHN CALVIN

   OFFERS HIS SALUTATIONS.

   My Commentary -- which now goes forth bearing the inscription of your
   name -- is, indeed, a small gift; yet I fully believe that it will be
   acceptable to you, for this reason, that the subject of the Epistle
   induced me to make this Dedication. The task of putting the finishing
   hand to that building which Paul had begun in Crete, but left
   incomplete was undertaken by Titus. I occupy nearly the same position
   with regard to you.

   When you had made some progress in rearing this church with vast
   exertions, and at great risk, after some time had elapsed I came, first
   as your assistant, and afterwards was left as your successor, that I
   might endeavor to carry forward, to the best of my ability, that work
   which you had so well and so successfully begun. This work, I and my
   colleagues are endeavoring to perform, if not with so great progress as
   might have been desired yet heartily and faithfully, according to our
   small ability.

   To return to you, in consequence of holding the same relation to you
   which Paul assigned to Titus, I have been led to consider this
   similarity as a good reason for selecting you above all others, for
   dedicating to you this labor of mine. Meanwhile, to the present age,
   and perhaps to posterity, it will, at least, be some evidence of that
   holy union and friendship which exists between us. I think that there
   has never been, in ordinary life, a circle of friends so sincerely
   bound to each other as we have been in our ministry. With both of you I
   discharged here the office of pastor; and so far was there from being
   any appearance of envy, that you and I seemed to be one. We were
   afterwards separated by places; for you, Farell, were invited by the
   church of Neufchastel, which you had rescued from the tyranny of
   Popery, and brought into obedience to Christ; and you, Viret, are held
   in the same relation by the church of Lausanne.

   While each of us occupies his own position, our union brings together
   the children of God into the fold of Christ, and even unites them in
   his body; while it scatters not only those outward enemies who openly
   carry on war with us, but those nearer and domestic enemies, by whom we
   are inwardly assailed. For I reckon this also to be one of the benefits
   resulting from being closely related, that filthy dogs, whose bites
   cannot succeed so far as to tear and rend the Church of Christ, do
   nothing more than bark against it with all their might. And, indeed, we
   cannot too thoroughly despise their insolence, since we can, with
   truth, glory before God, and have proved to men by the clearest
   evidence, that we cultivate no other society or friendship than that
   which has been consecrated to the name of Christ, which has hitherto
   been advantageous to his Church, and which has no other aim than that
   all may be at one with us in Him.

   Farewell, my most excellent and most upright brethren. May the Lord
   Jesus continue to bless your pious labors!

   Geneva, 29th November 1549.

   COMMENTARIES

   ON

   THE EPISTLE TO TITUS

   THE ARGUMENT

   ON THE EPISTLE TO TITUS

   Paul, having only laid the foundations of the church in Crete, and
   hastening to go to another place, (for he was not the pastor of a
   single island only, but the Apostle of the Gentiles,) had given charge
   to Titus to prosecute this work as an Evangelist. It is evident from
   this Epistle that, immediately after Paul's departure, Satan labored
   not only to overthrow the government of the Church, but likewise to
   corrupt its doctrine.

   There were some who, through ambitious motives, wished to be elevated
   to the rank of pastors, and who, because Titus did not comply with
   their wicked desires, spoke unfavorably of him to many persons. On the
   other hand, there were Jews who, under the pretense of supporting the
   Mosaic law, introduced a great number of trifles; and such persons were
   listened to with eagerness and with much acceptance. Paul therefore
   writes with this design, to arm Titus with his authority, that he may
   be able to bear so great a burden; for undoubtedly there were some who
   fearlessly despised him as being but one of the ordinary rank of
   pastors. It is also possible that complaints about him were in
   circulation, to the effect that he assumed more authority than belonged
   to him when he did not admit pastors till he had made trial and
   ascertained their fitness.

   Hence we may infer, that this was not so much a private epistle of Paul
   to Titus, as it was a public epistle to the Cretans. It is not probable
   that Titus is blamed for having with too great indulgence raised
   unworthy persons to the office of bishop, or that, as an ignorant man
   and a novice, he is told what is that kind of doctrine in which he
   ought to instruct the people; but because due honor was not rendered to
   him, Paul clothes him with his own authority, both in ordaining
   ministers and in the whole government of the Church. Because there were
   many who foolishly desired to have another form of doctrine than that
   which he delivered, Paul approves of this alone -- rejecting all others
   -- and exhorts him to proceed as he had begun.

   First, then, he shows what sort of persons ought to be chosen for being
   ministers. [208] Among other qualifications, he requires that a
   minister shall be well instructed in sound doctrine, that by means of
   it he may resist adversaries. Here he takes occasion to censure some
   vices of the Cretans, but especially rebukes the Jews, who made some
   kind of holiness to consist in a distinction of food, and in other
   outward ceremonies. In order to refute their fooleries, he contrasts
   with them the true exercises of piety and Christian life; and, with the
   view of pressing them more closely, he describes what are the duties
   which belong to every one in his calling. These duties he enjoins Titus
   diligently and constantly to inculcate. On the other hand, he
   admonishes others not to be weary of hearing them, and shows that this
   is the design of the redemption and salvation obtained through Christ.
   If any obstinate person oppose, or refuse to obey, he bids him set that
   person aside. We now see that Paul has no other object in view than to
   support the cause of Titus, and to stretch out the hand to assist him
   in performing the work of the Lord.

   CHAPTER 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   Titus 1:1-4

   1. Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to
   the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is
   after godliness;

   1. Paulus servus Dei apostolus autem Iesu Christi secundum fidem
   electorum Dei et agnitionem veritatis quae secundum pietatem est

   2. In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before
   the world began;

   2. in spem vitae aeternae quam promisit qui non mentitur Deus ante
   tempora saecularia

   3. But hath in due time manifested his word through preaching, which is
   committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;

   3. manifestavit autem temporibus suis verbum suum in praedicatione quae
   credita est mihi secundum praeceptum salvatoris nostri Dei

   4. To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and
   peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.

   4. Tito dilecto filio secundum communem fidem gratia et pax a Deo Patre
   et Christo Iesu salvatore nostro

   1. A servant of God This extended and laborious commendation of his
   apostleship shows that Paul had in view the whole Church, and not Titus
   alone; for his apostleship was not disputed by Titus, and Paul is in
   the habit of proclaiming the titles of his calling, in order to
   maintain his authority. Accordingly, just as he perceives those to whom
   he writes to be disposed, he deals largely or sparingly in those
   ornaments. Here his design was, to bring into subjection those who had
   haughtily rebelled; and for this reason he extols his apostleship in
   lofty terms. He therefore writes this Epistle, not that it may be read
   in solitude by Titus in his closet, but that it may be openly
   published.

   An Apostle of Jesus Christ First, he calls himself "a servant of God,"
   and next adds the particular kind of his ministry, namely, that he is
   "an Apostle of Christ;" for there are various ranks among the servants
   of God. Thus he descends from the general description to the particular
   class. We ought also to keep in remembrance what I have said elsewhere,
   that the word servant means something else than ordinary subjection,
   (on account of which all believers are called "servants of God,") and
   denotes a minister who has received a particular office. In this sense
   the prophets were formerly distinguished by this title, and Christ
   himself is the chief of the prophets:

   "Behold my servant, I have chosen him." (Isaiah 42:1.)

   Thus David, with a view to his royal dignity calls himself "a servant
   of God." Perhaps, also, it is on account of the Jews that he designates
   himself "a servant of God;" for they were wont to lower his authority
   by alleging the law against him. He therefore wishes to be accounted an
   Apostle of Christ in such a manner that he may likewise glory in being
   a servant of the eternal God. Thus he shows not only that those two
   titles are quite consistent with each other, but that they are joined
   by a bond which cannot be dissolved.

   According to the faith of the elect of God [209] If any one doubt about
   his apostleship, he procures credit for it by a very strong reason,
   connecting it with the salvation "of the elect of God." As if he had
   said, "There is a mutual agreement between my apostleship and the faith
   of the elect of God; and, therefore, it will not be rejected by any man
   who is not a reprobate and opposed to the true faith."

   By "the elect" he means not only those who were at that time alive, but
   all that had been from the beginning of the world; for he declares that
   he teaches no doctrine which does not agree with the faith of Abraham
   and of all the fathers. So, then, if any person in the present day
   wishes to be accounted a successor of Paul, he must prove that he is
   the minister of the same doctrine. But these words contain also an
   implied contrast, that the gospel may suffer no damage from the
   unbelief and obstinacy of many; for at that time, as well as in the
   present day, weak minds were greatly disturbed by this scandal, that
   the greater part of those who boasted of the title of the Church
   rejected the pure doctrine of Christ. For this reason Paul shows that,
   though all indiscriminately boast of the name of God, there are many of
   that multitude who are reprobates; as he elsewhere (Romans 9:7)
   affirms, that not all who are descended from Abraham according to the
   flesh, are the lawful children of Abraham.

   And the knowledge of that truth I consider the copulative and to be
   here equivalent to that is; so that the passage might run thus:
   "according to the faith of the elect of God, that is, the knowledge of
   that truth which is according to godliness." This clause explains what
   is the nature of that "faith" which he has mentioned, though it is not
   a full definition of it, but a description framed so as to apply to the
   present context. For the purpose of maintaining that his apostleship is
   free from all imposture and error, he solemnly declares that it
   contains nothing but known and ascertained truth, by which men are
   instructed in the pure worship of God. But as every word has its own
   weight, it is highly proper to enter into a detailed explanation.

   First, when "faith" is called "knowledge," it is distinguished not only
   from opinion, but from that shapeless faith which the Papists have
   contrived; for they have forged an implicit faith destitute of all
   light of the understanding. But when Paul describes it to be a quality
   which essentially belongs to faith -- to know the truth, he plainly
   shews that there is no faith without knowledge.

   The word truth expresses still more clearly the certainty which is
   demanded by the nature of faith; for faith is not satisfied with
   probable arguments, but holds what is true. Besides, he does not speak
   of every kind of truth, but of the heavenly doctrine, which is
   contrasted with the vanity of the human understanding. As God has
   revealed himself to us by means of that truth, so it is alone worthy of
   the honor of being called "the truth" -- a name which is bestowed on it
   in many parts of Scripture.

   "And the Spirit will lead you into all truth." (John 16:13.)

   "Thy word is the truth." (John 17:17.)

   "Who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth?"
   (Galatians 3:l.)

   "Having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of the Son of God."
   (Colossians 1:5.)

   "He wisheth all to come to the knowledge of the truth."
   (1 Timothy 2:4.)

   "The Church is the pillar and foundation of the truth."
   (1 Timothy 3 15.)

   In a word, that truth is the right and sincere knowledge of God, which
   frees us from all error and falsehood. So much the more ought it to be
   valued by us, since nothing is more wretched than to wander like cattle
   during our whole life.

   Which is according to godliness. This clause especially limits "the
   truth" of which he had spoken, but at the same time commends the
   doctrine of Paul from the fruit and end of it, because it has no other
   object than that God should be worshipped in a right manner, and that
   pure religion should flourish among men. In this manner he defends his
   doctrine from every suspicion of vain curiosity, as he did before
   Felix, (Acts 24:10,) and afterwards before Agrippa, (Acts 26:1;) for,
   since all questions which do not tend to edification ought justly to be
   suspected and even hated by good men, the only lawful commendation of
   doctrine is this, that it instructs us to fear God and to bow before
   him with reverence. And hence we are also informed, that the greater
   progress any one has made in godliness, he is so much the better
   disciple of Christ; and that he ought to be reckoned a true theologian
   who edifies consciences in the fear of God.

   2. In the hope (or, on account of the hope) of eternal life This
   undoubtedly denotes the cause; for that is the force of the Greek
   preposition epi; and therefore it may be translated, "On account of the
   hope," or "On the hope." True religion and the practice of godliness --
   begin with meditation on the heavenly life; and in like manner, when
   Paul (Colossians 1:5) praises the faith and love of the Colossians, he
   makes the cause and foundation of them to be "the hope laid up in
   heaven." The Sadducees and all who confine our hope to this world,
   whatever they may pretend, can do nothing else than produce contempt of
   God, while they reduce men to the condition of cattle. Accordingly, it
   ought always to be the aim of a good teacher, to turn away the eyes of
   men from the world, that they may look up to heaven. I readily
   acknowledge that we ought to value the glory of God more highly than
   our salvation; but we are not now discussing the question which of
   these two ought to be first in order. All that I say is -- that men
   never seek God in a right manner till they have confidence to approach
   to him; and, therefore, that we never apply our mind to godliness till
   we have been instructed about the hope of the heavenly life. [210]

   Which God promised before the times of ages. As Augustine translated
   the words, Pro chronon aionion to mean -- not "the times of ages" but
   "eternal times," he gives himself great uneasiness about "the eternity
   of times," till at length he explains "eternal times" as denoting those
   which go beyond all antiquity. As to the meaning, he and Jerome and
   other commentators agree, that God determined, before the creation of
   the world, to give that salvation which he hath now manifested by the
   gospel. Thus Paul would have used the word promise incorrectly instead
   of decree; for before men existed there was no one to whom he could
   promise.

   For this reason, while I do not reject this exposition, yet when I take
   a close survey of the whole matter, I am constrained to adopt a
   different interpretation -- that eternal life was promised to men many
   ages ago, and not only to those who lived at that time, but also for
   our own age. It was not for the benefit of Abraham alone, but with a
   view to all who should live after him, that God said,

   "In thy seed shall all nations be blessed." (Genesis 22:18.)

   Nor is this inconsistent with what he says, in another sense, (2
   Timothy 1:9) that salvation was given to men "before the times of
   ages." The meaning of the word is still the same in both passages; for,
   since the Greek word aio'n, denotes an uninterrupted succession of time
   from the beginning to the end of the world, Paul declares, in that
   passage, that salvation was given or decreed for the elect of God
   before times began to flow. But because in this passage he treats of
   the promise, he does not include all ages, so as to lead us back beyond
   the creation of the world, but shews that many ages [211] have elapsed
   since salvation was promised.

   If any person prefer to view "the times of ages" as a concise
   expression for the ages themselves, he is at liberty to do so. But
   because salvation was given by the eternal election of God before it
   was promised, the act of giving salvation is put in that passage (2
   Timothy 1:9) before all ages, and therefore we must supply the word
   all. But here it means nothing more than that the promise is more
   ancient than a long course of ages, because it began immediately after
   the creation of the world. In the same sense he shews that the gospel,
   which was to have been proclaimed when Christ rose from the dead, had
   been promised in the Scriptures by the prophets; for there is a wide
   difference between the promise which was formerly given to the fathers
   and the present exhibition of grace.

   Who cannot lie. This expression apseudes is added for glorifying God,
   and still more for confirming our faith. And, indeed, whenever the
   subject treated of is our salvation, we ought to recollect that it is
   founded on the word of Him who can neither deceive nor lie. Moreover,
   the only proof of the whole of religion is -- the unchangeable truth of
   God. [212]

   3. But hath manifested There was indeed some manifestation of this
   kind, when God in ancient times spake by his prophets; but because
   Christ publicly, displayed by his coming those thing which they had
   obscurely predicted, and the Gentiles were afterwards admitted into the
   fellowship of the covenant, in this sense Paul says that what had
   formerly been exhibited in part "hath now been manifested."

   In his own times This has the same meaning as "the fullness of times."
   (Galatians 4:4.) He reminds us that the time when it pleased the Lord
   to do this -- must have been the most seasonable time for doing it; and
   he mentions this for the purpose of meeting the rashness of men, who
   have always the hardihood to inquire why it was not sooner, or why it
   is to-day rather than to-morrow. In order therefore that our curiosity
   may not exceed proper bounds, he shews that the "times" are placed in
   the hand, and at the disposal, of God, in such a manner that we ought
   to think that he does everything in the proper order and at the most
   seasonable time.

   His word. Or, by his word; for it is not uncommon with Greek writers to
   supply the preposition by. Or, he calls Christ the Word; if it be not
   thought preferable to supply something for the sake of completing the
   sentence. Were it not that the second exposition is a little forced, in
   other respects I should give it the preference. Thus John says,

   "What we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what our hands
   have handled of the Word of life; and the life was manifested." (1 John
   1:1, 2.)

   I therefore prefer what is a simple meaning, that God hath manifested
   the word concerning the life by the preaching of the gospel.

   The preaching, of which he speaks, is the gospel proclaimed, as the
   chief thing which we hear in it is -- that Christ is given to us, and
   that in him there is life.

   Which hath been committed to me. Because all are not indiscriminately
   fit for so important an office, and no man ought to thrust himself into
   it, he asserts his calling, according to his custom. Here we ought to
   learn -- what we have often remarked on other occasions -- that the
   honor is not due to any man, till he has proved that God has ordained
   him, for even the ministers of Satan proudly boast that God has called
   them, but there is no truth in their words. Now Paul states nothing but
   what is known and proved, when he mentions his calling.

   Besides, from this passage we learn for what purpose they were made
   apostles. It was for the sake of publishing the gospel, as he says
   elsewhere,

   "Woe to me if I preach not the gospel, for a dispensation is committed
   unto me." (1 Corinthians 9:16, 17.)

   Accordingly, they who enact dumb show, in the midst of idleness and
   luxury, are excessively impudent in boasting that they are the
   successors of the apostles.

   Of God our Savior He applies the same epithet to the Father and to
   Christ, so that each of them is our Savior, but for a different reason;
   for the Father is called our Savior, because he redeemed us by the
   death of his Son, that he might make us heirs of eternal life; and the
   Son, because he shed his blood as the pledge and the price of our
   salvation. Thus the Son hath brought salvation to us from the Father,
   and the Father hath bestowed it through the Son.

   4 To Titus, my own son, according to the common faith. Hence it is
   evident in what sense a minister of the word is said to beget
   spiritually those whom he brings to the obedience of Christ, that is,
   so that he himself is also begotten. Paul declares himself to be the
   father of Titus, with respect to his faith; but immediately adds, that
   this faith is common to both, so that both of them alike have the same
   Father in heaven. Accordingly, God does not diminish his own
   prerogative, when he pronounces those to be spiritual fathers along
   with himself, by whose ministry he regenerates whom he chooses; for of
   themselves they do nothing, but only by the efficacy of the Spirit. As
   to the remainder of the verse, the exposition of it will be found in
   the Commentaries on the former Epistles, and especially on the First
   Epistle to Timothy. [213]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [209] "If faith be the fruit of election, the prescience of faith does
   not influence the electing act of God. It is called the faith of God's
   elect,' Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of
   God's elect, (Titus 1:1,) that is, settled in this office to bring the
   elect of God to faith. If men be chosen by God upon the foresight of
   faith, or not chosen till they have faith, they are not so much God's
   elect as God is their elect: they choose God by faith, before God
   chooseth them by love. It had not been the faith of God's elect, that
   is, of those already chosen, but the faith of those that were to be
   chosen by God afterwards. Election is the cause of faith, and not faith
   the cause of election. Fire is the cause of heat, and not heat of fire;
   the sun is the cause of day, and not the day the cause of the rising of
   the sun. Men are not chosen because they believe, but they believe
   because they are chosen. The Apostle did ill else to appropriate that
   to the elect, which they had no more interest in by virtue of their
   election than the veriest reprobate in the world. If the foresight of
   what works might be done by his creatures was the motive of his
   choosing them why did he not choose the devils to redemption, who could
   have done him better service, by the strength of their nature, than the
   whole mass of Adam's posterity? Well, then, there is no possible way to
   lay the original foundation of this act of election and preterition in
   anything but the absolute sovereignty of God." -- Charnock.

   [210] "Thus he shews that it will never be possible for men to dedicate
   themselves entirely to the service of God, if they do not think more
   about God than about all things else. In short, there is no living
   root, no faith no religion, till we have been led to heaven, that is,
   till we know that God has not created us to keep us here in an earthly
   life with brute beasts, but that he has adopted us to be his heritage,
   and reckons us to be his children. If, therefore, we do not look up to
   heaven, it is impossible that we shall have true devotion to surrender
   ourselves to God, or that there shall be any faith or Christianity in
   us. And that is the reason why -- among all who, in the present day,
   are accounted Christians, and give themselves out to be such -- there
   are very few who have this true mark, which Paul has here given to all
   the children of God. It is because all are occupied with the present
   life, and are so firmly bound to it, that they cannot rise higher. Now
   perceiving this vice to be so common, so much the more ought we to
   guard against it, and break the force of that which we cannot
   altogether destroy, till we come into close fellowship with God, which
   will only be, when the hope of eternal life shall be actually and
   sincerely formed in our hearts."--Fr. Ser.

   [211] "Beaucoup de centeines d'ans." -- "Many centuries of years."

   [212] "What a strange sort of men are these, that will endure to be so
   exposed, so scorned, so trampled upon, as they that bear the Christian
   name commonly are? What is the reason of it? What account will a
   reasonable man give, why he will so expose himself? I will tell you the
   reason. Therefore we labor and suffer reproach, because we hope in God,
   in the living God, and we are pretty well persuaded we shall not
   finally be losers. We shall not have an ill bargain of it at last.' As
   the same Apostle, when he writes himself an Apostle and servant of
   Jesus Christ' seems to allow that he was to doom himself to all the
   sufferings and calamities that the enemies of the Christian cause could
   load him with and lay upon him, for his assuming to himself such names
   of an Apostle and servant of Jesus Christ.' But why should Paul, --
   that wise and prudent man, that learned man, that man of so
   considerable reputation among his own countrymen -- why should he come
   to be written among the Apostles and servants of Jesus Christ? Why,
   saith he, it is in hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie,
   hath promised. (Titus 1:1, 2.) I avow myself an Apostle and servant of
   Jesus Christ upon this inducement, and for this reason; and so I mean
   to continue unto the end. It is the hope of eternal life which God,
   that cannot lie, hath promised to me. He whose nature doth not allow
   him to deceive to whom it is impossible to lie, I firmly and securely
   hope in him; and, therefore, I will readily dispose myself to encounter
   all the difficulties and hardships which the service of Jesus Christ
   can lay me open to." -- Howe.

   Titus 1:5-6

   5. For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in
   order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as
   I had appointed thee:

   5. Huius rei gratia reliqui to Cretae ut ea quae desunt corrigas et
   constituas per civitates presbyteros sicut ego tibi disposui

   6. If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful
   children not accused of riot or unruly.

   6. Si quis sine crimine est unius uxoris vir filios habens fideles non
   in accusatione luxuriae aut non subditos

   5. For this reason I left thee in Crete This preface clearly proves,
   that Titus is not so much admonished on his own account as recommended
   to others, that no one may hinder him. Paul testifies that he has
   appointed him in his own room; and on that account all should
   acknowledge and receive him with reverence as the Apostle's deputy. The
   apostles had no fixed place assigned to them, but were charged to
   spread the gospel through the whole world; and for this reason, when
   they left one city or district to go to another, they were wont to
   place fit men as their substitutes, to complete the work which they had
   begun. Thus Paul affirms that he founded the church of the Corinthians,
   but that there were other workmen, [214] who must build on his
   foundation, that is, carry forward the building.

   This, indeed, belongs to all pastors; for the churches will always
   stand in need of increase and progress, as long as the world shall
   endure. But in addition to the ordinary office of pastors, the care of
   organizing the church was committed to Titus. Till the churches have
   been already organized, and reduced to some order, pastors were not
   usually appointed over them. But Titus held some additional charge,
   which consisted in giving a form to churches that had not yet been
   properly arranged, and in appointing a fixed kind of government
   accompanied by discipline. Having laid the foundation, Paul departed;
   and then it became the duty of Titus to carry the work higher, that the
   building might have fair proportions.

   This is what he calls correcting those things which are still wanting.
   The building of the Church is not a work so easy that it can be brought
   all at once to perfection. How long Paul was in Crete -- is uncertain;
   but he had spent some time there, and had faithfully devoted his labors
   to erect the kingdom of Christ. He did not lack the most consummate
   skill that can be found in man; he was unwearied in toil; and yet he
   acknowledged that he left the work rough and incomplete. Hence we see
   the difficulty; and, indeed, we find, by experience, in the present
   day, that it is not the labor of one or two years to restore fallen.
   churches to a tolerable condition. Accordingly, those who have made
   diligent progress for many years -- must still be attentive to correct
   many things. [215]

   Here it is highly proper to observe the modesty of Paul who willingly
   permits another person to complete the work which he had begun. And,
   indeed, although Titus is greatly inferior to him, he does not refuse
   to have him for epanorthoten a "corrector," to give the finishing hand
   to his work. Such ought to be the dispositions of godly teachers; not
   that every one should labor to make everything bend to his own
   ambitious views, but that they should strive to assist each other, and
   that, when any one has labored more successfully, he should be
   congratulated and not envied by all the rest.

   And yet we must not imagine that Paul intended that Titus should
   correct those things which he had left undone, either through
   ignorance, or forgetfulness, or carelessness, but those things which he
   could not finish on account of the shortness of the time. In short, he
   enjoined Titus to make that correction which he would himself have
   made, if he had remained longer in Crete; not by varying -- not by
   changing anything, but by adding what was wanting; because the
   difficulty of such a work does not allow every part of it to be done in
   a single day.

   And appoint presbyters in each city [216] In the spiritual building
   this nearly comes next to doctrine, that pastors be ordained, to take
   charge of governing the Church; and therefore Paul mentions it here in
   preference to everything else. It is a point which ought to be
   carefully observed, that churches cannot safely remain without the
   ministry of pastors, and that consequently, wherever there is a
   considerable body of people, a pastor should be appointed over it. And
   yet he does not say that each town shall have a pastor, so that no
   place shall have more than one; but he means that no towns shall be
   destitute of pastors

   Presbyters or elders. It is well known, that it was not on account of
   age, that they received this appellation; for sometimes those who were
   still young -- such as Timothy -- were admitted to this rank. But in
   all languages it has been customary to apply this honorable designation
   to all rulers. Although we may conclude, from 1 Timothy 5:17, that
   there were two classes of presbyters, the context will immediately
   show, that here none other than teachers are meant, that is, those who
   were ordained to teach; for immediately afterwards, he will call the
   same persons "bishops."

   But it may be thought that he gives too much power to Titus, when he
   bids him appoint ministers for all the churches. That would be almost
   royal power. Besides, this method takes away from each church the right
   of choosing, and from the College of Pastors the power of judging; and
   thus the sacred administration of the Church would be almost wholly
   profaned. The answer is easy. He does not give permission to Titus,
   that he alone may do everything in this matter, and may place over the
   churches those whom he thinks fit to appoint to be bishops; but only
   bids him preside, as moderator, at the elections, which is quite
   necessary. This mode of expression is very common. In the same manner,
   a consul, or regent, or dictator is said to have created consuls, on
   account of having presided over the public assembly in electing them.
   Thus also Luke relates that Paul and Barnabas ordained elders in every
   church. (Acts 14:23.) Not that they alone, in an authoritative manner,
   appointed pastors which the churches had neither approved nor known;
   but that they ordained fit men, who had been chosen or desired by the
   people. From this passage we do indeed learn, that there was not at
   that time such equality among the ministers of Christ but that some one
   had authority and deliberative voice above others; but this has nothing
   to do with the tyrannical and profane custom which prevails in Popery
   as to Collations. The apostles had a widely different mode of
   procedure.

   6. If any one is blameless In order that no one may be angry with
   Titus, as if he were too rigorous or severe in rejecting any, Paul
   takes the whole blame to himself; [217] for he declares that he has
   expressly commanded, that no one may be admitted, unless he be such a
   person as is here described. Accordingly, as he testified, a little
   before, that he had invested Titus with authority to preside in the
   appointment of pastors, that others might allow to him that right; so
   he now relates the injunction which he had given, lest the severity of
   Titus should be exposed to the illwill of the ignorant, or the slanders
   of wicked men.

   As this passage presents to us a lively portrait of a lawful bishop, we
   ought to observe it carefully; but, on the other hand, as almost
   everything that is here contained has been explained by me in the
   Commentary on the First Epistle to Timothy, it will be enough at
   present to touch on it slightly. When he says, that a bishop must be
   anenkleos, blameless, he does not mean one who is exempt from every
   vice, (for no such person could at any time be found,) but one who is
   marked by no disgrace that would lessen his authority. He means,
   therefore, that he shall be a man of unblemished reputation. [218]

   The husband of one wife The reason why this rule is laid down -- has
   been explained by us in the Commentary on the First Epistle to Timothy.
   [219] Polygamy was so common among the Jews, that the wicked custom had
   nearly passed into a law. If any man had married two wives before he
   made a profession of Christianity, it would have been cruel to compel
   him to divorce one of them; and therefore the apostles endured what was
   in itself faulty, because they could not correct it. Besides, they who
   had involved themselves by marrying more than one wife at a time, even
   though they had been prepared to testify their repentance by retaining
   but one wife, had, nevertheless, given a sign of their incontinence,
   which might have been a brand on their good name. The meaning is the
   same as if Paul had enjoined them to elect those who had lived chastely
   in marriage -- had been satisfied with having a single wife, and had
   forbidden those who had manifested the power of lust by marrying many
   wives. At the same time, he who, having become an unmarried man by the
   death of his wife, marries another, ought, nevertheless, to be
   accounted "the husband of one wife;" for the apostle does not say, that
   they shall choose him who has been, but him who is, "the husband of one
   wife."

   Having believing children Seeing that it is required that a pastor
   shall have prudence and gravity, it is proper that those qualities
   should be exhibited in his family; for how shall that man who cannot
   rule his own house -- be able to govern the church! Besides, not only
   must the bishop himself be free from reproach, but his whole family
   ought to be a sort of mirror of chaste and honorable discipline; and,
   therefore, in the First Epistle to Timothy, he not less strictly
   enjoins their wives what they ought to be. [220]

   First, he demands that the children shall be "believers;" whence it is
   obvious that they have been educated in the sound doctrine of
   godliness, and in the fear of the Lord. Secondly, that they shall not
   be devoted to luxury, that they may be known to have been educated to
   temperance and frugality. Thirdly, that they shall not be disobedient;
   for he who cannot obtain from his children any reverence or subjection
   -- will hardly be able to restrain the people by the bridle of
   discipline.

   [215] "Those who are guided by ambition would wish to be thought clever
   people on the first day; they would wish to enjoy such reputation as to
   have it thought that they discharged their duty so faithfully that
   nothing more could be desired. On the contrary, when we have labored
   during our whole life to edify the Church of God, still we shall not
   succeed to the full extent. Let us therefore know that we must not
   presume so far on our industry or our virtues, that he who is endued
   with more abundant graces can suddenly have edified the Church of God
   to perfection; but we must assist each other. He who is farthest
   advanced must know that he cannot do everything, and must bend his
   shoulders and ask assistance from those whom God has appointed, and
   must be well pleased that others make progress, provided that all aim
   at serving God and advancing the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ. If
   we look well to ourselves, there will always be reason to grieve,
   because we are very far from having performed our duty. And those who
   make themselves believe this or that, and say, Here is a church so well
   reformed that nothing more is needed' -- are mistaken; for if they knew
   what reformation is, they would beware of thinking that there was no
   room for finding fault. Whatever pains we take in arranging matters,
   and bringing them into order, there are indeed many things which, when
   once begun, will follow in a regular train; but as to reaching
   perfection, we are very far from it."--Fr. Ser.

   matter."

   [218] "It is true, that the servants of God will never be without
   blame; as he even says, that they cannot avoid walking amidst disgrace
   and reproach. It is true, that Paul lived so virtuously that no fault
   could be found with him, and that too, before he came to the faith of
   Jesus Christ; so that he lived without reproach, and was a mirror and a
   jewel of holiness. Indeed he know not what he did, for hitherto he had
   not been directed by the Spirit of God; but he led a life so good that
   it was not liable to any reproach. And yet he tells us that he was
   pointed at with the finger, was mocked at, was reproached, was even
   accursed among believers, whose ingratitude was such that in his
   absence he was reviled and loaded with many slanders. So it is with the
   servants of God. But when Paul demands that they shall be without
   crime, he means that we should inquire and ascertain if the life of a
   man be pure and without blame, and if he continues to conduct himself
   in that manner. Although we cannot shut the mouths of all slanderers,
   that they shall not revile us, yet we must be without crime; for it is
   said, that we shall be reviled as evil-doers, but we shall be pure and
   innocent. And in what way? Before God we shall have this testimony,
   that he approves of us, and that all the talk against us is a
   lie."--Fr. Ser.

   Titus 1:7-9

   7. For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not
   selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to
   filthy lucre;

   7. oportet enim episcopum sine crimine esse sicut Dei dispensatorem non
   superbum non iracundum non vinolentum non percussorem non turpilucri
   cupidum

   8. But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy,
   temperate;

   8. sed hospitalem benignum sobrium iustum sanctum continentem

   9. Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may
   be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the
   gainsayers.

   9. amplectentem eum qui secundum doctrinam est fidelem sermonem ut
   potens sit et exhortari in doctrina sana et eos qui contradicunt
   arguere

   7. For a bishop ought to be blameless, as a governor of the house of
   God He again repeats, that they who aspire to the office of a bishop
   ought to retain an unspotted reputation; and he confirms it by this
   argument, that, because the Church is the house of God, every person
   who is appointed to govern it -- is constituted, as it were, governor
   of the house of God. Now, he would be ill spoken of among men, who
   should take a scandalous and infamous person, and make him his steward;
   and therefore it would be far more base and intolerable to appoint such
   persons to be rulers of the household of God. The Latin word
   dispensator (steward or manager) -- employed in the old translation,
   and retained by Erasmus -- does not at all express Paul's meaning; for,
   in order that greater care may be exercised in the election, he adorns
   the office of a bishop within this honorable eulogy, that it is a
   government of the house of God, as he says to Timothy,

   "That thou mayest know how thou oughtest to conduct thyself in the
   house of the living God, the pillar and foundation of truth."
   (1 Timothy 3:15.)

   This passage plainly shows that there is no distinction between a
   presbyter and a bishop; for he now calls indiscriminately, by the
   latter name, those whom he formerly he employs both names in the same
   sense, without any distinction; as Jerome has remarked, both in his
   Commentary on this passage, and in his Epistle to Evagrius. And hence
   we may perceive how much greater deference has been paid to the
   opinions of men than ought to have been paid to them; for the language
   of the Holy Spirit, has been set aside, and the custom introduced by
   the arbitrary will of man has prevailed. For my own part, I do not find
   fault with the custom which has existed from the very beginning of the
   Church, that each assembly of bishops shall have one moderator; [221]
   but that the name of office which God has given to all, shall be
   conveyed to one alone, and that all the rest shall be deprived of it,
   is both unreasonable and absurd. Besides, to pervert the language of
   the Holy Spirit -- in such a manner that the same words shall have a
   different meaning from what he intended -- is excessive and profane
   hardihood. [222]

   Not self-willed With good reason does he condemn this vice in a bishop,
   whose duty it is not only to receive kindly those who come to him of
   their own accord, but also to allure those who withdraw themselves,
   that he may conduct all in like manner to Christ. Now, authadeia (as
   Plato says in one of his Epistles to Dion) tos eremias esti xunoikos
   that is, "self-will is closely allied to solitude;" for society and
   friendship cannot be cherished, when every man pleases himself to such
   an extent as to refuse to yield and accommodate himself to others. And,
   indeed, every (authades) "self-willed" person, as soon as an occasion
   presents itself, will instantly become a fanatic.

   8. But hospitable, devoted to kindness Hence it is evident how
   destructive is that plague which tears the Church by quarrels. With
   this vice he contrasts, first, docility, and next, gentleness and
   modesty towards all; for a bishop will never teach well, who is not
   also ready to learn. Augustine praises highly a saying of Cyprian: "Let
   him be as patient to learn as skillful to teach." Besides, bishops
   often need advice and warnings. If they refuse to be admonished, if
   they reject good advices, they will immediately fall headlong to the
   grievous injury of the Church. The remedy against these evils,
   therefore, is, that they be not wise to themselves.

   I have chosen to translate philagathon devoted to kindness, rather than
   with Erasmus, "a lover of good things;" for this virtue, accompanied by
   hospitality, appears to be contrasted by Paul with covetousness and
   niggardliness. He calls that man just, who lives among men without
   doing harm to any one. Holiness has reference to God; for even Plato
   draws this distinction between the two words.

   9. Holding fast the faithful word This is the chief gift in a bishop,
   who is elected principally for the sake of teaching; for the Church
   cannot be governed in any other way than by the word. "The faithful
   word" is the appellation which he gives to that doctrine which is pure,
   and which has proceeded from the mouth of God. He wishes that a bishop
   should hold it fast, so as not only to be well instructed in it, but to
   be constant in maintaining it. There are some fickle persons who easily
   suffer themselves to be carried away to various kinds of doctrine;
   while others are cast down by fear, or moved by any occurrence to
   forsake the defense of the truth. Paul therefore enjoins that those
   persons shall be chosen who, having cordially embraced the truth of
   God, and holding it firmly, never allow it to be wrested from them, or
   can be torn from it. And, indeed, nothing is more dangerous than that
   fickleness of which I have spoken, when a pastor does not stedfastly
   adhere to that doctrine of which he ought to be the unshaken defender.
   In short, in a pastor there is demanded not only learning, but such
   zeal for pure doctrine as never to depart from it.

   But what is meant by according to instruction or doctrine? [223] The
   meaning is, that it is useful for the edification of the Church; for
   Paul is not wont to give the name of "doctrine" to anything that is
   learned and known without promoting any advancement of godliness; but,
   on the contrary, he condemns as vain and unprofitable all the
   speculations which yield no advantage, however ingenious they may be in
   other respects. Thus, "He that teacheth, let him do it in doctrine;"
   that is, let him labor to do good to the hearers. (Romans 12:7.) In
   short, the first thing required in a pastor is, that he be well
   instructed in the knowledge of sound doctrine; the second is, that,
   with unwavering firmness of courage, he hold by the confession of it to
   the last; and the third is, that he make his manner of teaching tend to
   edification, and do not, through motives of ambition, fly about through
   the subtleties of frivolous curiosity, but seek only the solid
   advantage of the Church.

   That he may be able The pastor ought to have two voices: one, for
   gathering the sheep; and another, for warding off and driving away
   wolves and thieves. The Scripture supplies him with the means of doing
   both; for he who is deeply skilled in it will be able both to govern
   those who are teachable, and to refute the enemies of the truth. This
   twofold use of Scripture Paul describes when he says, That he may be
   able to exhort and to convince adversaries And hence let us learn,
   first, what is the true knowledge of a bishop, and, next, to what
   purpose it ought to be applied. That bishop is truly wise, who holds
   the right faith; and he makes a proper use of his knowledge, when he
   applies it to the edification of the people.

   This is remarkable applause bestowed on the word of God, when it is
   pronounced to be sufficient, not only for governing the teachable, but
   for subduing the obstinacy of enemies. And, indeed, the power of truth
   revealed by the Lord is such that it easily vanquishes all falsehoods.
   Let the Popish bishops now go and boast of being the successors of the
   apostles, seeing that the greater part of them are so ignorant of all
   doctrine, as to reckon ignorance to be no small part of their dignity.

   Titus 1:10-12

   10. For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially
   they of the circumcision:

   10. sunt enim multi et inoboedientes vaniloqui et seductores maxime qui
   de circumcisione sunt

   11. Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching
   things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.

   11. quos oportet redargui qui universas domos subvertunt docentes quae
   non oportet turpis lucri gratia

   12. One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians
   are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.

   12. dixit quidam ex illis proprius ipsorum propheta Cretenses semper
   mendaces malae bestiae ventres pigri

   10 For there are many unruly. [224] After having laid down a general
   rule, which ought to be everywhere observed, in order that Titus may be
   more attentive to adhere to it, he holds out to him the urgent
   necessity which ought to excite him more than all things else. He warns
   him that he has to deal with many obstinate and incorrigible persons,
   that many are puffed up with vanity and idle talk, that many are
   deceivers; and that therefore they ought to choose, on the other hand,
   such leaders as are qualified and well prepared to oppose them. For, if
   the children of this world, when dangers arise, increase their
   solicitude and watchfulness, it would be disgraceful for us, when Satan
   is using his utmost efforts to remain careless and inactive, as if we
   were in a state of peace.

   Unruly Instead of (inobedientes) disobedient, which is the rendering in
   the old translation for anupotaktoi Erasmus translates it
   (intractabiles) incorrigible. He means those who cannot endure to be
   brought to obey, and who throw off the yoke of subjection. He gives the
   appellation of vain talkers, [225] not only to the authors of false
   doctrines, but to those who, addicted to ambitious display, occupy
   themselves with nothing but useless subtleties. Mataiologia [226] (vain
   talking) is contrasted with useful and solid doctrine, and therefore
   includes all trivial and frivolous speculations, which contain nothing
   but empty bombast, because they contribute nothing to piety and the
   fear of God. And such is all the scholastic theology that is found, in
   the present day, in Popery. Yet he calls the same persons deceivers of
   minds. It may be thought preferable to view this as relating to a
   different class of persons; but, for my own part, I think that it means
   the same class; for the teachers of such trifles entice and fascinate
   the minds of men, so as no longer to receive sound doctrine.

   Chiefly they who are of the circumcision. He says that they are chiefly
   of the Jews; for it is highly requisite that such plagues shall be
   known by all. We ought not to listen to those who plead that we should
   spare the reputation of this or that individual, when the matter in
   question is the great danger of the whole Church. And so much the
   greater danger was to be apprehended from that nation, because it
   claimed superiority above others on account of the sacredness of its
   lineage. This is therefore the reason why Paul reproves the Jews more
   sharply, in order to take from them the power of doing injury.

   11 Whose mouth must be stopped A good pastor ought therefore to be on
   the watch, so as not to give silent permission to wicked and dangerous
   doctrines to make gradual progress, or to allow wicked men an
   opportunity of spreading them. But it may be asked, "How is it possible
   for a bishop to constrain obstinate and self-willed men to be silent?
   For such persons, even though they are vanquished in argument, still do
   not hold their peace; and it frequently happens that, the more
   manifestly they are refuted and vanquished, they become the more
   insolent; for not only is their malice strengthened and inflamed, but
   they give themselves up to indolence." I reply, when they have been
   smitten down by the sword of God's word, and overwhelmed by the force
   of the truth, the Church may command them to be silent; and if they
   persevere, they may at least be banished from the society of believers,
   so that they shall have no opportunity of doing harm. [227] Yet by
   "shutting the mouth" Paul simply means -- "to refute their vain
   talking," even though they should not cease to make a noise; for he who
   is convicted by the word of God, however he may chatter, has nothing to
   say.

   Who overturn whole houses. If the faith of one individual were in
   danger of being overturned, (for we are speaking of the perdition of a
   single soul redeemed by the blood of Christ) the pastor should
   immediately gird himself for the combat; how much less tolerable is it
   to see whole houses overturned?

   Teaching things which they ought not. The manner in which they were
   overturned is described in these words. Hence we may infer how
   dangerous it is to make even the smallest departure from sound
   doctrine; for he does not say that the doctrines, by which they
   overturned the faith of many, were openly wicked; but we may understand
   by this designation every kind of corruptions, when there is a turning
   aside from the desire of edification. Thus it is in reality, that,
   amidst so great weakness of the flesh, we are exceedingly prone to
   fall; and hence it arises, that Satan easily and speedily destroys, by
   his ministers, what godly teachers had reared with great and
   long-continued toil.

   He next points out the source of the evil, a desire of dishonest gain;
   by which he reminds us how destructive a plague avarice is in teachers;
   for, as soon as they give themselves up to the pursuit of gain, they
   must labor to obtain the favor and countenance of men. This is quickly
   followed by the corruption of pure doctrine.

   12 One of themselves, a prophet of their own I have no doubt that he
   who is here spoken of is Epimenides, who was a native of Crete; for,
   when the Apostle says that this author was "one of themselves," and was
   "a prophet of their own," he undoubtedly means that he belonged to the
   nation of the Cretans. Why he calls him a Prophet--is doubtful. Some
   think that the reason is, that the book from which Paul borrowed this
   passage bears the title Peri Chresmon "concerning oracles." Others are
   of opinion that Paul speaks ironically, by saying that they have such a
   Prophet -- a Prophet worthy of a nation which refuses to listen to the
   servants of God. But as poets are sometimes called by the Greeks
   (prophotai) "prophets," and as the Latin authors call them Vates, I
   consider it to denote simply a teacher. The reason why they were so
   called appears to have been, that they were always reckoned to be
   (genos theion kai enthousiastikon) "a divine race and moved by divine
   inspiration." Thus also Adimantus, in the Second Book of Plato's
   treatise Peri Politeias after having called the poets huious Theon
   "sons of the gods," adds, that they also became their prophets. For
   this reason I think that Paul accommodates his style to the ordinary
   practice. Nor is it of any importance to inquire on what occasion
   Epimenides calls his countrymen liars, namely, because they boast of
   having the sepulcher of Jupiter; but seeing that the poet takes it from
   an ancient and well-known report, the Apostle quotes it as a proverbial
   saying. [228]

   From this passage we may infer that those persons are superstitious,
   who do not venture to borrow anything from heathen authors. All truth
   is from God; and consequently, if wicked men have said anything that is
   true and just, we ought not to reject it; for it has come from God.
   Besides, all things are of God; and, therefore, why should it not be
   lawful to dedicate to his glory everything that can properly be
   employed for such a purpose? But on this subject the reader may consult
   Basil's discourse [229] pros tous neous, hopos an ex hell k.t.l

   ruining the Church, and who are altogether addicted to evil, it is true
   that, if we can bring them back in a gentle manner to the right path,
   we should endeavor to do so. But if they persist, and if we perceive
   that they are obstinate in their malice, we must not be wiser than the
   Holy Spirit. They must be known, they must be exposed, and their
   baseness must be held up to public view, that they may be abhorred, and
   that others may withdraw from them, as we have formerly seen in other
   passages. As for those who murmur when we make use of such liberty,
   they shew plainly that they aim at nothing but confusion in the Church.
   They do indeed make a show of having some regard to humanity. And must
   we degrade people, and hold them up to scorn, as if we wished to put

   of our Lord Jesus Christ trampled under foot, and souls which he has
   redeemed at so costly a price go to perdition, and all order be set

   Titus 1:13-16

   13. This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may
   be sound in the faith;

   13. testimonium hoc verum est quam ob causam increpa illos dure ut sani
   sint in fide

   14. Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that
   turn from the truth.

   14. non intendentes iudaicis fabulis et mandatis hominum aversantium se
   a veritate

   15. Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled
   and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is
   defiled.

   15. omnia munda mundis coinquinatis autem et infidelibus nihil mundum
   sed inquinatae sunt eorum et mens et conscientia

   16. They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being
   abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.

   16. confitentur se nosse Deum factis autem negant cum sunt abominati et
   incredibiles et ad omne opus bonum reprobi

   13. This testimony is true. [230] How worthiness soever the witness may
   have been, [231] yet the truth which has been spoken by him is
   acknowledged by Paul. The inhabitants of Crete, of whom he speaks with
   such sharpness were undoubtedly very wicked. The Apostle, who is wont
   to reprove mildly those who deserved to be treated with extreme
   severity, would never have spoken so harshly of the Cretans, if he had
   not been moved by very strong reasons. What term more reproachful than
   these opprobrious epithets can be imagined; that they were "lazy,
   devoted to the belly, destitute of truth, evil beasts?" Nor are these
   vices charged against one or a few persons, but he condemns the whole
   nation.

   It was truly a wonderful purpose of God, that he called a nation so
   depraved, and so infamous on account of its vices, to be among the
   first who should partake of the gospel; but his goodness is not less
   worthy of admiration, in having bestowed heavenly grace on those who
   did not even deserve to live in this world. [232] In that country so
   corrupt, as if in the midst of hell, the Church of Christ held a
   position, and did not cease to be extended, though it was infected by
   the corruption of the evils which prevailed there; for here Paul not
   only reproves those who were strangers to the faith, but expressly
   reproves those who had made a profession of Christianity. Perceiving
   that these vices so hateful have already taken root, and are spreading
   far and wide, he does not spare the reputation of the whole nation,
   that he may attempt the care of those whom there was some hope of
   healing.

   Wherefore rebuke them sharply Of that circumspection and prudence with
   which a bishop ought to be endowed, it is not the least part, that he
   regulate his manner of teaching by the dispositions and conduct of men.
   We must not deal with obstinate and unruly persons in the same manner
   as with those who are meek and teachable; for, in instructing the
   latter, we ought to use such mildness as is suitable to their teachable
   disposition, while the stubbornness of the former must be severely
   corrected, and (as the saying is) for a bad knot there must be a bad
   wedge. [233] The reason why Titus ought to be more sharp and severe in
   rebuking them has been already stated, namely, that they are "evil
   beasts."

   That they may be sound in the faith Whether the "soundness" or
   "healthfulness" is here contrasted with the diseases which he has
   mentioned, or whether he simply commands them to remain in the sound
   faith, is uncertain. I prefer the latter view. As they already are
   exceedingly vicious, and may easily be corrupted more and more, he
   wishes them to be more closely and strictly kept within the pure faith.
   [234]

   14 And may not listen to Jewish fables He now shews in what "sound
   faith" consists -- when it is not corrupted by any "fables." But in
   guarding against the danger he prescribes this remedy -- not to give
   ear to them; for God wishes us to be so attentive to his word, that
   there shall be no entrance for trifles. And, indeed, when the truth of
   God has once gained admission all that can be brought against it will
   be so tasteless, that it will not attract our minds. If, therefore, we
   wish to preserve the faith uncontaminated, let us learn carefully to
   restrain our senses, so that they may not give themselves up to strange
   contrivances; for, as soon as any person shall begin to listen to
   fables, he will lose the purity of faith.

   All trivial inventions he calls "fables," or, as we would say,
   "trifles;" for what he immediately adds, about "the commandments of
   men," has the same meaning. And he calls those men enemies of the truth
   who, not satisfied with the pure doctrine of Christ, mix up with them
   their own fooleries; for all that men of themselves contrive ought to
   be accounted "fabulous."

   He attributes this vice chiefly to the Jews, because, under the
   presence of the divine law, they introduced superstitious ceremonies.
   The Gentiles, being aware that they had been wretchedly deceived during
   their whole life, more easily renounced their former course of life;
   while the Jews, having been educated in the true religion, obstinately
   defended the ceremonies to which they had been accustomed, and could
   not be convinced that the Law had been abrogated. In this manner they
   disturbed all churches, because, as soon as the gospel began to make
   its appearance anywhere, they did not cease to corrupt its purity by
   mixing it with their leaven. Accordingly, Paul not only forbids them,
   in general terms, to degenerate from sound doctrine, but points out, as
   with the finger, the present evil which needed to be remedied, that
   they may be on their guard against it.

   15 To the pure all things indeed are pure He glances at one class of
   fabulous opinions; for the choice of the kinds of food, (such as was
   temporarily enjoined by Moses,) together with purifications and
   washings, were insisted on as being still necessary, and they even made
   holiness to consist almost wholly in these minute observances. How
   dangerous to the Church this was, we have already explained. First, a
   snare of bondage was laid on the consciences; and next, ignorant
   persons, bound by this superstition, had a veil drawn over their eyes,
   which hindered them from advancing in the pure knowledge of Christ. If
   any of the Gentiles refused to submit to this yoke, because he had not
   been accustomed to it, the Jews vehemently contended for it, as if it
   had been the chief article of religions. Not without good reason,
   therefore, does Paul firmly oppose such corrupters of the gospel. In
   this passage, indeed, he not only refutes their error, but wittily
   laughs at their folly, in laboring anxiously, any advantage, about
   abstaining from certain kinds of food and things of that nature

   In the first clause of this verse he upholds Christian liberty, by
   asserting, that to believers nothing is unclean; but at the same time
   he indirectly censures the false apostles who set no value on inward
   purity, which alone is esteemed by God. He therefore rebukes their
   ignorance, in not understanding that Christians are pure without the
   ceremonies enjoined by the Law; and next he chastises their hypocrisy,
   in disregarding uprightness of heart, and occupying themselves with
   useless exercises. But as the subject now in hand is not the health of
   the body, but peace of conscience, he means nothing else than that the
   distinction of the kinds of food, which was in force under the Law, has
   now been abolished. For the same reason it is evident, that they do
   wrong, who impose religious scruples on consciences in this matter; for
   this is not a doctrine intended for a single age, but an eternal oracle
   of the Holy Spirit, which cannot lawfully be set aside by any new law.

   Accordingly, this must be true till the end of the world, that there is
   no kind of food which is unlawful in the sight of God; and, therefore,
   this passage is fitly and appropriately quoted in opposition to the
   tyrannical law of the Pope, which forbids the eating of flesh on
   certain days. And yet I am not unacquainted with the sophistical
   arguments which they employ. They affirm, that they do not forbid the
   eating of flesh, because they allege that it is unclean, (for they
   acknowledge that all kinds of food are in themselves clean and pure,)
   but that abstinence from flesh is enjoined on another ground, that it
   has a tendency to tame the lust of the flesh; as if the Lord had
   forbidden to eat swine's flesh, because he judged swine to be unclean.
   Even under the Law the fathers reckoned that everything which God
   created is in itself pure and clean; but they held that they were
   unclean for this reason, that the use of them was unlawful, because God
   had forbidden it. All things are, therefore, pronounced by the Apostle
   to be pure, with no other meaning than that the use of all things is
   free, as regards the conscience. Thus, if any law binds the consciences
   to any necessity of abstaining from certain kinds of food, it wickedly
   takes away from believers that liberty which God had given them.

   But to the polluted and unbelieving nothing is pure. This is the second
   clause, in which he ridicules the vain and useless precautions of such
   instructors. He says that they gain nothing by guarding against
   uncleanness in certain kinds of food, because they cannot touch
   anything that is clean to them. Why so? Because they are "polluted,"
   and, therefore, by their only touching those things which were
   otherwise pure, they become "polluted."

   To the "polluted" he adds the "unbelieving," [235] not as being a
   different class of persons; but the addition is made for the sake of
   explanation. Because there is no purity in the sight of God but that of
   faith, it follows that all unbelievers are unclean. By no laws or
   rules, therefore, will they obtain that cleanness which they desire to
   have; because, being themselves "polluted," they will find nothing in
   the world that is clean to them. [236]

   But their mind and conscience are polluted. He shows the fountain from
   which flows all the filth which is spread over the whole life of man;
   for, unless the heart be well purified, although men consider works to
   have great splendor, and a sweet smell, yet with God they will excite
   disgust by their abominable smell and by their filthiness.

   "The Lord looketh on the heart," (1 Samuel 16:7,)

   and

   "his eyes are on the truth." (Jeremiah 5:3.)

   Whence it arises, that those things which are lofty before men are
   abomination before God.

   The mind denotes the understanding, and the conscience relates rather
   to the affections of the heart. But here two things ought to be
   observed; first, that man is esteemed by God, not on account of outward
   works, but on account of the sincere desire of the heart; and,
   secondly, that the filth of infidelity is so great, that it pollutes
   not only the man, but everything that he touches. On this subject let
   the reader consult Haggai 2:11-14. In like manner Paul teaches that

   "all things are sanctified by the word," (1 Timothy 4:5,)

   because men use nothing in a pure manner till they receive it by faith
   from the hand of God.

   16 They profess that they know God He treats those persons as they
   deserve; for hypocrites, who give their whole attention to minute
   observances, despise fearlessly what constitutes the chief part of the
   Christian life. The consequence is, that they display their vanity,
   while contempt of God is manifested in open crimes. And this is what
   Paul means; that they who wish to be seen abstaining from one kind of
   food -- indulge in wantonness and rebellion, as if they had shaken of
   the yoke; that their conduct is disgraceful and full of wickedness, and
   that not a spark of virtue is visible in their whole life.

   For they are abominable, disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.
   When he calls them, bdeluktous [237] abominable, he seems to allude to
   their pretended holiness, to which they gave their earnest attention.
   But Paul declares that they gain no advantage, for they do not cease to
   be profane and detestable. With good reason does he accuse them of
   disobedience; for nothing can be more haughty than hypocrites, who
   exert themselves so laboriously about ceremonies, in order that they
   may have it in their power to despise with impunity the chief
   requirements of the law. We may appropriately interpret the word
   adokimoi reprobate in an active signification; as if he had said, that
   they who wish to be thought so sagacious instructors in trifles -- are
   destitute of judgment and understanding as to good works.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [230] "The general character of the Cretans, noticed in Paul's Epistle
   to Titus, is confirmed by the testimony of antiquity. The Apostle,
   writing to Titus, who had been left in Crete to regulate the affairs of
   the Christian Church in that island, complains of many disorderly men
   there, -- many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, who subvert whole
   houses, (or families,) teaching things which they ought not, for filthy
   lucre's sake, (Titus 1:10, 11); and he quotes the following verse from
   one of themselves, a prophet of their own,' namely, Epimenides, who was
   a Cretan poet, and whose writings were by the ancients termed chresmoi
   or oracles,' Krotes aei pseustai, kaka theria, gasteres argai. The
   general import of which passage is, that the Cretans were a false
   people, and united in their character the ferocity of the wild beast
   with the luxury of the domesticated one.' The circumstance of Paul's
   styling Epimenides a prophet' is sufficiently explained by the fact of
   the words Poet and Prophet being often used promiscuously by the Greeks
   and Romans, -- probably because their poets pretended to be inspired,
   and were by some believed to be so. The Apostle adds, that the
   testimony of Epimenides is but too true, this witness is true.' How
   true the first part of it is, with respect to their deceit and lying,
   the following facts will attest. From the time of Homer, the island of
   Crete was regarded as the scene of fiction. Many authors affirm that,
   as a people, its inhabitants were infamous for their violation of
   truth; and at length their falsehood became so notorious, that
   Kretizein to Cretise, or imitate the Cretans, was a proverbial
   expression among the ancients for lying." -- Horne's Introduction.

   [231] "Combien que l'autheur soit profane et de nulle authorite." --
   "Although the author is a heathen and of no authority."

   [232] "De vivre en ce monde."

   [233] "A un mauvais noeud il faut un mauvais coin."

   [234] "We have to observe that here, in a single word, Paul declares to
   us by what means men may defend themselves. It is, by keeping the
   purity of faith. If, then, we do not turn aside from the simple
   doctrine of the gospel, but wish to be governed according to the will
   of God; if we are not carried away by our volatile passions, and do not
   walk according to our groveling appetites; in short, if we are good
   scholars of our God, and reckon it enough to have received the doctrine
   which he teaches us; if that be the case, we shall be fortified against
   all evil. It is true, the devil will seek to poison the whole world
   with his venom, and will spread his filth everywhere, so that the world
   will be full of so many corruptions that every place shall be infected
   by them. But however that may be, we must not turn aside from time
   simplicity of our faith, and must always seek to be instructed simply
   by our God. When we follow this course, though the devil may contrive
   all that he can, still we shall be fortified against all evil."--Fr.
   Ser.

   [235] "The Apostle joins defiled' and unbelieving,' to intimate that,
   without a true belief, nothing is clean. The understanding and the
   conscience are polluted. Both the man and his doings are impure." --
   Hervey.

   [236] "It is a dreadful condemnation pronounced on men, when it is said
   that nothing is clean to them -- that all is polluted and defiled, till
   God has renewed them. So far are we from being able to bring anything
   that is acceptable to him, that we can neither eat nor drink, nor put
   on our clothes, nor walk a single step, without corruption, and, what
   is more, by dwelling in the world we infect all the creatures. And this
   is the reason why they must call for vengeance at the last day against
   all unbelievers and reprobates. We have, therefore, good reason to be
   dissatisfied with ourselves and to be ashamed, when we see that they
   become hateful on our account and that we are so polluted as to have
   infected every thing that God had appropriated to our use, and even
   that there is nothing in us but all corruption -- nothing but a God
   cursed and disowned. When we are thus humbled, let us know, on the
   other hand, the inestimable blessing which God bestows on us, when he
   brings us back to himself, and, after having cleansed us, causes us to
   use all his blessings and bounties: with purity of heart and when we
   are assured that it is lawful for us to eat and drink, provided that we
   do so with all sobriety, and in a reasonable manner." -- Fr. Ser.

   [237] "1. They are said to be bdeluktoi, abominable, or shamefully
   addicted to all manner of evil. The word in the original, denotes the
   heinousness of those practices in which they allow themselves; and is
   derived from a word that signifies to send forth an offensive smell.
   For all sentiments of right and good are not so totally lost and
   obliterated among mankind, but that there are some things which even
   pagans would detest. 2. They are said to be also apeitheis,
   disobedient, which expression imports perseverance and obstinacy in an
   evil course. They will by no means -- by no importunity -- by no
   arguments whatever, be dissuaded from practices so unjustifiable and
   detestable in their own nature. They are resolved to run on, whatever
   it costs them -- to continue in sin, and in the profession of religion
   at the same time, which is the greatest absurdity imaginable. 3. They
   are said, lastly, to be pros pan ergon agathon adokimoi, reprobate to
   every good work; which signifies a disinclination to everything that is
   good, to everything that is worthy of praise. The word may be taken, as
   it is observed, either actively or passively, and so may signify not
   only to be disappointed by others, but to disapprove themselves; in
   which latter sense we must, at present, principally understand the
   phrase. They disapprove all that which claims their approbation and
   esteem; and are disaffected to all that good which the religion they
   profess would oblige them to the practice of. The expression,
   therefore, does not so much signify their omission of what is good, as
   their disinclination to it; but it further denotes that, if they do
   anything at all in religion, it is what they neither delight in, nor
   can endure. Every good work' is an expression of such latitude, that it
   may comprehend all the works of piety, mercy, and common justice. And
   so it is fit we should understand it in this place. Whatever they do of
   this kind, their hearts are averse to it, and they bear a disaffected
   mind to it all. And such as here described, persons may be found to be,
   notwithstanding their profession." -- Howe.

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   Titus 2:1-5

   1. But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:

   1. Tu autem loquere quae decet sanam doctrinam

   2. That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in
   charity, in patience.

   2. senes ut sobrii sint pudici prudentes sani fide dilectione patientia

   3. The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh
   holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good
   things;

   3. anus similiter in habitu sancto non criminatrices non vino multo
   servientes bene docentes

   4. That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their
   husbands, to love their children,

   4. ut prudentiam doceant adulescentulas ut viros suos ament filios
   diligant

   5. To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own
   husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

   5. prudentes castas domus curam habentes benignas subditas suis viris
   ut non blasphemetur verbum Dei

   1. But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine He points out
   the remedy for driving away fables, namely, that Titus should devote
   himself to edification. He gives the appellation of sound doctrine to
   that which may instruct men to godliness; for all trifles vanish away,
   when that which is solid is taught. When he enjoins him to speak those
   things which agree with "sound doctrine," it is as if he had said, that
   Titus must be continually employed in this preaching; for to mention
   these things once or twice would not be enough. And Paul does not speak
   of the discourse of a single day; but so long as Titus shall hold the
   office of pastor, he wishes him to be employed in teaching this
   doctrine.

   "Sound doctrine" is so called from the effect produced by it; as, on
   the contrary, he says, that unskillful men dote about questions which
   do no good. Sound, therefore, means wholesome, that which actually
   feeds souls. Thus, by a single word, as by a solemn proclamation, he
   banishes from the Church all speculations which serve rather to promote
   ostentation than to aid godliness, [238] as he did in both of the
   Epistles to Timothy.

   He makes "sound doctrine" to consist of two parts. The first is that
   which magnifies the grace of God in Christ, from which we may learn
   where we ought to seek our salvation; and the second is that by which
   the life is framed to the fear of God, and inoffensive conduct.
   Although the former, which includes faith, is far more excellent, and
   therefore ought to be more zealously inculcated; yet Paul, in writing
   to Timothy, was not careful about attending to order; for he had to
   deal with an intelligent man, to whom he would offer an insult, if he
   dictated to him word by word, as is usually done to apprentices or
   beginners. Under the person of Titus, indeed, he instructs the whole
   church of Crete; yet he attends to the rules of propriety, that he may
   not appear to distrust his prudence. Besides, the reason why he is
   longer in his exhortations is, that they who gave their whole attention
   to idle questions -- needed especially to be exhorted to the practice
   of a good and holy life; for nothing is better fitted to restrain the
   wandering curiosity of men than to know in what duties [239] they ought
   to be employed.

   2. That aged men be sober He begins with particular duties, that the
   discourse may be better adapted to the instruction of the people. And
   he does so, not only that he may accommodate himself to their capacity,
   but that he may press every one more closely; for a general doctrine
   produces a less powerful impression; but when by holding out a few
   cases, he has instructed every person about his duty, there is no one
   who may not easily conclude, that the Lord has sufficiently instructed
   him as to the work in which he ought to be employed. We must not
   therefore, look for a regular method here; for Paul's design was only
   to state briefly what were the subjects concerning which godly teachers
   ought to speak, and not to undertake to treat largely of those
   subjects.

   "Aged men" are mentioned by him in the first place. He wishes them to
   be "sober," because excessive drinking is a vice too common among the
   old. Gravity, which he next mentions, is procured by well-regulated
   morals. Nothing is more shameful than for an old man to indulge in
   youthful wantonness, and, by his countenance, to strengthen the
   impudence of the young. In the life of old men, therefore, let there be
   displayed semnotes "a becoming gravity," which shall constrain the
   young to modesty. This will be followed chiefly by temperance, which he
   immediately adds.

   Sound in faith I do not know whether the word "sound" or "healthy"
   contains an indirect allusion to the various diseases of old men, with
   which he contrasts this health of the soul; at least, I think so,
   though I do not affirm it. With good reason does he include in these
   three parts -- faith, love, patience -- the sum of Christian
   perfection. By faith we worship God; for neither calling upon him, nor
   any exercises of godliness, can be separated from it. Love extends to
   all the commandments of the second table. Next follows patience as the
   seasoning of "faith" and "love;" for without "patience" faith would not
   long endure, and many occurrences are taking place every day --
   instances of unhandsome conduct or evil temper, which irritate us so
   much that we should not only be languid, but almost dead, to the duties
   of love towards our neighbor, if the same "patience" did not support
   us.

   3. That aged women in like manner We very frequently see, that females
   advanced in age either continue to dress with the lightness of youthful
   years, or have something superstitious in their apparel, and seldom hit
   the golden mean. Paul wished to guard against both extremes, by
   enjoining them to follow a course that is agreeable both to outward
   propriety and to religion; or, if you choose to express it in simpler
   language, to give evidence, by their very dress, that they are holy and
   godly women.

   He next corrects another two vices, to which they are often addicted,
   when he forbids them to be slanderers and slaves to much wine
   Talkativeness is a disease of women, and it is increased by old age. To
   this is added, that women never think that they are eloquent enough, if
   they are not given to prattling and to slander -- if they do not attack
   the characters of all. The consequence is, that old women, by their
   slanderous talkativeness, as by a lighted torch, frequently set on fire
   may houses. Many are also given to drinking, so that, forgetting
   modesty and gravity, they indulge in an unbecoming wantonness.

   4. That they may teach young women temperance That they may be more
   attentive to duty, he shows that it is not enough if their own life be
   decent, if they do not also train young women, by their instructions,
   to a decent and chaste life. He therefore adds, that by their example
   they should train to temperance and gravity those younger women whom
   the warmth of youth might otherwise lead into imprudence.

   To love their husbands and their children I do not agree with those who
   think that this is a recapitulation of the advices which elderly women
   should give to those who are younger for a careful perusal of the
   context will enable any one easily to perceive that Paul goes on in
   explaining the duties of women, which apply equally to those who are
   older. Besides, the construction would be inappropriate, sophronizosi,
   sophronas einai [240] Yet while he instructs elderly females what they
   ought to be, he at the same time holds out to the younger the example
   which they ought to follow. Thus he indiscriminately teaches both. In
   short, he wishes women to be restrained, by conjugal love and affection
   for their children, from giving themselves up to licentious
   attachments, he wishes them to rule their own house in a sober and
   orderly manner, forbids them to wander about in public places, bids
   them be chaste, and at the same time modest, so as to be subject to the
   dominion of their husbands; for those who excel in other virtues
   sometimes take occasion from them to act haughtily, so as to be
   disobedient to their husbands.

   When he adds, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of, it is
   supposed that this relates strictly to women who were married to
   unbelieving husbands, who might judge of the gospel from the wicked
   conduct of their wives; and this appears to be confirmed by 1 Peter
   iii. 1. But what if he does not speak of husbands alone? And, indeed,
   it is probable that he demands such strictness of life as not to bring
   the gospel into the contempt of the public by their vices. As to the
   other parts of the verse, the reader will find them explained in the
   Commentary on the First Epistle to Timothy. [241]

   [238] "Let the doctrine which proceeds from thy mouth be sound. For he
   expressly uses this word, because it is the means of upholding us in
   true integrity, that the word of God, which is preached to us, be our
   spiritual pasture. This will not be perceived at first sight, but such
   is the fact. And why do we not perceive it? Because we are too sensual
   and earthly. For when we are in want of food for our body, we are
   immediately terrified, we become alarmed, we have not a moment of
   repose, for it touches us nearly. We are sensitive as to this fading
   life, but we are insensible to all that affects our souls; there is
   such brutal stupidity that we do not know our wants, though they press
   heavily upon us. Yet let it be observed that there is nothing but
   weakness in us, if we are not fed with the doctrine of God. And that is
   the reason why it is called sound,' for in this consists the health of
   our souls. As our bodies are kept in their proper condition by
   well-regulated nourishment, so our souls are supported by that doctrine
   which serves not only for nourishment but for medicine. For we are full
   of vices which are worse than diseases; and therefore our soul must be
   purged, and we must be healed of them. The method of doing this is,
   that we profit by the word of God. And so it is not without good reason
   that Paul gives to it this designation, that it is sound,' or that it
   is wholesome.'" -- Fr. Ser.

   [239] "En quels devotes et bones oeuvres." -- "In what duties and good
   works."

   [240] "Ina sophronizosi tas neas "These words point at the chief
   purpose of the instructions -- namely, that they should teach them to
   be sophrones acting as monitresses and regulators of their morals.
   Those instructions (as appears from what follows) were to turn on the
   domestic duties suitable to young married women, and each in the order
   of importance. The first is, as it were, their cardinal virtue; for it
   was well said by Socrates, (Ap. Stob. p. 488,) eusebeia gunaikeia, ho
   pros ton andra eros (female piety is love to her husband.') In like
   manner, modesty is, by Pericles, in his Funeral Oration (Thucyd. 2:45)
   called the virtue of the female sex.'" -- Bloomfield.

   Titus 2:6-10

   6. Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.

   6. Juvenes similiter hortare ut sobrii sint

   7. In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine
   shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,

   7. In omnibus to ipsum praebe exemplum bonorum operum in doctrina
   integritatem gravitatem

   8. Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the
   contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.

   8. Sermonem sanum inreprehensibilem ut is qui ex adverso est vereatur
   nihil habens malum dicere de nobis

   9. Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please
   them well in all things; not answering again;

   9. Servos dominis suis subditos esse in omnibus placentes non
   contradicentes

   10. Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn
   the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

   10. Non fraudantes, sed in omnibus fidem bonam ostendentes ut doctrinam
   salutaris nostri Dei ornent in omnibus

   6 Exhort likewise younger men He merely enjoins that young men be
   instructed to be temperate; for temperance, as Plato shows, cures the
   whole understanding of man. It is as if he had said, "Let them be well
   regulated and obedient to reason."

   7. In all things shewing thyself For doctrine will otherwise carry
   little authority, if its power and majesty do not shine in the life of
   the bishop, [242] as in a mirror. He wishes, therefore, that the
   teacher may be a pattern, which his scholars may copy. [243]

   A pattern of good works in doctrine, uprightness, gravity In the
   original Greek the style is here involved and obscure, and this creates
   ambiguity. First, he makes use of the words in doctrine, and then adds,
   in the accusative case, integrity, gravity, etc. [244] Without
   mentioning the interpretations given by others, I shall state that
   which appears to me to be the most probable. First, I connect these
   words, of good works in doctrine; for, after having enjoined Titus
   that, in teaching he shall inculcate the practice of good works, he
   wishes that good works, which correspond to this doctrine, may be
   visible in his life; and consequently the preposition in means that
   they shall be suitable, or shall correspond, to the doctrine. What
   follows is in no degree obscure; for; in order that he may exhibit a
   representation of his doctrine in morals, he bids him be "upright and
   grave."

   8. Sound speech, unblamable [245] "Sound speech" relates (in my
   opinion) to ordinary life and familiar conversation; for it would be
   absurd to interpret it as relating to public instruction, since he only
   wishes that Titus, both in his actions and in his words, shall lead a
   life that agrees with his preaching. He therefore enjoins that his
   words shall be pure and free from all corruption.

   Unblamable may apply either to the words or the person of Titus. I
   prefer the latter view, that the other nouns in the accusative case
   (which the Greek syntax easily allows) may depend upon it in this sense
   -- "that thou mayest shew thyself unblamable in gravity, in integrity,
   and in sound words."

   That the adversary may be ashamed. Although a Christian man ought to
   look at other objects, yet this must not be neglected, to shut the
   mouth of wicked men, as we are everywhere taught that we should give no
   occasion for slander. Everything that they can seize on as improper in
   our conduct is maliciously turned against Christ and his doctrine. The
   consequence is, that, through our fault, the sacred name of God is
   exposed to insult. Accordingly, the more we perceive that we are keenly
   observed by enemies, let us be the more attentive to guard against
   their calumnies, and thus let their malignity strengthen in us the
   desire of doing well.

   9. Servants, that they be subject to their masters It has been already
   said that Paul merely glances at some things by way of example, and
   does not explain the whole of these subjects, as if he undertook,
   expressly, to handle them. Accordingly, when he enjoins servants to
   please their masters in all things, this desire of pleasing must be
   limited to those things which are proper; as is evident from other
   passages of a similar nature, in which an exception is expressly added,
   to the effect that nothing should be done but according to the will of
   God.

   It may be observed that the Apostle dwells chiefly on this point, that
   they who are under the authority of others shall be obedient and
   submissive. With good reason he does this, for nothing is more contrary
   to the natural disposition of man than subjection, and there was danger
   lest they should take the gospel as a pretext for becoming more
   refractory, as reckoning it unreasonable that they should be subject to
   the authority of unbelievers. So much the greater care and diligence
   ought pastors to use for either subduing or checking this rebellious
   spirit.

   10 Not thievish but shewing all good faith He censures two vices that
   are common among servants, petulant replies, and a propensity to steal.
   [246] The comedies are full of instances of excessively ready talk, by
   which servants cheat their masters. Nor was it without reason that an
   exchange of names took place in ancient times, by which "servant "and
   "thief "became convertible terms. Thus prudence requires that we make
   our instructions apply to the morals of each individual.

   By faith he means fidelity to their masters; and therefore, to shew all
   faith is to act faithfully, without using fraud or doing injury, in
   transacting the affairs of their masters.

   That they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things This
   ought to be a very sharp spur of exhortation to us, when we learn that
   our becoming conduct adorns the doctrine of God, which, at the same
   time, is a mirror of his glory. And, indeed, we see that this usually
   happens; as, on the other hand, our wicked life brings disgrace upon
   it; for men commonly judge of us from our works. But this circumstance
   ought also to be observed, that God deigns to receive an "ornament"
   from shaves, whose condition was so low and mean that they were wont to
   be scarcely accounted men; for he does not mean "servants," such as we
   have in the present day, but slaves, [247] who were bought with money,
   and held as property, like oxen or horses. And if the life of those men
   is an ornament to the Christian name, much more let those who are in
   honor take care that they do not stain it by their baseness.

   grew hardened, because their masters did not use them gently, but
   treated them as brute beasts, struck them, teased them, put them to the
   torture, and frequently beat them, when they were absolutely naked, so
   that the blood flowed on all sides. Being thus hardened to evil, we
   must not be astonished if they had such corruption as to take revenge
   on their masters when they had any opportunity. But now Paul does not

   that was good and right -- an exception which he makes in other

   Titus 2:11-15

   11. For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
   men,

   11. Apparuit enim gratia Dei salutaris omnibus hominibus

   12. Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should
   live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;

   12. erudiens nos ut abnegantes impietatem et saecularia desideria
   sobrie et iuste et pie vivamus in hoc saeculo

   13. Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the
   great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

   13. expectantes beatam spem et adventum gloriae magni Dei et salvatoris
   nostri Iesu Christi

   14. Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity,
   and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.

   14. qui dedit semet ipsum pro nobis ut nos redimeret ab omni iniquitate
   et mundaret sibi populum acceptabilem sectatorem bonorum operum

   15. These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let
   no man despise thee.

   15. haec loquere et exhortare et argue cum omni imperio nemo to
   contemnat

   11 For the grace of God [248] hath appeared He argues from the design
   of redemption, which he shews to be a desire to live a godly and
   upright life. Hence it follows, that the duty of a good teacher is
   rather to exhort to a holy life than to occupy the minds of men with
   useless questions. "He hath redeemed us," says Zacharias in his song,
   --

   "that we may serve him in holiness and righteousness
   all the days of our life." (Luke 1:74, 75.)

   For the same reason Paul says, the grace of God hath appeared, teaching
   us; for he means that it ought to hold the place of instruction to us
   to regulate our life well. What is proclaimed concerning the mercy of
   God is seized by some as all occasion of licentiousness; while others
   are hindered by slothfulness from meditating on "newness of life." But
   the manifestation of the grace of God unavoidably carries along with it
   exhortations to a holy life.

   Bringing salvation to all men, [249] That it is common to all is
   expressly testified by him on account of the slaves of whom he had
   spoken. Yet he does not mean individual men, but rather describes
   individual classes, or various ranks of life. And this is not a little
   emphatic, that the grace of God hath let itself down even to the race
   of slaves; for, since God does not despise men of the lowest and most
   degraded condition, it would be highly unreasonable that we should be
   negligent and slothful to embrace his goodness.

   12 Teaching us that, denying, ungodliness He now lays down the rule for
   regulating our life well, and how we ought to begin, namely, with
   renouncing our former life, of which he enumerates two parts,
   "ungodliness and worldly desires." Under ungodliness, I include not
   only superstitions, in which they had gone astray, but irreligious
   contempt of God, such as reigns in men, till they have been enlightened
   in the knowledge of the truth. Although they have some profession of
   religion, yet they never fear and reverence God sincerely and honestly,
   but, on the contrary, have consciences that are useless, so that
   nothing is further from their thoughts than that they ought to serve
   God. [250]

   By worldly desires [251] he means all the affections of the flesh;
   because we look at nothing but the world, till the Lord has drawn us to
   himself. Meditation on the heavenly life begins with regeneration.
   Before we have been regenerated, our desires lean towards the world,
   and rest on the world.

   That we may live temperately, and righteously, and piously As he
   formerly mentioned those three, when he wished to give a comprehensive
   summary of Christian life, so he now makes it to consist of those
   three, "piety, righteousness, and temperance." "Piety" is religion
   towards God. "Righteousness" has place among men. He who is endowed
   with both of these lacks nothing for perfect virtue; and, indeed, in
   the law of God there is absolute perfection, to which nothing whatever
   can be added. But as the exercises of godliness may be regarded as
   appendages to the first table, so "temperance," which Paul mentions in
   this passage, aims at nothing else than keeping the law, and, as I said
   before about patience, [252] is added to the former as a seasoning. Nor
   does the Apostle contradict himself, when at one time he describes
   patience, and at another time temperance, as the perfection of a holy
   life; for they are not distinct virtues, since sophrosune (here
   translated temperance) includes patience under it.

   He adds, in this world, [253] because the Lord has appointed the
   present life for the trial of our faith. Although the fruit of good
   actions is not yet visible, yet the hope should be sufficient for
   stimulating us to doing well; and this is what he immediately adds, --

   13 Looking for that blessed hope From the hope of future immortality he
   draws an exhortation, and indeed, if that hope be deeply seated in our
   mind, it is impossible that it should not lead us to devote ourselves
   wholly to God. On the contrary, they who do not cease to live to the
   world and to the flesh never have actually tasted what is the worth of
   the promise of eternal life; for the Lord, by calling us to heaven,
   withdraws us from the earth.

   Hope is here put for the thing hoped for, otherwise it would be an
   incorrect mode of expression. He gives this appellation to the blessed
   life which is laid up for us in heaven. At the same time he declares
   when we shall enjoy it, and what we ought to contemplate, when we
   desire or think of our salvation.

   And the appearing of the glory of the great God and Savior I interpret
   the glory of God, to mean not only that by which he shall be glorious
   in himself, but also that by which he shall then diffuse himself on all
   sides, so as to make all his elect partakers of it. He calls God great,
   because his greatness -- which men, blinded by the empty splendor of
   the world, now extenuate, and sometimes even annihilate, as far as lies
   in their power -- shall be fully manifested on the last day. The luster
   of the world, while it appears great to our eyes, dazzles them so much
   that "the glory of God" is, as it were, hidden in darkness. But Christ,
   by his coming, shall chase away all the empty show of the world --
   shall no longer obscure the brightness, shall no longer lessen the
   magnificence, of his glory. True the Lord demonstrates his majesty
   every day by his works; but because men are prevented by their
   blindness from seeing it, it is said to be hidden in obscurity. Paul
   wishes that believers may now contemplate by faith that which shall be
   manifested on the last day, and therefore that God may be magnified,
   whom the world either despises, or; at least, does not esteem according
   to his excellence.

   It is uncertain whether these words should be read together thus, "the
   glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, the great God and our Savior," or
   separately, as of the Father and the Son, "the glory of the great God,
   and of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ." [254] The Arians, seizing on
   this latter sense, have endeavored to prove from it, that the Son is
   less than the Father, because here Paul calls the Father "the great
   God" by way of distinction from the Son. The orthodox teachers of the
   Church, for the purpose of shutting out this slander, eagerly contended
   that both are affirmed of Christ. But the Arians may be refuted in a
   few words and by solid argument; for Paul, having spoken of the
   revelation of the glory of "the great God," immediately added "Christ,"
   in order to inform us, that that revelation of glory will be in his
   person; as if he had said that, when Christ shall appear, the greatness
   of the divine glory shall then be revealed to us.

   Hence we learn, first, that there is nothing that ought to render us
   more active or cheerful in doing good than the hope of the future
   resurrection; and, secondly, that believers ought always to have their
   eyes fixed on it, that they may not grow weary in the right course;
   for, if we do not wholly depend upon it, we shall continually be
   carried away to the vanities of the world. But, since the coming of the
   Lord to judgment might excite terror in us, Christ is held out to us as
   our "Savior," who will also be our judge.

   14 Who gave himself for us. This is another argument of exhortation,
   drawn from the design or effect of the death of Christ, who offered
   himself for us, that he might redeem us from the bondage of sin, and
   purchase us to himself as his heritage. His grace, therefore,
   necessarily brings along with it "newness of life," (Romans 6:4,)
   because they who still are the slaves of sin make void the blessing of
   redemption; but now we are released from the bondage of sin, in order
   that we may serve the righteousness of God; and, therefore, he
   immediately added, --

   A peculiar people, zealous of good works; by which he means that, so
   far as concerns us, the fruit of redemption is lost, if we are still
   entangled by the sinful desires of the world. And in order to express
   more fully, that we have been consecrated to good works by the death of
   Christ, he makes use of the word purify; for it would be truly base in
   us to be again polluted by the same filth from which the Son of God
   hath washed us by his blood. [255]

   15 Speak these things, and exhort, and reprove This conclusion is of
   the same meaning as if he enjoined Titus to dwell continually on that
   doctrine of edification, and never to grow weary, because it cannot be
   too much inculcated. He likewise bids him add the spurs of
   "exhortations and reproofs;" for men are not sufficiently admonished as
   to their duty, if they be not also vehemently urged to the performance
   of it. He who understands those things which the Apostle has formerly
   stated, and who has them always in his mouth, will have ground not only
   for teaching, but likewise for correcting.

   With all authority I do not agree with Erasmus, who translates epitage
   "diligence in commanding." There is greater probability in the opinion
   of Chrysostom who interprets it to mean severity against more atrocious
   sins; through I do not think that even he has hit the Apostle's
   meaning; which is, that Titus should claim authority and respect for
   himself in teaching these things. For men given to curious inquiries,
   and eager about trifles, dislike the commandments to lead a pious and
   holy life as being too common and vulgar. In order that Titus may meet
   this disdain, he is enjoined to add the weight of his authority to his
   doctrine. It is with the same view (in my opinion) that he immediately
   adds, --

   Let no man despise thee Others think that Titus is instructed to gain
   the ear of men, and their respect for him, by the integrity of his
   life; and it is indeed true that holy and blameless conduct imparts
   authority to instruction. But Paul had another object in view; for here
   he addresses the people rather than Titus. Because many had ears so
   delicate, that they despised the simplicity of the gospel; because they
   had such an itch for novelty, that hardly any space was left for
   edification; he beats down the haughtiness of such men, and strictly
   charges them to desist from despising, in any way, sound and useful
   doctrine. This confirms the remark which I made at the outset, that
   this Epistle was written to the inhabitants of Crete rather than to any
   single individual.

   [248] "We have seen that we ought to preach daily that grace which was
   declared at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is a wonderful
   mystery, that God was manifested in the flesh, and that, at the same
   time, he hath shewn to us his heavenly glory, that we may be united to
   it. In this manner all pastors ought to be employed; for when they
   shall unceasingly illustrate that wisdom which God hath declared to us
   in the person of his Son, it is certain that the time will not be lost.
   And this is what Paul says in another passage, (Ephesians 3:18,) that
   it is the height, and depth, and length, and breadth, and thickness of
   all knowledge. When we shall have extended our views to explore as far
   as possible -- when we shall descend into the depth to search out all
   that is concealed from us -- when we shall go beyond the length and
   breadth of the sea, we shall have a wisdom (he says) as high and as
   deep, as long and as broad as this: when we shall know the infinite
   love of God which God hath showed to us in the person of his only
   begotten Son." -- Fr. Ser.

   [249] "We now see why Paul speaks of all men, and thus we may judge of
   the folly of some who pretend to expound the Holy Scriptures, and do
   not understand their style, when they say, And God wishes that every
   person should be saved; the grace of God hath appeared for the
   salvation of every person; it follows, then, that there is free-will,
   that there is no election, that none have been predestinated to
   salvation.' If those men spoke it ought to be with a little more
   caution. Paul did not mean in this passage, or in 1 Timothy 2:6,
   anything else than that the great are called by God, though they are
   unworthy of it; that men of low condition, though they are despised,
   are nevertheless adopted by God, who stretches out his hand to receive
   them. At that time, because kings and magistrates were mortal enemies
   of the gospel, it might be thought that God had rejected them, and that
   they cannot obtain salvation. But Paul says that the door must not be
   shut against them, and that, eventually, God may choose some of this
   company, though their case appear to be desperate. Thus, in this
   passage, after speaking of the poor slaves who were not reckoned to
   belong to the rank of men, he says that God did not fail, on that
   account, to show himself compassionate towards them, and that he wishes
   that the gospel should be preached to those to whom men do not deign to
   utter a word. Here is a poor man, who shall be rejected by us, we shall
   hardly say, God bless him! and God addresses him in an especial manner,
   and declares that he is his Father, and does not merely say a passing
   word, but stops him to say, Thou art of my flock, let my word be thy
   pasture, let it be the spiritual food of thy soul.' Thus we see that
   this word is highly significant, when it is said that the grace of God
   hath appeared fully to all men." -- Fr. Ser.

   [250] "It presents us with the strongest motives to obedience. The
   grace of God teacheth us to deny ungodliness.' What chains bind faster
   and closer than love? Here is love to our nature in his incarnation,
   love to us, though enemies, in his death and passion: encouragements to
   obedience by the proffers of pardon for former rebellions. By the
   disobedience of man God introduces his redeeming grace, and engages his
   creature to more ingenuous and excellent returns than his innocent
   state could oblige him to. In his created state he had goodness to move
   him, he hath the same goodness now to oblige him as a creature, and a
   greater love and mercy to oblige him as a repaired creature; and the
   terror of justice is taken off, which might envenom his heart as a
   criminal. In his revolted state he had misery to discourage him; in his
   redeemed state he hath love to attract him. Without such a way, black
   despair had seized upon the creature exposed to a remediless misery,
   and God would have had no returns of love from the best of his earthly
   works; but if any sparks of ingenuity be left, they will be excited by
   the efficacy of this argument." -- Charnock.

   [251] "On the expression tas kosmikas epithumias, the best comment is 1
   John 2:16 Sophronos denotes virtue as regards ourselves; dikaios, as
   regards our fellow-creatures; and eusebos, as respects God. Similar
   divisions are found in passages of the classical writers cited by the
   commentators." -- Bloomfield.

   [252] See [20]p. 311.

   [253] "En ce present monde." -- "In this present world."

   [254] "Of these words the most natural sense, and that required by the
   proprietas linguae,' is, beyond all doubt, the one assigned by almost
   all the ancients from Clem. Alex. downwards, and by the early modern
   expositors, as Erasmus, Grotius, and Beza, and also by some eminent
   expositors and theologians of later times, as Bishops Pearson and Bull,
   Wolff, Matthaei, and Bishop Middleton, namely, Looking for (or rather,
   looking forward to; comp. Job 2:9, and see Grotius) the blessed hope,
   even the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.'
   The cause of the ambiguity in our common version is ably pointed out,
   and the above version established on the surest grounds, by Bishop
   Middleton and Professor Scholefield. But, besides the argument founded
   on the propriety of language,' that of Beza, who urges that epiphaneia
   is nowhere used of God, but Christ, is unanswerable. So in an able
   critique on Dr. Channing's works, in the British Critic, the Reviewer
   justly maintains that Christ must be the God here spoken of, because it
   is his "glorious appearing" which all Christians here are said to
   expect, but of God the Father we are expressly told that him "no man
   hath seen, nor can see."' Other convincing arguments for the
   construction here laid down may be seen in Dr. Routh's Reliquiae
   Sacrae, vol. 2, p. 26. The reader is also particularly referred to
   Clem. Alex. Colhort. ad Gentes, sub init., where verses 11-14 are cited
   by that Father, and the view of Sotoros here maintained is adopted. The
   whole of the context there is deserving of great attention, as
   containing such plain and repeated attestations to the divinity of
   Jesus Christ as can rarely be found. The passage itself may be seen in
   Bishop Bull's Def Fid. Nic., p. 87." -- Bloomfield.

   [255] "Christ expiated sin, not encouraged it; he died to make your
   peace, but he died to make you holy; to purify a people to himself,'
   (Titus 2:14.) The ends of Christ's death cannot be separated. He is no
   atoner, where he is not a refiner. It is as certain as any word the
   mouth of God hath spoken, that there is no peace to the wicked,'
   (Isaiah 48:22.) A guilty conscience, and an impure, will keep up the
   amity with Satan and enmity with God. He that allows himself in any sin
   deprives himself of the benefit of reconciliation. This reconciliation
   must be mutual; as God lays down his wrath against us, so we must throw
   down our arms against him. As there was a double enmity, one rooted in
   nature, another declared by wicked works; or rather, one enmity in its
   root, and another in its exercise, (Colossians 1:21,) so there must be
   an alteration of state, and an alteration of acts." -- Charnock.

   CHAPTER 3
     __________________________________________________________________

   Titus 3:1-3

   1. Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey
   magistrates, to be ready to every good work,

   1. Admone illos principibus et potestatibus subditos esse dicto
   oboedire ad omne opus bonum paratos esse

   2. To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all
   meekness unto all men.

   2. neminem blasphemare non litigiosos esse modestos omnem ostendentes
   mansuetudinem ad omnes homines

   3. For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived,
   serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful,
   and hating one another.

   3. eramus enim et nos aliquando insipientes increduli errantes
   servientes desideriis et voluptatibus variis in malitia et invidia
   agentes odibiles odientes invicem

   1 Remind them to be subject to principalities and powers From many
   passages it is evident that the Apostles had great difficulty in
   keeping the common people subject to the authority of magistrates and
   princes. We are all by nature desirous of power; and the consequence
   is, that no one willingly is subject to another. Besides, perceiving
   that nearly all the principalities and powers of the world [256] were
   at that time opposed to Christ they thought them unworthy of receiving
   any honor. The Jews especially, being an untamable race, did not cease
   to mutiny and rage. Thus, after having spoken of particular duties,
   Paul now wishes to give a general admonition to all, to observe
   peaceably the order of civil government, to submit to the laws, to obey
   magistrates. That subjection to princes, and that obedience to
   magistrates, which he demands, is extended to edicts, and laws, and
   other parts of civil government.

   What he immediately adds, To be ready for every good work, may be
   applied to the same subject, as if he had said, "All who do not refuse
   to lead a good and virtuous life, will cheerfully yield obedience to
   magistrates." For, since they have been appointed for the preservation
   of mankind, he who desires to have them removed, or shakes off their
   yoke, is an enemy of equity and justice, and is therefore devoid of all
   humanity. Yet if any prefer to interpret it without any immediate
   relation to the context, I have no objection; and indeed there can be
   no doubt that, in this sentence, he recommends to them kind offices
   towards their neighbors throughout their whole life.

   2 To speak evil of no one He now lays down the method of maintaining
   peace and friendship with all men. We know that there is nothing to
   which the disposition of every man is more prone than to despise others
   in comparison of himself. The consequence is, that many are proud of
   the gifts of God; and this is accompanied by contempt for their
   brethren, which is immediately followed by insult. He therefore forbids
   Christians to glory over others, or to reproach them, whatever may be
   their own superior excellence. Yet he does not wish them to flatter the
   vices of wicked men; he only condemns the propensity to slander.

   Not given to fighting As if he had said, "Quarrels and contentions must
   be avoided." The old translation has therefore rendered it better, Not
   quarrelsome; for there are other ways of fighting than the sword or the
   fist. And from what follows it is evident that this is the meaning; for
   he points out the remedies for the evil, when he enjoins them to be
   kind, and to shew all meekness towards all men; for "kindness" is
   contrasted with the utmost rigor of law, and "meekness" with
   bitterness. If, therefore, we are disposed to avoid every kind of
   contentions and fighting, let us learn, first, to moderate many things
   by gentleness, and next to bear with many things; for they who are
   excessively severe and ill-tempered carry with them a fire to kindle
   strife.

   He says, towards all men, in order to intimate that he should bear with
   even the lowest and meanest persons. Believers, holding wicked men in
   contempt, did not think them worthy of any forbearance. Such severity,
   which arises from nothing else than pride, Paul wished to correct.

   3 For we ourselves [257] also were formerly foolish Nothing is better
   adapted to subdue our pride, and at the same time to moderate our
   severity, than when it is shewn that everything that we turn against
   others may fall back on our own head; for he forgives easily who is
   compelled to sue for pardon in return. And indeed, ignorance of our own
   faults is the only cause that renders us unwilling to forgive our
   brethren. They who have a true zeal for God, are, indeed, severe
   against those who sin; but, because they begin with themselves, their
   severity is always attended by compassion. In order that believers,
   therefore, may not haughtily and cruelly mock at others, who are still
   held in ignorance and blindness, Paul brings back to their remembrance
   what sort of persons they formerly were; as if he had said, "If such
   fierce treatment is done to those on whom God has not yet bestowed the
   light of the gospel, with equally good reason might you have been at
   one time harshly treated. Undoubtedly you would not have wished that
   any person should be so cruel to you; exercise now, therefore, the same
   moderation towards others."

   In the words of Paul, there are two things that need to be understood.
   The first is, that they who have now been enlightened by the Lord,
   being humbled by the remembrance of their former ignorance, should not
   exalt themselves proudly over others, or treat them with greater
   harshness and severity than that which, they think, ought to have been
   exercised towards themselves when they were what those now are. The
   second is, that they should consider, from what has taken place in
   their own persons, that they who to-day are strangers may to-morrow be
   received into the Church, and, having been led to amendment of their
   sinful practices, may become partakers of the gifts of God, of which
   they are now destitute. There is a bright mirror of both in believers,
   who

   "at one time were darkness, and afterwards began
   to be light in the Lord." (Ephesians 5:8.)

   The knowledge of their former condition should therefore dispose them
   to sumpatheian fellow-feeling. On the other hand, the grace of God,
   which they now enjoy, is a proof that others may be brought to
   salvation.

   Thus we see that we must be humbled before God, in order that we may be
   gentle towards brethren; for pride is always cruel and disdainful of
   others. In another passage, (Galatians 6:1,) where he exhorts us to
   mildness, he advises every one to remember his own weakness. Here he
   goes farther, for he bids us remember those vices from which we have
   been delivered, that we may not pursue too keenly those which, still
   dwell in others.

   Besides, seeing that here Paul describes briefly the natural
   disposition of men, such as it is before it is renewed by the Spirit of
   God, we may behold, in this description, how wretched we are while we
   are out of Christ. First, he calls unbelievers foolish, because the
   whole wisdom of men is mere vanity, so long as they do not know God.
   Next, he calls them disobedient, because, as it is faith alone that
   truly obeys God, so unbelief is always wayward and rebellious; although
   we might translate apeitheis unbelieving, so as to describe the kind of
   "foolishness." Thirdly, he says that unbelievers go astray; for Christ
   alone is "the way" and the "light of the world." (John 8:12; 14:6.) All
   who are estranged from God must therefore wander and go astray during
   their whole life.

   Hitherto he has described the nature of unbelief; but now he likewise
   adds the fruits which proceed from it, namely, various desires and
   pleasures, envy, malice, and such like. It is true that each person is
   not equally chargeable with every vice; but, seeing that all are the
   slaves of wicked desires, although some are carried away by one and
   others by another desire, Paul embraces in a general statement [258]
   all the fruits that are anywhere produced by unbelief. This subject is
   explained towards the close of the first chapter of the Epistle to the
   Romans.

   Moreover, since Paul, by these marks, distinguishes the children of God
   from unbelievers, if we wish to be accounted believers, we must have
   our heart cleansed from all envy, and from all malice; and we must both
   love and be beloved. It is unreasonable that those desires should reign
   in us, which are there called "various," for this reason, in my
   opinion, that the lusts by which a carnal man is driven about are like
   opposing billows, which, by fighting against each other, turn the man
   hither and thither, so that he changes and vacillates almost every
   moment. Such, at least, is the restlessness of all who abandon
   themselves to carnal desires; because there is no stability but in the
   fear of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [256] "Toutes des principautes et puissances du monde."

   [257] "We ourselves, who had the oracles of God, that had greater
   privileges than others, were carried out with as strong an impetus
   naturally, till grace stopped the tide, and, after stopping, turned it
   against nature. When the mind was thus prepossessed, and the will made
   the lusts of the flesh its work and trade, there was no likelihood of
   any co-operation with God, in fulfilling his desires, till the bent of
   the heart was changed from the flesh and its principles. The heart is
   stone before grace. No stone can cooperate with any that would turn it
   into flesh, since it hath no seed, causes, or principles of any fleshly
   nature in it. Since we are overwhelmed by the rubbish of our corrupted
   estate, we can no more co-operate to the removal of it than a man
   buried under the ruins of a fallen house can contribute to the removal
   of that great weight that lies upon him. Neither would a man in that
   state help such a work, because his lusts are pleasures; he serves his
   lusts, which are pleasures as well as lusts, and therefore served with
   delight." -- Charnock.

   [258] "The Apostle speaks of what naturally we all were. This, then, is
   a most merciful influence that is given forth in the regenerating work.
   It is as if God should have said, I see those poor creatures are
   perishing, not only tending to hell, but carrying with them their own
   hell into hell, hell being at last cast into hell' (as the expression
   in the Revelation is.) It is a throwing hell into hell, when a wicked
   man comes to hell; for he was his own hell before. God, beholding this
   forlorn case of wretched creatures, saith, I must either renew them or
   lose them; I must either transform them, or they must perish: they are
   in the fire of hell already. Such and such we were, but of his mercy he
   saved us by the washing of regeneration, and renewing by the Holy
   Ghost. O! the compassionate influence that is shed upon a soul in this
   case! The balmy dews that descend from heaven upon a distempered soul,
   which quench the flames of lust, and which implant and invigorate
   (after their implantation) a divine principle, in-create a new life,
   that leads to God and Christ, and the way of holiness and heaven at
   last." -- Howe.

   Titus 3:4-7

   4. But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man
   appeared,

   4. cum autem benignitas et humanitas apparuit salvatoris nostri Dei

   5. Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to
   his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of
   the Holy Ghost;

   5. non ex operibus iustitiae quae fecimus nos sed secundum suam
   misericordiam salvos nos fecit per lavacrum regenerationis et
   renovationis Spiritus Sancti

   6. Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;

   6. quem effudit in nos abunde per Iesum Christum salvatorem nostrum

   7. That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according
   to the hope of eternal life.

   7. ut iustificati gratia ipsius heredes simus secundum spem vitae
   aeternae

   Either the principal clause in this sentence is, that "God hath saved
   us by his mercy," or the language is elliptical. Thus it will be proper
   to supply, that they were changed for the better, and became new men,
   in consequence of God having mercy upon them; as if he had said, "When
   God regenerated you by his Spirit, then did you begin to differ from
   others." But since there is a complete sense in the words of Paul,
   there is no necessity for making any addition. He classes himself along
   with others, in order that the exhortation may be more efficacious.

   4 But after that the goodness and love towards man appeared First, it
   might be asked, -- "Did the goodness of God begin to be made known to
   the world at the time when Christ was manifested in the flesh? For
   certainly, from the beginning, the fathers both knew and experienced
   that God was good, and kind, and gracious to them; and therefore this
   was not the first manifestation of his goodness, and fatherly love
   towards us," The answer is easy. In no other way did the fathers taste
   the goodness of God under the Law, than by looking at Christ, on whose
   coming all their faith rested. Thus the goodness of God is said to have
   appeared, when he exhibited a pledge of it, and gave actual
   demonstration, that not in vain did he so often promise salvation to
   men.

   "God so loved the world", says John, "that he gave his only-begotten
   Son." (John 3:16.)

   Paul also says in another passage,

   "Hereby God confirmeth his love towards us, that, while we were
   enemies, Christ died for us." (Romans 5:8.)

   It is a customary way of speaking in Scripture, that the world was
   reconciled to God through the death of Christ, although we know that he
   was a kind Father in all ages. But because we find no cause of the love
   of God toward us, and no ground of our salvation, but in Christ, not
   without good reason is God the Father said to have shewn his goodness
   to us in him.

   Yet there is a different reason for it in this passage, in which Paul
   speaks, not of that ordinary manifestation of Christ which took place
   when he came as a man into the world, but of the manifestation which is
   made by the gospel, when he exhibits and reveals himself, in a peculiar
   manner, to the elect. At the first coming of Christ, Paul was not
   renewed; but, on the contrary, Christ was raised in glory, and
   salvation through his name shone upon many, not only in Judea, but
   throughout the neighboring countries, while Paul, blinded by unbelief,
   labored to extinguish this grace by every means in his power. He
   therefore means that the grace of God "appeared" both to himself and to
   others, when they were enlightened in the knowledge of the gospel. And
   indeed, in no other way could these words apply; for he does not speak
   indiscriminately about the men of his age, but specially addresses
   those who had been separated from the ordinary ranks; as if he had
   said, that formerly they resembled those unbelievers who were still
   plunged in darkness, but that now they differ from them, not through
   their own merit, but by the grace of God; in the same manner as he
   beats down all the haughtiness of the flesh by the same argument. "Who
   maketh thee to differ," or to be more highly, esteemed than others? (1
   Corinthians 4:7.)

   Goodness and love He has with propriety assigned the first rank to
   "goodness," which prompts God to love us; for God will never find in us
   anything which he ought to love, but he loves us because he is good and
   merciful. Besides, although he testifies his goodness and love to all,
   yet we know it by faith only, when he declares himself to be our Father
   in Christ. Before Paul was called to the faith of Christ, he enjoyed
   innumerable gifts of God, which might have given him a taste of God's
   fatherly kindness; he had been educated, from his infancy, in the
   doctrine of the law; yet he wanders in darkness, so as not to perceive
   the goodness of God, till the Spirit enlightened his mind, and till
   Christ came forth as the witness and pledge of the grace of God the
   Father, from which, but for him, we are all excluded. Thus he means
   that the kindness of God is not revealed and known but by the light of
   faith.

   5 Not by works [259] Let us remember that here Paul addresses his
   discourse to believers, and describes the manner in which they entered
   into the kingdom of God. He affirms that by their works they did not at
   all deserve that they should become partakers of salvation, or that
   they should be reconciled to God through faith; but he says that they
   obtained this blessing solely through the mercy of God. We therefore
   conclude from his words, that we bring nothing to God, but that he goes
   before us by his pure grace, without any regard to works. For when he
   says, -- "Not by works which we have done", he means, that we can do
   nothing but sin till we have been renewed by God. This negative
   statement depends on the former affirmation, by which he said that they
   were foolish and disobedient, and led away by various desires, till
   they were created anew in Christ; and indeed, what good work could
   proceed from so corrupt a mass?

   It is madness, therefore, to allege that a man approaches to God by his
   own "preparations," as they call them. During the whole period of life
   they depart further and further from him, until he puts forth his hand,
   and brings them back into that path from which they had gone astray. In
   short, that we, rather than others, have been admitted to enjoy the
   salvation of Christ, is altogether ascribed by Paul to the mercy of
   God, because there were no works of righteousness in us. This argument
   would have no weight, if he did not take for granted, that everything
   that we attempt to do before we believe, is unrighteous and hateful to
   God.

   Which we had done. To argue from the preterite tense of this verb, that
   God looks at the future merits of men when he calls them, is
   sophistical and foolish. "When Paul," say they, "denies that God is
   induced by our merits to bestow his grace upon us, he limits the
   statement to the past time; and therefore, if it is only for the
   righteousness going before that no room is left, future righteousness
   is admitted to consideration." But they assume a principle, which Paul
   everywhere rejects, when he declares that election by free grace is the
   foundation of good works. If we owe it entirely to the grace of God,
   that we are fit for living a holy life, what future works of ours will
   God look upon? If, previously to our being called by God, iniquity
   holds such dominion over us, that it will not cease to make progress
   till it come to its height, how can God be induced, by a regard to our
   righteousness, to call us? Away then with such trifling! When Paul
   spoke of past works, his sole object was to exclude all merits. The
   meaning of his words is as if he had said, -- "If we boast of any
   merit, what sort of works had we?" This maxim holds good, that men
   would not be better than they were before, if the Lord did not make
   them better by his calling.

   He hath saved us He speaks of faith, and shews that we have already
   obtained salvation. Although, so long as we are held by the
   entanglements of sin, we carry about a body of death, yet we are
   certain of our salvation, provided that we are ingrafted into Christ by
   faith, according to that saying, --

   "He that believeth in the Son of God
   hath passed from death into life." (John 5:24.)

   Yet, shortly afterwards, by introducing the word faith, the Apostle
   will shew that we have not yet actually attained what Christ procured
   for us by his death. Hence it follows, that, on the part of God, our
   salvation is completed, while the full enjoyment of it is delayed till
   the end of our warfare. And that is what the same Apostle teaches in
   another passage, that "we are saved by hope." (Romans 8:24.)

   By the washing of regeneration I have no doubt that he alludes, at
   least, to baptism, and even I will not object to have this passage
   expounded as relating to baptism; not that salvation is contained in
   the outward symbol of water, but because baptism tells to us the
   salvation obtained by Christ. Paul treats of the exhibition of the
   grace of God, which, we have said, has been made by faith. Since
   therefore a part of revelation consists in baptism, that is, so far as
   it is intended to confirm our faith, he properly makes mention of it.
   Besides, baptism -- being the entrance into the Church and the symbol
   of our ingrafting into Christ -- is here appropriately introduced by
   Paul, when he intends to shew in what manner the grace of God appeared
   to us; so that the strain of the passage runs thus: -- "God hath saved
   us by his mercy, the symbol and pledge of which he gave in baptism, by
   admitting us into his Church, and ingrafting us into the body of his
   Son."

   Now the Apostles are wont to draw an argument from the Sacraments, to
   prove that which is there exhibited under a figure, because it ought to
   be held by believers as a settled principle, that God does not sport
   with us by unmeaning figures, but inwardly accomplishes by his power
   what he exhibits by the outward sign; and therefore, baptism is fitly
   and truly said to be "the washing of regeneration." The efficacy and
   use of the sacraments will be properly understood by him who shall
   connect the sign and the thing signified, in such a manner as not to
   make the sign unmeaning and inefficacious, and who nevertheless shall
   not, for the sake of adorning the sign, take away from the Holy Spirit
   what belongs to him. Although by baptism wicked men are neither washed
   nor renewed, yet it retains that power, so far as relates to God,
   because, although they reject the grace of God, still it is offered to
   them. But here Paul addresses believers, in whom baptism is always
   efficacious, and in whom, therefore, it is properly connected with its
   truth and efficacy. But by this mode of expression we are reminded
   that, if we do not wish to annihilate holy baptism, we must prove its
   efficacy by "newness of life." (Romans 6:4.)

   And of the renewing of the Holy Spirit [260] Though he mentioned the
   sign, that he might exhibit to our view the grace of God, yet, that we
   may not fix our whole attention on the sign, he immediately sends us to
   the Spirit, that we may know that we are washed by his power, and not
   by water, agreeably to what is said, --

   "I will sprinkle on you clean waters, even my Spirit."
   (Ezekiel 36:25, 27.)

   And indeed, the words of Paul agree so completely with the words of the
   Prophet, that it appears clearly that both of them say the same thing.
   For this reason I said at the commencement, that Paul, while he speaks
   directly about the Holy Spirit, at the same time alludes to baptism. It
   is therefore the Spirit of God who regenerates us, and makes us new
   creatures; but because his grace is invisible and hidden, a visible
   symbol of it is beheld in baptism.

   Some read the word "renewing," in the accusative case, thus: --
   "through the washing of regeneration and (through) the renewing of the
   Holy Spirit.", But the other reading -- "through the washing of
   regeneration and of the renewing of the Holy Spirit" -- is, in my
   opinion, preferable.

   6. Which he shed, (or, whom he shed.) In the Greek, the relative may
   apply either to the "washing" or to the "Spirit;" for both of the nouns
   -- loutron and Pneuma -- are neuter. It makes little difference as to
   the meaning; but the metaphor will be more elegant, if the relative be
   applied to loutron the "washing" Nor is it inconsistent with this
   opinion, that all are baptized without any distinction; for, while he
   shews that the "washing" is "shed," he speaks not of the sign, but
   rather of the thing signified, in which the truth of the sign exists.

   When he, says, abundantly, he means that, the more any of us excels in
   the abundance of the gifts which he has received, so much the more is
   he under obligations to the mercy of God, which alone enriches us; for
   in ourselves we are altogether poor, and destitute of everything good.
   If it be objected that not all the children of God enjoy so great
   abundance, but, on the contrary, the grace of God drops sparingly on
   many; the answer is, that no one has received so small a measure that
   he may not be justly accounted rich; for the smallest drop of the
   Spirit (so to speak) resembles an ever-flowing fountain, which never
   dries up. It is therefore a sufficient reason for calling it
   "abundance," that, how small soever the portion that has been given to
   us it is never exhausted.

   Through Jesus Christ [261] It is he alone in whom we are adopted; and
   therefore, it is he alone, through whom we are made partakers of the
   Spirit, who is the earnest and witness of our adoption. Paul therefore
   teaches us by this word, that the Spirit of regeneration is bestowed on
   none but those who are the members of Christ.

   7 That being justified by his grace If we understand "regeneration" in
   its strict and ordinary meaning, it might be thought that the Apostle
   employs the word "justified" instead of "regenerated;" and this is
   sometimes the meaning of it, but very seldom; yet there is no necessity
   which constrains us to depart from its strict and more natural
   signification. The design of Paul is, to ascribe to the grace of God
   all that we are, and all that we have, so that we may not exalt
   ourselves proudly against others. Thus he now extols the mercy of God,
   by ascribing to it entirely the cause of our salvation. But because he
   had spoken of the vices of unbelievers, it would have been improper to
   leave out the grace of regeneration, which is the medicine for curing
   them.

   Still this does not prevent him from returning immediately to praise
   divine mercy; and he even mingles both blessings together -- that our
   sins have been freely pardoned, and that we have been renewed so as to
   obey God. This, at least, is evident, that Paul maintains that
   "justification," is the free gift of God; and the only question is,
   what he means by the word justified. The contest seems to demand that
   its meaning shall be extended further than to the imputation of
   righteousness; and in this larger sense it is seldom (as I have said)
   employed by Paul; yet there is nothing that hinders the meaning of it
   from being limited to the forgiveness of sins.

   When he says, by his grace, this applies both to Christ and to the
   Father, and we ought not to contend for either of these expositions,
   because it will always hold good, that, by the grace of God, we have
   obtained righteousness through Christ.

   Heirs according to the hope of eternal life This clause is added by way
   of exposition. He had said that we have been saved through the mercy of
   God. [262] But our salvation is as yet hidden; and therefore he now
   says that we are heirs of life, not because we have arrived at the
   present possession of it, but because hope brings to us full and
   complete certainly of it. The meaning may be thus summed up. "Having
   been dead, we were restored to life through the grace of Christ, when
   God the: Father bestowed on us his Spirit, by whose power we have been
   purified. and renewed. Our salvation consists in this; but, because we
   are still in the world, we do not yet enjoy eternal life,' but only
   obtain it by hoping.'"

   [259] "Perhaps the reader will give me leave to add a short expository
   lecture upon the most distinguished parts of this very important
   paragraph. I. -- We have the cause of our redemption; not works of
   righteousness which we have done, but the kindness, the love, the
   mercy, of God our Savior. To these, to these alone, every child of man
   must ascribe both his fruition of present, and his expectation of
   future blessedness. II. -- The effects, which are -- 1. Justification,
   being justified, having our sins forgiven and our persons accepted
   through the righteousness of Christ imputed; all this without any the
   least deserving quality in us, solely by his grace and most unmerited
   goodness. 2. Sanctification expressed by the washing of regeneration --
   that washing in the Redeemer's blood which cleanses the soul from
   guilt, as the washing of water cleanseth the body from filth, which
   reconciles to God, gives peace of conscience, and thereby lays the
   foundation of an universal spiritual change -- the renewing of the Holy
   Ghost, whose influences, testifying of Christ, and applying his merits,
   introduce an improvement into all the faculties of the mind, something
   like that annual renovation and general smile which the return of
   spring diffuses over the face of nature. III. -- The end and
   consummation of all -- that we should be made heirs of the heavenly
   kingdom, and live more in the assured hope, hereafter in the full
   enjoyment, of eternal." -- Hervey.

   [260] "It remaineth that we declare what is the office of the same,
   what he, is unto us, as the Holy Spirit; for although the Spirit of God
   be of infinite, essential, and original holiness, as God, and so may be
   called Holy in himself; though other spirits which were created be
   either actually now unholy, or of defectible sanctity at first, and so
   having the name of spirit common unto them, he may be termed holy, that
   he may be distinguished from them; yet I conceive he is rather called
   the Holy Spirit, for the Spirit of Holiness (Romans 1:4,) because of
   the three persons in the blessed Trinity, it is his particular office
   to sanctify or make us holy. As, therefore, what our Savior did and
   suffered for us belonged to that office of a Redeemer which he took
   upon him; so whatsoever the Holy Ghost worketh in order to the same
   salvation, we look upon as belonging to his office. And because without
   holiness it is impossible to please God, because we all are impure and
   unholy, and the purity and holiness which is required in us to appear
   in the presence of God, whose eyes are pure, must be wrought in us by
   the Spirit of God, who is called Holy, because he is the cause of this
   holiness in us, therefore we acknowledge the office of the Spirit of
   God to consist in the sanctifying of the servants of God, and the
   declaration of this office, added to the description of his nature, to
   be a sufficient explication of the object of faith contained in this
   article -- 'I believe in the Holy Ghost'." -- Bp. Pearson on the Creed.

   [261] "When we wish to ascertain the method of our salvation, we must
   begin with the Son of God. For it is he who hath washed us by his blood
   -- it is he who hath obtained righteousness for us by his obedience --
   it is he who is our Advocate, and through whom we now find grace -- it
   is he who procured for us the adoption by which we are made children
   and heirs of God. Let us carefully observe that we must seek all the
   parts of our salvation in Jesus Christ; for we shall not find a single
   drop of it anywhere else." -- Fr. Ser.

   [262] "Par la grace et misericorde de Dieu." -- "By the grace and mercy
   of God."

   Titus 3:8-9

   8. This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm
   constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to
   maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.

   8. fidelis sermo est et de his volo to confirmare ut curent bonis
   operibus praeesse qui credunt Deo haec sunt bona et utilia hominibus

   9. But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and
   strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.

   9. Stultas autem quaestiones et genealogias et contentiones et pugnas
   legis devita sunt enim inutiles et vanae

   8 A faithful saying He employs this mode of expression, when he wishes
   to make a solemn assertion as we have seen in both of the Epistles to
   Timothy. (1 Timothy 1:15; 3:1; 2 Timothy 2:11.) And therefore he
   immediately adds: --

   I wish thee to affirm these things [263] Diabebaiousthai under a
   passive termination, has an active signification, and means "to affirm
   anything strongly." Titus is therefore enjoined to disregard other
   matters, and to teach those which are certain and undoubted -- to press
   them on the attention of their hearers -- to dwell upon them -- while
   others talk idly about things of little importance. Hence also, we
   conclude that a bishop must not make any assertions at random, but must
   assert those things only which he has ascertained to be true. "Affirm
   these things," says he, "because they are true and worthy of credit."
   But we are reminded, on the other hand, that it is the duty and office
   of a bishop to affirm strongly, and maintain boldly, those things which
   are believed on good grounds, and which edify godliness.

   That they who have believed God may be careful to excel in good works,
   (or, to extol good works, or, to assign to them the highest rank.) He
   includes all the instructions which he formerly gave concerning the
   duty of every person, and the desire of leading a religious and holy
   life; as if he contrasted the fear of God, and well-regulated conduct,
   with idle speculations. He wishes the people to be instructed in such a
   manner that "they who have believed God," may be solicitous, above all
   things, about good works.

   But, as the verb proistasthai is used in various senses by Greek
   authors, this passage also gives scope for various interpretations.
   Chrysostom: explains it to mean, that they should endeavor to relieve
   their neighbors by giving alms. Proistasthai does sometimes mean "to
   give assistance;" but in that case the syntax would require us to
   understand that the "good works" should be aided, which would be a
   harsh construction. The meaning conveyed by the French word avancer,
   "to go forward," would be more appropriate. What if we should say, --
   "Let them strive as those who have the pre-eminence?" That is also one
   meaning of the word. Or, perhaps, some one will prefer what I have
   enclosed in brackets: "Let them be careful to assign the highest rank
   to good works." And certainly it would not be unsuitable that Paul
   should enjoin that those things should prevail in the life of
   believers, because they are usually disregarded by others.

   Whatever may be the ambiguity of the expression, the meaning of Paul is
   sufficiently clear, that the design of Christian doctrine is, that
   believers should exercise themselves in good works. [264] Thus he
   wishes them to give to it their study and application; and, when the
   Apostle says, phrontizosi ("let them be careful,") he appears to allude
   elegantly to the useless contemplations of those who speculate without
   advantage, and without regard to active life.

   Yet he is not so careful about good works as to despise the root --
   that is, faith -- while he is gathering the fruits. He takes account of
   both parts, and, as is highly proper, assigns the first rank to faith;
   for he enjoins those "who believed in God" to be zealous of "good
   works;" by which he means that faith must go before in such a manner
   that good works may follow.

   For these things are honorable I refer this to the doctrine rather than
   to the works, in this sense: "It is excellent and useful that men be
   thus instructed; and, therefore, those things which he formerly
   exhorted Titus to be zealous in affirming are the same things that are
   good and useful to men." We might translate ta kala either "good," or
   "beautiful," or "honorable;" but, in my opinion, it would be best to
   translate it "excellent." He states indirectly that all other things
   that are taught are of no value, because they yield no profit or
   advantage; as, on the contrary, that which contributes to salvation is
   worthy of praise.

   9 But avoid foolish questions There is no necessity for debating long
   about the exposition of this passage. He contrasts "questions" with
   sound and certain doctrine. Although it is necessary to seek, in order
   to find, yet there is a limit to seeking, that you may understand what
   is useful to be known, and, next, that you may adhere firmly to the
   truth, when it has been known. Those who inquire curiously into
   everything, and are never at rest, may be truly called Questionarians.
   In short, what the schools of the Sorbonne account worthy of the
   highest praise -- is here condemned by Paul; for the whole theology of
   the Papists is nothing else than a labyrinth of questions. He calls
   them foolish; not that, at first sight, they appear to be such, (for,
   on the contrary, they often deceive by a vain parade of wisdom,) but
   because they contribute nothing to godliness.

   When he adds genealogies, he mentions one class of "foolish questions;"
   for instance, when curious men, forgetting to gather fruit from the
   sacred histories, seize on the lineage of races, and trifles of that
   nature, with which they weary themselves without advantage. Of that
   folly we spoke towards the beginning of the First Epistle to Timothy.
   [265]

   He properly adds contentions; because in "questions" the prevailing
   spirit is ambition; and, therefore, it is impossible but that they
   shall immediately break forth into "contention" and quarrels; for there
   every one wishes to be the conqueror. This is accompanied by hardihood
   in affirming about things that are uncertain, which unavoidably leads
   to debates.

   And fightings about the law He gives this disdainful appellation to
   those debates which were raised by the Jews under the pretence of the
   law; not that the law of itself produces them, but because the Jews,
   pretending to defend the law, disturbed the peace of the Church by
   their absurd controversies about the observation of ceremonies, about
   the distinction of the kinds of food and things of that nature.

   For they are unprofitable and unnecessary In doctrine, therefore, we
   should always have regard to usefulness, so that everything that does
   not contribute to godliness shall be held in no estimation. And yet
   those sophists, in babbling about things of no value, undoubtedly
   boasted of them as highly worthy and useful to be known; but Paul does
   not acknowledge them to possess any usefulness, unless they tend to the
   increase of faith and to a holy life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [263] "Meaning, and I would have you constantly insist on these truths;
   so that those who have believed in God may maintain good works.' The
   cause of the obscurity, and consequent diversity of interpretation,
   arose from the Apostle not having here shewn how it should be, that the
   doctrine of salvation by grace should produce holiness of life. But he
   has done it in another kindred passage, namely, Ephesians 2:9,10,
   where, after having at large treated on the subject of salvation by
   grace, (as here,) adding that it is not of works, lest any man should
   boast, he subjoins, autou gar esmen, k.t.l. where the gar refers to a
   clause omitted, q. d. (Yet works must be done,) for, etc. Hence it
   would seem that kalon ergon here must have the same sense as ergois
   agathois there; and consequently it must not be limited, with many
   eminent commentators, to works of benevolence, still less to the
   business of our avocation, but be extended to good works of every
   kind." -- Bloomfield.

   [264] "The original word proistasthai has a beauty and an energy,
   which, I believe, it is impossible for our language to preserve by any
   literal translation. It implies, that a believer should not only be
   exercised in, but eminent for, all good works; should shew others the
   way, and outstrip them in the honorable race; be both a pattern and a
   patron of universal godliness." -- Hervey.

   Titus 3:10-15

   10. A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition
   reject;

   10. hereticum hominem post unam et secundam correptionem devita

   11. Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being

   faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.

   15. salutant to qui mecum sunt omnes saluta qui nos amant in fide
   gratia Dei cum omnibus vobis amen

   It was written to Titus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the
   Cretians, from Nicopolis of Macedonia.

   Ad Titum, qui primus Cretensium Ecclesiae ordinatus fuit Episcopus,
   scripsit ex Nicopoli Macedoniae.

   10 Avoid an heretical man This is properly added; because there will be
   no end of quarrels and dispute, if we wish to conquer obstinate men by
   argument; for they will never want words, and they will derive fresh
   courage from impudence, so that they will never grow weary of fighting.
   Thus, after having given orders to Titus as to the form of doctrine
   which he should lay down, he now forbids him to waste much time in
   debating with heretics, because battle would lead to battle and dispute
   to dispute. Such is the cunning of Satan, that, by the impudent
   talkativeness of such men, he entangles good and faithful pastors, so
   as to draw them away from diligence in teaching. We must therefore
   beware lest we become engaged in quarrelsome disputes; for we shall
   never have leisure to devote our labors to the Lord's flock, and
   contentious men will never cease to annoy us.

   When he commands him to avoid such persons, it is as if he said that he
   must not toil hard to satisfy them, and even that there is nothing
   better than to cut off the handle for fighting which they are eager to
   find. This is a highly necessary admonition; for even they who would
   willingly take no part in strifes of words are sometimes drawn by shame
   into controversy, because they think that it would be shameful
   cowardice to quit the field. Besides, there is no temper, however mild,
   that is not liable to be provoked by the fierce taunts of enemies,
   because they look upon it as intolerable that those men should attack
   the truth, (as they are accustomed to do,) and that none should reply.
   Nor are there wanting men who are either of a combative disposition, or
   excessively hot-tempered, who are eager for battle. On the contrary,
   Paul does not wish that the servant of Christ should be much and long
   employed in debating with heretics.

   We must now see what he means by the word heretic. There is a common
   and well-known distinction between a heretic and a schismatic. But
   here, in my opinion, Paul disregards that distinction: for, by the term
   "heretic" he describes not only those who cherish and defend an
   erroneous or perverse doctrine, but in general all who do not yield
   assent to the sound doctrine which he laid down a little before. Thus
   under this name he includes all ambitious, unruly, contentious persons,
   who, led away by sinful passions, disturb the peace of the Church, and
   raise disputings. In short, every person who, by his overweening pride,
   breaks up the unity of the Church, is pronounced by Paul to be
   "heretic."

   But we must exercise moderation, so as not instantly to declare every
   man to be a "heretic" who does not agree with our opinion. There are
   some matters on which Christians may differ from each other, without
   being divided into sects. Paul himself commands that they shall not be
   so divided, when he bids them keep their harmony unbroken, and wait for
   the revelation of God. (Philippians 3:16.) But whenever the obstinacy
   of any person grows to such an extent, that, led by selfish motives, he
   either separates from the body, or draws away some of the flock, or
   interrupts the course of sound doctrine, in such a case we must boldly
   resist.

   In a word, a heresy or sect and the unity of the Church -- are things
   totally opposite to each other. Since the unity of the Church is dear
   to God, and ought to be held by us in the highest estimation, we ought
   to entertain the strongest abhorrence of heresy. Accordingly, the name
   of sect or heresy, though philosophers and statesmen reckon it to be
   honorable, is justly accounted infamous among Christians. We now
   understand who are meant by Paul, when he bids us dismiss and avoid
   heretics. But at the same time we ought to observe what immediately
   follows, --

   After the first and second admonition; for neither shall we have a
   right to pronounce a man to be a heretic, nor shall we be at liberty to
   reject him, till we have first endeavored to bring him back to sound
   views. [266] He does not mean any "admonition," whatever, or that of a
   private individual, but an "admonition" given by a minister, with the
   public authority of the Church; for the meaning of the Apostle's words
   is as if he had said, that heretics must be rebuked with solemn and
   severe censure.

   They who infer from this passage, that the supporters of wicked
   doctrines must be restrained by excommunication alone, and that no
   rigorous measures beyond this must be used against them, do not argue
   conclusively. There is a difference between the duties of a bishop and
   those of a magistrate. Writing to Titus, Paul does not treat of the
   office of a magistrate, but points out what belongs to a bishop. [267]
   Yet moderation is always best, that, instead of being restrained by
   force and violence, they may be corrected by the discipline of the
   Church, if there be any ground to believe that they can be cured.

   11 Knowing that he who is such is ruined He declares that man to be
   "ruined," as to whom there is no hope of repentance, because, if our
   labor could bring back any man to the right path, it should by no means
   be withheld. The metaphor is taken from a building, which is not merely
   decayed in some part, but completely demolished, so that it is
   incapable of being repaired.

   He next points out the sign of this ruin -- an evil conscience, when he
   says, that they who do not yield to admonitions are condemned by
   themselves; for, since they obstinately reject the truth, it is certain
   that they sin willfully and of their own accord, and therefore it would
   be of no advantage to admonish them.

   At the same time, we learn from Paul's words that we must not rashly or
   at random pronounce any man to be a heretic; for he says, "Knowing that
   he who is such is ruined." Let the bishop therefore beware lest, by
   indulging his passionate temper, he treat with excessive harshness, as
   a heretic, one whom he does not yet know to be such.

   13 Zenas a lawyer It is uncertain whether "Zenas", was a Doctor of the
   Civil Law or of the Law of Moses; but as we may learn from Paul's words
   that he was a poor man and needed the help of others, it is probable
   that he belonged to the same rank with Apollo, that is, an expounder of
   the Law of God among the Jews. It more frequently happens that such
   persons are in want of the necessaries of life than those who conduct
   causes in civil courts. I have said that Zenas's poverty may be
   inferred from the words of Paul, because the expression, conduct him,
   means here to supply him with the means of accomplishing his journey,
   as is evident from what follows.

   14 And let ours also learn to excel in good works. [268] That the
   Cretans, on whom he lays this burden, may not complain of being loaded
   with the expense, he reminds them that they must not be unfruitful, and
   that therefore they must be warmly exhorted to be zealous in good
   works. But of this mode of expression we have already spoken. Whether,
   therefore, he enjoins them to excel in good works, or to assign the
   highest rank to good works, he means that it is useful for them to have
   an opportunity afforded for exercising liberality, that they may not
   "be unfruitful" on this ground, that there is no opportunity, or that
   it is not demanded by necessity. What follows has been already
   explained in the other Epistles.

   [266] "Au droit chemin." -- "To the right road."

   [267] "Ce qu'il convient au Pasteur de faire." -- "What it belongs to
   the pastor to do."

   [268] "As he said before, let them apply their mind to it. He contrasts
   this with the foolish presumption but too common among those who
   thought that they were clever men, when they had speculated on this and
   the other subject. You have fine speculations, says he, but yet
   consider what is the true excellence of the children of God; it is to
   shew that they have profited well in doing good, and that this is the
   subject to which they have given their study. And then he says, Let
   them learn; as if he had said, Hitherto you have employed your time
   very ill, for there was nothing but foolish ambition, you yielded too
   far to your vain fancy. You must now follow a different course.
   Henceforth you must excel in doing good, and not in rambling talk.
   Instead of being led by curiosity and ambition, let every man be
   employed in doing good to his neighbors. Let every man consider what is
   his ability; and according to the power which God has given us, let us
   serve one another. Thus shall we shew that it is not in vain that we
   have received the gospel." -- Fr. Ser.

   Philemon 1-7

   1. Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto
   Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,

   1. Paulus vinctus Christi Iesu et Timotheus frater Philemoni amico et
   cooperario nostro,

   2. And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to
   the church in thy house:

   2. Et Apphiae dilectae, et Archippo commilitoni nostro, et Ecclesiae,
   quae domi tuae est.

   3. Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   3. Gratia vobis et pax a Deo Patre nostro et Domino Iesu Christo.

   4. I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,

   4. Gratias ago Deo meo, semper memoriam tui faciens in precibus meis,

   5. Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord
   Jesus, and toward all saints;

   5. Audiens tuam dilectionem et fidem, quam habes erga Dominum Iesum et
   erga omnes sanctos,

   6. That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the
   acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.

   6. Ut communicatio fidei tuae efficax sit cognitione omnis boni, quod
   in vobis est erga Christum Iesum.

   7. For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the
   bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.

   7. Gratiam enim habemus multam et consolationem super dilectione tua,
   quia viscera sanctorum per to refocillata sunt, frater.

   The singular loftiness of the mind of Paul, though it may be seen to
   greater advantage in his other writings which treat of weightier
   matters, is also attested by this Epistle, in which, while he handles a
   subject otherwise low and mean, he rises to God with his wonted
   elevation. Sending back a runaway slave and thief, he supplicates
   pardon for him. But in pleading this cause, he discourses about
   Christian forbearance [269] with such ability, that he appears to speak
   about the interests of the whole Church rather than the private affairs
   of a single individual. In behalf of a man of the lowest condition, he
   demeans himself so modestly and humbly, that nowhere else is the
   meekness of his temper painted in a more lively manner.

   1. A prisoner of Jesus Christ. In the same sense in which he elsewhere
   calls himself an Apostle of Christ, or a minister of Christ, he now
   calls himself "a prisoner of Christ;" because the chains by which he
   was bound on account of the gospel, were the ornaments or badges of
   that embassy which he exercised for Christ. Accordingly, he mentions
   them for the sake of strengthening his authority; not that he was
   afraid of being despised, (for Philemon undoubtedly had so great
   reverence and esteem for him, that there was no need of assuming any
   title,) but because he was about to plead the cause of a runaway slave,
   the principal part of which was entreaty for forgiveness.

   To Philemon our friend and fellow-laborer. It is probable that this
   "Philemon" belonged to the order of pastors; for the title with which
   he adorns him, when he calls him fellow-laborer, is a title which he is
   not accustomed to bestow on a private individual.

   2. And to Archippus our fellow-soldier. He next adds "Archippus," who
   appears also to have been a minister of the Church; at least, if he be
   the same person who is mentioned towards the conclusion of the Epistle
   to the Colossians, (Colossians 4:17,) which is not at all improbable;
   for the designation -- "fellow-soldier" -- which he bestows on this
   latter individual, belongs peculiarly to ministers. Although the
   condition of a soldier belongs to all Christians universally, yet
   because teachers may be regarded as standardbearers in the warfare,
   they ought to be ready more than all others to fight, and Satan usually
   gives them greater annoyance. It is also possible, that Archippus
   attended and shared in some contests which Paul maintained; and,
   indeed, this is the very word that Paul makes use of, whenever he
   mentions persecutions.

   And to the Church which is in thy house. By employing these terms, he
   bestows the highest praise on the family of Philemon. And certainly it
   is no small praise of a householder, that he regulates his family in
   such a manner as to be an image of the Church, and to discharge also
   the duty of a pastor within the walls of his dwelling. Nor must we
   forget to mention that this good man had a wife of the same character;
   for she, too, not without reason, is commended by Paul.

   4. I give thanks to my God. It deserves attention, that he at the same
   time prays for that very thing for which he "gives thanks." Even the
   most perfect, so long as they live in the world, never have so good
   ground for congratulation as not to need prayers, that God may grant to
   them, not only to persevere till the end, but likewise to make progress
   from day to day.

   5. Hearing of thy love and faith. This praise, which he bestows on
   Philemon, includes briefly the whole perfection of a Christian man. It
   consists of two parts, faith in Christ, and love towards our neighbors;
   for to these all the actions and all the duties of our life relate.
   Faith is said to be in Christ, because to him it especially looks; in
   like manner as in no other way than through him alone can God the
   Father be known, and in no other than in Him can we find any of the
   blessings which faith seeks.

   And towards all saints. He does not thus limit this love to the saints,
   as if there ought to be none towards others; for, since the doctrine of
   "love" is, that "we should not despise our flesh," (Isaiah 58:7) and
   that we should honor the image of God which is engraven on our nature,
   undoubtedly it includes all mankind. But since they that are of the
   household of faith are united with us by a closer bond of relationship,
   and since God peculiarly recommends them to us, for this reason they
   justly hold the highest rank.

   The arrangement of the passage is somewhat confused; but there is no
   obscurity in the meaning, except that it is doubtful whether the adverb
   always (in the 4th verse) is connected with the first clause, "I give
   thanks always to my God," or with the second clause, "making mention of
   thee always in my prayers." The meaning may be brought out in this
   manner, that, whenever the Apostle offered prayer for Philemon, he
   interwove thanksgiving with it; that is, because Philemon's piety
   afforded ground of rejoicing; for we often pray for those in whom
   nothing is to be found but what gives occasion for grief and tears. Yet
   the second mode of pointing is generally preferred, that Paul "gives
   thanks for Philemon, and always makes mention of him in his prayers."
   Let my readers be at full liberty to judge for themselves; but, for my
   own part, I think that the former meaning is more appropriate.

   In the rest of the passage there is an inversion of the natural order;
   for, after having spoken of "love" and "faith," he adds, "towards
   Christ and towards saints," while, on the contrary, the contrast would
   demand that "Christ" should be put in the second part of the clause as
   the object to which our faith looks. [270]

   6. That the communication of thy faith may be effectual. This clause is
   somewhat obscure; but I shall endeavor to elucidate it in such a manner
   that my readers may somewhat understand Paul's meaning. First, it ought
   to be known that the Apostle is not continuing to give the praise of
   Philemon, but that, on the contrary, he expresses those blessings for
   which he prays to God. These words are connected with what he had
   formerly said, that he "makes mention of him in his prayers." (Philemon
   1:4.) What blessing then did he ask for Philemon? That his faith,
   exercising itself by good works, might be proved to be true, and not
   unprofitable. He calls it "the communication of faith," because it does
   not remain inactive and concealed within, but is manifested to men by
   actual effects. Although faith has a hidden residence in the heart, yet
   it communicates itself to men by good works. It is, therefore, as if he
   had said, "That thy faith, by communicating itself, may demonstrate its
   efficacy in every good thing."

   The knowledge of every good thing denotes experience. He wishes that,
   by its effects, faith may be proved to be effectual. This takes place,
   when the men with whom we converse know our godly and holy life; and
   therefore, he says, of every good thing which is in you; for everything
   in us that is good makes known our faith.

   Towards Christ Jesus. The phrase eis Christon may be explained to mean
   "through Christ." But, for my own part, if I were at liberty, I would
   rather translate it as equivalent to en Christo, "in Christ;" for the
   gifts of God dwell in us in such a manner, that nevertheless, we are
   partakers of them only so far as we are members of Christ. Yet because
   the words in you go before, I am afraid that the harshness of the
   expression would give offense. Accordingly, I have not ventured to make
   any alteration in the words, but only wished to mention it to my
   readers, that, after full consideration, they may choose either of
   those meanings which they prefer.

   7. We have much grace and consolation. Although this reading is found
   in the majority of Greek copies, yet I think that it ought to be
   translated joy; for, since there is little difference between charin
   and charan, it would be easy to mistake a single letter. Besides, Paul
   elsewhere employs the word charin to mean "joy;" at least, if we
   believe Chrysostom on this matter. What has "grace" to do with
   "consolation?"

   For thy love. It is plain enough what he means, that he has great joy
   and consolation, because Philemon administered relief to the
   necessities of the godly. This was singular love, to feel so much joy
   on account of the benefit received by others. Besides, the Apostle does
   not only speak of his personal joy, but says that many rejoiced on
   account of the kindness and benevolence with which Philemon had aided
   religious men.

   Because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.
   "To refresh the bowels" is an expression used by Paul to mean, to give
   relief from distresses, or to aid the wretched in such a manner that,
   having their minds composed, and being free from all uneasiness and
   grief, they may find repose. "The bowels" mean the affections, and
   anapausis denotes tranquillity; and therefore they are greatly mistaken
   who torture this passage so as to make it refer to the belly and the
   nourishment of the body.

   [269] "De la douceur, moderation, et humanite." -- "Of gentleness,
   moderation, and kindness."

   [270] It has sometimes occurred to me, that the intricacy of this
   passage might be removed, first, by the transposition suggested by
   Calvin, and, next, by transposing the 5th verse so as to place it
   before the 4th. "Hearing of thy love towards all saints, and of thy
   faith which thou hast towards Lord Jesus, I give thanks unto my God,
   making mention of thee always in my prayers, That the communication of
   thy faith may be effectual, through the knowledge of every good thing
   which is in thee towards Christ Jesus." - Ed.

   Philemon Verses 8-14

   8. Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that
   which is convenient,

   8. Quapropter multam in Christo fiduciam habens imperandi tibi quod
   decet.

   9. Yet, for love's sake, I rather beseech thee, being such an one as
   Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

   9. Propter caritatem magis rogo, quum talis sim, nempe Paulus senex;
   nunc vero etiam vinctus Iesu Christi.

   10. I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my
   bonds:

   10. Rogo autem to pro filio meo, quem genui in vinculis meis, Onesimo,

   11. Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to
   thee and to me:

   11. Qui aliquando tibi inutilis fuit, nunc autem et mihi et tibi
   utilis.

   12. Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine
   own bowels:

   12. Quem remisi; tu vero illum, hoc est, mea viscera, suscipe.

   13. Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have
   ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:

   13. Quem ego volebam apud me ipsum retinere, ut pro to mihi ministraret
   in vinculis evangelii.

   14. But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should
   not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.

   14. Sed absque tua sententia nihil volui facere, ut non quasi secundum
   necessitatem esset bonum tuum, sed voluntarium.

   8. Wherefore, while I have great confidence in Christ to command thee.
   That is, "though I have authority so that I might justly command thee,
   yet thy love makes me prefer to entreat thee."

   9. Being such a one. He claims the right to command on two grounds,
   that he is an elder, and that he is a prisoner for Christ He says that,
   on account of Philemon's love, he chooses rather to entreat, because we
   interpose authority in commanding those things which we wish to extort
   by necessity even from the unwilling, but there is no need of
   commanding those who willingly obey. And because they who are ready of
   their own accord to do their duty listen more willingly to a calm
   statement of what is necessary to be done than to the exercise of
   authority, with good reason does Paul, when he has to deal with an
   obedient man, use entreaty. By his example he shows that pastors should
   endeavor to draw disciples gently rather than to drag them by force;
   and indeed, when, by condescending to entreaty, he foregoes his right,
   this has far greater power to obtain his wish than if he issued a
   command. Besides, he claims nothing for himself, but in Christ, that
   is, on account of the office which he has received from him; for he
   does not mean that they whom Christ has appointed to be apostles are
   destitute of authority.

   What is proper. By adding this, he means that teachers have not power
   to enact whatever they please, but that their authority is confined
   within these limits, that they must not command anything but "what is
   proper," and, in other respects, consistent with every man's duty.
   Hence (as I said a little before) pastors are reminded that the hearts
   of their people must be soothed with all possible gentleness, wherever
   this method is likely to be more advantageous, but yet so as to know
   that they who are treated so gently have nothing less exacted from them
   than what they ought to do.

   The designation "elder," here, denotes not age, but office. He calls
   himself an apostle for this reason, that the person with whom he has to
   deal, and with whom he talks familiarly, is a fellow-laborer in the
   ministry of the word.

   10. I beseech thee for my son. Since less weight is commonly attached
   to those prayers which are not founded in some cause of just
   commendation, Paul shows that Onesimus is so closely related to him as
   to afford a good reason for supplicating in his behalf. Here it is of
   importance to consider how deep is his condescension, when he gives the
   name of "son" to a slave, and a runaway, and a thief.

   When he says that Onesimus has been begotten by him this must be
   understood to mean, that it was done by his ministry, and not by his
   power. To renew a soul of man and form it anew to the image of God --
   is not a human work, and it is of this spiritual regeneration that he
   now speaks. Yet because the soul is regenerated by faith, and "faith is
   by hearing," (Romans 10:17,) on that, account he who administers the
   doctrine holds the place of a parent. Moreover, because the word of God
   preached by man is the seed of eternal life, we need not wonder that he
   from whose mouth we receive that seed is called a father. Yet, at the
   same time, we must believe that, while the ministry of a man is
   efficacious in regenerating the soul, yet, strictly speaking, God
   himself regenerates by the power of his Spirit. These modes of
   expression, therefore, do not imply any opposition between God and man,
   but only show what God does by means of men. When he says that he had
   begotten him in his bonds, this circumstance adds weight to the
   commendation.

   12. Receive him, that is, my bowels. Nothing could have been more
   powerful for assuaging the wrath of Philemon; for if he had refused to
   forgive his slave, he would thus have used cruelty against "the bowels"
   of Paul. This is remarkable kindness displayed by Paul, that he did not
   hesitate to receive, as it were into his bowels, a contemptible slave,
   and thief, and runaway, so as to defend him from the indignation of his
   master. And, indeed, if the conversion of a man to God were estimated
   by us, at its proper value, we too would embrace, in the same manner,
   those who should give evidence that they had truly and sincerely
   repented.

   13. Whom I was desirous to keep beside me. This is another argument for
   the purpose of appeasing Philemon, that Paul sends him back a slave, of
   whose services, in other respects, he stood greatly in need. It would
   have been extreme cruelty, to disdain so strong affection manifested by
   Paul. He likewise states indirectly, that it will be a gratification to
   himself to have Onesimus sent back to him rather than that he should be
   harshly treated at home.

   That he might minister to me instead of thee in the bonds of the
   gospel. He now mentions other circumstances: first, Onesimus will
   supply the place of his master, by performing this service; secondly,
   Paul himself, through modesty, was unwilling to deprive Philemon of his
   right; and, thirdly, Philemon will receive more applause, if, after
   having had his slave restored to him, he shall willingly and generously
   send him back. From this last consideration we infer, that we ought to
   aid the martyrs of Christ by every kind office in our power, while they
   are laboring for the testimony of the gospel; for if exile,
   imprisonment stripes, blows, and violent seizing of our property, are
   believed by us to belong to the gospel, as Paul here calls them,
   whoever refuses to share and partake of them separates himself even
   from Christ. Undoubtedly the defense of the gospel belongs alike to
   all. Accordingly, he who endures persecution, for the sake of the
   gospel, ought not to be regarded as a private individual, but as one
   who publicly represents the whole Church. Hence it follows, that all
   believers ought to be united in taking care of it, so that they may
   not, as is frequently done, leave the gospel to be defended in the
   person of one man.

   14. That thy benefit might not be by constraint. This is drawn from the
   general rule, that no sacrifices are acceptable to God but those which
   are freely offered. Paul speaks of almsgiving in the same manner. (2
   Corinthians 9:7.) To agathon is here put for "acts of kindness," and
   willingness is contrasted with constraint, when there is no other
   opportunity of putting to the test a generous and cheerful act of the
   will; for that duty which is generously performed, and not through
   influence exercised by others, is alone entitled to full praise. It is
   also worthy of observation, that Paul, while he acknowledges that
   Onesimus was to blame in past time, affirms that he is changed; and
   lest Philemon should have any doubt that his slave returns to him with
   a new disposition and different conduct, Paul says that he has made
   full trial of his repentance by personal knowledge.

   Philemon Verses 15-19

   15. For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest
   receive him for ever;

   15. Forte' enim ideo separatus fuit ad tempus, ut perpetuo eum
   retineres;

   16. Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved,
   specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in
   the Lord?

   16. Non jam ut servum, sed super servum fratrem dilectum maxime mihi,
   quanto magis tibi et in carne et in Domino?

   17. If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.

   17. Si igitur me habes consortem, suscipe eum tanquam me.

   18. If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine
   account;

   18. Si vero qua in re to laesit, vel aliquid debet, id mihi imputa

   19. I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit
   I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self
   besides.

   19. Ego Paulus scripsi mea manu, ego solvam, ut ne dicam tibi, quod et
   to ipsum mihi debes.

   15 For perhaps he was separated. If we are angry on account of offenses
   committed by men, our minds ought to be soothed, when we perceive that
   those things which were done through malice have been turned to a
   different end by the purpose of God. A joyful result may be regarded as
   a remedy for evils, which is held out to us by the hand of God for
   blotting out offenses. Thus Joseph -- when he takes into consideration,
   that the wonderful providence of God brought it about, that, though he
   was sold as a slave, yet he was elevated to that high rank, from which
   he could provide food for his brethren and his father -- forgets the
   treachery and cruelty of his brethren, and says, that he was sent
   before on their account. (Genesis 45:5.)

   Paul therefore reminds Philemon that he ought not to be so greatly
   offended at the flight of his slave, for it was the cause of a benefit
   not to be regretted. So long as Onesimus was at heart a runaway,
   Philemon, though he had him in his house, did not actually enjoy him as
   his property; for he was wicked and unfaithful, and could not be of
   real advantage. He says, therefore, that he was a wanderer for a little
   time, that, by changing his place, he might be converted and become a
   new man. And he prudently softens everything, by calling the flight a
   departure, and adding, that it was only for a time.

   That thou mightest receive him for ever. Lastly, he contrasts the
   perpetuity of the advantage with the short duration of the loss.

   But above a servant, a beloved brother. He next brings forward another
   advantage of the flight, that Onesimus has not only been corrected by
   means of it, so as to become a useful slave, but that he has become the
   "brother" of his master.

   Especially to me. Lest the heart of Onesimus, wounded by the offense
   which was still fresh, should be reluctant to admit the brotherly
   appellation, Paul claims Onesimus first of all, as his own "brother."
   Hence he infers that Philemon is much more closely related to him,
   because both of them had the same relationship in the Lord according to
   the Spirit, but, according to the flesh, Onesimus is a member of his
   family. Here we behold the uncommon modesty of Paul, who bestows on a
   worthless slave the title of a brother, and even calls him a dearly
   beloved brother to himself. And, indeed, it would be excessive pride,
   if we should be ashamed of acknowledging as our brother those whom God
   accounts to be his sons.

   How much more to thee. By these words he does not mean that Philemon is
   higher in rank according to the Spirit; but the meaning is, "Seeing
   that he is especially a brother to me, he must be much more so to thee;
   for there is a twofold relationship between you."

   We must hold it to be an undoubted truth, that Paul does not rashly or
   lightly (as many people do) answer for a man of whom he knows little,
   or extol his faith before he has ascertained it by strong proofs, and
   therefore in the person of Onesimus there is exhibited a memorable
   example of repentance. We know how wicked the dispositions of slaves
   were, so that scarcely one in a hundred ever came to be of real use. As
   to Onesimus, we may conjecture from his flight, that he had been
   hardened in depravity by long habit and practice. It is therefore
   uncommon and wonderful virtue to lay aside the vices by which his
   nature was polluted, so that the Apostle can truly declare that he has
   now become another man.

   From the same source proceeds a profitable doctrine, that the elect of
   God are sometimes brought to salvation by a method that could not have
   been believed, contrary to general expectation, by circuitous windings,
   and even by labyrinths. Onesimus lived in a religious and holy family,
   and, being banished from it by his own evil actions, he deliberately,
   as it were, withdraws far from God and from eternal life. Yet God, by
   hidden providence, wonderfully directs his pernicious flight, so that
   he meets with Paul.

   17 If, therefore, thou holdest me to be thy associate. Here he lowers
   himself still further, by giving up his right and his honor to a
   runaway, and putting him in his own room, as he will shortly afterwards
   offer himself to be his cautioner. He reckoned it to be of vast
   importance that Onesimus should have a mild and gentle master, that
   immoderate severity might not drive him to despair. That is the object
   which Paul toils so earnestly to accomplish. And his example warns us
   how affectionately we ought to aid a sinner who has given us proof of
   his repentance. And if it is our duty to intercede for others, in order
   to obtain forgiveness for those who repent, much more should we
   ourselves treat them with kindness and gentleness.

   18 If in any thing he hath done thee injury. Hence we may infer that
   Onesimus had likewise stolen something from his master, as was
   customary with fugitives; and yet he softens the criminality of the
   act, by adding, or if he oweth thee anything Not only was there a bond
   between them recognised by civil law, but the slave had become indebted
   to his master by the wrong which he had inflicted on him. So much the
   greater, therefore, was the kindness of Paul, who was even ready to
   give satisfaction for a crime.

   19 Not to tell thee that thou owest to me thyself. By this expression
   he intended to describe how confidently he believes that he will obtain
   it; as if he had said, "There is nothing that thou couldest refuse to
   give me, even though I should demand thyself." To the same purpose is
   what follows about lodging and other matters, as we shall immediately
   see.

   There remains one question. How does Paul -- who, if he had not been
   aided by the churches, had not the means of living sparingly and
   frugally -- promise to pay money? Amidst such poverty and want this
   does certainly appear to be a ridiculous promise; but it is easy to see
   that, by this form of expression, Paul beseeches Philemon not to ask
   anything back from his slave. Though he does not speak ironically, yet,
   by an indirect figure, he requests him to blot out and cancel this
   account. The meaning, therefore, is -- "I wish that thou shouldest not
   contend with thy slave, unless thou choosest to have me for thy debtor
   in his stead." For he immediately adds that Philemon is altogether his
   own; and he who claims the whole man as his property, need not give
   himself uneasiness about paying money.

   20. Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my
   bowels in the Lord.

   thou wilt also do more than I say.

   21. Persuasus de tua obedientia scripsi tibi, sciens etiam, quod supra

   25. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

   25. Gratia Domini nostri Iesu Christi cum spiritu vestro. Amen.

   Written from Rome to Philemon by Onesimus a servant.

   Ad Philemonem missa fuit e Roma per Onesimum servum.

   20 Yea, brother. This affirmation is used in order to increase the
   ardor of the exhortation; as if he had said -- "Now shall it be clearly
   proved that there hath been no variance between thee and me, but that,
   on the contrary, thou art sincerely attached to me, and that all that
   thou hadst is at my disposal, if thou pardon offenses and receive into
   favor him who is so closely related to me."

   Refresh my bowels in the Lord. He again repeats the same form of
   expressions which he had previously employed. Hence we infer that the
   faith of the gospel does not overturn civil government, or set aside
   the power and authority which masters have over slaves. For Philemon
   was not a man of the ordinary rank, but a fellow-laborer of Paul in
   cultivating Christ's vineyard; and yet that power over a slave which
   was permitted by the law is not taken away, but he is only commanded to
   receive him kindly by granting forgiveness, and is even humbly besought
   by Paul to restore him to his former condition.

   When Paul pleads so humbly in behalf of another, we are reminded how
   far distant they are from true repentance who obstinately excuse their
   vices, or who, without shame and without tokens of humility,
   acknowledge indeed that they have sinned, but in such a manner as if
   they had never sinned. When Onesimus saw so distinguished an apostle of
   Christ plead so eagerly in his behalf, he, must undoubtedly have been
   much more humbled, that he might bend the heart of his master to be
   merciful to him. To the same purpose is the excuse which he offers
   (Philemon 1:21) for writing so boldly, because he knew that Philemon
   would do more than he had been requested.

   22 But at the same time prepare for me a lodging. This confidence must
   have powerfully excited and moved Philemon; and next, he holds out to
   him the hope of being gratified by his own arrival. Although we do not
   know whether or not Paul was afterwards released from prison, yet there
   is no absurdity in this statement, even though he was disappointed of
   the hope which he cherished about God's temporal kindness. He had no
   confident hope of his release, further than if it pleased God.
   Accordingly, he always kept his mind in suspense, till the will of God
   was made known by the result.

   That through your prayers I shall be given to you. Here it deserves
   notice, that he says that everything that believers obtain "through
   their prayers," is "given" to them; for hence we infer that our
   prayers, though they are not unsuccessful, yet have no power through
   their own merit; for what is yielded to them is of free grace.

   24 Demas. This is the same person who afterwards forsook him, as he
   complains in the Second Epistle to Timothy (2 Timothy 4:10.) And if one
   of Paul's assistants, having become weary and discouraged, was
   afterwards drawn aside by the vanity of the world, let no man reckon
   too confidently on the zeal of a single year; but, considering how
   large a portion of the journey still remains to be accomplished, let
   him pray to God for steadfastness.

   END OF THE COMMENTARIES ON THE EPISTLE TO PHILEMON.

   A TRANSLATION OF CALVIN'S VERSION

   OF THE

   FIRST EPISTLE OF PAUL
   TO TIMOTHY
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 1

   1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the appointment of God
   our Savior, and of the Lord Jesus Christ our hope;

   2 To Timothy my own son in the faith, grace, mercy, peace, from God our
   Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.

   3 As I besought thee to remain at Ephesus, when I set out for
   Macedonia, I wish that thou shouldst charge some not to teach
   differently; [271] and

   4 Not to give heed to fables and to genealogies that have no end, which
   produce questions rather than the edification of God, which consisteth
   in faith.

   5 Now, the end of time commandment is love, out of a pure heart, and of
   a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned;

   6 From which some, having gone astray, have turned aside to idle
   talking

   7 Wishing to be teachers of the law, not understanding what they say,
   nor concerning what things they affirm.

   8 But we know that the law is good, if one use it lawfully;

   9 Knowing this, that the law is not made for the righteous man, but for
   the unrighteous and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for
   the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of
   mothers, for manslayers,

   10 For fornicators, for sodomites, for robbers, for liars, for
   perjurers, and if there be anything else that is contrary to sound
   doctrine;

   11 According to time gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which hath
   been intrusted to me.

   12 And I give thanks to our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath made me
   powerful, because he reckoned me faithful, by putting me into the
   ministry;

   13 Who was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor, and an oppressor,
   but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.

   14 And the grace of our Lord aboundeth beyond measure, with faith and
   love, which is in Christ Jesus.

   15 It is a faithful saying, and worthy of being fully accepted, that
   Christ Jesus came into the world, to save sinners, of whom I am the
   first;

   16 But for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me the first, Jesus
   Christ might show all compassion, for a pattern to those who should
   believe in him to eternal life.

   17 Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God,
   (be) honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

   18 This commandment I recommend to thee, son Timothy, according to the
   prophecies which went before concerning thee, that by them thou mayest
   war a good warfare;

   19 Holding faith and a good conscience, from which some, having turned
   aside concerning faith, have made shipwreck;

   20 Of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan,
   that they may learn not to blaspheme.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [271] "Autrement, ou, diverse doctrine." -- "Differently, or, different
   doctrine."

   CHAPTER 2

   1 I exhort therefore, that, above all, supplications, entreaties,
   intercessions, and thanksgivings, be made for all men;

   2 For kings, and for all who are placed in authority, that we lead a
   peaceful and quiet life, with all godliness and decency;

   3 For this is good and acceptable before God our Savior;

   4 Who wishes that all men may be saved and come to the knowledge of the
   truth.

   5 For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man
   Christ Jesus,

   6 Who gave himself the price of redemption for all, (that there might
   be) a testimony in due time;

   7 For which I have been appointed a herald and an apostle, (I speak the
   truth in Christ, I lie not,) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and
   truth.

   8 I wish therefore that men may pray in every place, lifting up pure
   hands, without wrath and disputing.

   9 In like manner also that women adorn themselves in decent apparel,
   with modesty and sobriety, not with plaited hair, or gold, or pearls,
   or costly raiment,

   10 But (which becometh women professing godliness) by good works.

   11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.

   12 But I suffer not the woman to teach, nor to assume authority over
   the man, but to be silent.

   13 For Adam was first created, then Eve.

   14 And Adam was not deceived; but the woman, being deceived, was guilty
   of the transgression.

   15 Yet she shall be saved through child -- bearing, if they continue in
   faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 3

   1 It is a true saying, If a man desireth the office of a bishop, he
   desireth an excellent work.

   2 A bishop, therefore, must be blameless, the husband of one wife,
   sober, temperate, modest not wickedly desirous of gain,

   3 But mild, not quarrelsome, not covetous,

   4 Who ruleth well his own house, who hath his children in subjection
   with all reverence.

   5 (And if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take
   charge of the church of God?)

   6 Not a novice, lest, being swelled with pride, he fall into
   condemnation of the devil.

   7 He must also have a good report from those who are without, lest he
   fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

   8 In like manner, the deacons must be grave, not double tongued, not
   given to much wine, not wickedly desirous of gain;

   9 Holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience.

   10 And let these be first tried, next let them minister when they have
   been found blameless.

   11 In like manner, their wives must be grave, not slanderers, sober,
   faithful in all things.

   12 Let the deacons be husbands of one wife, who rule their children and
   their houses in a becoming manner,

   13 For they who have served well procure for themselves a good (or,
   honorable) degree, and much liberty in the faith which is in Christ
   Jesus.

   14 These things I write to thee, hoping to come to thee soon and,

   15 If I shall delay, that thou mayest see how thou oughtst to conduct
   thyself in the house of God; which is the Church of the living God, the
   pillar and foundation of truth.

   16 And, without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness; God was
   manifested in the flesh, seen by angels, preached to the Gentiles,
   obtained belief in the world, was received into glory.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 4

   1 Now, the Spirit plainly saith, that, in the latter times, some will
   revolt from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and to
   doctrines of devils;

   2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot
   iron;

   3 Forbidding to enter into marriages, commanding to abstain from some
   kinds of food, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving
   by believers, and by those that know the truth;

   4 Because every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected
   which is received with thanksgiving;

   5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

   6 Exhibiting these things to the brethren, thou shalt he a good
   minister of Jesus Christ, nourished by the words of faith, which thou
   hast followed. [272]

   7 But avoid profane and old women's fables, and, on the contrary,
   exercise thyself to godliness.

   8 For bodily exercise is of little profit; but godliness is profitable
   for all things, having the promises of the present life, and of that
   which is to come.

   9 It is a faithful saying, and worthy of being cordially embraced.

   10 For in this we both labor and suffer reproaches, because we have
   hope fixed on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially
   of believers.

   11 Instruct and teach these things.

   12 Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the
   believers, in word, in conversation, in love, in spirit, in faith, in
   chastity.

   13 Till I come, apply thyself to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.

   14 Neglect not the gift which is in thee, which was given to thee by
   prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.

   15 Take heed to these things; give attention to them, that thy
   profiting may be manifest to all men, (or' in all things.)

   16 Give heed to thyself, and to the doctrine; continue in them; for, if
   thou shalt do this, thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear
   thee.

   CHAPTER 5

   1 Do not harshly rebuke an elder, but exhort him as a father, the
   younger as brethren;

   2 The older women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all
   chastity.

   3 Honor widows that are really widows.

   4 Now, if any widow hath children or grandchildren, let them learn
   first to exercise piety toward their own house, and to requite their
   parents; for this is good and acceptable before God.

   5 Now, she who is really a widow and desolate hopeth in God, and
   continueth in prayers and supplications night and day.

   6 But she who spendeth her time in luxury is dead while she liveth.

   7 And enjoin these things, that they may be blameless.

   8 And if any person do not provide for his own, and especially for
   those of his own household, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than
   an infidel.

   9 Let a widow be chosen, not under sixty years of age, who hath been
   the wife of one man

   10 Having attestation for good works, if she hath brought up children,
   if she hath been hospitable, if she hath washed the feet of the saints,
   if she hath relieved the afflicted, if she hath been diligent in every
   good work.

   11 But refuse younger widows; for, when they have begun to he wanton
   against Christ, they wish to be married;

   12 Having condemnation, because they have renounced their first faith.

   13 And at the same time, being idle, they learn to go about from house
   to house; and not only are idle, but also tattlers and busybodies,
   speaking things which they ought not.

   14 I wish the younger (widows), therefore, to be married, to bear
   children, to take charge of the house, to give no occasion to the
   adversary, that he may have ground for slandering;

   15 For some have already turned aside after Satan.

   16 And if any believing man or believing woman hath widows, let him or
   her relieve them; and let not the church be burdened, that it may
   relieve those who are really widows.

   17 Let the elders [273] that rule well be reckoned worthy of double
   honor, especially those who labor in word and doctrine.

   18 For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth
   out the corn, (Deuteronomy 25:4,) and, The laborer is worthy of his
   hire. (Matthew 10:10.)

   19 Against an elder receive not an accusation, unless by two or three
   witnesses.

   20 Those that sin rebuke in presence of all, [274] that others also may
   fear.

   21 I adjure thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect
   angels, that thou observe these things without hastiness of judgment,
   doing nothing by turning to this side or that.

   22 Lay not bands suddenly on any man, neither partake of other men's
   sins; keep thyself pure.

   23 No longer drink water, but use a little wine on account of thy
   stomach, and of thy frequent ill health.

   24 The sins of some men are visible beforehand, hastening to judgment;
   and in some they follow after.

   25 In like manner, also, the good works are visible beforehand; and
   those that are otherwise cannot be concealed.

   CHAPTER 6

   1 Let all who are slaves under the yoke reckon their own masters worthy
   of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine may not be
   blasphemed.

   2 And they who have believing masters, let them not despise them
   because they are brethren; but let them serve so much the more, because
   they are believers and beloved, and partakers of the benefit. These
   things teach and exhort.

   3 If any man teacheth otherwise (or, other thing), and consenteth not
   to the healthful words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to that doctrine
   which is according to godliness,

   4 He is puffed up, knowing nothing, but sickening after questions and
   debates of words, out of which spring envy, strife, slanders, unfounded
   suspicions,

   5 Useless disputes of men corrupt in understanding, and that are
   destitute of the truth, thinking that gain is godliness. Withdraw
   thyself from such.

   6 But godliness with sufficiency [275] is great gain.

   7 For we brought nothing into the world; it is certain that neither can
   we carry anything out.

   8 And having food and raiment, we shall be content with these.

   9 For they who wish to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and
   into numerous and hurtful follies, which plunge men into ruin and
   destruction.

   10 For the root of all evils is avarice, which some eagerly desiring,
   have gone astray from the faith, and have entangled themselves with
   many sorrows.

   11 But thou, O man of God, flee these things, and follow after
   righteousness, piety, faith, love, patience, meekness.

   12 Fight the good fight of faith; lay hold on eternal life, to which
   also thou art called, and hast confessed a good confession before many
   witnesses.

   13 I charge (or, command) thee before God, who quickeneth all things,
   and before Christ Jesus, who testified a good confession before Pontius
   Pilate,

   14 That thou keep the commandment without spot and unblameably, till
   the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;

   15 Which shall be manifested in due season by the blessed and only
   Prince, the King of kings, and Lord of lords,

   16 Who along bath immortality, who inhabiteth unapproachable light,
   whom no man hath seen or can see, to whom be honor and everlasting
   power (or, everlasting dominion). Amen.

   17 Command (or, charge) those who are rich, that they be not haughty,
   nor hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, who
   supplieth all things abundantly for enjoyment;

   18 To do good, to be rich in good works, ready to distribute (or, to
   bestow), willingly imparting,

   19 Laying up for themselves a good foundation for the future, that they
   may lay hold on eternal life.

   20 O Timothy, guard that which is committed to thee, avoiding profane
   vanities of noises, idle talking, and contradictions of science falsely
   so called,

   21 Which some professing, have erred concerning the faith. Grace (be)
   with thee. Amen.

   The first (Epistle) to Timothy was sent from Laodicea, which is the
   chief city of Phrygia Pacatiana.

   A TRANSLATION OF CALVIN'S VERSION

   OF THE

   SECOND EPISTLE OF PAUL
   TO TIMOTHY
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 1

   1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the
   promise of life, which is in Christ Jesus,

   2 To Timothy, my beloved son, [276] grace, mercy, peace, from God the
   Father, and from Christ Jesus our Lord.

   3 I give thanks to God, whom I worship from my ancestors, in a pure
   conscience, as I make continual mention of thee in my prayers night and
   day,

   4 Desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be
   filled with joy;

   5 Calling to remembrance that unfeigned faith which is in thee, which
   dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunice, and I am
   persuaded that (it dwelleth) in thee also. [277]

   6 For which cause I advise thee to stir up the gift of God which is in
   thee, by the laying on of my hands;

   7 For God hath not given to us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and
   of love, and of soberness.

   8 Be not ashamed, therefore, of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me,
   who am his prisoner; but be thou a partaker of the afflictions of the
   gospel, according to the power of God;

   9 Who hath saved us and hath called us with a holy calling; not
   according to our works, but according to his purpose and grace, which
   was given to us in Christ Jesus before eternal ages,

   10 But hath now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus
   Christ, who hath indeed destroyed death, and hath brought to light life
   and immortality by the gospel.

   11 To which I have been appointed a herald, and an apostle, and a
   teacher of the gentiles;

   12 For which cause also I suffer these things, but I am not ashamed;
   for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to
   keep what I have intrusted to him till that day.

   13 Hold the form of sound words which thou hast heard from me, in faith
   and love which is in Christ Jesus.

   14 Guard the excellent thing to thee by the Holy Spirit, who dwelleth
   in us.

   15 Thou knowest this, that all that are in Asia have forsaken me; of
   whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.

   16 May the Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus; for he often
   refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,

   17 But when he was in Rome, he sought me out diligently, and found me.

   18 May the Lord grant to him that he may find mercy with the Lord on
   that day; and how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus, thou
   knowest well. [278]

   bien." -- "And all that in which he served me at Ephesus thou knowest
   very well."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 2

   1 Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace which is in Christ
   Jesus.

   2 And what things thou hast heard from me by many witnesses, these
   commit thou to believing men, who shall be able to teach others also.

   3 Do thou therefore endure afflictions, as a good soldier of Jesus
   Christ.

   4 No man who warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of life, that
   he may please his general.

   5 And if any one also strive, he is not crowned, unless he strive
   lawfully.

   6 The husbandman must labor before he receive the fruits.

   7 Understand what I say; and may the Lord give thee understanding in
   all things!

   8 Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, hath been raised
   from the dead, according to my gospel;

   9 In which I am a sufferer, as an evil -- doer, even to bonds, but the
   word of God is not bound.

   10 Wherefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they
   also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal
   glory.

   11 It is a faithful saying; for if we die with him, we shall also live
   with him;

   12 If we suffer, we shall also reign with him; [279] if we deny him,
   [280] he will also deny us;

   13 If we are unbelieving, he remaineth faithful; he cannot deny
   himself.

   14 Remind them of these things, solemnly charging them before the Lord
   not to dispute about words, for no use, (but) for the subversion of the
   hearers.

   15 Study to shew thyself to be approved by God, a workman that doth not
   blush, dividing aright the word of truth.

   16 But avoid profane and unmeaning noises; for they will grow to
   greater ungodliness.

   17 And their word will eat as a gangrene; of the number of whom are
   Hymenaeus and Philetus,

   18 Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is
   already past, and subvert the faith of some.

   19 Nevertheless, the foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal,
   The Lord knoweth who are his, and, Let every one that calleth on the
   name of Christ depart from iniquity.

   20 Now, in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver,
   but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor and some to dishonor

   21 If any one, therefore, shall cleanse himself from these, he shall be
   a vessel sanctified for honor, and useful for the Lord, being prepared
   for every good work.

   22 Flee youthful desires; but follow righteousness, faith, love, peace,
   with all that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

   23 But avoid foolish and uninstructive questions, knowing that they
   beget quarrels.

   24 But the servant of the Lord must not fight, but must be gentle
   towards all, qualified for teaching, patient to the bad,

   25 Instructing (or, chastising) those who resist, if some time God give
   to them repentance for the acknowledgment of the truth,

   26 And deliverance (or, return to a sound mind) from the snare of the
   devil, by whom they are held captive at his will.

   CHAPTER 3

   1 But know this, that in the last days there will arise dangerous (or,
   troublesome) times.

   2 For men will be lovers of themselves, covetous, proud, slanderers,
   disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy;

   3 Without natural affection, [281] covenant breakers, false accusers,
   intemperate, fierce, despisers of those that are good;

   4 Traitors, rash, haughty, lovers of pleasures rather than of God;

   5 Having a form of godliness, while they deny the power of it.

   6 Turn away from those persons; for of those are they who creep into
   families, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, who are led
   away by various sinful desires;

   7 Always learning, while yet they never can come to the knowledge of
   the truth.

   8 And as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the
   truth, men corrupted in understanding, reprobate concerning the faith.

   9 But they shall not proceed further; for the madness of the latter
   shall be manifest to all, as was also that of time former.

   10 But thou hast closely followed my doctrine, instruction, [282]
   purpose, faith, meekness, love, patience;

   11 Persecutions, afflictions, which befell me at Antioch, at Iconium,
   at Lystra; what persecutions I endured; but out of them all the Lord
   delivered me.

   12 And all who wish to live a godly life in Christ Jesus shall suffer
   persecution.

   13 But wicked men and impostors will grow worse and worse, going
   astray, and leading others astray.

   14 But as for thee, continue in those things which thou hast learned,
   and which have been intrusted to thee, knowing from whom thou hast
   learned them;

   15 And that from (thy) childhood thou hast known the holy scriptures,
   which are able to make thee wise to salvation, through faith which is
   in Christ Jesus.

   16 All scripture (or, the whole of scripture) is divinely inspired, and
   is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
   instruction which is in righteousness;

   17 That the man of God may be perfect, being made ready for every good
   work.

   CHAPTER 4

   1 I adjure thee, therefore, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who
   shall judge the living and the dead, at his appearing and his kingdom.

   2 Preach the word; apply thyself in season, out of season; reprove,
   rebuke, exhort, with all gentleness and doctrine.

   3 For there will be a time, when they will not endure sound doctrine,
   but, having itching ears, shall heap up to themselves according to
   their sinful desires;

   4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be
   turned to fables.

   5 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an
   evangelist, render thy ministry approved.

   6 For I am now offered as a sacrifice, and the time of my dissolution
   is at hand.

   7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept
   the faith.

   8 Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which
   the Lord, the righteous Judge, will render to me on that day, and not
   to me only, but likewise to all who love his coming.

   9 Make haste to come to me quickly.

   10 For Demas hath forsaken me, having embraced this world, and is gone
   away to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.

   11 Luke alone is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee, for he is
   profitable to me for the ministry.

   12 And I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.

   13 When thou shalt come, bring the cloak which I left at Carpus, and
   the books, and the parchments.

   14 Alexander the coppersmith hath done me many evil things; may the
   Lord reward him according to his works!

   15 Of whom beware thou also; for he vehemently opposed our discourses.

   16 At my first defense no man assisted me, but all forsook me; may it
   not be laid to their charge!

   17 But the Lord assisted and strengthened me, that through me the
   proclamation might be confirmed, and that all the Gentiles might hear;
   and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

   18 And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve
   me to his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory for ever and ever! Amen.

   19 Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the family of Onesiphorus.

   20 Erastus remained at Corinth; but I left Trophimus at Miletum sick.

   21 Make haste to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens,
   and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.

   22 The Lord Jesus Christ (be) with thy spirit. Grace be with thee. Amen

   This Second (Epistle) was written from Rome to Timothy, who was the
   first bishop ordained at Ephesus, when Paul was brought the second time
   before Caesar Nero.

   TRANSLATION OF CALVIN'S VERSION

   OF The

   EPISTLE OF PAUL TO TITUS
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 1

   1 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to
   the faith of the elect of God, and (or, that is,) the knowledge of that
   truth which is according to godliness;

   2 In the hope (or, on account of the hope) of eternal life, which God,
   who cannot lie, promised before eternal ages,

   3 but hath manifested in his own times his word (or, by his word,) in
   the preaching which hath been committed to me, according to the
   appointment of God our Savior;

   4 To Titus, my own son, according to the common faith, grace, mercy,
   peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.

   5 For this reason I left thee in Crete, that thou mightest continue to
   correct those things which are still wanting, ^f [283] and mightst
   ordain presbyters ^f [284] in each city, as I appointed thee:

   6 If any one is blameless, the husband of one wife, having believing
   children, not accused of licentiousness, not disobedient.

   7 For a bishop ought to be blameless, as a governor of the house of
   God; not self-willed, not passionate, not given to wine, not a striker,
   not wickedly desirous of gain;

   8 But hospitable, devoted to kindness, prudent, just, holy, temperate;

   9 Holding fast the faithful word, which is according to instruction,
   that he maybe able both to exhort by sound doctrine, and to convince
   adversaries.

   10 For there are many unruly, [285] and vain talkers, and deceivers of
   minds' chiefly they who are of the circumcision;

   11 Whose month must be stopped, who overturn whole houses, teaching
   things which they ought not, for the sake of dishonest gain.

   12 One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, The Cretans are
   always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies.

   13 This testimony is true; wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may
   be sound in the faith,

   14 And may not give heed to Jewish fables, and to commandments of men
   who turn aside from the truth.

   15 To the pure all things indeed are pure; but to the polluted and
   unbelieving nothing is pure, but their mind and conscience are
   polluted.

   16 They profess that they know God, but in works they deny him; for
   they are abominable, disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.

   poursuyves de corriger les choses qui restent." -- "The reason why I
   left thee in Crete, is in order that thou mayest continue to correct
   the things that are wanting."

   [284] "Des prestres, ou anciens." -- "Presbyters, or elders."

   [285] "Car il y en a plusieurs qui ne se peuvent ranger." -- "For there
   are many of them who cannot submit to authority."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 2

   1 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine;

   2 That aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in
   patience;

   3 That aged women, in like manner, wear raiment which becomes religious
   persons, that they be not slanderers, not slaves to much wine, (that
   they be) teachers of what is good;

   4 That they may teach the young women temperance to love their husbands
   and their children,

   5 To be temperate, chaste, keepers of the house, kind, subject to their
   husbands ^f [286] that the word of God may not be evil spoken of.

   6 Exhort likewise younger men to be temperate;

   7 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works; in doctrine,
   (chewing) integrity, gravity;

   8 Sound speech, unblameable, that the adversary may be ashamed, having
   nothing evil to say of you.

   9 Exhort servants to be subject to their own masters, endeavoring to
   please them in all things, not answering again;

   10 Not thievish, but shewing all good faith, that they may adorn the
   doctrine of God our Savior in all things

   11 For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men,

   12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should
   live temperately and righteously and piously, in this world,

   13 Looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of Jesus Christ, the
   great God and our Savior,

   14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity,
   and purify to himself a peculiar, people, zealous of good works. ^f
   [287]

   15 Speak these things, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let
   no man despise thee.

   [287] "Adonne a bonnes oeuvres." -- "Devoted to good works."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 3

   1 Remind them to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey
   magistrates, to be ready for every good work;

   2 To speak evil of no one, not to be given to fighting, (to be) kind,
   shew shewing all meekness towards all men.

   3 For we ourselves were also formerly foolish, disobedient, going
   astray, serving various desires and pleasures, living in malice and
   envy, hateful, [288] and hating one another.

   4 But after that the goodness and love of God our Savior towards men
   appeared,

   5 Not by works, which were in righteousness, which we had done, but
   according to his mercy, he saved us, by the washing of regeneration and
   of the renewing of the Holy Spirit,

   6 Which (or, whom) he shed abundantly on us, through Jesus Christ our
   Savior,

   7 That, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according
   to the hope of eternal life.

   8 A faithful saying: I wish thee to affirm these things, that they who
   have believed in God may be careful to excel in good works, (or, to
   extol good works, or, to assign to them the highest rank.) For these
   things are honorable and profitable to men

   9 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and
   fightings about the law; for they are unprofitable and unnecessary.

   10 Avoid an heretical man after the first and second admonition;

   11 Knowing that he who is such is ruined, being condemned by himself.

   12 When I shall send to thee Artemas, or Tychicus, hasten to come to me
   to Nicopolis for I have determined to winter there.

   13 Be careful to help forward Zenas the lawyer, and Apollo, that they
   may not be in want of anything.

   14 And let ours also learn to excel in good works (or, as formerly, to
   assign to them the highest rank, that they may excel,) for necessary
   uses, that they may not be unfruitful.

   15 All who are with me salute thee. Salute those who love us in faith.
   Grace (be) with you all. Amen.

   It was written from Nicopolis of Macedonia, to Titus, who was ordained
   the first bishop of the Church of the Cretans.

   A TRANSLATION OF CALVIN'S VERSION

   OF THE

   EPISTLE OF PAUL TO PHILEMON
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy a brother,

   2 To Philemon our friend and fellow-laborer, and to Apphia the beloved,
   and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church which is in thy
   house.

   3 Grace (be) to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   4 I give thanks to my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,

   5 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast towards the Lord Jesus
   and towards all saints,

   6 That the communication of thy faith may be effectual, by the
   knowledge of every good thing which is in thee towards Christ Jesus.

   7 For we have much grace (or, joy) and consolation on account of thy
   love, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee,
   brother.

   8 Wherefore, while I have great confidence in Christ to command thee
   what is proper, yet for love's sake I rather entreat thee;

   9 Being such a one as Paul the aged (or, elder,) and now also a
   prisoner of Jesus Christ.

   10 I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bonds,

   11 Onesimus, who formerly was unprofitable to thee, but now is
   profitable both to thee and to me;

   12 Whom I have sent back; receive him therefore, that is, my bowels;

   13 Whom I was desirous to keep beside me, that he might minister to me
   instead of thee in the bonds of the gospel.

   14 But without thy opinion I would do nothing, that thy benefit might
   not be by constraint, but of free choice.

   15 For perhaps for this reason he was separated for a time, that thou
   mightest receive him for ever;

   16 Not now as a slave, but above a slave, a beloved brother, especially
   to me, how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord?

   17 If therefore thou holdest me to be thy associate, receive him as
   myself.

   18 And if in anything he hath done thee injury, or oweth thee anything,
   place it to my account.

   19 I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will pay it; not to tell
   thee that thou owest me even thyself.

   20 Yea, brother, let me enjoy [289] in the Lord; refresh my bowels in
   the Lord.

   21 Being convinced of they obedience, I have written to thee, knowing
   that thou wilt do beyond what I write.

   22 But at the same time prepare for me a lodging; for I hope that
   through your prayers I shall be given to you.

   23 Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus,

   24 Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow laborers, salute thee.

   25 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (be) with your spirit. Amen.

   It was sent from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus a slave.
