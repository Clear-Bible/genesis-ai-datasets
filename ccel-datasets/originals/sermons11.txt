                              True Unity Promoted

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JANUARY 1, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Endea voring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
   Ephesians 4:3.

   YOU will remember that for several years I have received my morning's
   text for the first Sunday in the year from an esteemed Brother, a
   clergyman of the Church of England. This year he very kindly sends me
   this verse, which I hope will be useful to us all, reminding us of our
   former faults and of our present duty in the matter of "endeavoring to
   keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace." The Pope has lately
   been most lustily cursing us all. According to his nature, of course,
   must be his utterances. We could not expect a blessing where no
   blessing abides. And if we get a curse we only receive a polluted
   stream from a polluted fountain. It is an old saying that England never
   prospers so well as when the Pope curses her. I hope to see a year of
   great prosperity this year!

   Let the poor deluded priest curse as long as he will, our God shall
   turn it into a blessing. In former days, when some of the Churches of
   Christ began to shake off the yoke of Popedom from their necks, the
   plea urged against reformation was the necessity of maintaining unity.
   "You must bear with this ceremony and that dogma no matter how
   antichristian and unholy, you must bear with it, 'endeavoring to keep
   the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.' " So spoke the old
   serpent in those early days. "The Church is one, woe unto those who
   shall create schism! It may be true that Mary is set up in the place of
   Christ, that images are worshipped, sticks and rotten rags adored and
   pardons bought and sold for crimes of every kind. It may be that the
   so-called church has become an abomination and a nuisance upon the face
   of the earth, but still, 'endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit
   in the bond of peace,' you must lie down, restrain the testimony of the
   Spirit of God within you, keep His Truth under a bushel and let the lie
   prevail."

   This was the grand sophistry of the church of Rome. When, however, she
   could not seduce men by talking of love and union, she took upon
   herself to use her natural tone of voice and cursed right and left
   right heartily--and so let her curse till she expires! Brethren, there
   was no reason in the argument of the Papist! If you will look at the
   text for a moment, you will see the text bids us endeavor to keep the
   unity of the Spirit--but it does not tell us to endeavor to maintain
   the unity of evil, the unity of superstition--or the unity of spiritual
   tyranny! The unity of error, of false doctrine, of priestcraft may have
   in it the spirit of Satan--we do not doubt that--but that it is the
   unity of the Spirit of God we do utterly deny!

   The unity of evil we are to break down by every weapon which our hands
   can grasp--the unity of the Spirit which we are to maintain and foster
   is quite another thing. Remember that we are forbidden to do evil that
   good may come. And it is evil to restrain the witness of the Spirit of
   God within us! To conceal any Truth of God which we have learned by
   revelation of God is evil! To hold back from testifying for God's Truth
   and Word--against the sin and folly of man's inventions--would be sin
   of the blackest hue. We dare not commit the sin of quenching the Holy
   Spirit even though it were with the view of promoting unity!

   The unity of the Spirit never requires any sinful support--that is
   maintained not by suppressing the Truth of God, but by publishing it
   abroad. The unity of the Spirit has for its pillars, among other
   things, the witnessing of spiritually enlightened saints to the one
   faith which God has revealed in His Word. That is quite another unity
   which would gag our mouths and turn us all into dumb driven cattle to
   be fed or slaughtered at the will of priestly masters. Dr. McNeil has,
   very properly, said that a man can scarcely be an earnest Christian in
   the recent day without being a controversialist. We are sent forth
   today as sheep in the midst of wolves--can there be agreement? We are
   kindled as lamps in the midst of darkness--can there be concord?

   Has not Christ Himself said, "Think not that I am come to send peace on
   earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword"? You understand how all
   this is the truest method of endeavoring to keep the unity of the
   Spirit, for Christ, the

   Man of War, is Jesus the Peacemaker. But in order to the creation of
   lasting, spiritual peace, the phalanx of evil must be broken and the
   unity of darkness dashed to shivers. I pray God evermore to preserve us
   from a unity in which Truth shall be considered valueless! In which
   principle gives place to policy! In which the noble and masculine
   virtues which adorn the Christian hero are to be supplemented by an
   effeminate affectation of charity! May the Lord deliver us from
   indifference to His Word and will! This only creates the cold unity of
   masses of ice frozen into an iceberg chilling the air for miles
   around--the unity of the dead as they sleep in their graves, contending
   for nothing--because they have neither part nor lot in all that belongs
   to living men.

   There is a unity which is seldom broken--the unity of devils, who,
   under the service of their great liege master, never disagree and
   quarrel! From this terrible unity keep us, O God of Heaven! The unity
   of locusts have one common object-- the glutting of themselves to the
   ruin of all around! The unity of the waves of Tophet's fire, sweeping
   myriads into deeper misery--from this also, O King of Heaven, save us
   forevermore! May God perpetually send some Prophet who shall cry aloud
   to the world, "Your covenant with death shall be disannulled and your
   agreement with Hell shall not stand." May there ever be found some men,
   though they are rough as Amos, or stern as Haggai, who shall denounce
   again and again all league with error and all compromise with sin and
   declare that these are the abhorrence of God!

   Never dream that holy contention is at all a violation of my text. The
   destruction of every sort of union which is not based on the Truth of
   God is a preliminary to the edification of the unity of the Spirit. We
   must first sweep away these walls of untempered mortar--these tottering
   fences of man's building--before there can be room to lay the goodly
   stones of Jerusalem's walls one upon the other for lasting and enduring
   prosperity!

   In this spirit have I spoken to clear a way to reach my text. It is
   clear from the text that there is a unity of the Spirit to be kept.
   Secondly that it needs keeping. And thirdly, that a bond is to be used.
   When we have enlarged upon these points we shall use the text in its
   practical application--first to Christians in their connection with
   other churches and then to members of the same Church in their
   connection with each other.

   I. First, THERE IS A UNITY OF THE SPIRIT OF WHICH THE TEXT SPEAKS WHICH
   IS WORTHY TO BE KEPT. You will observe it is not an ecclesiastical
   unity. It is not endeavoring to keep the unity of the denomination, the
   community, the diocese, the parish--no, it is "endeavoring to keep the
   unity of the Spirit." Men speak of the Episcopal Church, the Wesleyan
   Church, or the Presbyterian Church. Now I hesitate not to say that
   there is nothing whatever in Scripture at all parallel to such
   language, for there I read of the seven Churches in Asia, the Church in
   Corinth, Philippi, Antioch, etc.

   In England, if I speak according to the Word of God, there are some
   thousands of churches holding the Episcopal form of government. In
   Scotland, some thousands of godly churches are ordered according to
   Presbyterian rule. Among the Wesleyans, there are churches adhering to
   the form of government first carried out by Mr. Wesley. But it is not
   according to the method of Scripture, but only according to human
   invention to speak of a whole cluster of churches as one church.

   Although I myself am much inclined to a Presbyterian union among our
   churches, I cannot but perceive in Holy Scripture that each church is
   separate and distinct from every other church. The whole being is
   connected by those different bonds and ligaments which keep all the
   separate members together--but not so connected as to run into one
   another to lose their separateness and individuality. There is nothing
   in Scripture which says, "Endeavoring to keep up your ecclesiastical
   arrangements for centralization." The exhortation runs
   thus--"Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit."

   Again, you will observe it does not say, "Endeavoring to keep the
   uniformity of the Spirit." The Spirit does not recognize uniformity.
   The analogy of His work in nature is against it. The flowers are not
   all tinted with the same hue, nor do they exhale the same odors. There
   is variety everywhere in the work of God. If I glance at Providence, I
   do not perceive that any two events happen after the same form--the
   page of history is varied. If, therefore, I look into the Church of
   God, I do not expect to find that all Christians pronounce the same
   shibboleth, or see with the same eyes.

   The same, "one Lord, one faith, one Baptism, one God and Father of
   all," we rejoice to recognize. But as to uniformity of dress,
   liturgical verbiage, or form of worship, I find nothing of it in
   Scripture. Men may pray acceptably standing, sitting, kneeling, or
   lying with their faces upon the earth. They may meet with Jesus by the
   river's side, in the temple porch, in a prison, or in a private house.
   And they may be one in the same Spirit although the one regards a day
   and the other regards it not.

   So what is this unity of the Spirit? I trust, dear Brothers and
   Sisters, that we know it by having it in possession. It is most certain
   that we cannot keep the unity of the Spirit if we don't already have
   it! Let us ask ourselves the question, "Have we the unity of the
   Spirit?" None can have it but those who have the Spirit and the Spirit
   dwells only in new-born believing souls. By virtue of his having the
   Spirit, the Believer is in union with every other spiritual man and
   this is the unity which he is to endeavor to keep.

   This unity of the Spirit is manifested in love. A husband and wife may
   be, through Providence, cast hundreds of miles from one another--but
   there is a unity of spirit in them because their hearts are one. We,
   Brethren, are divided many thousands of miles from the saints in
   Australia, America and the South Seas--but loving as Brethren--we feel
   the unity of the Spirit. I was never a member of a Church meeting in
   the backwoods of America. I never worshipped God with the Samoans, or
   with my Brethren in New Zealand--but notwithstanding all this, I feel
   the unity of the Spirit in my soul with them and everything which
   concerns their spiritual welfare is interesting to me.

   This unity of the Spirit is caused by a similarity of nature. Find a
   drop of water glittering in the rainbow, leaping in the waterfall,
   rippling in the rivulet, lying silent in the stagnant pool or dashing
   in spray against the vessel's side--that water claims kinship with
   every drop of water the wide world over because it is the same in its
   elements. And even so there is a unity of the Spirit which we cannot
   imitate which consists in our being "begotten again unto a lively hope
   by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."

   We bear in us the Holy Spirit as our daily Quickener and walk in the
   path of faith in the living God. Here is the unity of spirit, a unity
   of life working itself out in love. This is sustained daily by the
   Spirit of God. He who makes us one, keeps us one. Every member of my
   body must have a communion with every other member of my body. I say
   must. The question never arises, that I know of, between the members of
   my body whether they will do so or not. As long as there is life in my
   frame, every separate portion of my body must have communion with every
   other portion of it.

   Here is my finger--I may discolor it with some noxious drug. My head
   may not approve of the staining of my finger--it may suggest a thousand
   ways by which that finger ought to be put through a purgation and this
   may be all right and proper--but my head never says, "I will cut off
   that finger from communion." My tongue speaks loudly against the
   noxious fluid which has done my finger mischief and has blistered it so
   as to cause pain to the whole body, yet the head cannot say, "I will
   have that finger cut off," unless the body is willing to be forever
   mutilated and incomplete.

   Now, it is not possible to mutilate the body of Christ. Christ does not
   lose His members or cast off parts of His mystical body. And therefore
   it never ought to enter the head of any Christian whether or not he
   shall have communion in spirit with any other Christian, for he cannot
   do without it--as long as he lives he must have it. This does not stop
   him in boldly denouncing the error into which his Brother may have
   fallen, or in avoiding his intimate acquaintance while he continues to
   sin. But it does forbid the thought that we can ever really sever any
   true Believer from Christ, or even from us, if we are in Christ Jesus.

   The unity of the Spirit is preserved, then, by the Holy Spirit infusing
   daily life-floods into the one mystical body. And in proportion as the
   life-floods become more strong, that union becomes more manifest. Let a
   spirit of prayer be poured out on all our churches and
   conventionalities will be dashed down--divisions will be forgotten and
   locked in each others arms--the people of God will show to the world
   that they are one in Christ Jesus! There are some points in which this
   unity of the Spirit is certain to discover itself. In prayer, how truly
   does Montgomery put it--

   "The saints in prayer appear as one In word and deed and mind,
   While with the Father and the Son, Sweet fellowship they find."

   There is a unity of praise, too. Our hymn books differ, after all, very
   little. We still sing the same songs and praise the same Savior. This
   unity will soon discover itself in co-working--they have a union in
   their conflict with the common foe and in their contention for the
   common Truth of God. This will lead to communion--I do not mean sitting
   down to the same table to eat bread and drink wine--that is only the
   outward union--but I mean that communion which consists in heart
   beating true to heart and in the feeling that they are one in Christ
   Jesus. It was a motto with Bucer, "To love all in whom he could see
   anything of Christ Jesus."

   Be this your motto, Brothers and Sisters in Christ. Make not your love
   an excuse for not offering stern rebuke, but rebuke because you love!
   Some persons think that unless you smooth your tongue and cover your
   words with sugar, no matter though it may be sugar of lead--unless you
   cringe and compliment and conceal--there is no love in your heart. But
   I trust it will be our privilege to show in our own persons, some of
   us, how sternly we can dissent and yet love. How truly be
   Nonconformists to our Brethren's error and yet in our very
   nonconformity prove our affection to them and to our common Master.

   It is said of some men that they appear to have been born upon the
   mountains of Bether, for they do nothing but cause division. And
   baptized in the waters of Meribah, for they delight in causing strife.
   This is not the case with the genuine Christian--he cares only for the
   Truth, for his Master, for the love of souls--and when these things are
   not imperiled, his own private likes or dislikes never affect him. He
   loves as much to see another Church prosper as his own--so long as he
   can know that Christ is glorified, it is a matter of comparative
   indifference to him by what minister God's arm is made bare, in what
   place souls are converted, or to what particular form of worship men
   addict themselves.

   Yet ever does he hold to this--that there is no unity of the Spirit
   where there is a lie in the teaching--that where the souls of men are
   concerned he would be a traitor to God if he did not bear witness
   against the error which damns, and testify to the Truth which saves.
   And where the crown jewels of his Master's kingdom are concerned he
   dares not traitorously hold his tongue. And though his fellow subjects
   cast his name out as evil, he counts it all joy so long as he is
   faithful to his Master and discharges his conscience as before the
   Judge of the quick and the dead.

   II. Secondly, THIS UNITY NEEDS KEEPING. It is a very difficult thing to
   maintain and that for several reasons. Our sins would, very naturally,
   break it. If we were all angels we should keep the unity of the Spirit
   and not need even the exhortation to do so. But, alas, we are proud,
   and pride is the mother of division! Diotrephes, who loves to have the
   preeminence, is very sure to head a faction.

   Envy, too, how that separates friends! When I cannot be satisfied with
   anything which is not hammered on my anvil or run in my mold. When
   another man's candle grieves me because it gives more light than mine.
   And when another man troubles me because he has more Divine Grace than
   I have--oh, there is no unity in this case! Anger--what a deadly foe is
   that to unity! When we cannot take the smallest disrespect--when the
   slightest thing brings the blood into our face-- when we speak
   unadvisedly with our lips--but surely I need not read the long list of
   sins which spoil this unity of the Spirit, for they are legion! O, may
   God cast them out from us, for only so can we keep the unity of the
   Spirit!

   But, Beloved, our very virtues may make it difficult for us to keep
   this unity. Luther is brave and bold, hot and impetuous. He is just the
   man to lead the van and clear the way for the Reformation. Calvin is
   logical, clear, cool, precise-- he seldom speaks rashly. It is not in
   the order of things that Luther and Calvin should always agree. Their
   very virtues cause them to fall out and, consequently, Luther, in a bad
   temper, calls Calvin a pig and a devil. And, albeit, Calvin once
   replied, "Luther may call me what he will, but I will always call him a
   dear servant of Christ."

   Yet John Calvin knew how to pierce Luther under the fifth rib when he
   was in humor. In those days the courtesies of Christians to one another
   were generally of the iron-gauntlet order rather than the naked hand.
   All were so much called to war for the sake of the Truth of God that
   even their fellow soldiers were treated with suspicion. And it may be
   with us that the very watchfulness of Truth, which is so valuable, may
   make us suspect where there is no need for suspicion and our courage
   may take us as sometimes a fiery horse has carried a young warrior
   beyond where he intended to have rid-den--where he may be taken
   prisoner to his own damage.

   We must watch--the best of us must watch--lest we fight the Lord's
   battles with Satan's weapons and so even from love to God and His Truth
   violate the unity of the Spirit. The unity of the Spirit ought to be
   kept, dear Friends, because Satan is so busy to mar it. He knows that
   the greatest Glory of Christ will spring from the unity of His Church.
   "That they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me and I in You. That
   they also may be one in Us: that the world may believe that You have
   sent Me."

   There is no Church happiness where there is not Church unity. Let a
   Church be disaffected and divided, the schism in the body is death to
   all hallowed fellowship. We cannot enjoy communion with each other
   unless our hearts are one. Our work for God--how feebly it is done when
   we are not agreed! The enemy cannot desire a better ally than strife in
   the midst of our camp. "Can you not agree," said a warrior of old,
   "when your enemy is in sight?" Christians, can you not agree to keep
   the unity of the Spirit when a destroying Satan is ever on the watch
   seeking to drag immortal souls down to perdition?

   We must be more diligent in this matter! We must seek to purge out from
   ourselves everything which would divide and to have in our hearts every
   holy thought which would tend to unite us with our Brethren. I am not,
   when I join a Christian Church, to say, "I am quite certain I shall
   never break its unity." I am to suspect myself of a liability to that
   evil and I am to watch with all diligence that I keep the unity of the
   Spirit.

   III. In the third place, in order to the keeping of this, THERE IS A
   BOND PROVIDED, THE BOND OF PEACE. Beloved, there should be much peace,
   perfect peace, unbounded peace between the people of God. We are not
   aliens. We are "fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of
   God." Realize your fellow citizenship! Treat not Christian people as
   foreigners and this bond of fellow citizenship will be one bond of
   peace. You are not enemies. Men may be fellow citizens and yet hate one
   another, but you are friends, you are all friends to Christ and in Him
   you are all friends to one another. Let that be another bond.

   But you go farther--you are not mere friends, you are Brethren born of
   the same parent--filled with the same life. And shall not this be a
   bond? See that you fall not out by the way. Strive not one with
   another, for you are Brethren. This is not all. You are closer than
   this--you are members of the same body. Shall this mysterious union
   fail to be a bond of peace to you? Will you, being the foot, contend
   with the eye? Or will you, being the eye, contend with the hand and
   say, "I have no need of you"?

   If it is, indeed, the Truth of God and not a fiction that we are
   members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones-- because the
   joints and bones in other men's bodies may not agree--let it never be
   said of the mystical body of our blessed Lord that there was such a
   monstrous thing in it! Let it never be said that the various parts
   would not co-work but fell to battling with another! I believe I have
   brought out the meaning of the text. There is a unity of the Spirit
   which is worthy to be kept--we ought to keep it--we must try to keep it
   in the bond of peace.

   To come to the practical conclusion of the subject. First, in the
   connection of one Church with another. And secondly, in the connection
   of one Church member with another. It is not a desirable thing that all
   churches should melt into one another and become one. The complete
   fusion of all churches into one ecclesiastical corporation would
   inevitably produce another form of Popery since history teaches us that
   large ecclesiastical bodies grow more or less corrupt as a matter of
   course.

   Huge spiritual corporations are, as a whole, the strongholds of tyranny
   and the refuges of abuse. And it is only a matter of time when they
   shall break to pieces. Disruption and secession must occur and will
   occur where a unity is attempted which is not meant in God's Word. But
   it will be a blessed thing when all the churches walk together in the
   unity of the Spirit! When this Church, although it has been baptized
   into the Lord Jesus Christ and laments the neglect of that ordinance by
   others, yet feels that the unity of the Spirit is not to be broken and
   holds out its right hand to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ in
   sincerity.

   When yonder Church, governed by its elders, feels a unity with another
   Church which is presided over by its bishop. When a certain Church,
   which holds with mutual edification and no ministry, is yet not
   quarrelsome towards those who love the ministry of the Word! When, in
   fact, we have agreed in this one thing--that we will search the Word
   independently and act out according to our light what we find to be
   true--but having so done we will keep the unity of the Spirit in the
   bond of peace. I say this is most desirable and this, it is, that we
   are to seek after--not the fusion of all into one denomination! But the
   keeping of each Church in its own distinct independent testimony in
   love with every other Church that is doing the same.

   Now, in order to this, I have a few suggestions to offer. It is quite
   certain we shall never keep the unity of the Spirit if this Church
   shall declare that it is superior to every other. If there is a Church
   which says, "We are the Church and all others are mere sects. We are
   established and others are only tolerated," then it is a troubler in
   Israel and must hide its head when the unity of the Spirit is so much
   as hinted at! Any Church which lifts up its head on high and boasts
   over other churches has violated the unity of the Spirit. If other
   churches reply, "One is our Master and all we are Brethren," they do
   not violate the unity of the Spirit, for they simply claim their rights
   and speak the Truth of God.

   That other Church which forgets its true position as one in the family
   and begins to set itself up as mistress and claim pre-eminence over its
   fellow servants has put it out of its own power to keep the unity of
   the Spirit, for it has violated it once and for all. A Church that
   would keep the unity of the Spirit, again, must not consider itself to
   be so infallible that not to belong to its membership is sin. What
   right has any one Church to set itself up as the standard, so that
   those who do not join it are necessarily Dissenters?

   It is true my Episcopal brother is a Dissenter--he dissents from me! It
   is true he is a Nonconformist, for he does not conform to me--I would
   not, however, call him by such names lest I should arrogate to my own
   Church to be the one true church and so should break the unity of the
   Spirit. If I turn to history I may believe that my Church can claim a
   long line of ancestors descending from the Apostles, without ever
   running through the Church of Rome. But shall I therefore call a
   Brother who does not quite see this succession, a schismatic and
   denominate his assembly illegal? If he is a schismatic because he does
   not come to my place, why am I not a schismatic because I do not go to
   his?

   Well, but he divides the church! He ought to come and worship with me.
   Ought I not to go and worship with him? Ah, but we are the larger
   number! Are Divine things to be ruled by the majority? Where would the
   Church of God be any day if it came to polling? I am afraid the devil
   would always be at the head of the poll. We wish to keep the unity of
   the Spirit and if we have a little sister, we will treat her all the
   more kindly, owing to the fewness of her members. If I want to "keep
   the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace," I must never call in the
   magistrate to force my Brother to pay for washing my surplice, ringing
   my bell and winding up my clock.

   I must not tell my Brother that he is bound to pay for the support of
   my worship. "Oh," he says, "my dear Friend, I pay for the maintenance
   of the worship which I believe to be correct and I am quite willing
   that you should do the same for yours." I would voluntarily assist you
   if you were poor. But you tell me you will put me in prison if I do not
   pay and yet tell me to keep the unity of the Spirit? My dear Friend, it
   is not keeping the unity of the Spirit to take away my stool and my
   table and my candlestick, and say you will put me in "limbo," or hail
   me before an ecclesiastical court. You send the constable after me. And
   then if I say a word about it, you say, "Charity hopes all things."

   Yes, among the rest it hopes that you will give up your sin in this
   matter. If we should stand possessed of a piece of ground where we bury
   our dead, and if there should happen to come a member of another
   Christian Church who would wish to lay his poor dead baby in our
   ground, there being no other convenient spot anywhere and he asks the
   favor, I think we can hardly be thought to keep the unity of the Spirit
   if we tell him, "No, nothing of the kind! You had your child sprinkled,
   therefore it cannot be buried with us Christians! We will not have your
   sprinkled baby lying alongside our baptized dead."

   I do not think that is keeping the unity of the Spirit. And I do not
   think when some churches have turned from their graveyard gate the
   mourners who have brought an unbaptized infant--and the mourners have
   gone back weeping to their homes--I do not think such churches have
   been endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

   Again, if churches are to agree one with another they must not make
   rules that ministers who are not of their own denomination shall not
   occupy their pulpits. I should be ashamed of you, if you passed a
   resolution that no one dissenting from us should stand in my pulpit.
   But we know a church which says, "No matter how good a man may be. He
   may be a man as venerated as John Angell James, or he may have all the
   excellencies of a William Jay--we would not, perhaps, mind hearing him
   in a Town Hall--but into the sacredness of our particular rostrum these
   interlopers must not intrude."

   For, says this church, "Ours are ministers, yours are only lay
   teachers. Ours are sacraments--the cup of blessing which we bless is
   the blood of Christ and the bread which we break is the body of
   Christ--you have no sacramental efficacy with you. In fact, you are not
   a church, but only a body of schismatics meeting together to carry out
   what you think to be right. We tolerate you, but that is all we can
   do." Where is the unity of the Spirit there?

   My dear Friends, I received this text from one of the most holy men in
   the Church of England--if I expound it slightly for her benefit, he
   will, I trust, excuse me, for I do so in all honesty, desiring to aid
   him and many others in revision and reform. If this Church were in the
   same condition as the Church of England I would pray to be as plain in
   my remarks. I say it is an anachronism! It is a thing out of date for
   the nineteenth century for any one church in this land and that church
   the only one which defiles her hand by taking State pay, to stand up
   and say, "We are the church! Our ministers are the ministers! Our
   people are the people! And now, dear Brethren, shake hands and endeavor
   to keep the unity of the Spirit of God."

   Why, it is preposterous! Let us meet on equal ground! Let us lay aside
   all pretences to superiority! Let us really aid and not oppress each
   other! Let us mingle in prayer. Let us unite in confession of sin. Let
   us join heartily in reforming our errors and a true Evangelical
   Alliance will cover our land! If any church will take the Bible as its
   standard and in the power of the Spirit of God preach the name of
   Jesus, there are thousands of us who will rejoice to give the right
   hand of fellowship with a hearty greeting to all such! We are striving
   every day to get other churches and ourselves more and more into that
   condition in which, while holding our own, we can yet keep the unity of
   the Spirit in the bond of peace!

   Now, a few words to you in regard to your relationship to one another
   as members of the same church. If we are to endeavor to keep the unity
   of the Spirit in the bond of peace in the same church, then we must
   avoid everything that would mar it. Gossip--gossip is a very ready
   means of separating friends from one another. Let us endeavor to talk
   of something better than each other's characters. Dionysius went down
   to the Academy to Plato. Plato asked what he came for. "Why," said
   Dionysius, "I thought that you, Plato, would be talking against me to
   your students."

   Plato made this answer--"Do you think, Dionysius, we are so destitute
   of matter to converse upon that we talk of you?" Truly we must be very
   short of subjects when we begin to talk of one another. It is better
   far that we magnify Christ than detract from the honor of His members.
   We must lay aside all envy. Multitudes of good people liked the
   Reformation, but they said they did not like the idea of its being done
   by a poor miserable monk like Martin Luther. And so there are many who
   like to see good things done and good works carried on, but do not care
   to see it done by that upstart young Brother, or that poor man, or that
   woman who has no particular rank or state.

   As a Church let us shake off envy! Let us all rejoice in God's light.
   And as for pride--if any of you have grown vainglorious of late, shake
   it off. I hope to exercise a ministry in this place which will drive
   out those of you who will not acknowledge your Brethren when they are
   poorer or of less education than yourselves. What if the man does mar
   the Queen's English when he talks--what does that matter, so long as
   his heart is right? As long as you can feel he loves the Master, surely
   you can put up with his faults of language--if he can put up with your
   faults of action. Then let us cultivate everything that would tend to
   unity.

   Are any sick? Let us care for them. Are any suffering? Let us weep with
   them. Do we know one who has less love than others? Then let us have
   more, so as to make up the deficiency. Do we perceive faults in a
   Brother? Let us admonish him in love and affection. I pray you be
   peacemakers, every one of you! Let this Church go on as it has done for
   the last eleven years in holy concord and blessed unity. Let us
   remember that we cannot keep the unity of the Spirit unless we all
   believe the Truth of God. Let us search our Bibles, therefore, and
   conform our views and sentiments to the teaching of God's Word.

   I have already told you that unity in error is unity in ruin. We want
   unity in the Truth of God through the Spirit of God. This let us seek
   after it! Let us live near to Christ, for this is the best way of
   promoting unity. Divisions in churches never begin with those full of
   love to the Savior. Cold hearts, unholy lives, inconsistent actions,
   neglected closets--these are the seeds which sow schisms in the body!
   But he who lives near to Jesus--wears His likeness and copies His
   example--will be, wherever he goes, a sacred bond, a holy link to bind
   the Church together more closely than ever.

   May God give us this and from now on let us endeavor to keep the unity
   of the Spirit in the bond of peace. I commend the text to all Believers
   to be practiced through the coming year. And to those who are not
   Believers, what can I say but that I trust their unity and their peace
   may be broken forever and that they may be led to Christ Jesus to find
   peace in His death! May faith be given and then love and every Divine
   Grace will follow, so that they may be one with us in Christ Jesus our
   Lord. Amen.

                        A Discourse For A Revival Season

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JANUARY 8TH, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of My people because of
   them that dwell in a far country, Is not the Lord in Zion? Is not her
   King in her? Why have they provoked Me to anger with their graven
   images and with strange vanities? The harvest is past, the summer is
   ended and we are not saved." Jeremiah 8:19,20.

   THESE words, as they stand in the book of Jeremiah, were probably meant
   to set forth the sin of Israel. The Prophet's heart is very full of
   sadness--he can hear the shrieks and cries of the people in the streets
   of Jerusalem. They are moaning for sorrow because of the oppression of
   the Chaldeans--the nation that dwelt afar off. And in the midst of
   their bitterness and woe they remember the God whom they had forgotten
   in their prosperity--but this remembrance is not a gracious one. They
   do not remember Him to humble themselves before Him, but to bring
   accusations against Him!

   They enquire, "Is not the Lord in Zion? Is not her king in her?" As if
   they felt, "The people of the Lord, the people of the Lord are we, and
   therefore He is bound to send us a deliverance." They question the
   faithfulness of Jehovah because He justly suffers them to be
   downtrodden for their sins. Then the Lord, speaking by the Prophet,
   tells them the reason why, although present among them, He did not help
   them--"Why have they provoked Me to anger with their graven images and
   with strange vanities?"

   If they believed Him to be present, why did they set up false gods? If
   they considered Him to be their God, why did they turn aside to the
   vanities of the heathen? His Presence among them had been the occasion
   of greater provocation since they had mocked Him to His face and set up
   idols in His own temple! In the twentieth verse the Prophet represents
   the people as breaking forth into another dolorous and lamentable cry,
   "We thought that God would help us in the days of harvest--but the
   harvest is past. We dreamed that He would chase away our enemies when
   the summer months had come--but the summer is ended and still Chaldea
   has her foot upon Judea's neck--still we drink the wormwood and the
   gall and our enemies open their mouths at us. The harvest is past and
   the summer is ended and we are not saved."

   We find in the New Testament that sometimes the Apostles used the
   language of the Prophets in other than the original sense. Finding the
   Prophetic words to be expressive of a sense which they themselves
   wished to convey to the people, they did, as it were, take the horses
   and chariot of the Prophet and drive them in another direction. So I
   intend to do this morning. It strikes me that there is no text in
   Scripture more applicable to our present condition than this. "Behold
   the voice of the cry of the daughter of My people because of them that
   dwell in a far country."

   We have been crying and pleading with God for the multitude of far-off
   sinners who know nothing of Him. We will begin, therefore, by dwelling
   upon the cry. Then comes a question, a question much requiring earnest
   thought at pre-sent--"Is not the Lord in Zion? Is not her king in her?"
   Then we have another question which may cause searching of heart both
   among saints and sinners--"Why have they provoked Me to anger with
   their graven images and with strange vanities?" And our text concludes
   with another cry, not the cry of gracious souls for others, but the cry
   of graceless sinners for themselves, "The harvest is past, the summer
   is ended and we are not saved."

   I. At the outset we have in the text A CRY. Observe the word, "Behold."
   I have told you many times that wherever the word, "behold," occurs in
   Scripture, it is a sort of signpost to show that there is good
   entertainment within. God puts this, "N.B.," in the margin that we may
   observe well what it is that He is saying to us. The "behold" here is
   the mark of astonishment. We are to "Behold the voice of the cry of the
   daughter of My people" as an unusual thing. So seldom does Israel cry
   unto the Lord--she is so negligent of prayer, she is so silent when she
   ought to be incessant in her petitions--that when at last she does cry,
   her voice is a wonder in God's ears!

   I have felt, this week, in the state of mind which is indicated by that
   interjection, "Behold!" When I sat on this platform on Monday night and
   marked your sobs and tears and heard the suppressed sighs and groans of
   the great multitude then assembled, I could not but say, "Behold!" And
   yet it ought not to be a wonder, it ought not to be a strange thing for
   God's people to be in earnest, or for sinners to feel brokenness of
   heart! If prayer is the Christian's breath, why then, to see a
   multitude breathing should never be a spectacle! If to pray unto God is
   the Christian's daily privilege, then to approach the Throne of God
   with prevalent earnestness should never be looked upon with
   astonishment!

   Yet, Brothers and Sisters, we must frankly confess that it is so. True
   prayer is an astonishing thing! Prevalent intercession is an amazing
   thing--and if you want to see something that will really thrill you
   with a holy wonder, attend a Prayer Meeting where the Holy Spirit is
   present in the fullness of His power and where the Brethren pray not as
   a mere matter of form, but as if filled with all the fullness of God!

   Such meetings as we have had during the past week are things to marvel
   at! Behold! It has become a wonder for God's people to really cry. Ah,
   there are some of you to whom weeping over sinners would be a novelty.
   To some of you professors agonizing for souls would be a new thing--you
   pray for sinners in your usual prayers--but you do not know what it is
   to travail in birth for souls. You never feel as if your hearts would
   break if souls are not saved. You do not feel the burden of the Lord
   laid upon you till you are crushed in the dust and made to groan out,
   "God have mercy upon these poor perishing souls."

   With some of you it would be a great wonder to be really on fire in
   prayer. And if we heard you cry, we should be compelled to say, "Behold
   the voice of the cry of My people." Notice how this prayer is
   described. It is a cry--"Behold the cry." A cry is the most natural
   form of utterance. It is a natural expression made up of pain and
   desire for relief. A cry is the first sign of human life--as if to
   indicate that we are most alive when most we cry. As if a cry were the
   way to life and the path to higher life ever afterwards. A cry! There
   is something cutting and piercing in it. It cleaves its way up to the
   Throne of God. A spiritual cry! It is born in the heart, down deep in
   the inner recesses of regenerate nature. It is not a mere lip-worship,
   it is not a thing of the tongue and of the jaw.

   A cry! It comes from the very soul and therefore it reaches to God's
   ear and God's heart. A cry! It is a plaintive, bitter, painful
   thing--and, mark you--God's people seldom get a blessing in the
   conversion of souls till their prayer turns into a cry mingled with
   weeping. And if there is sobbing and groaning, it is none the worse. Do
   you know, dear Friends, the difference between the prayers which are
   not cries and those which are? When a Brother merely prays what we call
   prayer, he stands up and utters very proper words, very edifying, very
   suitable, no doubt, and then he is done.

   Another Brother comes forward--he wants a blessing--he tells the Lord
   what he desires. He takes the promises. He wrestles with God and then
   he seems to say, "I will not let You go except You bless me." He cannot
   be satisfied till, with the cry of, "Abba, Father," he has come before
   the Throne of God and really obtained an audience with the Most High.
   Note again, for every word of our text is suggestive--it is, "Behold
   the voice of the cry of the daughter of My people." It is not enough to
   be earnest! You must know what you are earnest about! The cry must have
   a voice which is as far as possible understood by yourself and a voice
   which has a meaning in it before God.

   I am afraid there have been some meetings against which the charge of
   fanaticism might be very fairly brought, because, while there was an
   admirable earnestness which it were well for colder Christians to copy,
   there was a lack of understanding--a want of really knowing what they
   wanted. Beloved, we must be clear when we come before God that we
   really are asking for something. Our soul must prepare itself by
   meditation upon its own needs and upon the needs of the people to
   express an intelligent desire before God.

   Cry! Cry aloud as much as you will! But remember, when the voice said
   cry, the Prophet said, "What shall I cry?" And so when I come before
   God in prayer, I must ask Him, "What shall I cry?" And I must get a
   clear sense of what it is at which I am driving. For if an archer takes
   no aim, he may pull his bow with all his might, but he certainly is not
   likely to succeed. I must direct my prayer unto God as David says--pull
   my bow, direct the arrow, take aim at the center of the target--and
   then when the arrow flies it is likely to reach its place. "In the
   morning will I direct my prayer unto You and will look up."

   What a mercy it is that our cries have a voice with God! Why sometimes,
   when our cries have no voice for us, they have a voice with God. "The
   Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be
   uttered." When my desires are such that there are no words in any human
   language which could possibly express them, my heart does but let fall
   a tear, or lift a glance to Heaven and there is a voice in my cry.
   "Lord, take the meaning, take the meaning," said a poor man in an
   earnest prayer, to which I remember to have once listened--"I cannot
   tell You, Lord, what I want, but take the meaning, take the meaning of
   my poor stammering words."

   There is a voice in our prayers as a Church and I think it is, "Father,
   have mercy upon souls! Father, arise and let Your kingdom come, and let
   the name of Your Son Jesus be honored in the hearts of many! Father,
   let the Spirit who dwells in His Church, now work mightily and get to
   Your name great renown in the midst of the dense crowd among whom we
   dwell." O God, this is the voice of the cry of Your people! Further,
   study the matter of the voice--it was, "for them that dwell in a far
   country." In what a far country does every sinner dwell! "He took his
   journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous
   living."

   The sinner who is nearest to God is still in a far country. You
   moralists, how far off you are from God! Dear Mr. Offord said the other
   night, "Can any of you tell how far off God is from the unpardoned
   sinner? Remember, you are on this side of sin and God is on the other
   side of it--but can anyone tell how far God is from the other side of
   sin! His pure and holy eyes cannot even look on it! Then how far must
   He be from it! You are just so far off from God as God is from sin,
   added to the breadth and length of sin itself. See your sin towering
   like a stupendous Alp! You cannot cross that barrier and God is far
   away on the other side of that mountain. This is your wretched position
   afar off from God."

   Now, the prayers, I hope, of God's people have been going up for all
   the far-off ones, that infinite mercy would make them near by the blood
   of Christ. There are certain special far-off ones whom we ought to
   mention in our prayers and whom we ought to labor after in our
   Christian efforts. Do not forget the harlot when you pray--illustrious
   trophies of Divine Grace have been snatched from the kennel and the
   pavement. Do not forget the poorest of the poor, the vilest of the
   vile--and those who dwell in haunts where theft, ignorance and crime do
   fester. Pray for these most. They most need your entreaties--and let
   your prayer be a cry--a cry like that of Jesus when He wept over
   Jerusalem.

   It would be one of the healthiest things in all the world for you
   Christian people, if you were to spend a day with City Missionaries and
   Bible Women in the very worst of our back slums. If your cry did not
   come up, then, for those who dwell in a far country, I despair of your
   knowing what true religion means! The fact is we do not face the sin of
   London. We, like the ostrich, bury our heads and shut our eyes so as to
   avoid seeing the evil. We can so easily get to our places of worship
   along the front streets in which there is a fringe of respectability
   and order and so on, that we forget the dark lanes, the blind alleys,
   the dingy courts, the places where poverty, suffering, sin and
   ignorance abound.

   O dear Friends, if we do not go further, if we do not think of foreign
   lands, we have still reason enough for putting up the voice of our cry
   for those who are, "in a far country," and yet dwell at home in
   England! Still, I must have you remark another word in the text--for,
   "those that dwell in a far country"--there are some of you who make a
   long abode in a far country. You were afar off from God eleven years
   ago. I preached at you then. You were afar off from God five or six
   years ago, when revivals were frequent. When this Tabernacle was opened
   you came here and took your seat and you were afar off from God
   then--and you are afar off now.

   The fact is, you have taken up your dwellings--you have made a
   settlement in one of the parishes of the City of Destruction! You are
   making out a claim to be enrolled in the devil's register. You dwell in
   the far-off land. If you were uneasy and felt yourselves to be
   strangers and foreigners in the land of destruction, how would I clap
   my hands for joy, for you would soon be rid of your old master if you
   once felt sick of him. But no! You dwell in that country and I suppose
   some of you always will, till you are taken from it to make your
   lodging place in the flames of Hell forever! O, may God prevent it! But
   I fear it of some of you.

   There are some who listen to my words who are made to feel under them.
   I heard but the other day of one who was set a trembling and shivering
   under the Gospel. He could not but come and hear though it was always
   like a great hammer to him. His friends and companions, by much
   persevering effort, laughed him out of coming here. They could not bear
   that he should come to hear the despised preacher. Though he had been a
   dreadful drunkard and swearer before and was then sober, yet they
   preferred his drunkenness to his coming here! Bitterly have they had to
   regret it--for he went back to his sins and became as gross a sinner as
   before.

   And then when he was killing himself with sin, they began to wish him
   to come here again--but it was too late--he would not come again.
   Perhaps he dared not. A dreadful remorse settled upon him and under its
   influence he put an end to his own existence. Take care, any of you who
   hate the Gospel, that you do not laugh at other men's convictions. And
   when the Gospel does come home with power to any, do not be the devil's
   advocate and stand up and plead against God. God forgive those who do
   this and may none of us be guilty of it!

   But oh, you dwell in this far country, some of you. You are in a state
   of danger and condemnation. It was only the other night, when we met at
   St. John's Wood, that a man came into the vestry made broken-hearted
   through the address of the evening. My dear Brother Stott soon had him
   on his knees and began to pray with him. And to my grief this man said
   he used to hear me at Exeter Hall and was much better in his outward
   life. While hearing me he thought of religion and lived soberly--but
   the Tabernacle was too far for him to come to and he would not go
   anywhere else--and therefore he went back to the world and what seemed
   to be like a work of Divine Grace proved to be only a work of nature.

   Let us be anxious concerning those who dwell in the far country and are
   only, for a time, as it were, taken out as on an excursion into the
   land of light. They still have their parish settlement in the far
   country and are numbered among the citizens of the City of Destruction
   and are not among the people of God. O, for a cry this morning, another
   cry from God's people for those who dwell in a far country! One very
   consoling thought is in the text. I must only hint at it. The cry is,
   "The cry of the daughter of My people." O beloved, it is so sweet to
   think that our prayers, poor as they are, are the prayers of God's own
   people, and therefore they must be heard.

   You will say, "Is that a right argument?" Oh, yes it is! "If you being
   evil know how to give good gifts unto your children." Remember that is
   how Christ puts it. You are the Lord's children, therefore He will hear
   you. If you were strangers it might be a different thing. Our prayers
   might very readily be pulled to pieces by critics, but our Father will
   not criticize them because they are the cries of His own children. I do
   not think we set such store by Believer's prayers as we ought to do.
   Would you let your child constantly cry to you and not answer him? I
   know you would not.

   Put it differently--would you let your Brother in Christ plead with you
   and not grant him his desire if you could grant it? You have not a
   Christian's heart if you would. Or I will touch you more closely. We
   love our wives--if your wife should ask for anything that would be for
   her good and you could give it, would you refuse it? Husband, would you
   refuse it? You are no husband if you did! Look at Christ, the Husband
   of the Church--do you think He will refuse the cry of His own spouse?

   What? Shall His own dear bride come before Him and embrace His feet and
   say, "I will not let You go except You bless me"--and shall He who has
   espoused her unto Himself in faithfulness, say to her, "I have bid you
   seek Me, but I will not be found of you. I have commanded you to knock,
   but the door shall not be opened. I have told you to ask, but you shall
   not receive"? O, slander not my loving Lord like this--

   "He feels at His heart all our sighs and our groans, For we are most
   near Him, His flesh and His bones." Let us rejoice together in the
   spirit of prayer which God has given us. Let us try to foster it. Let
   us be much in the exercise of it. During the coming week let us still
   continue to meet together to intercede at the Throne of Grace.

   And this is my reason for urging it upon you--God has promised that
   when we cry, He will hear us--"He shall call upon Me and I will answer
   him." "Whatever you shall ask the Father in My name, He will give it
   you." "With long life will I satisfy him and show him My salvation."

   II. We will now turn to the QUESTION--"Is not the Lord in Zion? Is not
   her king in her?" I will answer that question at once in the
   affirmative. "The Lord is in Zion. Her king is in the midst of her."
   Having answered this question, it suggests many more. Let me put them
   to you. If the Lord is, indeed, in Zion and the king is in the midst of
   her, why do we pray as if He were not? I find no fault with the prayers
   of my Brothers and Sisters when they ask for an outpouring of the
   Spirit--what they mean by their prayers is a very proper thing. But I
   am not certain that the expression is altogether the best that might be
   used.

   The Spirit of God is with His people. I could not, last Monday night,
   ask to have the Spirit of God poured out, for He was there. If at any
   time the Holy Spirit was with any men on earth, even at Pentecost, He
   was here last Monday night, as those present must have felt. We had not
   so much to ask for it as to be thankful for it. When two or three of
   you meet together in Christ's name, do not meet unbelievingly. Remember
   that He has said, "There am I in the midst of you." Be content with
   that assurance. You have not, as it were, to mount up to Heaven, that
   is, to bring Christ down--nor to descend into the earth, that is, to
   bring Him up from the depths--He is with you! "Know you not that your
   bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit?" "God dwells in you."

   The Holy Spirit is given to the Church as a perpetual and abiding
   Comforter. And in the Church the Spirit of God always dwells. Do not
   pray, therefore, dear friends, as if God were not with you. "Is not the
   Lord in Zion? Is not her King in the midst of her?" Do not pray,
   therefore, like the priests of Baal, as though your God were on a
   journey or needed to be awakened out of sleep. He is with you, ready to
   answer by fire, if, like Elijah, you have but faith with which to
   challenge His promise and His power. Is the Lord with you? Then in the
   next place, let me ask you this question. Why do you despond because of
   your own weakness? "We have not a sufficient number of ministers. We
   have little wealth. We have few places of public worship. We have few
   gifted members," and so on.

   So some unbelievingly talk. "Is not the Lord in Zion? Is not her King
   in her?" What more do you want? "Oh, we would like to be strong." Why
   would you be strong? That you must be disqualified to be used by God?
   "No," you say. Well, but you would be! What did the Lord say by the
   mouth of His servant Gideon? "The people are too many for Me." I never
   heard that the Lord said, "The people are too few"--never! "The people
   are too many." If Samson had the choice of weapons with which to rout
   his enemies--if he wished to do it in such a way as to make the feat
   illustrious, if there were before him a cannon, a fifty-pounder and the
   jawbone of an ass--which would he take? Why, any fool can kill the
   enemy with a cannon, but it takes a Samson to smite them with the
   jawbone of an ass!

   And so, when God has the choice of weapons and He always has, He
   chooses the weaker weapon that He may get for Himself the greater
   renown. My Brothers and Sisters, glory in your infirmities--thank God
   for your weaknesses! There is room for God when you are empty! But when
   you are so full and so strong and have such excellent machinery and can
   do the work so well, why then you will attempt to do without your God
   and a failure will be the result. But, O Beloved--

   "When I am weak, then am I strong, Grace is my shield and Christ my
   song."

   Let this silence forever all your raving about weakness in Christian
   duty! "Is not the Lord in Zion? Is not her King in the midst of her?"
   Did I hear you say, "I am a feeble woman and I have too much work to do
   for God. I had better, perhaps, curtail it, or give it up"? My Sister,
   now that you are weaker, try to do more! Now there is more room for
   your God. "Oh, I am a trembling, humble, unknown man with but little
   talent and what I have done has been about as much as I can do--I am
   afraid to venture more." My Brother, venture more! Get onto the ground
   of, "I cannot, but God can." That is safe ground. "I can" is like the
   ice on which the boy tries to slide and it swallows him up. "I cannot,
   but God can," is terra firma--stand there and you stand safely.

   There can never come a shock to the man who rests on the Eternal
   Rock--God all-sufficient. Rest on that and be glad. Again, this
   question provokes another one. If God IS with us, why these great fears
   about the prosperity of the Church? "Dr. Colenso becomes an Infidel.
   Stanley becomes something very suspicious. Multitudes of ministers, so
   called, become Puseyites--what will become of the Church of Christ?"
   What will become of her? She will nestle where she always did
   nestle--beneath the eternal wings! And the more she gets rid of all her
   carnal confidences the better for her!

   "Oh what will become of true religion?" Beloved, become of true
   religion? It will go on winning and conquering, and with Christ upon
   the white horse of victory, riding in her forefront, the Truth of God
   shall march on conquering and to conquer till He shall come whose right
   it is to reign. Be not discouraged, "Is not her King in the midst of
   her?" Every now and then, when we try a new scheme, certain prudent
   Brethren come and pull our ears a bit and they say, "It is more than
   you can do. You must be prudent."

   Yes, we are prudent. We claim to be prudent. We claim to have the
   highest prudence. For we reckon it always prudent to believe God and
   always prudent to act upon God's promise and not according to carnal
   policy, nor the judgments of our proud, self-conceited, ignorant flesh.
   Brethren, if the King is in the midst of her, let us go on and conquer!
   You think you will never see such days as Pentecost? Why not? "Is not
   the Lord in Zion? Is not her King in her?" You fear you will never see
   such wonders as were worked by Whitfield and Wesley? "Is not the Lord
   in Zion? Is not her King in her?"

   You fancy that Ireland will never receive the Gospel? You think that
   heathen nations will never lay aside their idolatry? "Is not the Lord
   in Zion? Is not her King in the midst of her?" You conceive that this
   is not the age of miracles and you condemn us to go on in the
   everlasting jog-trot of propriety, in the do-nothing style of
   prescription, keeping in the perpetual cart-rut of conventionality and
   never daring to blaze out a path for ourselves? "Is not the Lord in
   Zion? Is not her King in the midst of her?" You do not believe there
   will be a thousand souls converted under one sermon? You do not think
   it is likely that the Church will be increased by hundreds in a day, or
   in a month? "Is not the Lord in Zion? Is not her King in the midst of
   her?"

   Dear brethren, the God of Zion is here! The King of Zion is here! I
   grant you, we do not sufficiently recognize His Presence. We are not,
   as we should be, obedient to His commands. But I charge you, O you
   soldiers of the Cross, believe in the Presence of your Captain and
   press where you see His helmet amidst the din of war! His Cross is the
   great emblazoned banner which leads you on to Glory. Press forward to
   suffer, to deny yourselves, to bear witness for Christ--the battle is
   the Lord's and the King Himself fights in the van. "Her King is in the
   midst of her."

   I want to see you trying deeds of daring! Noble deeds of consecration,
   generous gifts of liberality! I want you to be more earnest in prayer,
   more incessant in supplication--but, at the same time--more venturesome
   in your actions, more daring in your devotedness to Christ. The King is
   in the midst of her! The Lord is in Zion still! Sinner, I must leave
   this point, but there is one word of encouragement for you--

   "Jesussits on Zion's hill, He receives poor sinners still."

   He is in Zion, not on Sinai. Come to Him just as you are! Come to Him
   for He is ready to accept you. The King with the silver scepter in His
   hand holds it out to every broken-hearted sinner. Come and touch it--He
   will give you perfect pardon in an instant, if your soul does but touch
   the silver scepter of His Grace presented to you in Christ Jesus.

   III. Time, however, will not stop for me and therefore let us go on to
   the third point. That is, ANOTHER QUESTION. "Why have they provoked Me
   to anger with their graven images and with strange vanities?" Here is a
   question for the Lord's people. It becomes a very solemn thing when God
   is in His Church how that Church behaves herself. Suppose that Church
   to set up false principles--if her King were not there she might take
   the kings of the earth to be her head. But dare she do that when her
   King Himself is there?

   She might begin to lean upon the civil arm if her God were not in her!
   But if her God is in her--will she venture to do that in the face of
   the Presence of God? Will she build up with untempered mortar the walls
   of human confidence and rest upon an arm of flesh when Jehovah is
   looking on? In the matter of Gospel ordinances it is a very important
   thing that we keep these ordinances as they were delivered. If the King
   were not in Zion it would not matter whether I practiced Believers'
   Baptism or unbelievers' Baptism! But if He has commanded Believers'
   Baptism how dare I baptize unbelievers in the Presence of the King in
   Zion?

   How dare I profane His own ordinance to what it was never intended? It
   therefore becomes a solemn question. If the King is in Zion, I must
   mind what doctrines I preach. The king is there to hear me. God is
   there to observe me. If God is in Zion, again, we must take care no
   wrong principles are let in. What? Shall I allow the King's enemies to
   eat and drink before the King's own Throne? Shall I wait upon the
   King's foes and treat them as my friends when He is looking upon me
   with eyes of love?

   Let me take heed lest I prove a hypocrite and receive anger instead of
   love! Certainly He will look upon my sins with increased wrath if I
   indulge them in His Presence. Is God in Zion? Beloved Christian
   Brothers and Sisters, how dare you set up that idol in your heart? Is
   it your child? Your spouse? What is it? Can you worship idols when the
   King is in Zion--when God is in the midst of her? My dear Friend, how
   can you be so worldly, so money-grasping? How is it that you can make
   wealth the main object of your life when the King is in Zion? If He did
   not know about your worldliness. If He did not know about your coldness
   of heart. If He did not mark your inconsistency--if He could not see
   you in the path of sin--then I might not plead with you!

   But. O Christian men and women, when God is present, how careful should
   we be! And He is present in His Church! Judas, where are you this
   morning? The Lord Jehovah is here in Zion! He has come to search
   Jerusalem with candles and to punish the men who are settled upon their
   lees! What will He do with you? You think it a good thing to have God
   in Zion, but you have desired in this, as far as you are concerned, a
   day of darkness and not of light--for when He comes, He shall be as a
   consuming fire and as fullers' soap! The Lord's special Presence in His
   Church always involves a season of purification.

   A Church may go on with dead members for twenty years, but when the
   Lord comes, as soon as the wind sweeps through the forest, the dead
   branches crack and fall from the tree. A visitation from God to this
   Church will try you--it is all a blessing, but partly a trial. I
   believe that in every society and every Church where the Presence of
   God comes, instead of the dead calm which they formerly enjoyed, there
   usually comes some outbreak on the part of the flesh against the powers
   or the Spirit. And they are discovered to be hypocrites who otherwise
   might have gone on the whole of their lives with their vain
   profession--boasting in what they did not possess. Well, we must
   prepare for this ordeal. If God is in Zion, let us not provoke Him to
   anger with our idolatry, nor with our strange vanities. Let us purge
   and humble ourselves before Him!

   But this text has a particular voice to sinners. I want you to listen
   to me, you who are unconverted, while I just read this text slowly. You
   have been saying, "God is in the midst of His people--how is it I have
   not had a blessing?" I will ask you this question, "Why have they
   provoked Me to anger with their graven images and with strange
   vanities?" I will turn that enquiry into English--it is in Hebrew
   now--"Why have you provoked Me to anger with your drunkenness and with
   your mixing with vain companions? Do not ask why I have not called you
   by My Divine Grace--do not ask why you are not among the people of God.
   Answer My question--Why have you provoked Me to anger by indulging the
   lusts of the flesh--by leaving the paths of chastity and virtue--when
   you knew the right and chose the wrong?

   "Do not ask why the Word is not blessed to you! Do not ask why you do
   not enjoy the Prayer Meeting--answer My question first. Why have you
   provoked Me to anger with your tricks in trade, with your
   Sabbath-breaking, with your lying, with your loose songs, with your
   mixing up with worldly company, with your profanity? Do not ask Me why
   the holy dew has not dropped on you! Do not ask Me why the Holy Spirit
   has not come to quicken you, but answer this, 'Why have you provoked Me
   to anger with your sins?' "

   Why, some of you have provoked God to anger these twenty or thirty
   years! I hear of you every now and then. You love me, I know you do and
   you dare not leave my ministry! You cannot leave it though it is often
   a heart-searching ministry to you. God make it more so! But every now
   and then there comes an outbreak with you undecided ones. You must have
   the drink again, or you must go forth to lechery or sin. So it is with
   you--you would be saved, but you must be damned! You would have Christ,
   but you must have your sins! You would like to go to Heaven, but you
   want to taste the sweets of damnation's dainties on the road!

   How is it you will be such fools as to keep your filthy idols? My God,
   take the hammer and break their idols! O my God, be the great
   Iconoclast and dash down the altars of their lusts and clear a temple
   for Yourself! You say, "Amen," to that--I hope you do. Then God hear
   your cry this morning! Through the eternal Savior who drove the buyers
   and the sellers out of the temple with a scourge of small cords and
   overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of them that
   sold doves and said, "Take these things away"--this day may He come
   into your heart and overturn your sins!

   And may He say, "Take these things away--I have bought that man with
   blood! I have loved him with an everlasting love! I have brought him
   under the sound of the ministry! I purpose to bring him to Myself! I
   have ordained him to wear a crown and wave a palm and be wrapped about
   with the fair white linen of the righteousness of saints! He shall be
   Mine when I make up My jewels. Out with you, intruders! Away, you
   devils! Away, you lusts! You may be called Legion, but I,
   Jehovah-Jesus, cast you out, for this man is Mine."

   Lord, do it! Do it this morning! The voice of the cry of Your people
   comes up for those who are afar off, that their vanities may be given
   up and their sins may be dashed in pieces--that they may be Yours
   forever and ever.

   IV. The last point is, ANOTHER CRY. I wish I might hear this cry this
   morning, for then I should not hear it in the world to come, "The
   harvest is past, the summer is ended and we are not saved." I have been
   talking to you. Now I want you to talk for yourselves in your heart to
   God. There came a harvest of souls to this Church, by His Grace, from
   the very day when first we began to preach the Gospel here. And we have
   gathered such numbers into the Church as probably never were received
   into any one Church in Europe in any age at one time except in the days
   of the Apostles.

   That harvest is only past so far as the blessing which we have received
   has been received--for the harvest still continues in all its fullness.
   But, ah, the harvest has missed jou! Some of you have had to move away,
   or the Word ceases to be a blessing to you as it once was. This voice
   has grown stale to you, has no trumpet-ringing clang about it as it
   once had-- "The harvest is past." Very blessed times have passed over
   this Church. We have had a summer--oh, what Divine warmth has been
   felt! The sun has shone strong in upon us and every plant has breathed
   forth its perfume--every plant that the Lord has planted.

   But many a Monday night--many a Prayer Meeting night has gone--the
   summer has ended and you are not saved! You are not saved! Do you
   remember, some of you, that sermon in the Music Hall, from the text,
   "Compel them to come in"? Then we had a harvest and then we had a
   summer--but you were not compelled to come in. You were not saved! You
   remember some Monday nights when we have been bowed down and broken in
   heart before God in prayer? We have then had harvests and summers--but
   you are not saved! And now, last Monday night what a visitation we had!
   What a harvest! What a summer! But you are not saved!

   I wish you would put up that cry, "Now, Lord, I am not saved! Lord I am
   not saved! I am not saved from my hard heart! I am not saved from my
   love of sin! I am not saved from the guilt of sin! I am without God,
   without Christ and a stranger to the commonwealth of Israel! I am not
   saved!" There are some of you I could speak to very specifically--we
   pray for you--but you are not saved! You have a brother who prays for
   you, a sister who prays for you, a father and mother who have prayed
   for you--but still you are not saved!

   Husband! You have a wife who never ceases to intercede for you--but you
   are not saved! We thought you would have been converted long ago! There
   have been many hopeful signs about you, but you have disappointed
   us--you are not saved! Take heed, take heed! There may be more in the
   words that I now speak than if they were my words, for, to this day,
   God sometimes speaks to men prophetically by His truly sent ministers.
   The day is near with some of you, if you do not repent, when, tossing
   upon the bed of sickness you will have to cry in the sight of the
   approach of death, "the harvest is past, the summer is ended and I am
   not saved!"

   You will look back upon these Sunday gatherings with a very different
   eye from that with which you look upon them now. You will remember your
   Gospel privileges and value them very differently from what you do now.
   When you seem to hear the tolling of your own death knell, then you
   will value the Sunday chime! And take heed yet a little further! There
   will come a day when you will lift up your eyes in Hell, some of you,
   being in torments--and then, as you look up and see the people of God
   glorified at God's right hand--you will have to say, "The harvest is
   past, and the summer is ended and I am not saved!"

   And let me tell you, those words will ring very differently then from
   what they do now, when you have--

   "To linger in eternal pain, yet death forever fly," to have to say, "I
   am not saved," will be dreadful. Then the Lord will come. We are
   looking for His coming. And when He comes His people shall reign with
   Him. They shall rise from the dead in triumph. And when their days of
   earthly reign shall be over the great archangel shall sound the trumpet
   for the second resurrection--and when you wake up and find that the
   righteous have all risen before you and have received their crowns and
   their rewards--then, as you see the harvest of God borne by the angelic
   reapers up to the sky--as you see the brightness of the Glory of the
   new Jerusalem taken up into the clouds to be withdrawn from the place
   where men shall stand to be judged, you will say, "The harvest is past,
   the summer is ended and we are not saved!"

   Oh, then you will cry, "Rocks, hide us! Mountains, fall upon us! We are
   not saved!" Those mountains shall have no ears for you--those rocks
   shall have no heart of compassion for you--there shall only be a dread
   reverberation of your awful cry, "We are not saved! We are not saved!"
   And when Hell opens wide her jaws and her tongue of fire shall lick up
   the ungodly, then, "We are not saved! We are not saved! We are not
   saved!" will be in dolorous contrast to that ever-swelling,
   ever-increasing song, "We have washed our robes and made them white in
   the blood of the Lamb. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah!"

   Shall it be "Hallelujah," Sinner, or shall it be, "We are not saved"?
   May God's eternal Grace work in you to will and to do of His own good
   pleasure and so make you to work out your own salvation with fear and
   trembling. And then may the question be decided and may you not have to
   say forever, "We are not saved." May God bless these words for Christ
   Jesus' sake. Amen.

                              Knowledge Commended

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JANUARY 15, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But the people that know their God shall be strong and do exploits.
   And they that understand among the people shall instruct many." Daniel
   11:32,33.

   THE uninspired book of the Maccabees is perhaps the best interpreter of
   this passage in Daniel. The Prophet, we think, refers to the great
   persecution under Antiochus, when the followers of Judas Maccabees,
   knowing their God and keeping close to Him amidst general defection,
   refused to bow before the idols of Syria. These were strong, by God's
   Divine Grace, and did great exploits--wonders of valor we read of in
   the history of Judas and his brethren, and wonders of heroic suffering
   never surpassed are recounted of the mother and sons and those other
   martyrs who, under tortures of the most amazing kind, held fast their
   faith even to the end. In that age there were some who were stoned, who
   were sawn asunder, who felt the violence of fire and yet were not
   separated from their God by all that the foe could do.

   We have a lesson to learn from the text before us, and we therefore
   leave the historical references and proceed to enter into the teaching
   of the text. It appears that the people who did all this were a knowing
   people and an understanding people. Those by whom the exploits were
   performed were not ignorant, but a people who knew their God. Those who
   helped to keep up the light of Israel in the midst of the thick
   darkness were not uninstructed, but were a people who understood.

   Our subject this morning is knowledge, and especially the knowledge of
   the things of God. The matter is very urgent and important at this
   season when we are receiving so many young converts into the
   Church--many of whom need much teaching in the things of God. It lies
   heavily on my heart that it is my bounden duty to urge these young
   ones, since they know the elements of the Christian faith, to strive
   with diligence to learn more and more of the higher Truths of God. And
   if they have received some insight into the wondrous revelation of
   Divine love, I must urge them to press forward till they comprehend
   with all saints what are the heights and depths and know the love of
   Christ which passes knowledge.

   The question is often put to us in a very general and vague manner, "Is
   knowledge a good thing or not?" We are expected to give an answer
   promptly and without reserve. And if we do so we shall very likely be
   caught in a trap. "Knowledge--is it a good thing in itself or not?"
   That depends upon several things. You might as well ask me whether air
   is a good thing. Why, of course, speaking loosely, it is! But then
   there is much bad air in old wells and cellars and so on, which will
   destroy life--and therefore you cannot expect me to say at once, if I
   know you are trying to trick me--either "Yes," or "No."

   Air is a good thing as a general rule of thumb. The lungs require it,
   man must have it--it is a good thing. So is knowledge. Knowledge heaves
   the intellectual lungs--it is a good thing. But then there is noxious
   knowledge, which it were infinitely better for us never to receive,
   just as there is pestilential air. Is food a good thing? Yes. But if
   you are alluding to the decayed meat which was seized in the market, or
   to adulterated drinks, I am not in such a hurry to answer you. I want
   to know what sort of food you are alluding to. Food, in the abstract,
   is a good thing, but not food univer-sally--for putrid meats will
   engender disease and bring on ten thousand maladies and destroy the
   life which food is meant to sustain.

   So is it with knowledge. It is the food of the mind. And yet there is a
   knowledge which is deadly, poisonous, infectious, full of all manner of
   mischief and they who know nothing of it are wise. Is water a good
   thing? Again I answer, "Yes," in the abstract. So many watery particles
   are absolutely necessary to the building up and sustenance of the human
   frame that every thirsty man knows that water is good. Yet there is bad
   water. There have been poisoned wells--water stagnates and becomes
   putrid and injurious to life--water is good taken abstractedly. And
   there is a knowledge which, like stagnant or poisoned water, may
   destroy the soul. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil stood in
   Paradise-- mark that--but it ruined Paradise, mark that, too!

   A man may know much and he may still stand in his integrity--but the
   chances are that while men are what they are, there will be a serpent
   in the tree of knowledge, seeking the ruin of souls. If you want to
   judge concerning the good or evil of knowledge, you must ask yourself,
   What is its source? To have one's lips touched with a live coal is a
   choice blessing if the seraph brings that coal from off the altar of
   God. But there are tongues which are set on fire in Hell--and who
   desires to feel such accursed flame? You must know from where the coal
   comes before you may consent that it shall touch your lips.

   Knowledge may be tested by considering its character. Some knowledge is
   like the light of the moon--clear, cold, barren, if not injurious to
   health. But heavenly knowledge is fructifying, healthful and genial,
   chasing away disease like the warm rays of the sun. You may make
   knowledge good or evil by the way in which you use it. If it is a
   torch, you may carry it with you to kindle the flame of Tophet's fire,
   or, on the other hand, by that Heaven-lit torch you may, through Divine
   Grace, find your way to the gates of Paradise! Judge knowledge,
   therefore, with discretion and while you seek it as in the abstract an
   eminently good thing, yet be not in haste to plunge yourself into every
   abyss to find its bottom, nor into every burning crater to fathom its
   depth. I know enough of poison without drinking it and enough of sin
   without running into it.

   This much by way of introduction--we come now to the text. Here we have
   knowledge of a peculiar kind referred to. Then its happy influence--it
   makes men strong to do great exploits. Next, we shall consider the
   means of its attainment. Fourthly, just a hint as to its danger. And
   fifthly, the duty of spreading it, contained in the thirty-third verse,
   "They that understand among the people shall instruct many."

   I. First, then, there is A SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE REFERRED TO--"The people
   that know their God." To know God is the highest and best form of
   knowledge. But what can we know of God? Nothing but what He has been
   pleased to reveal to us. He has revealed something of Himself in the
   Book of Nature and muck more in the Book of Revelation. And He has been
   pleased to cast a vivid light upon the Book of Revelation by
   manifesting Himself unto His people as He does not unto the world.

   Those who know the Lord should believe in the unity of His Essence and
   Subsistence. "Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord." There
   should be no mistaken notions here--the unity of the Godhead is
   fundamental and mistakes here are fatal. We should know the Lord in the
   plurality of His Persons. God said, "Let Us make man in our own image."
   Let not man be content until he knows something of the "Us" from whom
   his being was derived. Endeavor to know the Father. Bury your head in
   His bosom in deep repentance and confess that you are not worthy to be
   called His son. Receive the kiss of His love. Let the ring which is the
   token of His eternal faithfulness be on your finger. Sit at His table
   and let your heart make merry in His Grace.

   Seek to know much of the Son of God who is the brightness of His
   Father's Glory and the express image of His Person and yet in
   unspeakable condescension of Grace became Man for our sakes. Know Him
   in the singular complexity of His Nature--eternal God and yet
   suffering, finite Man. Follow Him as He walks the waters with the tread
   of Deity and as He sits upon the well in the weariness of humanity. Be
   not satisfied unless you know something of Jesus Christ as your Friend,
   your Brother, your Husband, your All.

   Forget not the Holy Spirit--endeavor to get as clear a view as you can
   of His Nature and Character, His attributes and His works. Behold that
   Spirit of the Lord who first of all moved upon chaos and brought forth
   order--who now visits the chaos of your soul and makes order there.
   Behold Him as the Lord and giver of spiritual life, the Illuminator,
   the Instructor, the Comforter and the Sanctifier. Behold Him as, like
   holy unction, He descends upon the head of Jesus and then afterwards
   rests upon you who are as the skirts of His garments. Get a clear idea,
   then, of the Trinity in Unity. Do not reason about it. Do not try to
   understand it--remember, it is not your duty to comprehend, but to
   apprehend such Truths of God as these--you are to believe, rather than
   to reason.

   One God in the Trinity of His Persons. Let us know Him and worship Him.
   Remember that those who do not now this, very seldom know much else
   about Divine things. It is a very remarkable fact that when the
   doctrine of the Trinity is given up, the other doctrines of the
   evangelical system are pretty sure to be cast to the winds. This
   doctrine of the Trinity in Unity seems to be the place of standing or
   falling with public teachers and private Believers. Let us study to be
   well instructed in the Divine attributes and ask for Grace to know them
   all. Be not like those who dream of a God who is all love, and nothing
   else. These persons talk in maudlin sentences, as if they believed in
   an effeminate God who winks at sin and is utterly destitute of one
   single atom of integrity or holiness.

   Believe God to be what He most certainly is--a God terrible as well as
   benevolent who will by no means spare the guilty--and yet passes by
   transgression, iniquity and sin. See God in the suffering body and soul
   of Christ Jesus upon Calvary and you will understand how He is severely
   just in punishing sin in Him upon whom sin was made to meet and yet
   supremely gracious in providing such a way of escape for guilty souls!
   Do not be content with a maimed and distorted view of God's attributes!
   Feel Him to be Omnipresent--let it be your delight to know that you
   have not to call upon Him as one who is afar off, but ever near at
   hand. Recognize Him as Omnipotent--know that there is nothing which He
   cannot do and therefore doubt Him not.

   Forget not His absolute Sovereignty, but meekly submit to it. The
   failure of many men in their ideas about God is that they imagine Him
   to be subject to Law instead of being the Source and Fountain of all
   Law. They arraign His actions at their bar and forget His terrible
   reply! "No but, O man, who are you that replies against God? Shall the
   thing formed say to him that formed it, Why have you made me thus? Has
   not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel
   unto honor and another unto dishonor?" They have not heard the solemn
   voice, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have
   compassion on whom I will have compassion."

   Although to perfection you cannot find out God, yet do not worship Him
   as did the Athenians under the title of "The Unknown God." Endeavor to
   understand how Love unbounded meets with Justice unlimited and
   Sovereignty without control--how "holiness becomes His house," and yet
   how tender-hearted affection towards His creatures ever dwells in Him.
   Do not worship ignorantly! Whatever else you do not know, do know the
   Character of your God. "They that know Your name will put their trust
   in You."

   Then labor to know God in His actions. Study well the past. Do not be
   ignorant of the great work of creation! If you have the skill, look at
   that creation in the light of modern science so far as that light is
   really derived from facts and not from conjectures. Pry into God's
   great works in Providence--begin your pilgrimage of study at the gates
   of Eden and travel onward to the present time. Float safely in your
   meditations with Noah in the ark! Study the wonderful justice of God in
   thus sweeping away the race of men. I have not time to linger on any
   one particular spot this morning--if I might, I should have selected
   the Red Sea.

   Remember what Jehovah did at the Red Sea and by the brooks of Arnon!
   Tell how He made bare His arm and swept away His foes! Take Miriam's
   timbrel and sing unto the Lord who triumphed gloriously! Or, if that
   contents you not, remember Og and Sihon, or exult over Sisera in
   Deborah's song--"Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song:
   arise, Barak and lead your captivity captive, you son of Abinoam."
   Think of the deeds of God in later times when He smote Sennacherib and
   laid His hosts dead at midnight. Tell how He brought forth his People
   from the land of captivity with rejoicing and built up the walls of
   Jerusalem once more.

   Let, especially, the actions of God concerning Christ be very dear to
   you. Fly back to the eternal Council--you will not be intruding if your
   faith can enter that great council chamber of eternity. Think of the
   Covenant, the Suretyship, the provision, the Almighty decree! See Jesus
   Christ coming forth from the bosom of the Father, amid the song of
   angels, to hang upon a woman's breast. Trace the history of your
   Incarnate God--make the life of Christ be with you a household
   study--know every corner of it. Never let a question be asked of the
   youngest of you, concerning the life of Jesus, which you cannot answer!

   The rhetorician studies the classics. The old Roman orators were
   familiar with Demosthenes and the Greek poets-- so let the Christian
   make the life of Jesus his first study and with every single passage in
   it let him be familiar. Know the Savior from the weakness of the cradle
   to the triumph of His ascension, when, leading captivity captive, He
   mounted the Father's Throne to reign forever. If you have mastered all
   this, seek to know something of the teaching of the Spirit of God
   concerning the plan of salvation. Do not be content to be saved in the
   dark--try to find out how it is that you are saved. You are on a
   Rock--but look at the Rock and understand why it is a Rock and how you
   came to be standing on it.

   I believe that very much of current Arminianism is simply ignorance of
   Gospel doctrine. And if people began to study their Bibles and to take
   the Word of God as they find it, they must inevitably, if Believers,
   rise up to rejoice in the

   Doctrines of Grace. Bolingbroke was far gone in infidelity and yet when
   he met Mr. Whitfield one morning, he said to him, "Sir, if the Bible is
   true, Calvinistic doctrines such as you preach are most certainly
   taught in it. And though I neither receive the Bible nor Calvinistic
   doctrines--if you want to have these doctrines proved from the Bible at
   any time-- my pen is very much at your service. I am persuaded it is
   so."

   Dear Friends, I would not have you merely unite with the Christian
   Church and say, "Yes, I believe in Christ," but I want you--and here I
   speak to you who are lately added to the Church--I want you to know
   where this great scheme began! I want you to know how it is that the
   blood of Christ takes away sins. To know the fact is very precious, but
   to understand the reason of that fact is so comforting, so
   establishing, so every way to be desired that I would have you study
   much the Word of God till you get a clear view of the whole scheme. I
   want you to understand the reasons from election onward to final
   perseverance and from final perseverance to the second advent--the
   resurrection and the glories which shall follow--world without end!

   I have thus brought out what I think is the idea of the text about the
   people knowing their God. But we must not overlook that little word
   "their"--"They that know their God." It is not, "they that know God,"
   but, "their God." To know anything of Him aright, you must get a firm
   hold of God--He must be your God. "There is no praying," said one old
   man who used to be much in prayer, "till you come to a close grip."
   There must be a blessed familiarity with God! You must know Him to be
   yours because He gave Himself to you in the Eternal Covenant--yours
   because He has promised Himself to you in His Word--yours because you
   take Him by an act of simple faith.

   You must know He is yours because you, every day, put yourself beneath
   His guidance and desire to be a soldier under His command. Yours to
   have and to hold through life, in death and in eternity, because He has
   laid hold of you and will hold you even to the end. "The people that
   know their God." Ah, that is one of the choicest things a human tongue
   can ever say, "My God! My God!" Ah, Thomas, you learned a great lesson
   when, with your hand in Jesus' side you could say not only, "Lord,
   God," but "My Lord and my God!" O, may you all be among the people who
   know their God!

   II. THE HAPPY INFLUENCE OF THIS KIND OF KNOWLEDGE next requires our
   notice. The text shows that it strengthens, gives courage, energy,
   vigor, resolution, daring, success. They who know their God are strong
   and do exploits. The Romish church thinks a great deal of implicit
   faith--of the faith which cannot apprehend what it believes. Now we
   agree with Romanists in this--that we are to believe what we cannot
   comprehend--but we do not agree with them in the other--that we are to
   believe what we cannot apprehend. You remember the faith of the coal
   miner? "What do you believe?" "I believe what the church believes."
   "But what does the church believe?" "Oh, the church believes as I
   believe." "Well, but what do you and the church believe?" "Why, we both
   believe the same thing."

   Now Romanists may set great store by that kind of faith and they go the
   right way to induce it very often by denying the Bible to the common
   people or by neglecting education so that the masses are unable to read
   the Word when they can get it. If you say, "You believe as I believe
   and I believe as you believe and we both believe the same thing," I
   tell you that you are no credit to your teacher, and the sooner you
   give up your faith the better! A man cannot believe what he does not
   apprehend. He may say, "I am prepared to believe it when I do apprehend
   it," but as to believing what he has never been told, it is quite
   impossible.

   If there are any dogmas of Mother Church which I have not heard of, I
   do not believe them and if I stand up and say I do, I am talking
   nonsense! If I say I am prepared to believe when I shall have been
   told, that may be--but I cannot already believe them--for belief must
   be parallel with apprehension! A man must apprehend a thing or he
   cannot believe it. Knowledge strengthens the spiritual man because, in
   the first place, it is that on which faith has to feed. Where there is
   faith, knowledge is a great gain. This will be clear to all of you who
   read attentively your Bible, because the words, "to know," and, "to
   believe," are frequently used in Scripture almost synonymously.

   If you turn to the tenth chapter of St. John's Gospel you will find at
   the thirty-eighth verse that the Savior said, "But if I do, though you
   do not believe Me, believe the works, that you may know and believe
   that the Father is in Me and I in Him." And then in the first Epistle
   of St. John, in the second chapter, at the third verse, we have an
   expression which is tantamount to the one I have already referred to.
   "And hereby we do know that we know Him if we keep His commandments."
   We are sure of our faith and of our knowledge by walking in obedience
   to Him.

   The source from which Christian faith comes proves the importance of
   knowledge. How does faith come to the Christian? By sitting still and
   looking at fifty or a hundred wax candles? By admiringly gazing upon a
   impassive Madonna at the corner of the street? By hearing language
   which I cannot comprehend repeated by men in a peculiar dress? Never,
   according to Scripture! How then? "Faith comes by hearing, and hearing
   by the Word of God." There is the whole history of faith--the Word of
   God gives the teaching which blesses us with knowledge and then comes
   faith. The sight of the eye, religious awe, impressions of dread,
   emotions of wonder--these do not give faith--but hearing something
   which I can apprehend is the means of my believing!

   Believers are constantly spoken of in the Scriptures as being people
   who are enlightened and taught of the Lord. They are said to "have an
   unction from the Holy One," and it is the Spirit's peculiar office to
   lead them into all Truths of God and all this for the increase and the
   fostering of their faith. They are not kept in darkness that they may
   believe, but put into the light that they may believe! Here is the
   difference between the religion of Christ and the religion of
   antichrist.

   Moreover, there is provided in the Church of God an agency which proves
   that knowledge is to be the food of faith. To what end is the ministry
   ordained but this--"For the edification of the saints." Are we not
   called teachers? That preacher who does nothing but excite the
   people--who teaches nothing and declares no definite doctrine--had
   better lay aside his office and take to some honest employment where he
   may do no more mischief. Teaching is what we need--a true minister is a
   teacher to his people, a steward of God bringing forth things, "both
   new and old." You see, then, that if knowledge is under God the Holy
   Spirit, truly the food of faith, then in order to be strong--since
   faith is the very sinew of human strength--we must get much knowledge
   of the things of God. The people who know their God shall be strong in
   faith and shall do great exploits.

   Think again, dear Friends, of the influence of faith upon all the other
   Graces of God. Love is the sweetest of all-- but how can I love till
   knowledge gives me a view of Christ? Knowledge opens the door and then
   through that door I see my Savior. Or I may use another
   expression--knowledge takes the portrait of Christ and when I see that
   portrait, then I love Him. I cannot love a Christ I do not know, at
   least, in some degree! And if I know nothing about the excellencies of
   Christ--what He has done for me and what He is doing now--I cannot love
   Him! In Christ's case to know is to love and the more I know the more I
   shall love.

   Look at hope again. How can I hope for a thing if I do not know of its
   existence? Hope may be the telescope, but then. till I get knowledge of
   something in front of the glass, I can see nothing whatever. Knowledge
   takes away the impediment, and then when I look through the optic glass
   I can see the glory to be revealed. But I cannot hope for that of which
   I know nothing whatever! I must know there is a Heaven, or I cannot
   hope for it. Then, take patience. How shall I have patience unless I
   have heard, as James says, of the patience of Job? Unless I know
   something of the sympathy of Christ and understand the good which is to
   come out of the correction which my heavenly Father gives me?

   Knowledge gives me reasons for patience. I cannot stop on this point,
   but there is no one single grace of the Christian which, under God,
   will not be fostered and brought to perfection by holy knowledge.
   Knowledge becomes, then, of the highest importance. Again, from the
   connection of the text, it appears that many were led astray in the
   days of Antio-chus. "Such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he
   corrupt by flatteries: but the people that know their God shall be
   strong," and so on. It seems, then, that to know God is a means of
   steadfastness.

   Who are the people that are greatly troubled by new systems of
   philosophy and infidelity which are constantly springing up? Why, the
   people who do not know their God! Certain young folks say to me, "O
   Sir, I have read a new book--there is a great discovery made about
   development. Animals were not created separately, but grew out of one
   another by degrees of gradual improvement." Go and ask your grandmother
   about it! And what does she say as she takes off her spectacles? "Why,"
   she says, "I was reading 'There shall come in the last days scoffers,
   walking after their own lusts.' "

   Say to her, "Do you not feel alarmed about your faith?" "No," she says,
   "if they were to discover fifty thousand things, it would not trouble
   me for, 'I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able
   to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day.' " You
   think she is a simpleton, perhaps--she might far more properly think
   you the same! Every now and then there comes up a heresy--some woman
   turns "prophetess" and raves! Or some lunatic gets the idea that God
   has inspired him and there are always fools ready to follow any
   impostor. Who are those that go after them? Those who do not know God!
   Those who do know Him, say--

   "Should all the forms that men devise
   Assault my faith with treacherous art, I'd call them vanity and lies,
   And bind the Gospel to my heart."

   Brethren, if a truly godly minister has for six or seven years been
   teaching a people and he gives them the good, solid Truth of God and
   they receive it and understand it, I should not like to see the wolf
   come in! I do not believe he would do much mischief--for many strong
   men will be found to slay the intruder! But if there is a ministry
   which only consists of preaching up moral duties and creating the
   titillation of excitement, then, if the wolf comes, he may just glut
   himself with the blood of professors--for there is no strength in them
   to resist him! We want sound doctrine to give us stability. May God
   grant that we may be rooted and grounded in Christ, and that we may
   know the things which are revealed to us of God!

   Only once more and then we leave the second point. Knowledge will
   clearly be seen by you to be a great means for enabling you to do great
   exploits if you think of its bearing upon usefulness. A Christian
   without knowledge, for instance, is an admirable man in the holiness of
   his life. But to what other end, to what other purpose can you put him?
   He must not enter the pulpit--if he is already there, he had better
   retire. He must not be a Church officer. It would be foolish to choose
   the feeblest among us to be our leaders! He is scarcely of any use in
   the Sunday school class--he may manage to hear the children read and to
   wile away the time--but if he were a true Christian instructor, he
   would open up the Scriptures and explain them.

   Do not, any of you, feel grieved at what I am saying? I am speaking to
   those who have been lately converted! You are Believers--I am rejoicing
   in it--rejoicing that you are converted, however little your knowledge.
   But I want you to feel dissatisfied with your ignorance and to seek, in
   order to your usefulness, to know the ground and the reason for the
   things you believe and to understand, as far as you can, the deep
   things of God. Do not be content to be always chil-dren--you will never
   be men unless you are children first! Do not be content to be stunted
   in your understanding, but ask to grow in Divine Grace and in the
   knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, for the sake of your own
   usefulness.

   III. We come, in the third place, TO NOTICE HOW THIS KNOWLEDGE MAY BE
   OBTAINED. Time has fled and therefore we will not enlarge, but just
   give the outline. Search the Scriptures! Do not merely read
   them--search them! Look at the parallel passages--collate them--try to
   get the meaning of the Spirit upon any one Truth by looking at all the
   texts which refer to it. Read the Bible consecutively--do not merely
   read a verse here and there--that is not fair. You would never know
   anything about John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress if you opened it every
   morning and read six lines in any part and then shut it up again--you
   must read it all through if you want to know anything about it.

   Get those books--say Mark or John. Read Mark right through from
   beginning to end. Do not stop with two or three verses, or a
   chapter--but try to know what Mark is aiming at. It is not fair to Paul
   to take his Epistle to the Romans and read one chapter--we are obliged
   to do it in public service--but if you want to get at Paul's meaning,
   read the whole Epistle through as you would another letter. Read the
   Bible in a common-sense way. Do not read it on your knees, as I have
   known some people do--it is an awkward posture--get into an easy chair
   and read it in comfort.

   Pray after you have read it as much as you like but do not make a
   penance of what ought to be a pleasure. And when you are reading it, if
   you come to a knotty point, do not skip it. You all have some Christian
   friend who knows more than you do--go to him and try to get the thing
   explained. Above all, when you have read any passage and understand it,
   act it out and ask the Spirit of God to burn the meaning into your
   conscience till it is written on the fleshy tables of your heart.

   Next, use good helps to your Bible. I do not know better helps for the
   common mass of people than, "The Confession of Faith," or the little
   Catechism. With the little Catechism and texts of Scripture, any
   Believer, however ignorant, can, in a very short time, get a good view
   of the things of God. I believe that the Westminster Assembly's Shorter
   Catechism has more divinity in it than nine out of ten of the modern
   printings. And if any person would know and understand that, he need
   not be afraid but what he will be able to give a reason for the hope
   that is in him, provided the hope is in him.

   Next, be sure to attend a teaching ministry. Do not be always after
   sweets. Do not be running after prophesying and novelties. Try to see
   the whole range of Scripture. Believe in Calvinism--but if there is a
   single Truth of God which only the Arminians hold, believe that, too.
   Do not put your feet into Chinese shoes to be squeezed after the
   current fashion into an orthodox shape! Be willing to have a broad
   understanding--receive anything which God has revealed and be content
   to take the whole of God's Truth, whether you can make it into a system
   or not.

   Then I should say, if you want to understand much, be much in prayer.
   Prayer cuts many a Gordian knot. Be much in communion with God. You
   cannot know God at a distance. Get close to Him--come to Him in the
   name of Jesus Christ--come very close to Him. The other night, in
   prayer, I remember, by mistake, quoting an old Scripture--that we might
   weep, like the priests, "between the porch and the altar"--and I was
   corrected by a Brother for it. He said, "We do not want to stand
   between the porch and the altar, because, in prayer, the proper place
   for a Christian is beyond the altar. The sacrifice is finished and we
   are to go through the court of the priests and enter into the Most Holy
   Place--into that which is within the veil, where our Forerunner entered
   for us."

   Endeavor, therefore, to get a good view of the types of Scripture. When
   you have made a mistake about them, be willing to be corrected, but try
   to understand the types by getting the substance in your own
   experience--that is the best way of knowing them. And, remember, there
   is one school to which you can all go--where you will all learn. Our
   Savior says, "If any man will do His will, he shall know of the
   doctrine, whether it is of God or not." Practical holiness is a grammar
   school in which we may learn the Doctrines of Grace.

   IV. And now I want to say ONE WORD BY WAY OF CAUTION and it shall be
   scarcely more than a word. Remember that knowledge of itself--with all
   its excellencies and virtues when God blesses it--has a danger in it to
   you. "Knowledge," says the Apostle, "puffs up." So it does. You may get
   proud of what you know and then God forgive you and deliver you from
   it! And, moreover, you may get so positive about what you know that you
   may have made up your mind never to know any more.

   I know some of that kind--they know everything--every doctrine which is
   brought forward that they have not received already must be rejected
   because they have made up their minds that they have the whole of
   revelation by heart. They have "meted out Heaven with the span and
   comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure," and think they know
   wisdom to perfection. Do not get into that state. Your knowledge may
   even make you haughty to the people of God. You may look down with
   contempt on some who do not know so much as you and yet they may have
   twice your holiness and be doing more service to God. Knowledge is,
   after all, but a talent and Divine Grace is always better than gifts.

   Try to get Divine Grace to make the gift right, and as you grow in
   knowledge which may prove to be the sails, humility will prove an
   admirable ballast. To this end I ask the help of the Holy Spirit, that
   what you know may be rightly known, for then it will not exalt you, but
   make you lie at the foot of the Cross. O that God might thus teach and
   thus instruct us all!

   V. And now to close--here is THE DUTY OF SPREADING THIS KNOWLEDGE WHEN
   WE HAVE IT. "They that understand among the people shall instruct
   many." It is a prophecy which is fulfilled, but it is also a suggestion
   of a duty which we have to carry out. Are we instructing many, those of
   us who know the Lord? "Well," says one, "I am. I am endeavoring to do
   my best in the Sunday school, in the catechumen class and so on." God
   speed you, dear Friend! God speed you in your good work! God speed you
   a thousand-fold more than you have yet learned to ask or even think!
   But there must be some here who are not teaching others.

   Of course our business is to begin with teaching our own children. When
   the services used to be in the morning and afternoon in the olden
   times, the evening was generally spent with the children in teaching
   and catechizing. I do not think we in London could go back to the old
   plan. But I am not sure that the present one is an improvement, whether
   the children might not learn much more if the parents did give the
   Sunday evening constantly to their instruction. At any rate, no mother,
   no father--especially no mother--should suffer a Sunday to pass over
   her head, if she knows the things of God, without having her little
   ones around her and teaching them what she herself knows.

   The Sunday school teacher does well, but he cannot relieve parents from
   the responsibility of teaching their own children. Others might take a
   wider range. Might you not get up Bible-readings at your house? If God
   has taught you a Truth which others do not know, could you not find
   others in your neighborhood who might be willing to come to your house
   and understand the things of God from you or someone else? If they will
   not come, have you not the instinct to get at them some other way?
   Cannot you so weave the common events of life into a means of Christian
   instruction that you are truly "all things to all men"?

   Put in words edgewise, so as to instruct casual visitors. We have not a
   system of class meetings as among our Wesleyan friends. It would be a
   great mercy if we had something like they had. And it would be a good
   thing if the elders of this Church would constantly look after the
   younger ones. Get seven, eight, or nine to meet you as a class. Get a
   textbook and study it by the light of the Word of God. We have some
   admirable teachers here, but I believe we have some who might teach a
   great deal more, who are not doing it. Some of you are living at a
   distance--your work cannot be very well carried on in connection with
   this place. What does that matter?

   I would as soon you taught elsewhere! So long as you are working for
   God, it does not matter whether it is here or there. If you are
   Christian people belonging to this Church, your first duty is here. But
   if from any other circumstance you cannot throw in your strength with
   us, why, do it elsewhere! If you want to go elsewhere, of course we are
   sorry to lose you, but, we say, go, by all means, if you can serve God
   better! If you feel you must attend our ministry because it suits your
   mind, then come among us and aid our efforts to do good. Do, at any
   rate, teach what God has told you!

   If God has lit your candle, try to shine and let other candles be lit
   by you. I have said much on this point and I close with this
   remark--there are some here who cannot be exhorted to learn and know
   much of God because they have not yet begun to know themselves. They do
   not know this simple Truth of God--"That Christ came into the world to
   save sinners." They know it from theory, but that is of very little
   use. May they know it in their heart by saying, "Jesus, I am a sinner!
   Since You came to save sinners, I give myself to You. O save me! I
   trust You to save me."

   God bring you to this state and when you have received Christ, then
   endeavor, as much as lies in you--

   "To teach to sinners round, What a dear Savior you have found." May the
   Master bless these words, for Jesus' sake. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

                    The Great Need--Or, The Great Salvation

   A SERMON PREACHED BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE,
   NEWINGTON.

   "O that you had hearkened to My commandments! Then your peace would ha
   ve been like a river and your righteousness as the waves of the sea."
   Isaiah 48:18.

   FROM this verse we may learn that when God smites men on account of sin
   it gives Him no pleasure. The voice which speaks is not that of the
   seraphic Prophet, but it is the voice of the Lord God of the prophets
   Himself. The manner is not merely the majestic formula, "Thus says
   Jehovah," but it is supplemented with words intended to remind us of
   His graciousness and His goodwill. "Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer,"
   He who rescued you from perils past, "the Holy One of Israel," the
   faithful Promiser, who has shown you His counsels and His statutes.
   Moreover, He challenges attention with more simple, touching mementoes
   of His kindness when He adds, "I am the Lord your God which teaches you
   to profit, which leads you by the way that you should go."

   As the Instructor of their childhood and the Guide of their riper
   years, He first expresses the most natural interest in their welfare
   and then pitifully bewails the folly of His children. Speaking after
   the manner of men, to chasten His own people is a pain and a grief to
   His heart--"Like as a father pities his children, so the Lord pities
   them that fear Him." John Knox said that he never chastised his
   children without tears in his own eyes. Jeremiah, in the bitterest
   chapter of his unparalleled Lamentations, bears this grateful witness
   to our Covenant God--"He does not afflict willingly nor grieve the
   children of men."

   And surely if in the gentler chastisement of His hands the Most High
   takes no pleasure, much less can He find delight in that withering
   curse which destroys the finally impenitent. Beloved, the eternal
   torment of men is no joy to God! The ruin of a sinner gives Him no
   satisfaction. While the calamity is such as He only can estimate, the
   warnings, expostulations and entreaties He has spoken furnish proof
   upon proof of His pity. Hear His own words, no, listen as He swears,
   listen to His own oath--"As I live, says the Lord God, I have no
   pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his
   way and live."

   Not vengeance, but mercy--to kiss the returning prodigal! To wash the
   feet of the guilty sinner! To press the rebel to His bosom and to adopt
   Him into His family--this is happiness to God! When, therefore, He
   rises to judgment and pronounces the fearful sentence, "Depart, you
   cursed," and casts down the transgressor to Hell and delivers him over
   to the tormentors--though He vindicates the justice of His Throne, it
   is--"His strange work, to bring to pass His act, His strange act."

   Even the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction have experience of
   God's longsuffering. How tardily He puts off the time! How often He
   tarries before He inflicts the stroke! How He hides His power while He
   unfolds His patience! He refrains the fierceness of His anger because
   He is "God, and not man!" "How shall I give you up, Ephraim? How shall
   I deliver you, Israel? How shall I make you as Admah? How shall I set
   you as Zeboim? My heart is turned within Me, My repentings are kindled
   together."

   Let me appeal to you then, my Hearers, those of you who have
   entertained hard thoughts of God--correct them now--banish them from
   your breasts tonight! You may take pleasure in the damnation of your
   fellow men--my God has no such pleasure! You may find gratification in
   your sins, but He grieves over them, for as He sees your course, He
   foresees your end! Nor is this the only lesson which lays on the
   surface of the text. Still speaking after the manner of men, I beg you
   to observe that the Lord addresses words of poignant regret over the
   prize the sinner has lost, as well as the penalty he has incurred.

   So did Jesus Christ look upon Jerusalem. Musing on the desolation to
   which she should shortly come, He reflected on the preservation in
   which she might have safely stood. Just as little chickens cluster
   under the hen's wings, nestling there in genial warmth and peaceful
   security, so might Israel have found prosperity in her own borders and
   protection against foreign invaders under the shadow of the wings of
   the Lord God Almighty. You remember how He burst into tears? Can you
   ever forget that cry of His, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill the
   Prophets and stone them which are sent unto you, how often would I have
   gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens
   under her wings and you would not"?

   Such, too, are the words of my text--words which I pray God may rouse
   your thoughts and be engraved deeply on your hearts. God looks upon the
   "peace" you might enjoy and the "righteousness" that would enrich
   you--if you would just hearken to His commandments and obey His great
   mandate, "Believe and live." He sees you afar off from peace! He
   beholds what you cannot yet discern--the clouds gathering round your
   head. It may be you feel in a dead calm. He utters this pathetic
   exclamation, "O that you had hearkened to My commandments! Then your
   peace would have been like a river and your righteousness as the waves
   of the sea."

   Sinner! The eternal God weeps over you while you are utterly careless
   about yourself! The infinite heart of my Divine Master yearns over you!
   The voice which has often reproved you now mourns your hapless state in
   plaintive tones. I think I hear the chords of His heart in notes of
   pity far exceeding all that Prophets, Apostles and ministers could ever
   utter! "O that that sinner would believe in Jesus! O that He would give
   Me his heart! O that he would be obedient to My Word! Then his peace
   should flow in purity and fertility like a river. And then his
   righteousness should roll in boundless plenty and multiply its grand
   impressive witness like the waves of the sea."

   And now, instead of giving you the order of my sermon, let me speak
   straight on. How great is the Divine Grace which the sinner despises!
   He cannot tell the loss he suffers. And what sweet figures these are by
   which God has been pleased to set that Grace forth! Gladly would I woo
   you by their charms. But oh, how terrible the consequences of neglect!
   May God enable me to sound the warning faithfully in your ears this
   night! What loss do you think is that which God bewails on your
   account? It is not for you, O Sinner, to understand, or to appreciate
   such blessings as you have never known or possessed.

   We strive in vain to describe the blessing of sight to him who was born
   blind, or the sweetness of melody to the deaf. "Peace like a river,"
   and "righteousness like the waves of the sea," are not within the
   limits of your comprehension. Be it so, then. There is a need which you
   unconsciously suffer. You are a stranger to peace. "There is no peace,
   says my God, to the wicked." David Hume used to say that Christians
   were melancholy people. But that was a happy retort in which somebody
   observed, "David Hume's opinion is not worth much, for he never saw
   many Christians. And when he did see any, there was enough to make them
   miserable in the sight of David Hume."

   The true Christian has a peace which is totally unknown to any other
   man! Yes, he has, "the peace of God which passes all understanding."
   There are, indeed, two kinds of peace into the secret satisfaction of
   which no unconverted person can enter--peace with God, and peace in the
   heart. Yet both of these are the inalienable right of the Believer! The
   peace which our Lord Jesus Christ made by the blood of His Cross has
   sealed his acceptance with the Father. And the peace which is produced
   in his conscience as the fruit of the Spirit calms the troubled
   passions of his breast. He enjoys peace with God. Happy soul!

   He says of the Lord, "He is my refuge and my fortress: my God! In Him
   will I trust." The terrors of the Lord do not make him afraid. When he
   walks in the midst of God's works, this is his joy--

   "My Father made them all."

   When he is on the deep and hoary sea, he says, "The deep is in the
   hollow of my Father's hand and were I to sink beneath its surging
   billows, I could only drop on to His bare arm." When the thunder is
   abroad and the lightning flashes dart across the jet-black sky, he
   trembles not--his lips do not grow pale, nor is his face all blanched
   with fear--they are but his Father's servants that do His pleasure, why
   should he be alarmed? Let sickness of body, or sorrow of mind, or any
   Providence, however calamitous come upon him--he bears it all with an
   equanimity which faith alone can beget-- because God has done it.

   He has perfect peace with God which the tribulations of the world
   cannot disturb. Between my soul and my God, if I am a Believer, there
   is no breach. No, there is friendship, love, union! The bonds which
   bind me to Him are the bonds of His own immutability and His Covenant
   love. This peace of God must transcend the strife of the elements which
   surround me, for--

   "The hand that may ruffle the evening's calm, Bears Calvary's print on
   its bleeding palm."

   So, too, the Christian is at peace with himself. Self is an ugly enemy
   for a sinner to encounter. It is written in the Bible, "And David's
   heart smote him." Conscience strikes hard blows. A good conscience has
   a keen edge and severely cuts those who tamper with it. Bad men are
   sometimes afraid of evil spirits. We have heard of people shutting
   their doors to keep the devil out of their houses. But so long as the
   thing called, "Conscience," dwells in their breast, they will never be
   able to shut out a troublesome spirit. He carries a demon with him who
   has an unsatisfied conscience.

   Tell me not of the howling of the wolf, when, in the depths of
   winter--meager, gaunt and grim--it gets a smell of blood and speeds on
   in its ravenous career--conscience is infinitely more insatiable! The
   deep baying of the hounds of conscience is more terrible to a man than
   any sound except the voice of God. But the Christian is not afraid of
   himself. He can sit with himself in the hours of midnight, walk with
   himself in the lonely road and talk with himself in the still calm of
   his meditations--God has enabled him to shake hands with his conscience
   and they have become the best of friends!--

   "Oh, lost to virtue, lost to manly thought,
   Lost to the noble sallies of the soul,
   Who think it solitude to be alone.
   Our reason, guardian angel and our God,
   Then nearest these when others most remote,
   And soon all shall be remote but these."

   This is a peace which no man can attain unto except the man who
   hearkens to the commandment, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ." And if
   you hearken to that commandment and believe in the Son of God you shall
   have peace and that peace shall be like a river. The metaphor is full
   of beauty and not wanting in instructiveness either--by which peace is
   compared to a river. What does this mean? I think it may suggest
   several things. Peace, like a river, for continuance. Look at it,
   rising as a little brook among the shingles of that green hill, it
   comes dashing down a rugged waterfall--it flows along that valley
   yonder--where the red deer wanders and where the child loves to play.

   It turns the village mill--listen to its babblings as it flows onward,
   sometimes leaping down the wheel and at other times flinging carelessly
   its strength to the winds. Now it becomes broad and deep and many a
   large and heavy craft floats upon it. Then it swells its bosom--bridges
   with noble arches span it and it becomes an estuary like a great arm of
   the sea and pours its torrents into old father Ocean. It continues. It
   is not a thing of today which is gone tomorrow, but it proclaims its
   own constancy--

   "Men may come and men may go, But I flow on forever."

   Forever! Throughout all generations the river speeds to its destined
   place. Such is the peace of the Christian. He is always at peace. He
   has not peace like a swollen torrent which is dried up under some hot
   sun of adversity, but his peace is with him at all times. Do you
   enquire for the Thames? You shall find it flowing in its own bed in the
   thick black night, as well as in the clear bright day. You shall
   discover the Thames when it mirrors the stars or sends back the sheen
   of the moon as well as when multitudes of eyes gaze upon it at midday.
   You shall see the Thames in the hour of tempest by the lightning's
   flash as well as in the day of calm when the sun shines brightly on it.
   Ever it is there.

   And such is the Christian's peace. Come night, come day, come sickness,
   come health, come what will--this peace which passes all understanding
   will keep the Christian's heart and mind, through Jesus Christ. Like a
   river it always flows on--no matter what the scenery on its banks, it
   does not stop. Here is a hill and there a dale, here the dry and
   thirsty sand and there, again, the fat and laughing fields--but the
   river is still the same. And so with the Christian. Today he
   abounds--tomorrow he is empty. One day he walks with manly stride,
   erect in health--another day he pines and tosses upon the bed of pain.
   Today men praise him and every man extols him in song--tomorrow he is
   the butt of ridicule and the subject of caricature--pointed at in the
   streets and despised. Today he lives--tomorrow he dies.

   But his peace is still the same. Like a river, no matter what the banks
   which overlook it, or what the weather which overcasts it--still it is
   the same. Such is the deep calm which pervades the Christian's spirit.
   It is a continual thing--a peace with which the world cannot market--a
   peace of which the world cannot deprive, but a peace, still, unto which
   the Christian is called and it abides with him forevermore.

   Since the day I learned to wear in my button hole the heart's-ease
   plucked from God's garden, my soul can laugh all men to scorn who find
   comfort elsewhere. And this peace is "peace like a river" for
   freshness, too. The water which runs down the Thames, say at
   Maidenhead, never was there before. It is fresh water, fresh from the
   hills today and tomorrow it is the same and the same the next day--ever
   fresh supplies from the heart of old England to keep her glorious river
   swelling and abounding.

   Now the peace which a Christian has is always fresh, always receiving
   fresh supplies. We found peace at first through the precious blood of
   Christ. We have sinned since then, but we have gone anew to the
   Fountain and have washed again and again. We have had doubts and fears.
   These at first were dispersed by a sight of Christ--we have fresh views
   of our glorious Savior and His completed work and so the river goes on
   receiving fresh supplies. The Spirit of God was our Comforter ten years
   ago. Ah, gray-headed man, he was your Comforter, perhaps, before I was
   born! Before this babbling tongue had touched any man's conscience, you
   had rested on the Cross of Christ and the Spirit had said, "Peace be
   unto you."

   The whole of these forty years you have had fresh anointings, fresh
   unction from on high and so your continued peace has been like a river.
   Do not suppose, O you who are strangers to these things--do not suppose
   that the Christian gets a peace like the striking of a match which goes
   out in a moment! Oh, no! It is the steady shining of a fixed star! Not
   the blaze of a meteor in an autumn evening, but the shining of the
   brightest lamp which never goes out and never goes down. Happy that
   Christian who has fresh floods of peace, peace like a river for the
   freshness of its streams!

   And you know, Brothers and Sisters, that a river increases in breadth
   and its waters augment their volume. You can leap across the Thames,
   say, at Cricklade, or Lechlade--it is so tiny a little brook you may
   almost take it up in a cup! There is a narrow plank across which
   laughing village girls go tripping over! But who thinks of laying down
   a plank across the Thames at Southend, or at Grays? Who would imagine
   that at Gravesend it might be crossed by the tripping girls, or by the
   skipping lambs?

   No, the river has grown--how deep! At the mouth of it, I suppose,
   comparable to the sea--how broad! It is a sort of ocean in miniature.
   There go the ships and leviathan might play there. Not even Behemoth
   himself, I think, would have the presumption to suppose that he could
   sniff up this Jordan at a draught, for it has grown too great for him!
   Such is the Christian's peace. Pure and perfect though it is at the
   first, little temptations seem to mar it and oftentimes the troubles of
   this life threaten to choke it. Not that they ever do--

   "Men may come and men may go, But it flows on forever."

   True, it seems little at the point of its rise. But be not deceived.
   Wait. When the Christian is ten years older and has meandered a few
   more miles along the tortuous course of a gracious experience, his
   peace will be like a broad river!

   Wait twenty or thirty years--till he has traversed these rich lowlands
   of fellowship with Christ in His sufferings and conformity to His
   death--then his peace will be like a deep river, for he shall know the
   peace of God which passes all understanding! And he will have cast all
   his care upon God who cares for him. Thus that peace will go on
   increasing till it melts into the Infinite peace of the beatific
   vision, where--

   "Not a wave of trouble rolls Across the peaceful breast."

   Well, therefore, may our peace be likened to a river for its perpetual
   increase!

   Yet once more, the peace of the Christian is like a river because of
   its joyful independence of man. We have heard the story of a simpleton
   who went to see the reputed source of the Thames. Putting his hand over
   the little rivulet that came trickling down the ditch, he stopped it
   and said, "I wonder what they are doing at London Bridge now that I
   have stopped the river?" His idea was that as he had stopped its flow,
   all the barges were high and dry, the steamers breaking their backs on
   the sandbanks and nobody knowing what consequences might ensue because
   he had stopped the Thames!

   But who knew the difference? A child takes into its hand its cup of
   water and blows it and the whole surface undulates with little
   waves--but where are the giant lips which could blow the Thames and
   cause waves upon its bosom? Steadily, pleasantly, laughingly, the river
   flows on, gliding beneath the majestic castle of monarchs and sporting
   past the bowers of the muses, careless altogether what men of might do,
   or men of intellect think! A whole Parliament could not make the Thames
   swell with waves and fifty Parliaments could not lessen the body of its
   waters. It were well, by the way, if they could preserve its streams
   from the pollution of those foul and putrid sewers constantly emptied
   into it! The rivers would be better without the interference of men.

   Such, then, is the Christian's peace. I have watched this river as it
   broke over the stones of adversity--and when the tide of earthly
   comfort ran low--it has seemed as if the flow of peace were clearer and
   more transparent than ever! Some of you may have said, "I wonder
   whether such a Brother or Sister will be as peaceful when he is lying
   on his sick bed, as he used to be when he joined our Sunday services."
   You go and you will find his peace abounds in the hour of need. Perhaps
   you hardly expected that another dear friend could bear the loss of his
   situation and thus come down, as it were, in the world--but to your
   amazement he tells you how he is just beginning to learn Habakkuk's
   song--"Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be
   in the vines. The labor of the olive shall fail and the fields shall
   yield no meat. The flock shall be cut off from the fold and there shall
   be no herd in the stalls--yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in
   the God of my salvation."

   The devil cannot rob us of the peace which comes from God! Neither can
   the world take it away! O Christian, what a comfort it is for you to
   think that if all the powers of darkness should be in arms against you,
   they cannot destroy your peace which is in Christ Jesus the Lord! Only
   let God be with you and your peace of mind would still be like a river.
   It would still be like a sea of glass which is not to be ruffled at
   all. Glorious in deed and in truth is the Christian's independence.
   Some Christians call themselves "Independents." I believe we are all
   very dependent upon God, and therefore we shall never be Independents
   in that respect!

   But, at the same time, every Christian is so entirely independent of
   man when he leans upon his God that we may, every one of us, be
   Independents! We can afford to defy the world to do its best or its
   worst to stay the tide of our joy when He causes our peace to flow like
   a river! What would some of you give to have such a peace as this--that
   you could go to bed with peace and not be afraid of sleeping your last
   and wake up with peace fearing no ill? That you could go to business
   not afraid of evil tidings because your heart is fixed, trusting in the
   Lord? What would you give to have a great lump of sunshine put into
   your bosom which you might break up and sprinkle over all your days and
   nights?

   Yet such peace you shall have if you hearken to God's commands. That
   you have it not is our regret tonight. Alas! Alas, for you, that you
   have not listened to His commandment, which is, "Believe in the Lord
   Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved." If you had hearkened to it, then
   the blessing would be yours and the sweet enjoyment thereof would
   tranquil-ize your minds while it caused a tide of pleasure to stir up
   every grateful emotion of your heart!

   Time flies and I am still lingering upon the former of the two figures
   employed. I must pass on to notice the other figure which is used to
   express those good things which the sinner has missed--"YOUR
   RIGHTEOUSNESS AS THE WAVES OF THE SEA!" Let us pause a moment and
   notice how this metaphor surpasses the previous one in dignity, if not
   in delicacy. Now we can all see a sort of comparison and yet at the
   same time a strong contrast between the water of an inland river and
   the collection of waters which make up the wide expanse of the sea.
   One, for the most part, is tran-quil--the other always heaving and
   surging to and fro.

   So I suppose, as the words were originally addressed to the Jewish
   nation and referred to their temporal welfare, the river would
   represent the beauty and happiness of their own land, like the garden
   of Eden watered by the river of God's pleasure. And the sea, with its
   waves rolling in majestically one after another in unbroken succession,
   would set forth that progress which is the renown of righteousness.
   Generation after generation would witness the rising tide of
   prosperity. Each chapter of their chronicles would lift its crested
   plume and tell of mighty acts and righteous deeds, till, like the roar
   of the ocean, the righteousness of Israel should proclaim the name of
   the Lord from the river even to the ends of the earth!

   Oh, what did that rebellious seed of Jacob lose by forsaking the Lord!
   This seems to me to be something like the meaning. But I want to apply
   this metaphor of the waves of the sea, like I have that of the flowing
   of the river, to the happiness of the Believer. Look, dear Friends, at
   this precious doctrine of the Gospel through the glass of that Old
   Testament symbol. The man who believes in Jesus Christ has the
   righteousness of Christ imputed to him, that is to say, the obedience
   of Christ is considered by God as his obedience. So if I believe in
   Christ, I am as much beloved and as much accepted as if I had been
   perfect in a moral uprightness of my own--for the righteousness of
   Christ becomes mine.

   But how is this righteousness like the waves of the sea? Well, first it
   is like the waves of the sea for multitude. You cannot count the waves
   of the sea, do what you will. And so is it with the righteousness of
   Christ--you cannot count its different forms and fashions. Let us tell
   you of some of these waves. I was born in sin and shapen in iniquity,
   but Christ is called, "that holy Thing" which is born of the Virgin and
   the holiness of Christ's birth takes away the unholiness of my
   nativity.

   I have committed sins in my childhood, sins against my parents. But
   Jesus Christ was a child full of the Spirit and grew in wisdom and in
   stature and in favor both with God and man--so Christ's childish
   perfection is imputed to me and hides my childish sins. I have to mourn
   over sins of thought because the imaginations and thoughts of my heart
   are evil. But Christ can say, "Your Law is My delight," and the
   thoughts of Christ's mind cover my thoughts. Sins of the tongue you
   have all had to lament--but Grace is poured into His lips and the
   graciousness of Christ's speech covers the gracelessness of yours.

   You have had heart-sins--but Christ has had heart-virtues. Your heart
   is hard. But He could say, "Reproach has broken My heart." Your heart
   was cold--but His fervor was constant, till He could say, "The zeal of
   Your house has eaten Me up." Your heart was proud, high and lofty--but
   Christ was humble and meek--He endured shame and spitting. You have had
   sins in worship--but Christ purged the temple and served the Father in
   perfection, yes, both in Spirit and in truth. We have sins in private
   prayer--but the cold mountaintops witnessed the fervor of His
   supplications.

   We have sinned against our fellow men. But He loved His neighbor better
   than Himself. We have many sins against God--but Christ loved the Lord
   His God with all His heart and it was His delight to do His Father's
   business. Keep on, Brethren, keep on--let the list of your sins be
   long, but the list of Christ's righteousness will be longer still, for
   it is like the waves of the sea! What are you--a servant? Well, if you
   have the sins of a servant, Christ has the virtues of a servant. Are
   you a master? Your sins as a master are covered by Christ's
   righteousness as a master. I am a minister. I feel my
   im-perfection--but my Lord was a perfect Shepherd of the flock--as He
   was a perfect Teacher, the perfection of His teach-ership belongs to me
   and I am covered with it.

   Oh, what a righteousness is this! It is like the waves of the sea,
   manifold. All that the Christian can want to satisfy the claims of the
   Divine Law is found in the righteousness of Christ! There is a moral
   grandeur in the picture here-- "Righteousness like the waves of the
   sea." The righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ is also like the waves
   of the sea for majesty. What an illustration of overwhelming power!
   There comes the rushing wave. The tide has determined to rise to
   such-and-such a point--who can keep it back? And ask now, Beloved, "Who
   can withstand the power of Christ's righteousness? Who shall lay
   anything to the charge of God's elect? Whom Christ has justified, who
   shall condemn?"

   Rise, mighty tide of Righteousness, rise on, for none can stay You in
   Your course. Then it is majestic, because it is profound. Who can plumb
   the depth of the righteousness of Christ?--deep as the demands of the
   Law, deep as the miseries of Hell, deep as the thoughts of God! It is
   majestic, too, because of its ceaseless energy. Sit in the boat and see
   the waves as they go rolling by, following each other in endless
   succession. Never will the sea stop--it boils like a pot. Now, the
   righteousness of Christ has a ceaseless energy. Wave upon wave, it
   breaks upon the eternal shore of Divine justice, fulfilling the
   counsels of God, while it covers all the sins of His people!

   Beloved, that righteousness pleads tonight for every sinner who is
   resting on it and it brings to you and to me the countless mercies
   which we are privileged to enjoy. For majesty, then, the righteousness
   of Christ is like the waves of the sea. And the analogy may be traced
   still further if you reflect on the sufficiency of the one and the
   other. All over the world, at low water, you will find certain muddy
   creeks, bays and coves. How are all these to be covered? How will that
   swamp once more be made to look like a seabed? Who can do it? God can!
   And there is water enough in the sea to cover every cove and creek. And
   there is not a river which will have to say "We had no tide today."

   O careless Hearer, what shall I say to you to commend this
   righteousness of Christ? You may be the vilest sinner out of Hell, but
   there is enough righteousness in Christ to cover you! For every creek
   of sin, for every bay of blasphemy, for every cove of infamy here is a
   flood which will cover them all! The high-water mark of complete
   salvation shall be gained by every child of God. You cannot measure the
   all-sufficiency of the waves of the sea, much less can you find a gauge
   by which to estimate the all-sufficiency of the merit of Christ!

   Only once more, to make four points here, as we did in interpreting the
   river. The righteousness of Christ is like the waves of the sea for
   origin. Who is the father of those waves? Out of whose womb came that
   mighty company? Who is the joyous sire to whom these children may lift
   up their voices and say, "Here we are"? "God," let the torrents roar,
   "He has made us and not we ourselves. The holy hands of God poured us
   into the channels which He had dug and here we are, sometimes as a
   glass, that He may mirror His awful face in tempest, but ever His
   willing servants and His obedient sons."

   Now the righteousness of Christ comes not from man. No one adds a jot
   or tittle to it, but it is of the Lord and the Lord alone.
   Jehovah-Tsidkenu bared His mighty arm and stretched it to the work and
   with Him there was no man. When He worked out the salvation of His
   people He stood alone without a helper. "O" says one, "I wish I had
   that righteousness to cover all my sins and to take me to Heaven!" If
   you had hearkened to God's commands, you would have had it. Yes,
   Sinner, if you had believed in Christ, your peace would have been as a
   river and your righteousness as the waves of the sea.

   That you have it not is owing to this--that you have not listened to
   God. I will put it to you very affectionately, but with the utmost
   faithfulness. When the Gospel has been preached, have you listened
   attentively? Do you say, "Yes"? We will go farther, then. Have you
   listened in solemn earnestness, desiring that the Word might be blessed
   to you? Have you listened in prayerfulness, crying, "God be merciful to
   me, a sinner"? Have you hearkened with willingness, being willing to be
   obedient? Have you hearkened with resolve, determining to do what was
   commanded you? Have you listened with humility, feeling your own
   inability and did you beseech Him, the Lord, to help you? Have you
   listened with all the powers of your mind, calling upon your entire
   being and saying--"Now, Lord, here is my ear. Speak, Lord, for Your
   servant hears"?

   O my Friends, you have, many of you, listened to me, but you do not
   listen to my Master and even my poor word goes in one ear and out the
   other! You will go chatting home tonight and you will seek after your
   amusements tomorrow and all that the Word might have done will be
   thrown away upon you. I know how some of you hear--it is always with
   procrastination. You mean to hear, but you do not give heed with a
   present anxiety. You do not hear as that clock would bid you, for every
   tick of it seems to say, "Now, now, NOW." Do any of you remember the
   loss of that vessel they called the "Central America"? I suppose some
   of you do. She was in a bad state--she had sprung a leak and was going
   down and she hoisted a signal of distress.

   A ship came close to her, the captain of which asked, through the
   trumpet, "What is amiss?" "We are in bad repair and are going down. Lie
   by till morning," was the answer. But the captain on board the rescue
   ship said, "Let me take your passengers on board now." "Lie by till
   morning!" Was the message which came back. Once again, the captain
   cried, "You had better let me take your passengers on board now." "Lie
   by till morning," was the hoarse reply which came through the tempest.
   About an hour and-a-half after, the lights were missing and though no
   sound was heard, she and all on board had gone down to the fathomless
   abyss.

   Do not say, Sinner, "Lie by till morning!" For God's sake, do not say,
   "Lie by till morning!" Tonight, even tonight, hear the voice of God! O
   that the Spirit of my God might come upon you and open your ears to
   listen to His commandment, for, "now is the accepted time, now is the
   day of salvation." This is the commandment--"He that believes and is
   baptized shall be saved." "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you
   shall be saved." To believe, as you know, is to TRUST. It is, as it
   were, to fall flat down upon Christ--to let Him carry you to Heaven--to
   put yourself out of your own hands into Christ's hands!

   It is to have done with saving yourself and to believe that He who died
   upon the Cross has perfected your salvation. Trust Him and if you
   listen to His commandment, then your peace shall be as a river and your
   righteousness as the waves of the sea. The Lord grant that it may be
   so, for His name's sake. Amen.

                  Zechariah'S Vision Of Joshua The High Priest

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JANUARY 22, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of
   the Lord and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. And the
   Lord said to Satan, The Lord rebuke you Satan! The Lord who has chosen
   Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a log plucked from the fire? Now
   Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and was standing before the
   Angel. Then He answered and spoke to those who stood before Him,
   saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And to him He said,
   Behold, I have removed your iniquity from you and I will clothe you
   with rich robes. And I said, Let them put a clean turban upon his head.
   So they put a clean turban upon his head and they put the clothes on
   him. And the Angel of the Lord stood by." Zechariah 3:1-5.

   THE original intention of this vision was to foretell the revival of
   the Jewish state after its long depression through the Babylonian
   captivity. Joshua, the high priest, with his tattered garments, must be
   looked upon as the type of the Jewish people in their deep distress. He
   was ministering before the Lord in worn and filthy garments, to show at
   once the sin of Israel and the poverty into which they had fallen. They
   were so poor that the service of God could not be conducted in suitable
   apparel, but the high priest himself appeared before the altar in robes
   unfit for his sacred work.

   The set time to favor Zion is according to the visions most near at
   hand. And Satan, the old adversary of the chosen race, bestirs himself
   to resist them and turn away the favor of God from them. But that same
   Angel of the Covenant who led the people through the wilderness and
   carried them all the days of old, stands before the Throne as their
   Advocate and at His request Jehovah rebukes Satan and begins to bless
   the people. Joshua, their representative, receives a change of clothes,
   in testimony that the people's sin is forgiven and that God accepts
   their worship.

   The vision then sweeps on to the day of the Lord Jesus and the heart of
   the Prophet Zechariah is cheered by a sight of the whole land restored
   to its former peace and happiness under the reign of the glorious One
   who is called, "My servant, THE BRANCH." While we have been
   interpreting the other visions of Zechariah, we have tried to derive
   present comfort and profit from them. We will endeavor to do so on this
   occasion. We may very properly take Joshua as a type of all the people
   of God as they stand in their sense of sin and natural faultiness,
   subject to the accusations of Satan, but delivered by their ever
   gracious Lord.

   And the change of clothing as setting forth the forgiveness of sin and
   the imputation of the Savior's righteousness, which is the joy of all
   Believers. Let us take each particular separately and may God the Holy
   Spirit shed a sacred light upon the vision and may we see in it more
   than Zechariah himself discovered! May we see Jehovah Jesus in all the
   glory of His love, manifesting Himself to His chosen as He does not
   unto the world.

   I. To begin, then, where the vision begins--with THE BELIEVER HIMSELF
   REPRESENTED BY JOSHUA. The Believer himself is described as a priest
   standing before the Angel of the Lord. Let us mark this. He is a
   priest. Who are the priests? Certain sons of Korah, who take too much
   upon them, say, "We are the priests, we are the legitimate descendants
   of the Apostles and a mysterious power distills from our priestly
   hands." We reply to them, it is impossible that you should be
   descendants of the Apostles and yet claim to possess priestly power,
   for the Apostles never claimed any peculiar priesthood for themselves
   above other Believers.

   They spoke of their Brethren, the Christians of their age, as being on
   a par with themselves in the matter of priesthood. "You also, as lively
   stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up
   spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ" (1 Peter 2:5).
   If, then, these pretenders to priesthood are priests in any special
   sense, they certainly are not descendants of the Apostles--for the
   Apostles claimed no priority of priesthood beyond the rest of their
   brethren, but said of all the saints, "You are a chosen generation, a
   royal priesthood."

   The fact is they are neither one nor the other--they are not
   descendants of the Apostles, for they preach not the Apostles' Gospel
   and know not their Spirit! Nor have they any priestly office, unless it
   is that the old Babylonian harlot accepts them as her foster children
   and gives them a name and a place among those who partake in her
   abominations. Who are the priests? Why, every humble man and woman that
   knows the power of Jesus Christ in his own soul to purge and cleanse
   him from dead works is appointed to serve as a priest unto God! I say
   every humble man and every humble woman, too, for in Christ Jesus there
   is neither male nor female--we are all one in Him.

   We offer prayers to God knowing that they ascend to Heaven like sweet
   odors before the Throne! We offer praise, believing that "whoever
   offers praise, glorifies God." "Present your bodies a living sacrifice,
   holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service." Jesus has
   made us priests and kings unto God and even here upon earth we exercise
   the priesthood of consecrated living and hallowed service and hope to
   exercise it till the Lord shall come. When I see, then, Joshua the high
   priest, I do but see a picture of each and every child of God who has
   been made near by the blood of Christ and has been taught to minister
   in holy things and enter into that which is within the veil.

   But observe where this high priest is--he is said to be "standing
   before the Angel of the Lord," that is, standing to minister. This
   should be the perpetual position of every true Believer. I have no
   business on the bed of sloth. I have no right to be wandering abroad
   after private business. I can claim no time which I may set apart to my
   own follies, or to my own aggrandizement. My true position as a
   Christian is to be always ministering to God--always standing before
   His altar.

   Do I hear you ask how this can be--with your farms and with your
   merchandise? Know you not, Brethren, that whether you eat, or drink, or
   whatever you do, you may do it all to the glory of God? Understand you
   not that every place is now God's temple and that everywhere is God's
   altar and that you can as truly serve Him in your daily callings as in
   the assemblies of the place of worship? You know not the true position
   of a Christian if you fancy that you are only priests on the Lord's Day
   and only to minister before God when you stand in the congregation of
   the faithful. You are appointed priests like your Lord--forever--and
   you are forever to be offering the sacrifice!

   By day and by night should your hearts be going up to Him. You should
   fall asleep with your Master's name upon your tongue and when you awake
   you should say with the Psalmist, "I am still with You." Happy Joshua!
   Notwithstanding the filthiness of his garments, he is to be commended
   because he keeps in the position to which he is called and like the
   servant whose ear was bored, he does not leave his master's house.
   Come, you that profess to be God's people--if you have been negligent
   in the duties of your high calling, and if your hearts at this moment
   are going after vanity--pray God the Holy Spirit to put you into a
   proper state to perform the functions of your holy office! And now in
   the courts of the Lord's House, stand like Joshua, with your hearts
   prepared by the Lord of Hosts to minister before the Lord.

   Yet, notice where it is that Joshua stands to minister. It is before
   the Angel of Jehovah. You and I can never stand to minister before
   Moses, the mediator under the Law--much less before Jehovah Himself.
   For our God is a consuming fire. It is only through a Mediator that we
   poor, defiled ones can ever become priests unto God. Perhaps some of
   God's people here may have forgotten this. You have been searching
   yourselves and trying your hearts as in the sight of God's Law and you
   feel very deeply that you are far behind what the glory of the God in
   the Law would ask of you. Therefore you begin foolishly to mistrust
   your Father's love and to think that your service before Him will not
   be heeded.

   Beloved, it is ill serving God in the light of the Law--but oh, how
   blessed is it to stand and minister before Christ and in Christ! Then,
   if I can bring Him nothing but my tears He will put them in His bottle,
   for He once wept. If I can bring Him nothing but my groans and sighs He
   will accept these as an acceptable sacrifice, for He once was broken in
   heart and sighed heavily in spirit. Gracious God, I bless You that I
   have not to present my sacrifice directly to Yourself, else you would
   consume my sacrifice and me with the flames of Your wrath! But I
   present what I have before Your Messenger, the Angel of the Covenant,
   the Lord Jesus! And through Him my prayers find acceptance wrapped up
   in His prayers!

   My praises become sweet as they are bound up with bundles of myrrh and
   aloes and cassia from Christ's own garden. Then I myself, standing in
   Him, am accepted in the Beloved. And all my poor, defiled, polluted
   works, though in themselves only objects of Divine abhorrence, are so
   accepted and received, that God smells a sweet savor. He is content and
   I am blessed. See, then, the position of the Christian as a priest--he
   is to stand before the Angel of the Lord. Now read the next word in the
   light of your own experience--"Clothed," it is said, "with filthy
   garments." Did you ever feel this when you have come to serve God?

   Perhaps it is at evening prayer--there has been something amiss in the
   family during the day and you know it-- perhaps, as the head of the
   household you have to conduct prayer and you feel, "O God, I cannot
   pray, I cannot pray as I would! I am Your priest in this house, I know,
   but how can I minister before You, for I have filthy garments on?"
   Possibly your business kept you up very late last night. Things are not
   going on as well as you wish in matters of trade and you have come here
   distracted. And while sitting in the pew listening to God's people as
   they praise the Lord, you have thought, "Ah, I have my filthy garments
   on. I cannot pray to Him. I cannot praise Him as I would."

   I know what it is to come and preach to you sometimes and to feel such
   an overwhelming sense of my own unworthi-ness, that, were it not, "Woe
   unto me if I do not preach the Gospel," I would not come on this
   platform again, for it is hard to feel that your garments are defiled
   while endeavoring to be God's mouth to men. Perhaps this afternoon,
   when you are going into your Sunday school class, you will feel much
   warmth of heart towards God. You will confess that you are not your
   own, but bought with a price. You will desire to live unto Him and
   honor Him.

   But, oh, that dread impediment of conscious guilt--it will make you cry
   out--"How can I stand before Him who charged His angels with folly and
   declares that the heavens are not pure in His sight? How can I hope to
   have a blessing on anything that I do when I feel a heart of unbelief
   departing from the living God? How can I give a blessing to His saints
   when I want a blessing myself? How shall I break the bread of Christ
   with unholy fingers and pour out the wine into His cup with a sinful
   hand?"

   But stop, Christian! Do not think of renouncing your priesthood! Do not
   let a sense of unfitness keep you from your service! Stand where you
   are--for remember, you are standing in the only place where pollution
   can be washed away-- you are standing before the Angel of the Covenant!
   It is before Christ that sin is to be confessed. Confess it anywhere
   else, your sorrow is not repentance, but remorse.

   "What is remorse?" says one. Remorse is repentance made out of sight of
   Jesus! True repentance is sorrow of sin in the Presence of Christ. Foul
   and filthy as you are, there is but one Voice which can speak you
   clean. Go not away from that Voice. There is but one Hand which can
   touch you and make you pure--stand where that Hand is close to you and
   still, filthy as your garments are, shun not the face of your best,
   your only Friend! And breathe out this prayer, "Lord, if You will, You
   can make me clean. Purge me, oh, purge me now, for Your love's sake."

   II. Let us turn to another individual who figures in the group. We
   have, in the second place, AN ADVERSARY. Satan stood before the Angel
   to resist Joshua. Does not his opposition seem superfluous? Poor Joshua
   feels enough the filth upon his garments without needing to have the
   devil to withstand him. And I, poor I, do often feel so much my own
   sinfulness that it seems a work of supererogation on the devil's part
   to lay accusations--conscience accuses enough without him!

   But yet, so cruel is he that he avails himself of the times of the
   weakness of God's people--then and there to resist them. Observe what
   he is called. He is called Satan, which signifies an adversary. He is
   an adversary and that by nature. His nature is now so vile that he
   cannot help being the adversary of everything that is good. From the
   day on which he was expelled from Heaven and dragged with him a third
   part of the stars of glory, he has been God's bitterest foe. And as to
   man, from the hour in which it was said, "The seed of the woman shall
   bruise the serpent's head," he discovered in that humble creature, man,
   his great destroyer. And he has never ceased to nibble at the heel of
   the seed of the woman, foreknowing how terribly his head is to be
   bruised.

   There is something, however, very comforting in the thought that he is
   an adversary--I would sooner have him for an adversary than for a
   friend! O my Soul, it were dread work with you if Satan were a friend
   of yours, for then with him you must forever dwell in darkness and in
   the deeps--shut out from the friendship of God! But to have Satan for
   an adversary is a comfortable omen, for it looks as if God were our
   Friend and so far let us be comforted in this matter. Yet, remember,
   Satan is an adversary not to be despised. Of keen intellect, ripened by
   years of experience, with a fullness of cunning and craft which made
   even the serpent, when possessed by him, more subtle than any other
   beast of the field, he is an antagonist worthy of angelic might.

   Gabriel might lose in such a conflict if he did not stand clad in the
   golden armor of perfect innocence. We, so apt to sin, carrying about
   with us so much tinder, had need to fear the fiery sparks which he
   scatters. It is a dreadful thing to stand foot to foot with Apollyon.
   Read Bunyan's description of Christian's fight in the Valley of
   Humiliation and you have there a shadow of what the true conflict is.
   Better to endure all kinds of temporal pains and trials than to be
   beset by Satan. He who wins, gains nothing--and he who fails will find
   his weight full heavy when the dragon sets his foot upon his neck. You
   have a stern adversary here and one who will never cease to vex you
   till you shall be out of gunshot of him, in having crossed the river of
   death.

   Now you will perceive, if you look at the passage, that this adversary
   selected a most fitting place in which to do Joshua damage. He came to
   accuse him before the Angel--before God's own Son! Oh, if he could once
   make the Lord loose His hold of us, then we should soon be his prey!
   You perceive he does not attack Joshua first, but he comes before the
   Angel to prevent Joshua's being accepted. If Satan can once persuade
   you or me to think we are not God's children and not accepted, he knows
   that he has done us serious injury. In the arsenals of Hell there are
   great stores of "ifs"-- "ifs" are Satan's bombshells--"If you are the
   Son of God."

   If he can make you doubt, then he makes a breach in your wall. If you
   are strong enough to say, "I know whom I have believed and am persuaded
   that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him," you will
   then come off more than conqueror! But the drift of Satan is to touch
   you just there, in that place where your strength lies. He is like
   Delilah--he feels that if he can cut off the locks of your faith, where
   your strength dwells--then he may put out your eyes and sell you to the
   Philistines forever. Take care, take care, when Satan comes to accuse
   you before the Angel and to make you doubt your interest in the Lord
   Jesus, that you at once leave the case in the Angel's hands--for your
   Advocate can plead better against the accuser than you can!

   And it is best for you to hold your peace and to let that great
   Advocate stand up and say, "The Lord rebuke you, Satan! The Lord who
   has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you!" You will agree with me that the
   adversary not only selected a very fit place by coming at once to the
   Throne to lay the accusation, but a very fit opportunity. Joshua had
   his filthy garments on. Satan is a great coward--he will generally
   meddle with God's people when they are down. I find that when I am in
   good physical health, I am not often tempted of Satan to despondency or
   doubt. But whenever I get depressed in spirit, or my liver is out of
   order, or my head aches--then comes the hissing serpent--"God has
   forsaken you! You are no child of God! You are unfaithful to your
   Master! You have no part in the blood of sprinkling," and such-like
   things.

   You old rascal! If you say as much as that to me in my days of
   health--when my blood is leaping in my veins--I shall be more than a
   match for you! But to meet me just then, when you understand that I am
   weak, yes, this is just like you, Satan. What a thorough devil our
   enemy is! I can call him by no worse name than his own! But if worse
   there were, richly would he deserve it. You must expect, Christian,
   when you have lost your sense of justification, when you are conscious
   of sin, when you feel unfit to minister before God--you must expect
   that just then he will come to accuse you.

   If Joshua's garment had been perfectly clean that morning when he went
   to minister as a priest, Satan would have let him alone. But see Joshua
   depressed in spirit and heavy in mind--weeping over his sins--then
   comes Satan and he says, "Now, I shall battle with him! God will hate
   Joshua, for He cannot bear filth. He will be sure to cast away the
   filthy priest. And Joshua is hating himself, too, and so I shall plunge
   him in despair and make an end of the man." Surely, so it would have
   been if the Angel had not been there!

   But the Angel of the Lord, by His Presence, is ever a wall of fire
   round about His people and a Glory in the midst! If the lion of Hell
   comes prowling forth to seize the very weakest lamb, the great Shepherd
   will deliver the lamb out of his teeth--nor shall the infernal lion
   rend the meanest of His sheep. Commentators have puzzled themselves to
   know what Satan would have to say against Joshua. As I read their
   conjectures I thought that it would never have puzzled me--for my
   question would be, in my own case--"Which one out of the fifty thousand
   things the devil would choose to bring?" Not what he could bring, but I
   ask which one out of fifty thousand things he would choose to bring?

   Truly, dear Friend, if Satan wants to accuse us--any page of our
   history--any hour of any day will furnish him material for his charges!
   Yesterday you were impatient. The day before you were proud. Another
   day you were slothful, on another, angry. Oh what a den of unclean
   birds the human heart is! I would to God we could wring their necks,
   but they are too many for any power less than Divine to destroy them
   all! One chirps at one time and one at another and between them they
   maintain a dolorous discord! Talk of perfection in the flesh? The man
   who dreams of it is either a fool or a knave, one of the two!

   He is either a fool and does not know his own heart, or else he is a
   knave before God and is dishonest and does not call that sin which is
   sin. Perfection in the flesh? Why, those Believers who live nearest to
   God and have the deepest experience of Divine things will tell you they
   have given up that dream long ago! They never expect to be perfect
   except in Christ Jesus and never to be complete in themselves but only
   to be complete in Him. If the old accuser wants reasons for accusation,
   he may, indeed, find as many as he wills and continue to accuse as long
   as ever he pleases--for we are altogether as an unclean thing and all
   our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.

   I have heard of a certain Divine that he used always to carry about
   with him a little book. This little book had only three leaves in it
   and to tell the truth there was not a single word in the book. The
   first was a sheet of black paper, black as jet. The next was a sheet of
   red--scarlet. And the next was a sheet of white without spot. Day by
   day he used to take out this little book and at last he told some one
   the secret of what it meant. He said, "There is the black leaf--that is
   my sin and the wrath of God which my sin deserves. I look and look and
   think it is not black enough, though it is black as black can be. Then
   the next, that is the leaf of the atoning sacrifice, the precious
   blood--the red leaf--how I do delight to look at that and look and look
   again. Then there is the white leaf. That is my soul, as it is washed
   in Jesus' blood, made white as snow through the righteousness of Jesus
   Christ and washing in the fountain which Christ has filled from His own
   veins."

   Ah, that first black leaf! That black leaf! Surely, if Satan looks over
   it, it will be no puzzle to him to find something against you! He may
   continue to plead against you till doomsday and always find ground in
   your shortcomings for accusing you before the Angel of God! And what
   was it that Satan was after, after all, with Joshua? Was it that he
   hated Joshua's sins? Did he bring these before the Angel because he
   really was vexed that such a sinner as Joshua should defile the courts
   of God's House? Ah, not a bit of it! It is an edifying spectacle,
   certainly, to see Satan pleading against sin! It is sometimes good to
   turn the tables on Satan, as Martin Luther does and tell him,
   "Supposing I am all you say I am, yet what are you, that you should
   bring accusations against me?

   "I am no servant of yours, Satan. If my Master does not find fault with
   me, who am I that I should be afraid because you assail and accuse me?
   What are you, after all? You do but look round my castle wall and smile
   at every rift and so tell me where it needs mending! What are you but a
   fierce dog, keeping me awake by your howling? Better that I have you,
   than be without you, lest I fall into a deadly slumber and so sleep
   myself into carnal security and spiritual death. What are you after
   all, arch Fiend, but one who, like a terrible tempest, drives me nearer
   to my Savior and compels me to find a harbor in His bosom?"

   Satan aims at our destruction--that is the point at which he drives. He
   does not care for our pleasure--it is our total and eternal ruin. Let
   us know this and never be beguiled by him. In whatever way he puts sin,
   let us understand it to be sin, still, and therefore keep out of his
   clutches. When at the council of Basle, a certain cardinal had spoken
   very fairly about Protestants, the Emperor Sigismund rose and said,
   "Yes, he talks very prettily, but remember, he is a Roman--he is a
   Roman still." So when the adversary advances with his blandishments and
   temptations, remember he is a devil still, though dressed in his best
   robes! You can always detect him under any of his various
   disguises--for his desire is at all times and all seasons your total
   destruction!

   We have now a very gloomy picture before us. We have the poor Believer
   in Christ willing to minister unto the Lord, but quite unable to do so
   because of his filthy garments. And we have, at the same time, a
   clamorous accuser who is crying out before the bar ofjustice, "Condemn
   him! Condemn him! Condemn him!" And well may that poor Believer tremble
   from head to foot as he recollects how true the charge is!

   III. But stop! The picture changes now, for THE ANGEL SPEAKS! He has
   been silent till now, but now He comes into the foreground. "The Lord
   rebuke you Satan! The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this
   not a log plucked from the fire?" Take note that this rebuke comes at
   the right season. When Satan accuses, Christ pleads. He does not wait
   till the case has gone against us and then expresses His regret, but He
   is always a very present help in time of trouble.

   He knows the heart of Satan, being Omniscient God. And long before
   Satan can accuse He puts in the blessed plea on our behalf and delays
   the action till He gives an answer which silences forever every
   accusation. Do not think, Christian, that there will ever come a night
   so dark that there will be no light shining for you in it, or that
   Satan will be able to surprise the Savior and take you by storm! In the
   nick of time Christ will be sure to be your help. Observe that this
   rebuke also came from the very highest authority. He says, "Jehovah
   rebuke you, Satan." Christ does not merely rebuke Satan Himself, but He
   prays the Lord to do it.

   The eternal God, who is full of justice, says to the accuser, "I have
   justified, why do you accuse? I accepted My own dear Son in the place
   of the poor sinner with the filthy garments on--why do you accuse?"
   That is a joyous utterance of the Apostle, "Who shall lay anything to
   the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies." If God justifies,
   that very act is a rebuke to all the accusations of the false Fiend!
   Courage, Christian! The Voice which silenced your cruel foe is the
   Voice that rolls the stars along--against which nothing can stand.

   You must not fail to observe, however, that this rebuke was founded
   upon electing love. You that deny the doctrine of election come here
   and read this verse--"Jehovah rebuke you, Satan! Even Jehovah who has
   chosen Jerusalem rebuke you!" If God has chosen His people, then it is
   of no use for Satan to attempt their overthrow. Christ does not here
   meet Satan with any, "ifs," "ands," 'buts," nor "perhapses." He does
   not meet him with those truths which are merely matters of experience
   and about which there may be a question--He meets him with the high
   mysterious Truth of God which was settled before the world was--He
   throws, as it were, this chain into his teeth and bids him champ that
   till he breaks his teeth. "God has chosen Jerusalem!" Let that be
   rebuke enough.

   I think your experience will bear out what I now say--that it is all
   very well to live on spoon victuals and on milk when you have no trials
   and troubles. But if it ever comes to a pinch between your soul and
   sin--if you are in the deep waters of conscious sinfulness and Satan is
   accusing you--nothing will do for your soul to meet the adversary with
   but the doctrines of Sovereign Grace. You may be an Arminian in the
   summer, but you must be a Calvinist in the roaring winds of winter.
   Arminianism is a very pretty sort of theology for a painted boat upon a
   glassy lake. But they that do business on deep waters, and weather
   storms and hurricanes must have a good substantial boat of everlasting
   immutable love! Otherwise, if the vessel is not staunchly and well
   built--its tacklings will become loose--and they cannot strengthen
   their mast and the vessel will drive upon the quicksands.

   Beloved, in my spiritual building I want to get more and more onto the
   rock, immediately on the rock. I know I am told that the rock does not
   yield a harvest--that election is not a practical truth--but after all,
   if I want a house built, let me have it on the rock, for if it does not
   yield me any present practical results, yet I must have some comfort--I
   must have some place to dwell in the storm! I can go out to other
   fields to sow my corn and reap my harvest, but for my everlasting
   confidence I want a rock.

   Rest assured that the doctrines commonly called Calvinistic are the
   only doctrines that can shut the mouths of devils and fill the mouths
   of saints in the day of famine and in the time of extremity. "The Lord
   who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you!" When I am bowed down under sin,
   next to my Bible I love such books as "Elisha Coles on Divine
   Sovereignty," or "Dr. Crisp's Sermons." Albeit that they do not contain
   all the Truth of God, yet they teach very clearly that part of it which
   a troubled spirit needs. Does eternal love ordain sinners to eternal
   life irrespective of their works? Does the Lord absolutely, out of
   sovereign mercy, make men to be His children? Did God choose the chief
   of sinners and does He ever cast them away?

   Does He say, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy"? Does He
   declare that He is absolutely justified in doing whatever He wills with
   His own? Does He, on such terms as that, choose me? Then blessed be His
   name--such an election as this just suits my case! And I find that
   believing the doctrine in that light I can say to all my doubts and
   fears, "Jehovah who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you!" The rebuke is
   forcibly applicable to the case in hand. He says, "Is this not a log
   plucked from the fire." Satan says, "The man's garments are filthy!"
   "Well," says Jesus, "how do you expect them to be otherwise? When you
   pull a log out of the fire, do you expect to find it milk-white or
   polished?"

   No, it had begun to crack and burn and though you have plucked it out
   of the fire, it is, in itself, still black and charred. So it is with
   the child of God. What is he at his best? Till he is taken up to
   Heaven, he is nothing but a log plucked out of the fire. It is his
   daily moan that he is a sinner. But Christ accepts him as he is--and He
   shuts the devil's mouth by telling him, "You say this man is black--of
   course he is--what did I think he was but that? He is a log plucked out
   of the fire!

   "I plucked him out of it. He was burning when he was in it--he is black
   now he is out of it. He was what I knew he would be--he is not what I
   mean to make him--but he is what I knew he would be. I have chosen him
   as a log plucked out of the fire. What have you to say to that?"
   Observe that this plea did not require a single word to be added to it
   from Joshua. If you look, Joshua did not say a solitary word. This so
   silenced the devil that he was speechless. How often Satan has been
   nonplussed! He has made up a very pretty case against us--he has caught
   us in our worst moments and he has thought, "I will sift him like wheat
   in my sieve."

   His plans would have succeeded, but there was a "but" in his way--(an
   unfortunate "but" for him, but a blessed "but" for us)! "But I have
   prayed for you that your faith fail not." Satan is something like
   Haman. What an admirable plot Haman had laid for the destruction of
   Mordecai and the Jews! Yes, but there was one little thing which he had
   not reckoned on--the Jews had a friend at court who lay in the bosom of
   the king. And so Satan has often a scheme for the destruction of God's
   people, but there is one thing which frustrates him, namely, that they
   have a dear Friend at Court who lies in the bosom of the Eternal King
   and who pleads for them! And while He is there poor Joshua shall never
   fail, for the great Joshua, even Jesus his near kinsman, says, "The
   Lord rebuke you Satan! The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is
   this not a log plucked out of the fire?"

   IV. We have not yet entered into the soul of our text, but here it
   is--A MATCHLESS DEED OF GRACE. Thus said the Angel, "take away the
   filthy garments from him." Here is a picture of sin removed. Do you not
   think you see him? They have taken off his vestments, every single
   piece of the robe which was too defiled for him to wear has been taken
   away and there he stands! And as the Angel looks at him He sees the
   man's nakedness, but He cannot see any defilement, for the filth is all
   gone!

   So is every pardoned sinner! So am I this morning--so are you, dear
   Brothers and Sisters. God has commanded, "Take away his filthy garments
   from him," and as easily as we take off filthy robes, so easily does
   God take away sin through the Atonement of Christ. There is more than
   that here. The Lord does not only take away the sin itself, but He
   takes away the consciousness of it. You feel as if you could not serve
   God because sin is heavy on you. Look to Jesus, the Covenant Angel.
   Hear Him say, "It is finished," and if you can but lay hold on Him, in
   a moment you will lose all sense of sin!

   You will know yourself to be a sinner, but at the same time you will
   feel that you are a blood-washed sinner--a sinner saved by Divine
   Grace! And your soul, with your Savior's garments on--made holy as the
   Holy One--will venture close to the Throne and stand there unabashed.
   That is a delightful sentence where Paul speaks of "having our
   conscience purged from dead works." Not merely having the dead works
   forgiven, but having the conscience purged of them so that you have no
   more conscience of sin. Sin is gone! You do not stand, now, in God's
   sight as a sinner, but as one who is perfect in Christ Jesus! You have
   not a sin in God's book against you--you are absolved. Christ has said
   it, "Your sins, which are many, are forgiven you."

   You have an admirable picture of this in Joshua's losing his filthy
   garments. Nor was this all. The order was now given to clothe him--"I
   will clothe you with rich robes." Christ has performed complete
   obedience to the Divine Law. He had no need to do this for Himself, but
   He did it for His people. What He did is ours. The perfect obedience of
   Christ is imputed to every Believer! We wrap ourselves about with the
   garments of Christ, just as Jacob put on the robes of his brother Esau.
   And our Father gives us the blessing, because He finds us in our
   brother's clothes. Oh, this is gracious, because all the righteousness
   you and I could ever have if we had been perfect would only have been
   human--but this is Divine!

   Christ is the Lord our Righteousness and we are sumptuously arrayed in
   His seamless robe. Here let me remark that this is matter of
   experience, too, for the Believer gets to feel that he can now minister
   before God without trembling, because he wears Christ's garments. Oh,
   how delightful it is to preach dressed in the robes of Christ, or to
   pray when you feel you have Christ's vestments on! Oh, how fair a thing
   it is to minister at God's altar when you know that you are dressed in
   the white linen, the righteousness of Christ--so clean that even God's
   all-seeing eyes cannot detect so much as a spot or blemish on it.

   Pure, lovely, beautiful--without blemish from head to foot in the sight
   of God is every justified soul! Oh, Christian, never be satisfied
   unless you know this and live in the constant enjoyment of it. Notice
   one more thing and I will not keep you longer. The Prophet was so
   astonished to see the alteration which had taken place in Joshua
   dressed out in his new and sumptuous apparel that he broke in upon the
   vision, and spoke, himself! "And I said, Let them put a clean turban
   upon his head." I do not know what business Zechariah had to speak, but
   truly, if I had seen the vision, I must have done the same.

   Gazing through my tears, seeing the Lord's people thus transformed from
   filthiness to cleanliness and from shame to beauty, I think I should
   have said, "Now, Lord, finish the work. Make that servant of Yours to
   serve You. As he is perfectly clothed, now, Lord, put on the miter and
   make him fit to do your work." Some of God's people appear to me to
   forget this. They get as far as imputed righteousness and believe
   themselves to be accepted in the Beloved. There they are, content to
   tarry. But, ah, my soul desires even to say, "Lord, put a fair miter on
   the head of every one of Your saved ones."

   Some of you, I trust, are saved, but then how little you do for Christ!
   My prayer shall be for you--"Lord, put the miter on their heads! Make
   them priests--they ought to be such. You have washed them, cleansed
   them and clothed them on purpose that they may be such--but they have
   laid aside their miter--Lord, put it on their heads." I pray that you
   may have it on your head today! That you may in your family! In the
   Sunday school! Tomorrow in your business--in the street and in the
   shop! Go forth wearing the miter--ordained to be true priests unto God
   and exercising your functions! Do not lay aside your office! Some act
   with their miters as our kings and queens do with their crowns--they
   only put them on upon State occasions--they do not always wear them
   because they are too heavy.

   Oh Christian, your State occasion should be always! You are always dear
   to Christ and always near the Father's heart. Never take your miter
   off! Believers, put it on and go forth from this time forth praising
   and blessing the Covenant Angel who, in Jehovah's name, has taken away
   your filthy garments and who still stands by! I like that closing
   sentence--"And the angel of the Lord stood by." Oh, yes, we want Him
   always to stand by! When you have your new garments on, when you wear
   your miter, you still need His Presence. "Abide with us," must be our
   daily prayer. We still need His strength, His comfort, His smile--the
   help of His arm, the light of His countenance--for if we have Him not,
   we shall soon slip from our steadfastness and have reason to stand
   again, like Joshua, with filthy garments on.

   I have thus preached after a very feeble sort to God's people. There is
   this voice to sinners. Your case is like that of Joshua at first--for
   you have filthy garments on. Do not try to wash them. Nothing is said
   here about washing the garments, not a word! Do not try to make those
   old rags any better--there is nothing said about stitching or mending.
   Just confess that they are too bad to be mended, too filthy to be
   washed, and turn your eyes to Christ, the wounded Sufferer, and ask Him
   this morning to speak the word--"Take away the filthy garments from
   him. Clothe him with a change of raiment."

   I tell you, Sinner, what He did for Joshua, He will do for you! Oh seek
   His face and live! God help you to seek it and to find it this very
   morning and He shall have the praise forever and ever. Amen.

                       Jesus Washing His Disciples' Feet

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JANUARY 29, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Then He came to Simon Peter: and Peter said unto Him, Lord, do You
   wash my feet?" John 13:6.

   OUR Savior had so steadfastly set His face towards the awful sufferings
   of His passion that when they actually approached He was not in the
   slightest degree disturbed or disconcerted. If you were perfectly aware
   that tomorrow morning, after a night of terrible agony, you would be
   led forth to a cruel and ignominious death you would probably feel like
   men distracted with terrible apprehensions. At any rate, if through
   Divine Grace you were able to be calm and peaceful, your mind would
   scarcely be in a fit state to minister consolation to others, or to
   conceive new methods of instruction for your friends.

   But behold your Lord and Master! It is eventide of the same night in
   which He was betrayed. He foreknows that the bloody sweat within an
   hour or two will crimson all His flesh. He is well aware that he who is
   eating bread with Him will that night betray Him. He foresees that He
   must feel the Roman scourge and be the victim of Jewish slander. He
   knows right well that He must bear all the wrath of God on the behalf
   of His people. And yet He sits at supper. He feasts as if no unusual
   cloud were lowering. And when the supper is over His inventive mind is
   fully at work with admirable plans of instruction for His disciples and
   among the rest He takes off His upper garment.

   He wraps Himself about the loins with a towel. He goes to them as they
   are reclining at full length around the table and coming behind them He
   begins to wash the feet of first one, and then another! What blessed
   calmness of mind! What hallowed serenity of spirit! O that our hearts
   were equally fixed on God in our days of trial and grief! Without
   question we may go further and take most solemn notice that there was
   in the near approach of death a joy in Jesus' heart into which no
   stranger could enter.

   Now was about to be accomplished that which He had longed for. Did He
   not say, "I have a Baptism to be baptized with and how am I straitened
   till it is accomplished. With desire have I desired to eat this
   Passover with you before I die"? Did this account for His giving out a
   hymn of praise on that doleful night? "After supper they sang a hymn."
   Did that account for His adding these remarkable words--"Now is the Son
   of Man glorified and God is glorified in Him"? Did His joy in the
   prospect of what He was about to accomplish for His people swell to the
   very highest just about the time when the fountains of the depths of
   His griefs were about to be broken up and His spirit to be flooded in
   agony as He cried, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death"?

   O to know His joy--the joy of loving even unto death! Let us come at
   once to the teaching of the Savior and let it be surrounded with an
   unusual interest because of the fact that it is His dying teaching. Let
   us see Him as He girds Himself with the towel, remembering that He was
   soon to be girt with the bands of death! Let us see Him, I say, with a
   more profound interest because He is just upon the verge of these
   terrible depths where all the waves and billows of Jehovah's justice
   dashed over Him.

   His sermon beginning, "Let not your heart be troubled," is His swan
   song. These are the last drops of His life that He is now spending--at
   the supper table you have the wine which He keeps until now. As we see
   Him washing His disciples' feet we shall discover choice love worthy of
   the last solemn hour of departure. We shall take the text in four ways.
   First here is matter for enquiry, "Lord, do You wash my feet?"
   Secondly, here is matter for admiration--"Lord, do You wash my feet?"
   Thirdly, here is matter for gratitude. Fourthly, here is matter for
   imitation.

   I. HERE IS MATTER FOR ENQUIRY. We know that the Savior washed the feet
   of Peter, but does He wash our feet, also? We do not expect, of course,
   the literal transaction to take place. But is there anything in the
   conduct of Christ now analogous to His washing Peter's feet when on
   earth? He has washed all Believers, once and for all, in His most
   precious blood.

   But of this we do not speak this morning. Cleansing, as before the bar
   of justice, is completely accomplished forever for all the chosen by
   the great blood-shedding upon Calvary. That is a matter of the past--a
   thing for which to bless God for all eternity. "We are clean, through
   Jesus' blood we are clean." But here is another kind of washing--not of
   the entire man, but of the feet only. Not with blood, but with
   water--not in the fountain filled from the Savior's veins--but in a
   basin filled with water. Does our Lord Jesus do anything of this kind
   now? Doe He do anything so humbling to Himself and yet so needful for
   us?

   We answer, yes, He does. And, first, does not the Savior perform an
   action parallel with this when He watches over the temporal affairs of
   His people? You know, Beloved, that not a hair of your head falls to
   the ground without His care. In all your afflictions He is afflicted,
   and as the Angel of God's Presence, He saves you and carries you. Your
   most trifling trouble may be taken in prayer to Christ and spread
   before Him with as much certainty of deliverance as when Hezekiah
   spread Sennacherib's letter before the Lord--for Jesus waits to be
   gracious to His own. In every transaction we should adore the
   providential care of our great Shepherd and Friend for the government
   is upon His shoulders.

   Now, when Jesus thus superintends your mean affairs, looks to your
   family troubles and bears your household cares, saying unto you, "Cast
   all your care on Me, for I care for you," is He not, in effect, doing
   for you what He did for Peter? Is He not washing your feet--for He is
   caring for your lowest part and minding the poor dust-stained body. O
   King of Glory, the stars would not make a crown worthy of You! The
   tempest is but a poor chariot for Your Glory and the winds are but slow
   coursers to be harnessed to Your cart. And yet You stoop from all this
   greatness to observe man, who is less than a worm! To observe me--less
   than the least of all Your saints--and to care for me as a mother cares
   for her child!

   It is even so! He does do it--He does, in this sense, wash His people's
   feet! When Jesus Christ puts away from us day by day our daily
   infirmities and sins, does He not wash our feet? Last night, when you
   bowed the knee, you could not help confessing that there had been much
   in the week's transactions which was not worthy of your standing and
   profession. And even tonight, when the engagements of this day are
   over, you will have to mourn that you foolishly committed the very sins
   which you repented of weeks ago.

   You will have to admit that you have fallen again into the very sloughs
   of folly and sin from which special Grace delivered you long ago. And
   yet Jesus Christ will have great patience with you! He will hear your
   confession of sin! He will say, "I will, be you clean." He will again
   apply the blood of sprinkling--He will speak peace to your conscience
   and remove every spot. Oh, it is a great act of eternal love when
   Christ, once and for all absolves the sinner, takes him from under the
   dominion of the Law and puts him into the family of God! But what
   long-suffering and patience there is when the Savior, with much
   long-suffering, bears the daily follies of the recipient of so much
   mercy! Day by day and hour by hour He puts away the constant sin of the
   erring but yet beloved child!

   To dry up a flood of sin is something marvelous--but to endure the
   constant dropping of daily sins--to bear with that constant weary
   trying of patience, this is Divine, indeed! To blot out the whole of
   sin like a thick cloud is a great and matchless power, as well as
   Grace--but to remove the mist of every morning and the damp of every
   night--oh, this is condescension! I wish I could describe it--it is
   condescension well imaged in the washing of Peter's feet. Consider
   again. Our poor prayers which are very much the feet of our soul--since
   with them we climb to Heaven, with them we run after God--our poor
   prayers always need washing!

   It is oftentimes easier, Brothers and Sisters, to do a thing over at
   once than it is to mend and patch up a work which has been badly done
   by others. Then what patience it must require in Christ's case to take
   my poor, imperfect and polluted prayers and make them fit to be
   presented before His Father's face! There are His own prayers for me--I
   thank Him for them--for they prevail. But I cannot help also blessing
   Him that He should take my prayers and put them into the censer and
   offer them before His Father's face--for I am certain that before they
   can have been fit to offer they must have experienced a deal of
   washing.

   John tells us that He offers "the prayers of saints"--this is humbling
   Himself, indeed! Oh, how much of redundancy must have been taken away
   from our petitions when we have asked for what we ought not to have
   desired! How much of omission must have been made up when we have
   forgotten to ask for the things which we most needed! How much of
   unbelief He must take out of our prayers! How much coldness, deadness
   of heart! How much formality, wandering of thought! O how much holy
   life and unction, holy faith and holy joy, must the dear Redeemer
   infuse into our supplications before they are fit to come up before the
   ears of the Lord God of Hosts! Yes, in patiently bearing with my
   prayers He does daily wash my feet.

   Think again. Jesus makes our works acceptable. These may be compared to
   the soul's feet. It is by the feet that a man expresses his
   activity--the walk of a Christian--by this we mean the good works which
   the Christian performs for his Master. But look at our works! If Christ
   would simply throw all our good works into a heap and let them rot,
   that would be most deserving of them. If He would take our almsgiving,
   our preaching, our teaching of others, our prayers and thoughts and
   works all together and just cast them into Tophet's fire--how dare we
   complain? But instead of that He is not unrighteous to forget our work
   of faith and labor of love, but counts that here His Father is
   glorified in that we bear much fruit.

   We remember to have heard of someone who made sugar out of old rags.
   But then it was found that the sugar cost a great deal more than the
   sugar was worth. The manufacture cost was more than the goods were
   worth when produced. And judging from our point of view, this is
   something like our works. Jesus Christ makes sweetness out of the poor
   rags of our good works--surely I may say they cost Him more in the
   manufacturing than ever the raw material could have been worth, or the
   finished works themselves are worth, except in His esteem. Could He
   not, if He pleased, convert men without our preaching? But He will not
   do it! He would rather that they should be brought in by our imperfect
   preaching and therefore He washes our preaching--He washes our feet!

   Could He not save sinners without you, my Sister--without you, my
   Brother? And yet He sets you longing after souls and opens your mouth
   to speak a good word to them. And He accepts what you do! But oh, what
   condescension is there! What tenderness, what Divine stooping from His
   loftiness, that He should cleanse our works! It is more than He ever
   did for angels! When an angel had defiled his service, He banished him
   from Heaven. But with all the imperfection of our service, we expect
   that in Christ we shall be welcomed into Heaven with the words, "Well
   done, good and faithful servant."

   If you want other instances of the familiar condescension of Christ,
   let me remind you of how patiently He is content to suffer in His
   people's sufferings. Not a pang shoots through that head of yours but
   Jesus knows and feels it! Not a grief makes that bosom heave in which
   Christ is not a partaker. "I will make all their bed in their
   sickness." Oh, what a blessed text is that! As one old expositor says,
   "Not merely make their pillow, but their bolster and their bed and make
   all their bed, where their feet lie, where their head lies. All, all of
   it. I will come and I will have such sympathy with them in their entire
   grief, that from the beginning to the end of it I will make them happy
   in the midst of grief through My Divine consolations." "I will make all
   their bed in their sickness."

   Have you not had choice manifestations from Christ in your worst
   seasons--so exactly fitted to the peculiarity of your case--that you
   did not know which to admire most, the love which visited you, or the
   condescending care which so brought itself down to your case? He sat
   down at your bedside and put His loving care so entirely into your
   position that it felt as you felt and speak to you just the words which
   your case required. The Lord Jesus loves His people so, that every day
   He is washing their feet! Their poorest action He accepts. Their
   deepest sorrow He feels. Their smallest wish He hears and their
   greatest sin He forgives. He is still their servant as well as their
   friend--still He takes the basin--still He wears the towel.

   It is not only majestic deeds that He performs--as wearing the miter on
   His brow and the precious jewels glittering on His breastplate! He
   stands up to plead humbly, patiently--like a servant He goes about
   among His people--washing His disciples' feet. I would to God I could
   speak worthily on such a theme as this! But it is true, as your
   experience must tell you, that, "He remembers our low estate, for His
   mercy endures forever." Before I pass from this point, it is a matter
   of enquiry for some here--"Lord, do You wash my feet?" Some of you are
   not washed by Christ, for you live without thinking of Him. "I never
   did any harm," says one, "that I know of." I will ask you another
   question--what did you ever do for Christ? Can you answer that? You
   must reply "I have done nothing for Him whatever."

   Ah, then, if you have never been enabled to do anything for Him, I fear
   it is because you have lived thoughtlessly, without a care for Him.
   But, if He had ever washed your feet, you could not forget Him. And
   little as it might be, yet you would have done something and you would
   now be desiring to do more. Ah, my Hearers, some of you are so far from
   ever having your feet washed daily that you have never been washed at
   all! "There is a fountain filled with blood," but filled in vain, as
   far as you are concerned. There is a Savior, but you are unsaved. There
   is balm in Gilead, but you are not healed. There is a Physician there,
   but you are still sick! There is life in Christ, but you are dead!

   The bronze serpent is lifted up but you are dying of the fiery
   serpent's bite. One look at Jesus will save--but that look you have not
   given--you are without God, without Christ, without hope and "strangers
   from the commonwealth of Israel." May God the Holy Spirit visit you
   with His quickening power and convince you of your sin this morning!
   May He make you feel uneasy till you find Christ! May He give you a
   hunger and a thirst after Him that will never be satisfied till you
   clasp Him in your arms and say, "Christ is mine!"

   I would to God that I had not to make this remark, but I must make it
   in faithfulness to your souls. You are obliged to answer, "No, no, no.
   The Lord Jesus has never washed my feet." But then send up the prayer,
   "Lord, do it! Lord, do it now for Your love's sake."

   II. Our text is, in the second place, MATTER FOR ADMIRATION and that,
   too, in several respects. It is matter for admiration when we consider
   the freeness of the deed. "Lord, do You wash my feet?" It is perfectly
   wonderful that He should, for we have scarcely desired the mercy. If
   you look the chapter through, you do not find that Peter asked Christ
   to do it. Peter was lying down--he had just been eating at the
   supper--he had no thought of Christ's washing his feet!

   There was not one of the twelve that ever dreamed of such a thing! And
   when the Lord began to wash the feet of one, the others did not say,
   "Lord, come and do the same to me." No, it was unsolicited, unexpected!
   He comes, without any prayers or supplications on their part and He
   begins to wash their feet. Peter is surprised. It is great goodness on
   Christ's part to do what we ask Him to do--to hear our prayers when we
   really feel our need. But does He perform for us such menial, such
   generous acts, as to wash our feet without being asked?

   Oh, Beloved, if Christ did no more for us than we ask Him to do, we
   should perish forever! For nine out of ten of the things which He gives
   us, we never asked for! And what if I were to say that three out of
   four of them we scarcely know that we want? We do not know our own
   needs! We have a general view of our necessities, wholesale, as it
   were--but our daily needs, our daily wants--who among us can know them?
   Christ's sufferings are said, according to the Greek Liturgy, to have
   had unknown depths--"Your unknown sufferings." Were not those unknown
   sufferings endured for our unknown sins and to make a supply for our
   unknown wants--that we might have that multitude of mercies which we
   may style unknown mercies?

   We should not only bless God for the mercies which we have known, but
   for those which we have not known--for probably those make up the
   larger proportion. You that are Christians, some of you who have been
   believers in Christ ten or twenty years--have there not been many
   nights on which you have gone to bed without any particular sense of
   guilt and without any special intercession for peculiar cleansing? You
   have forgotten to ask for the cleansing, but He has never forgotten to
   give it! He has spontaneously washed your feet! You have risen in the
   morning--you were not aware that any special danger would come to you
   and you did not pray for special protection--but yet He knew it. And
   unasked and unsought for He has followed you, held the shield over you
   and kept you from danger.

   He has washed your feet without your having desired it, or having known
   that He had done it! Let His name be praised for this. These unsought
   favors of unspeakable love, these perpetual mercies of unslumbering
   carefulness--let them wake us now to gratitude and now may we exclaim
   with wonder, "Lord, is it so? Do You always continue thus to wash my
   feet?"

   The next subject of wonder is the Glory of the Person. "Lord! King!
   Master! God! Everlasting! Eternal! Almighty! King of Kings and Lord of
   Lords! Do you--do YOU wash my feet? You call the stars by their names
   and they shine by Your light! Mazzaroth comes forth in his season at
   Your bidding! You guide Arcturus with his sons! The heavens are Yours!
   The earth also is Yours! You sit upon the circle of the heavens and the
   inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers-- You hold the waters in the
   hollow of Your hand, You mete out Heaven with Your span--Lord, do You
   wash my feet?

   When You were on earth You tread the waters--the depths knew You and
   were like marble beneath Your feet. You frightened grim Death himself,
   for Lazarus came forth at Your bidding from the shades of the grave!
   Fevers knew You-- leprosy, paralysis, epilepsy--all diseases understood
   their Master's voice and fled at Your bidding. The winds were hushed at
   Your will--even the devils were subject to You! Though You were veiled
   in manhood Your creatures perceived Your greatness! Angels ministered
   unto You and the heavens were opened unto You. And do You wash my feet?

   my Brothers and Sisters, meditate on this! It is far more a theme for
   thought than for speech. He whom the angels worship takes a towel and
   girds Himself! Hark to the song, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of
   Sabaoth! Heaven and earth are full of the majesty of Your Glory. All
   the earth does worship You, You eternal Son of the Father." "Lord, do
   You wash my feet?" Oh, think of this, spiritual men and women! Think
   till your hearts melt with love! No one else could cleanse us. The
   infinite God must take away the infinite blackness and filth of His
   people's sins! What a stoop is here!

   Let us lift up our eyes and wonder! Let us lift up our voices and
   praise His name that He should ever wash our feet! Change again the
   word. Observe the lowliness of the office. "Lord, do You wash my feet?"
   Here comes a traveler who has journeyed far. He is very weary. There is
   much dust upon his sandals and his feet are stained with travel. As
   soon as he treads the threshold of the hospitable house--a black slave,
   a servant, a hired servant--takes off his sandals, brings a basin, a
   pitcher full of water and begins to pour the water upon his feet,
   having first unloosed the latchets of his shoes and taken them off.

   The host does not stoop to this office! It is not the part of a master
   to wash feet! It is servile, menial, humiliating work. Yet this, which
   was the lowest of all offices in the East, is that which the Savior
   undertakes! Not in fiction and metaphor, but in reality, for every one
   of us! "Lord, do You wash my feet? To wash my head, Lord, is very
   gracious. To purge my mind from evil thoughts is very loving. To wash
   my hands, to take my heart and make that clean is very
   conde-scending--but do You absolutely do a slave's work and wash my
   feet? Lord, will You take the meanest part of me and wash that? I know
   You have said You will sanctify my spirit and my soul--there is much
   there--but will You sanctify my body, too? My feet, the lowest part of
   the man, the meanest part? Are You not content to leave spot or wrinkle
   upon me anywhere and therefore do You humble Yourself to the meanest,
   basest, lowest action of all--to wash my feet?"

   Truly, Beloved, this is subject of wonder! And yet the wonder is
   excelled if you remember that He shared a slave's death, as well as a
   slave's life. A slave's life--when He washed our feet! A slave's
   death--when they sold Him for thirty pieces of silver and afterwards
   pierced His hands and His feet. I put this deed of love in contrast.
   Conceive Him now in the highest heavens, with the keys of Heaven and
   earth and Hell swinging at His side. He is holding the silver scepter
   by which He governs all creation--can you imagine Him as every knee
   bows and every tongue confesses that He is Lord to the glory of God the
   Father? And yet He, that same One, comes down from the grandeur of
   Heaven and the splendor of infinite honor and He washes, absolutely
   washes, in a slave's garb and after a menial manner, the feet of His
   disciples!

   Oh, that we felt a tender admiration worthy of this miracle of love!
   Once again, there is a note of wonder if you lay the stress upon the
   word "my"--"Lord, do you wash my feet?" Perhaps to some of you this
   will be the greatest marvel of all--the unworthiness of the object of
   this washing. "Do you wash my feet?" You have favored me with more
   mercies than the most of men! You have overwhelmed me with Your
   bounties. And yet my heart is hard towards You--I am often unbelieving,
   forgetful, slothful, careless. You might well cast me away forever!
   Because of my ingratitude You might well say, "Depart, I will have no
   more to do with you--I have had enough of patience. I cannot endure
   your ill manners!" Yet do You, Lord, absolutely condescend to wash my
   feet?

   "Here You have displayed Yourself more gloriously than ever--Your Grace
   has out-Graced itself." Thus would the preacher speak and he thinks he
   hears you follow him. "Lord," you say, "I once cursed You to Your face.
   There was a time when Your holy day was my best day of business--when
   Your House was a place which I abhorred! Your Book was unread. My knee
   was never bent to You--I boasted of my own righteousness! I was a
   sinner black and filthy--and do You wash my feet?!"

   1 hear a Sister, with peculiar tenderness, say, "O Jesus, I would
   gladly wash Your feet with my tears and wipe them with the hair of my
   head, for I have been a sinner. And do You wash my feet?!" I think I
   hear another say, "Lord, I once denied You. I made a profession of Your
   faith, but in an evil hour I fell. I went into sin. I said, "I know not
   the Man!" And do You wash my feet?! I hear another say, "Lord, You know
   my private sins, my secret vices. I dare not tell into the ear of my
   fellow creature the faults into which I have fallen! I am only fit to
   be firewood in Hell-fire. There is nothing in me but what is not
   damnable! I am altogether as an unclean thing! And do You wash my
   feet?!"

   Oh, you that are the people of God, cannot you all find some special
   reason for wonder at this? There are some of you who are so poor that
   even some of your own Christian brethren are wicked enough to be half
   ashamed to own you! Yet Jesus Christ washes your feet! Your clothes
   would not sell for sixpence and yet He washes your feet! You scarcely
   have enough shoe leather to keep your feet from the cold and yet He
   washes them! You have been laughed at and despised and ridiculed and
   yet you have Christ to wash your feet!

   The moment your name is mentioned there are some ready at once to
   slander you and abuse you--yet so tenderly does Jesus love you that He
   washes your foulest part. However, I must leave you to think--for I
   cannot talk--I must leave you to think on such a precious passage as
   this. Certainly the angels of Heaven will never leave off wondering how
   it can be that their King, their Prince, their Leader, could so humble
   Himself as to become a Servant of servants--to take the very meanest of
   His people and declare that He will wash their feet--yes, and do it,
   too.

   One more subject for wonder. It is perfectly marvelous to remember that
   Christ does so completely wash our feet. "Do You wash my feet, Lord?
   Then there cannot be any filth on them. Do You wash my feet? Then they
   must be clean. It cannot be that You could wash and yet filth remain."
   When things are washed by careless servants, they need washing
   again--but when they are washed by the loving hands of Jesus--washed by
   Him who made Heaven and earth, surely they cannot be badly done! Come,
   then, you that feel you have been sinning the last week--you that are
   God's people, you that are resting on Christ but have a sense of guilt
   upon your consciences and cannot get rid of it and are sighing and
   crying--ask this question, "Lord, do You wash my feet? Then I will come
   to You. I will come with my feet all filthy if there is such a bath as
   this to be washed in.

   "If my sins are returned to me and appear to remain upon my conscience,
   if You wait, still, to wash me from present guilt and present
   depravity, then here I am--as at the first I came, I come
   again--nothing but Your merit do I rely upon! Nothing but Your love is
   my confidence! I give myself up to You--take me as I am and wash me
   clean." I say it is a subject for admiration, how thoroughly clean
   Christ does wash His people, so that they can really cry, "There is no
   spot nor wrinkle, nor any such thing, even upon my feet! I shall be
   presented holy, unblamable and unreproveable in the sight of God,
   through Jesus Christ my Lord."

   III. Now we will turn from admiration to what may be more practical--to
   GRATITUDE. I hope we already feel that Heaven-born flame glowing in our
   souls. Here is matter for gratitude, then. I heard the other day of a
   meeting for prayer at which my dear Brother Offord--who so marvelously
   made confession of sin at our great Prayer Meeting in the first week of
   January--was moved to make another confession. And he did so in such a
   manner that the whole assembly was moved and there were audible sobs
   and cries from God's people while they confessed their transgressions.

   No sooner had he done so, than some Brother, wise above what is
   written, rose in the assembly and said he thanked God he could not join
   in the confession--his sins were all forgiven him and therefore he had
   no sins to confess! He stood before God so accepted in Christ that he
   had no sins whatever to make confession of. His prayer went far to
   spoil the meeting and to grieve the people of God!

   I do occasionally meet with erring Brethren, who say, "I never make any
   confession of sin." "I have prayed for months," said one to me, "and I
   have never made any confession of sin. I believe all my sins are
   forgiven and I have none to confess." Now, at the very first mention of
   this, do you not feel shocked? The holy sensibilities of a child of God
   suffer violence from the very thought of such absence of repentance! I
   should have been surprised if I did not hold myself prepared to hear
   any monstrosity from persons tinctured with the gall of Plymouth
   Brethrenism. Concerning that sect, much as I love and respect many of
   its members, I dare not say less than this--that God alone knows what
   they will teach tomorrow!

   They seem to be given up to the inventions of their own vainglorious
   minds to concoct and devise delusions without number. They have one
   mark of the Babylon which they profess to abhor--for mystery is written
   on their very brow. I pray God to keep our young people from their
   company, for their professions and pretences are such as might, if it
   were possible, deceive the very elect! Gracious men I grant them to be,
   but as to doctrine as mad as March hares and as perverse us bullocks
   unaccustomed to the yoke! When I first heard this doctrine of not
   confessing sins, I was startled. I felt as if I could have no more
   communion with a man who could talk in that way. Go on your knees and
   not confess sin? My dear Friends, I hope to die with this upon my lips,
   "I have gone astray like a lost sheep. Seek Your servant, for I do not
   forget Your Commandments."

   I hold that I shall be out of Christ altogether when I reject
   repentance and confession. I know that my sins are forgiven me! There
   is no man in the world who preaches more than I do the doctrine that
   Christ has forever made a full atonement for the sins of all His
   people! But as to not making a confession of sin, God forbid these lips
   should ever utter anything so unGospel-like, so un-Christlike! Let us
   put this matter before you plainly. It is quite certain that those whom
   Christ has washed in His precious blood need not make a confession of
   sin as before God the Judge because they are no longer under God as
   Judge. They are not ruled and governed upon the principle of Law at
   all. Christ has forever taken away all their sins in a legal sense so
   that no one can bring anything to their charge and they need not
   confess where there is no one to accuse.

   The blood of Jesus has set His people entirely away from the position
   of prisoners under the Law. They do not stand where they can be
   condemned. They are no longer culprits or criminals. They are taken
   from under the dominion of the Judge. But what are God's people? Why
   they are children and as long as God is their Father and they are
   children, and imperfect children, nature teaches them that it is the
   duty of children to make a confession to their Father. If my boy should
   do anything amiss--God forbid it ever should be--but suppose it were
   some petty theft, I might say, "My Child, as far as that theft is
   concerned, no policeman shall take you. You shall not be taken before
   the bar or put in prison for that. You are quite forgiven as far as
   that is concerned."

   I do not wish him to go before the magistrate and make a
   confession--but then he has offended me, his father. And I, as his
   father, expect him to confess the wrong that he has done to me and if
   he does not, I chasten him, not by way of penal infliction--that is not
   my part as a father, I have nothing to do with penalties to my
   children--but by way of chastisement that he may be led to see his
   fault, and may do it no more. No father who has his wits about him ever
   chastens his child in the light of punishment for the offense itself.
   No, he says, that is not my business--the offense must be punished by
   God, or if it is an offense against the law of the land, by the law of
   the land. When a father scourges, he does it for chastisement--for the
   good of the person chastised--not as a vindication of law and order.

   Now the Lord never chastens His people because of any sin in them in
   order to punish them for their sin--He has punished Christ instead of
   them--they are quite clear there. But now having become children, and
   offending as children, ought they not every day to go before their
   heavenly Father and confess the sin and acknowledge the iniquity? The
   Divine Grace of God in the heart would teach us all that it should be
   so. We daily offend as children. We offend, as we could not offend if
   we were not children. I doubt my Father--I am guilty of a want of love
   to Him, or obedience to Him. I offend as I could not offend if I were
   not His child.

   Supposing that this offense against my Father is not at once washed
   away by the cleansing power of the Lord Jesus-- what will be the
   consequence of it? Why I shall get under the thralldom of bad habit. I
   shall feel such defilement in my nature that I shall do it again and
   again and again--what I had once done--till I get into the habit of
   doing it. If I am not washed from these offenses against my Father, I
   shall feel at a distance from Him. I shall begin to doubt His love to
   me. I shall tremble at Him. Most likely I shall be afraid to pray to
   Him--I shall get to be like the prodigal, who, while he was a child,
   was yet far off from his father. If I am not washed, I shall very soon
   have need to feel the rod and I shall have it.

   But oh, Beloved, if the Lord Jesus Christ, day by day shall come to me
   and wash my feet from these defilements of offenses against my Father,
   why then I shall, to a great extent, escape the rod! I shall feel a
   holy love to my Father! I shall walk in the light of His countenance! I
   shall have joy and peace through believing and I shall go through my
   Christian career, not only as saved, but as one enjoying present peace
   in God through Jesus Christ my Lord! I think you can see the difference
   between Christ putting away sin by blood and by water. I think you can
   see the distinction between confessing sin as a culprit and confessing
   sin as a child. And I think you can see how much gratitude you owe to
   Christ, that after having once set you free from the Law, He, day by
   day, as your Elder Brother, goes in before your Father's face and still
   keeps you right before the Father.

   And when there has been any defilement, or any wrong, He washes your
   feet from it that you may still stand with peace in your conscience,
   with joy in your heart, with love in your bosom and with the Father's
   love shed abroad in you! Here is matter for gratitude--that having once
   washed head and hands and feet with blood--He still does daily wash my
   feet with water. For my part, I mean to keep on praying, "Forgive us
   our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us." And it
   shall always be my joy that, "if any man sin, we have an Advocate with
   the Father," and, "the blood of Jesus Christ, God's dear Son, cleanses
   us from all sin."

   IV. The last point is MATTER FOR IMITATION. Does Jesus wash our feet?
   Then we ought to wash one another's feet. Some of our Brethren, the
   Scotch Baptists, were accustomed to wash the saints' feet literally. I
   dare say it would not do some of the saints much harm. But still it
   never was intended for us to carry out literally the example of the
   Savior. There is a spiritual meaning here and what He means is this--if
   there is any deed of kindness or love that we can do for the very
   meanest and most obscure of God's people, we ought to be willing to do
   it--to be servants to God's servants-- to feel like Abigail did, when
   she said to David, "Let your handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of
   the servants of my Lord."

   Abigail became David's wife--that is the true position of every
   Christian--but yet she felt she was not worthy even to wash his
   servants' feet. That must be our spirit. Do you know any poor bedridden
   soul? Go and talk with that poor woman, or that poor man. Seek to take
   comfort to that poor man's miserable lodgings. Do you know a Brother
   who is rather angry in temper and he wants a kind word said to him and
   someone says, "I will not speak to any such person as he is?" Do it--do
   it, my dear Brothers and Sisters--go and wash his feet! Do you know one
   who has gone astray? Someone says, "I would not like to be seen in
   association with him." My dear Friend, you are spiritual--go and
   restore such an one in the spirit of meekness.

   Wash his feet! There is another riding the high horse--he is very, very
   proud. One says, "I am not going to humble myself to him." My dear
   Brother, go to him and wash his feet! Whenever there is a child of God
   who has any defilement upon him and you are able to point it out and
   rid him of it--submit to any degradation, put yourself in any
   position-- sooner than that child of God should be the subject of sin!
   Especially let those who are highest among us seek to do the lowest
   offices. "Whoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant."
   Remember that Christ's way of rising is to go down. He descended, that
   He might ascend. And so must we.

   Let us count that forevermore it is our highest honor and our greatest
   glory to lay aside all honor and all glory and to win honor and glory
   out of shame and humiliation for Christ Jesus' sake. I believe this is
   done in this Church. I hope we are as free as possible from the feeling
   of caste--God deliver us from the last relic and remnant of it! You are
   Brothers and Sisters in Christ! Love one another!

   "Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted--but the
   rich in that he is made low." You are Brothers and Sisters and one is
   your Master, even Christ. Try to carry out, every one of you to your
   utmost, the teaching of your Lord--that you should wash one another's
   feet. You have an opportunity of doing it in the collection--for I
   believe that these servants of God--these aged ministers, these
   ministers who are in great poverty--need today that you should, by your
   contributions, wash their feet.

                  The Strong One Driven Out By A Stronger One

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 5, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "When a strong man armed keeps his palace, his goods are in peace: but
   when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him, he takes
   from him all his armor wherein he trusted, and divides his spoils. He
   that is not with Me is against Me: and he that gathers not with Me
   scatters. When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks
   through dry places, seeking rest. And finding none, he says, I will
   return unto my house from where I came out. And when he comes, he finds
   it swept and garnished. Then goes he and takes to him seven other
   spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in and dwell there:
   and the last state of that man is worse than the first." Luke 11:21-26.

   THE Lord Jesus is ever in direct and open antagonism to Satan. "I will
   put enmity between you and the woman, between your seed and her seed,"
   has been most emphatically fulfilled. Christ has never tolerated any
   truce or parley with the Evil One and never will. Whenever Christ
   strikes a blow at Satan, it is a real blow and not a feint and is meant
   to destroy, not to amend. He never asks Satan's help to subdue
   Satan--never fights evil by evil--He uses the weapons which are not
   carnal, but mighty to the pulling down of strongholds. And He uses them
   ever with this intention--not to dally with Satan, but to cut up his
   empire, root and branch. "For this purpose the Son of God was
   manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil."

   There is a deadly, implacable, infinite, eternal hatred between Christ
   and that sin of which Satan is the representative. No compromise can
   ever be thought of, no quarter will ever be allowed. The Lord will
   never turn from His purpose to bruise Satan under His feet and to cast
   him into the lake of fire. Therefore there was nothing more libelous
   than the assertion of certain Pharisees in Christ's day that He cast
   out devils through Beelzebub, the Prince of devils! O base suggestion
   that the Lord of Glory was in league with the dunghill deity, the
   Prince of devils! He never fights the Lord's battles with the devil's
   weapons! He has not the most distant affiance with evil! It is not
   possible that He should be the friend and patron of that spirit of
   unhallowed charity which for the sake of peace would give tolerance to
   error.

   No, Christ never allies Himself with Satan to advance the kingdom of
   God. He comes against him as a strong man armed, determined to fight
   until He wins a decisive victory. We shall observe this more clearly as
   we open up the passage now before us. Our text presents us with a
   picture of man in his sinful state. Then it gives us a representation
   of man for a time reformed, but eventually subjected to the worst forms
   of evil. And it also shows us a graphic portrait of man, entirely
   conquered by the power of the great Redeemer.

   I. First, WE SHALL ATTENTIVELY LOOK AT THE PICTURE OF MAN AS HE IS IN A
   STATE OF NATURE. "When a strong man armed keeps his palace, his goods
   are in peace." Observe that although man's heart was intended to be the
   Throne of God, it has now become the palace of Satan--whereas Adam was
   the obedient servant of the Most High and his body was a temple for
   God's love, now, through the Fall, we have become the servants of sin
   and our bodies have become the workshops of Satan.

   "The spirit that now works in the children of disobedience." This
   spirit is called a strong man and truly so he is-- who can stand
   against him? Like the monster in the book of Job, we may say of him,
   "Lay your hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. Behold, the
   hope of him is in vain! Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of
   him?" Though a thousand Philistines are smitten hip and thigh with a
   great slaughter by Samson, the avenger of Israel, yet the strong man
   falls a victim to the stronger fiend.

   That mighty hero, though he could rend a lion, was no match for the
   lion of the pit who overcame him to his shame and hurt. Solomon, the
   wisest of men, was outwitted by Satan, for his heart was led astray by
   the arch-tempter. Even he who was the sire of men was overthrown by
   this dread enemy in the early days of innocence and happiness. He is so
   strong that if all of us should combine against him, Satan would laugh
   at us as Leviathan laughs at the shaking of the spear. Strong he is,
   not simply as possessing force, but in the sense of cunning. He knows
   how to adapt his temptations to our besetting sins. He discovers
   fitting times in which to assail us. He understands that there is a
   time when kings go forth to battle and he is ever ready for the fight.

   He is a good swordsman. He knows every cut and guard and thrust and
   parry and he knows our weak places and the joints in our harness.
   Christians who have ever stood foot to foot with him will give him
   credit for this--that he is strong, indeed. And unbelievers who have at
   any time sought to resist his power in their own strength have soon
   been made to feel that their strength was perfect weakness. He is a
   strong man with a vengeance! Oh, Christian, well is it for you that
   there is a stronger than he--the might of Satan would crush you to your
   ruin if it were not that the almighti-ness of Christ comes in to the
   rescue!

   It is said of this strong man, moreover, that he is armed. Truly the
   Prince of the power of the air is never without weapons. His principal
   weapon is the lie. The sword of God's Spirit is the Truth, but the
   sword of the evil spirit is the lie. It was by falsehood that he
   overthrew our race at first and despoiled us of perfection. And it is
   with continued falsehoods, of which the lie is both the forger and the
   user, that he continues to destroy the souls of men. He will tell the
   sinner sometimes that he is too young to think of death and of eternal
   things. And when this weapon fails he will assure him that it is too
   late, for the day of Grace is over--

   "He feeds our hopes with airy dreams. Or kills with slavish fear. And
   holds us still in wide extremes, Presumption, or despair. Now he
   persuades, 'Howeasy 'tis

   To walk the road to Heaven!' Then he swells our sins and cries, 'They
   cannot be forgiven!'

   Thus he supports his cruel throne By mischief and deceit, And drags the
   sons of Adam do wn To darkness and the pit."

   He has a way of making the worse appear the better reason. He can put
   bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter--make men believe that it is to
   their own advantage to do that which is causing their everlasting ruin.
   He can make men carry coals of fire in their bosoms and dream that they
   shall not be burned. He can make them dance upon the brink of Hell as
   though they were on the verge of Heaven. Alas, fools that we are, how
   readily do his lies prevail against us! Then he has the well-feathered
   arrows of pleasure. The strong man is armed with the lusts of the
   flesh. Dainty dalliances he offers to some--overflowing cups that
   sparkle to the eye he presents for others! Glittering wealth he gives
   to the avaricious and the trump of fame and all the smoke of applause
   he promises to others.

   Weapons? Why, I cannot attempt to mention all the war-like implements
   of the Prince of the power of the air. He can hurl fiery darts as thick
   as hail. His breath kindles coals and a flame goes out of his mouth.
   When he raises himself up the mighty are afraid. Bunyan's half-inspired
   imagination pictured him thus--"Now the monster was hideous to behold.
   He was clothed with scales like a fish (and they are his pride). He had
   wings like a dragon, feet like a bear, and out of his belly came fire
   and smoke and his mouth was as the mouth of a lion."

   He is well armed at every point and he knows how to arm his slave--the
   sinner, too. He will plate him from head to foot with mail and put
   weapons into his hands against which the puny might of Gospel ministers
   and of human conscience can never prevail. Then we are told that he
   wears armor--for we read that the stronger warrior, "takes from him all
   his armor wherein he trusted." Certain it is the evil spirit is well
   informed in that which is proof against all terrestrial steel.
   Prejudice, ignorance, evil education--all these are chain-armor with
   which Satan girds himself.

   A hard heart is the impenetrable breastplate which this evil spirit
   wears! A seared conscience becomes to him like leaves of brass. Living
   in sin is a helmet of iron. We know some who, through a long period of
   years, have harbored within them an evil spirit which seems to have no
   joints in its harness at all. It were as easy to draw blood from
   granite as to reach some men's hearts--the demon who possesses them is
   not to be wounded by our artillery. "His scales are his pride, shut up
   together as with a closed seal. His heart is as firm as a stone--yes,
   as hard as a piece of the nether millstone."

   We have preached at such men, prayed for them, spoken sharply, spoken
   tenderly, assaulted them from every quarter, wooed them with love
   Divine, thundered at them with the judgments of God and with the
   terrors of His Law. But the strong man is so completely mailed that as
   yet we have made no impression upon him whatever. When we have struck
   him with such a blow that he seemed to reel, yet the armor has been
   thick enough to save him from a deadly wound. "The sword of him that
   strikes at him cannot hold, nor the spear, the dart, nor the coat of
   mail. He thinks of iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. The arrow
   cannot make him flee--stones from slingshots are turned by him into
   stubble. The flakes of his flesh are joined together--they are firm in
   themselves. They cannot be moved."

   Notice, again, this strong man--besides being armed and plated with
   armor--is very watchful. It is said, "he keeps his palace." He keeps it
   like the faithful warden who with ceaseless tramp and sleepless eye
   holds watch upon the castle wall. He does not put on the armor to sleep
   in it. You may find sleeping saints, but never sleeping devils. The
   restless activity of fallen angels is something awful to
   contemplate--"they rest not day nor night"--but like ravenous lions go
   about seeking their prey. When Satan enters a man's heart, he takes
   care to watch whenever there is the slightest chance of the Truth of
   God coming in and driving him from his throne.

   He puts a double guard on the person when he is under the sound of the
   Word. He will let you go to those places where the minister never
   attacks the conscience and never cries aloud against sin--for he feels
   that there his kingdom is not assailed. But wherever the true Gospel is
   preached and preached with Divine power, hosts of devils are sure to
   gather, "Because," says Satan, "there is danger to my dominions now. I
   will set a double garrison to protect my citadel against the attack of
   God's Truth."

   Beware, O saints, when the Lord, the Holy Spirit, is working, for the
   great enemy is certain to be doubly active at such seasons! He keeps
   his goods. How would I delight to catch him unawares, but this
   leviathan is not to be taken with a hook, nor is his jaw to be bored
   through with a thorn. We may drop a warning to the sinner here, we may
   speak the passing word of exhortation there, we may stand in the corner
   of yonder street and declare salvation, or we may occupy the pulpit in
   Jesus' name--we may use all the means which ingenuity can devise--but
   Satan is always as prompt as we are, having his unclean birds always
   ready to carry away any seeds that may be scattered upon the soil.

   While men sleeps he sows tares, but he never slumbers himself. As Hugh
   Latimer used to say, he is the most industrious bishop in England.
   Other bishops may neglect their dioceses, but Satan, never! He is
   always making visitations and going from place to place upon his evil
   business to watch after his black sheep. The sinner's heart must be
   carried away by storm if it is ever taken, for there is no hope of
   taking the Evil One by surprise. We have in the text a good reason
   given why Satan thus watches over the man whose heart he
   inhabits--because he considers the man to be his property--"he keeps
   his goods."

   They are not his in justice. Whatever goods there are in the house of
   manhood must belong to God who built the house and who intended to
   tenant it. But Satan makes up a claim and calls everything in the man
   his property. The man's memory he makes a storehouse for ill words and
   bad songs. The man's judgment he perverts so that the scales and
   weights are false. The man's love he sets on fire with coals of Hell
   and his imagination he dazzles with foul delusions. All the powers of
   the man, Satan claims--"I will have his mouth--he shall swear for me! I
   will have his eyes--they shall wander after vanity! I will have his
   feet--they shall take him to the place of sinful amusement! I will have
   his hands--he shall work for me and be my slave!"

   The heart is hard and the conscience stupefied and therefore--

   "Sin like a raging tyrant sits Upon his flinty throne, And all that's
   good is crushed to death, Beneath this heart of stone."

   He claims the whole man to be his own. And it is amazing how readily
   his claim is allowed! Men fancy music in the chains with which Satan
   binds them and hug the fetters which he hangs upon them! Men cheerfully
   obey the Prince of Darkness and yet it is hard, ah, hard indeed, to
   bring the followers of Jesus to yield up their members in full
   obedience to the sweet Prince of Peace.

   Nor is this all! Satan not only claims possession, but he claims
   sovereignty! You perceive it is said, "his palace." A palace is usually
   the abode of a king--so Satan considers himself a great king when he
   dwells in the human heart. Divine Sovereignty has ever been the great
   target of Satan's attacks, because he aspires to set up his own
   infernal sovereignty. His sway over men is imperial and his government
   despotic. When he takes possession of the human heart he says to his
   servant, "Go," and he goes. And to his captive, "Do this," and he does
   it. He will not be regulated and ruled by reason, but he will have his
   own will obeyed in all its madness of rebellion. His declaration is
   made in apish imitation of the great God. "Cannot I do as I will with
   my own." "I am, and there is none beside me."

   To what extravagances of sovereignty will not Satan go with men! He
   will allure them to drunkenness--nor is that enough--he will hurry them
   into delirium tremens. He will drive them out of their senses and urge
   them to lay violent hands upon themselves--no, he often covers his
   victims with their own blood shed by themselves! An old preacher took
   for his text, "When the devils entered into the swine the whole herd
   ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the
   waters." One of his points was, "The devil drives his hogs to a bad
   market." And there is much truth in the rough assertion--when he gets
   into men there is no telling where they will go.

   Another point was, "They run hard whom the devil drives." Unto what
   extremities of sottish folly, cruelty and self-injury will not men go
   when once Satan gains possession of them? Like Baal's priests they are
   cutting themselves with knives! Like the Gadarene demoniac dwelling in
   tombs and wearing no clothes! Like the child in the Gospel sometimes
   cast into the fire and then into the water--such are men when the devil
   rules them. No king could ever walk in his palace and say, "All this is
   mine," with such pride as Satan when he walks through the heart of man!
   He can boastingly cry, "This man will fall down and worship me! He will
   sacrifice his comfort, his very life to me! He will drain my cups and
   not refuse the poison in the dregs! He will go upon my service and not
   ask me whether death is to be the everlasting wages!"

   Oh, that God had such willing servants, such joyful martyrs as those
   who obey the devil! You may see the devil's martyrs in every gin
   palace--ragged, haggard and diseased. You may see them in the early
   morning shivering till the time shall come when they shall drink
   another dram of Hell-draught. You may see them in every moonlit street,
   waiting in the cold, damp mists of night to be offered up upon his
   altar to prostitute both body and soul to his unhallowed worship. You
   may see them in every hospital rotting into their graves--their bones
   full of disease and their very blood polluted with a filthy taint of
   loathsomeness. You may see them, I say, all eager to sacrifice soul and
   body as a whole burnt offering to be wholly consumed by the infernal
   fire--that they may serve Satan with their whole heart! Oh, that we
   were half as faithful to God as the devil's servants are to him. The
   heart is well called Apollyon's palace, for he reigns with absolute
   dominion there. O eternal God, drive him out!

   I must not leave this picture until you have observed that it is said,
   "while he keeps his palace, his goods are in peace." This is the most
   fearful sign in the whole affair. The man is quite
   undisturbed--conscience does not prick him-- why should it? God does
   not alarm him--who is God, that he should obey His voice? Thoughts of
   Hell never disturb him. "Peace, peace," says Satan, "it is well with
   you now--leave these bugbears to those who believe in them." The wrath
   of God, which abides on him, never frets him! When men are mortifying,
   they feel no pain in the mortified member. Men who are stupefied with
   opium may be naked but they are not cold. They may have empty stomachs,
   but they are not hungry. They may be diseased in body but they do not
   feel the torment--they are drunk and know not their misery!

   And so it is with the most of carnal men--nothing awakens them. The
   sermon is listened to with a remark upon the style of the speaker, but
   the Truth of God is neglected. A judgment comes--the funeral bell
   tolls--a tear or two may be shed but they are soon wiped away and the
   man goes his way, like "the dog to his vomit and the sow that was
   washed to her wallowing in the mire." "I know nothing of what it is to
   be troubled in conscience," says one. "I am quite easy--I am as jolly
   as the days are long." I dare say you are--I wish you were not! If you
   were dissatisfied with your old master, there would be some hope that
   you would leave him and return to your Father's house--but so long as
   you are content with the world and with the Prince who governs it, you
   will go on, on, on, to your own destruction!

   Satan does with men as the sirens are fabled to have done with
   mariners. They sat upon the rocks and chanted songs so harmonious that
   no mariner, who once heard the sound, could ever resist the impulse to
   steer his ship towards them. So each vessel voyaging that way was
   wrecked upon the rocks through their disastrous, but enchanting strain.
   Such is

   Satan's voice--he lures to eternal ruin with the sweetest strains of
   infernal minstrelsy. He can play sonatas so inimitably enchanting in
   their harmony that it is not in poor mortal flesh and blood, unaided by
   the Spirit of God, to stand against their thrilling witchery.

   This is the melodious note--"Peace, peace, peace, peace." O Sinner, if
   you were not a fool you would stop up your ears to this treacherous
   lie! Forever blessed is that Sovereign Grace which has saved us from
   the enchantments of this destroyer! The tenant of the heart is called
   "an unclean spirit." He is unclean, notwithstanding all the peace he
   gives you. I pray you not flatter yourself to the contrary. He is ever
   the same, unchanged, unchangeable. Perhaps you tell me that you are not
   subject to any uncleanness. You say you do not drink nor swear, nor
   lie. But remember, it is unclean to be unreconciled to God! It is
   unclean to be a stranger to Christ! It is unclean to disobey God who
   created you. And above all it is unclean not to love the Redeemer whose
   most precious blood has delivered His people from their sins. At his
   best the devil is no better than a devil and the heart in which he
   dwells is no better than a den for a traitor to hide in.

   Thus I have given you an outline interpretation of the text--it would
   need much time to fill up and bring out the whole of its meaning.

   II. Now let us notice THE PARTIAL REFORMATION HERE DESCRIBED. "When the
   unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places,
   seeking rest. And finding none, he says, I will return unto my house
   from where I came out. And when he comes, he finds it swept and
   garnished. Then goes he and takes to him seven other spirits more
   wicked than himself. And they enter in and dwell there: and the last
   state of that man is worse than the first."

   Observe, then, that in the case before us the unclean spirit goes out
   of his own free will. He is not turned out--there is no conflict--the
   house still remains his own property for it is written at the end of
   the twenty-fourth verse, "I will return unto my house from where I came
   out." He retires from his palace of his own free will, intending to
   return at his leisure or pleasure. There are some persons who appear to
   be converted who think they are so and therefore make a profession and
   are cheerfully received into the Christian Church because their outward
   life gives evidence of a very great and remarkable change.

   I could now picture some who, to my great grief, come under my tearful
   observation. Some who were once with us, but have long since arrived at
   the last end which was "worse than the first." When the unclean spirit
   goes out of a man he becomes quite different from what he used to be.
   Very likely the shop that was open on the Sunday is now shut up. He
   turns his footsteps to the place where God's people meet for worship.
   He begins to pray, even sets up family prayer. He attends Prayer
   Meetings, feels some sort of enjoyment in the excitement of religion.
   He goes where the saints go and to a great extent in life he acts as
   they act. The unclean spirit is fairly gone out of the man and he is
   another man--though not a new creature in Christ Jesus.

   But I have said there was no struggle about it. It was suddenly that
   the spirit went out and the man jumped into religion. There was no
   repentance, no conviction, no struggling against depravity, no weeping
   before the Lord in prayer and no looking up to the Crucified Savior and
   reading pardon in His wounds. There was no agonizing struggle after
   holiness, no wrestling with evil--joy came suddenly and the man thought
   himself saved. The man was a sinner yesterday and he appears to be a
   saint today--nobody knows how. You talk to him about the work of the
   Spirit in his soul, convincing him of sin, breaking him with the hammer
   of the Law or by the power of the Cross, pounding him in pieces,
   compelling him to feel that his righteousness is filthy rags.

   He does not understand you. The unclean spirit is gone out of the man
   and that is all. Why does the evil spirit leave a man for a time? Has
   he not some hellish purpose in view? Certainly he has! I think it is
   often because he feels if he does not go out he will be driven out, and
   he thinks that by giving way for a time he will satisfy the conscience
   till he gets it lulled to sleep faster than ever. Thus he will stoop to
   conquer, retreat to draw his opponent into an ill position. He will
   allow his throne to shake so that he may reestablish his dominion
   permanently. Moreover, he thinks that by letting the man indulge in a
   little religion for a time, and then turn aside from it he will make
   him permanently skeptical so that he will hold him fast by the iron
   chain of infidelity and drag him down to Hell with that hook in his
   jaws.

   Now, after a time it appears that the evil spirit returned. He could
   find no rest for himself except in the hearts of the wicked and
   therefore he came back. There is no opposition to his entrance, the
   door is not locked--or if it is he has the key. He comes in--there is
   no tenant, no man in possession--no other proprietor. He looks round
   and cries, "Here is my house. I left it when I took my walks abroad and
   I have come back and here it is ready for me." In due time the devil
   comes back to those persons who are reformed but not renewed--who are
   changed but not made new creatures in Christ Jesus.

   But what does the devil see? First of all he sees the place to be
   empty. If it had been full he could not have entered again. If Jesus
   Christ had been at the door there would have been a very terrible
   struggle for a little time, but it would have ended in Satan being
   driven away in disgrace. But it is empty and therefore he quietly
   resumes his sway. The devil shouts his, "Halloa!" and there is an echo
   through every room, but no intruder starts up. "Is Christ here?" No
   answer. He goes outside and he looks at the lintel, for Christ's mark
   is sure to be there if Jesus is within. "No mark of blood on the post.
   Christ is not here," he says. "It is empty, I will make myself at
   home." If Jesus had been there, though He had been hidden in a closet,
   yet when He came out He would claim possession and drive out the
   traitor and say, "Be gone! This is no place for you. I have bought it
   with My blood and I mean to possess it forever."

   But it is empty and so Satan fills it with stores of evil. The next
   thing the fiend notices is that it is swept--as one says, "Swept, but
   never washed." Sweeping takes away the loose dirt--washing takes away
   all the filth. O to be washed in Jesus' blood! Here is a man whose
   house is swept--the loose sins are gone. He is not a drunkard, there is
   a pledge over the mantelpiece. He is no longer lustful--he hates that
   sin--or says he does, which is as much as the devil wants him to do.
   The place is swept so tidy, so neat, you would not know him to be the
   same man as he used to be. And he himself is so proud to think he has
   got his house so clean and he stands up at the threshold as he meets
   the devil with a, "Good morning!"

   And he says "I am not as other men are, I am neither an extortioner,
   nor a drunkard! Nor even as that Christian over yonder who is not half
   what he ought to be--nor a fraction as consistent as I am." And as the
   devil looks round and finds the place swept, he finds it garnished,
   too. The man has bought some pictures--he has not real faith, but he
   has a fine picture of it over the fireplace. He has no love to the
   Cross of Christ, but he has a very handsome crucifix hanging on the
   wall. He has no Divine Grace of the Spirit, but he has a fine vase of
   flowers on the table--of other people's experiences and other people's
   graces--and they smell tolerably sweet. There is a fireplace without
   fire, but there is one of the most handsome ornaments for the fireplace
   that was ever bought for money.

   It is swept and garnished. Oh, the garnished people I have
   met!--garnished, sometimes, with almsgiving--at other times with
   long-winded prayers! Garnished with the profession of zeal and the
   pretense of reverence! You will find a zealous Protestant--oh, so
   zealous--who would go into fits at the sign of a cross and yet will
   commit fornication! Do you think such a case impossible? I know such a
   case. You find persons shocked because another boiled a teakettle on a
   Sunday, or insured his life, or assisted at a bazaar, who will cheat
   and draw the eye teeth out of an orphan child, if they could get a
   sixpence by it! They are swept and garnished.

   Walk in, Ladies and Gentlemen! Did you ever see a house so delightfully
   furnished as this? How elegant--how tasteful! Just so--but men may be
   damned tastefully and go to Hell respectably just as well as they can
   in a vulgar and debauched fashion! You see the whole, how it ends.
   Satan is very pleased to find the place as it is, and thinking that
   this is too good for one, he goes abroad and asks in seven of his
   friends worse than himself--for some devils are worse than others. And
   they come in and hold high holiday in the man's soul. What do we mean
   by that? Why, we mean that such persons do really become more wicked,
   more hardened, more ungodly than they were before they professed to be
   Christians!

   It is really a shocking thing that if you want to find a thoroughbred,
   out-and-out transgressor, you must find one who once made a profession
   of religion! When Satan wants a servant who will do anything and ask no
   questions--who will swallow camels as well as gnats--he finds one that
   once stood high in the Christian Church. If he can find one who used to
   sing Christ's song, that is the throat to sing the devil's song! If he
   can find one who once sat at the sacramental table, he will say, "This
   is the man to sit at the head of my banquets and conduct my feasts for
   me." These renegades, these traitors, these Ahithophels, these Judases,
   these men who have known the Truth of God and have been once, in a
   manner, enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gifts and the
   powers of the world to come in a certain sense--and yet fall
   away--these become like salt that is neither fit for the land nor yet
   for the dunghill--even men cast them out!

   They are trees twice dead, plucked up by the roots--wandering stars for
   whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever. Have I any such in
   this place, any who were once swept and garnished, into whom Satan has
   returned? My Friend, from my soul I pity you! What will be your
   portion? No common Hell will be yours! Remember, there are re- served
   places in the pit and those are reserved for such as you are. Read the
   letter of Jude and you will there find that there are some for whom are
   reserved, "the blackness of darkness forever."

   That is your case and this will be the aggravation of it--you sat at
   the Master's Table and you must now drink the cup of fire! You preached
   in Christ's courts but you must now give forth a dolorous sermon
   concerning your own apostasy! You sang God's praises once--you must now
   howl out the Miserere of the damned! You had a glimpse of Heaven-- you
   shall now have a dread insight into Hell! You talked about eternal
   life, you shall now feel eternal death--plunged in waves of flame,
   never to rise again, never to hope, never even to die, for to die were
   bliss. How dreadful shall your case be! In this world seven times worse
   than before, but in the world to come, damned, damned with an awful
   emphasis which common sinners cannot know. I pray God that these truths
   may make us watchful, make us careful lest we be found hypocrites or
   self-deceived professors.

   III. I turn to a much more pleasing duty, which is TO TAKE UP THE
   SAVIOR'S DESCRIPTION OF TRUE CONVERSION. "When a stronger than he shall
   come upon him and overcome him, he takes from him all his armor wherein
   he trusted and divides his spoils." Now, observe here is a "stronger
   than he." This is not the man, himself. The man is the house--the man
   is not so strong as the devil--who is this? This is Jesus Christ who
   comes by His Spirit into the heart of man! The Spirit of God is vastly
   superior to Satanic power, as much as the infinite Creator Himself must
   ever be superior to the finite creature.

   He who made Satan knows how to lay at him with His sword so as to cut
   Rahab and wound the dragon. It is not, you see, the result of the man's
   free will--it is not the result of the devil's free will, either. It is
   the result of a stronger than he coming into the soul. As soon as the
   stronger than he comes in there is a conflict. "He comes upon him,"
   that is to say, He attacks him!

   And ah, how vehemently does Christ lay to at the great enemy of souls!
   One sword-cut cuts away the plume of pride! Another blow takes away the
   comfort of sin a and another destroys the reigning power of sin. What a
   struggle there often is when man is worked upon by the Holy Spirit!
   With all the power of prayer, with all the might of faith the poor soul
   struggles against Satan! Christ struggles with all the power of His
   blood and the blessings of His Spirit and yet we know in some cases the
   arch fiend has been allowed to hold out for days, for weeks, even for
   months because of the unbelief of the poor soul. "He could not do many
   mighty works there," it is written, "because of their unbelief."

   This fight will sometimes grow so hot that the soul will choose
   strangling rather than life and yet the result of it is never doubtful!
   For notice in the text that the stronger than he overcomes at the last.
   Oh, well do I remember when the stronger than Satan overcame in my
   soul! Five years, more or less, was there a conflict. Sometimes my
   proud heart would not yield to Sovereign Grace. At another time a
   willful spirit would go astray after vanity. But at last, when Jesus
   showed His wounds and said to me, "Look unto Me and be you saved, all
   the ends of the earth," I could hold out no longer and the evil spirit
   could resist no more!

   The wounds of Christ had wounded the old dragon and the death of the
   Savior became the death of sin. Oh, there are many of us who know what
   it is to be conquered, to be subdued by a power other than our own! And
   in every case there must be this experience, or there is no real life.
   Dear Hearer, if your religion grew in your own garden it is a weed and
   good for nothing! If your grace springs up as the result of your own
   willing, your own acting, and your own seeking, it is good for nothing!
   Christ must seek you! It must be a power far above you--mightier than
   you, far stronger than you and the devil put together--which must
   deliver you from your sins.

   As soon as ever the stronger man has conquered the enemy, what does He
   do? He takes the sword of rebellion, snaps it across His knee and pulls
   the armor from the back of the unclean spirit. Prejudice, ignorance,
   hard-heartedness--all these are pulled off the old enemy. I think I see
   him--I think I see the Savior stripping him to his shame and ejecting
   him from the heart with abhorrence. There, let him go among the dry
   places and again seek rest and find none. Happy day! Happy day for the
   palace which he once defiled when he is cast out and cast out forever!

   Christ Jesus then proceeds to divide the spoil. "There is the man's
   heart, I will take that," says He. "That shall be a jewel in My crown.
   The man's love I will set as a jewel upon My arm forever. His memory,
   his judgment, his power of thought, utterance and working--these are
   all Mine," says Christ. He begins to divide the spoil. He puts the
   broad arrow of the King upon every room in the house, upon every piece
   of furniture. The garnishing He pulls out, "I will adorn it far better
   than this," He says. "There shall be no pictures of faith, but faith.
   There shall be no ornament in yonder grate except the ornament of the
   glowing fire of fervid zeal. There shall be no borrowed flowers, but I
   will train round this window the sweet roses and jasmine of love and
   peace of mind.

   "I will wash what was only swept, with My blood. I will make it white
   and sweet and clean. And I will strike the lintel and the two side
   posts with the hyssop and with the blood mark--and then the destroying
   angel, when he sweeps by, shall sheathe his sword--and the black fiend,
   when he would enter, shall see the mark there and go back trembling to
   his accursed den."

   This is conversion, the other was only conviction! This is change of
   heart, the other was only change of life. I do trust, if you have been
   content with the former, you will now bestir yourselves and never be
   satisfied without the latter--

   "O Sovereign Grace, my heart subdue, I would be led in triumph, too.
   Drive the old dragon from his seat, With all his hellish crew."

   Sinner, cry to the stronger than you are to come and help you. You
   groan under your slavery--I am thankful for it! Cry to the Great
   Deliverer! He will come! He will come! Is there a conflict going on in
   you? Remember faith gets the victory. Look to Jesus--look to Jesus and
   the battle is won! Cast your poor spirit upon Jesus. Now burn that
   broom--it is of no use to go on sweeping! You need washing--washing
   with blood! Come, now, spare that money of yours with which you are
   going to buy garnishing--they are all rubbish! Buy no more. I counsel
   you buy of Him gold tried in the fire.

   Come to His precious blood and be made really clean. Your
   Church-goings, your Chapel-goings, your prayers, your almsgivings, your
   fasting, your feelings, your good works are all nothing--so much dross
   and dung--if you try to sweep and garnish your house with them. Cast
   them all away! Fly from your good works as you would from your bad
   ones! Do not expect to be saved by anything that you can feel that is
   good any more than you would expect to be saved by anything that you
   feel that is bad--

   "None but Jesus, none but Jesus, Can do helpless sinners good."

   My Lord Jesus, if You are passing by, traveling in the greatness of
   Your strength, come and show Your prowess! Turn aside, You heavenly
   Samson and rend the lion in this vineyard! If You have dipped Your
   robes in the blood of Your foes, come dye them all again with the blood
   of my cruel sins! If You have trod the wine press of Jehovah's wrath
   and crushed Your enemies, here is another of the accursed crew! Come
   and drag him out and crush him! Here is an Agag in my heart, come and
   hew him in pieces! Here is a dragon in my spirit, break, O break, his
   head and set me free from my old state of sin! Deliver me from my
   fierce enemy and unto You shall be the praise, forever and ever. Amen.

                               For Christ'S Sake

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 12, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For Christ's sake." Ephesians 4:32.

   THIS is the great argument of awakened sinners when they seek mercy at
   God's hands. Once they could boast of their own righteousness. They
   could rest upon their feelings, their resolutions, their goodness of
   heart, or their prayers--but now that God the Holy Spirit has shown
   them what they are and revealed to them the desperate evil of their
   hearts, they dare not offer any other plea than this--"For Christ's
   sake." They look and there is no man to succor. They cast their eyes
   around and there is no helper and their heart knows neither peace nor
   hope till they behold the Person and sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Then
   straightway their mouth is opened with arguments and they can plead
   with God with prevailing reasons, saying, "For Christ's sake, for
   Christ's sake, have mercy upon me."

   Indeed, Beloved, this is the only argument which can prevail with God
   in prayer, whether the prayer comes from saint or sinner. It is true
   that God did not originally love us for Christ's sake, for His electing
   love was Sovereign and absolute--the Father loved us not because the
   Savior died--but the Savior died because the Father loved us from
   before the foundation of the world. Nevertheless the only channel of
   communication between a loving Father and His elect people is the
   meritorious and glorious Person of Christ. The Father gives us no
   privilege except through His Only-Begotten, nor are we looked upon as
   accepted or acceptable except as we stand in and through our Lord
   Jesus, accepted in the Beloved, perfect in Christ Jesus.

   I must use no other argument when I plead with God but the name of His
   dear Son, for this is the sum of all heavenly logic. Whatever Covenant
   mercy I may wish for, this is the key which will unlock the storehouses
   of Heaven. No other name will prevail with God to scatter His mercies
   among undeserving sinners. He who knows how to plant his foot on the
   solid foothold of, "for Christ's sake," needs not fear, like Jacob, to
   wrestle with the Angel of God. But if we forget this in our prayers, we
   have lost the muscle and sinew from the arm of prayer--we have snapped
   the spinal column by which the manhood of prayer is sustained erect--we
   have pulled down about our own ears the whole temple of supplication as
   Samson did the house of the Philistines.

   "For Christ's sake," this is the one unbuttressed pillar upon which all
   prayer must lean--take this away and it comes down with a crash! Let
   this stand and prayer stands like Heaven--reaching upward--holding
   communion with the skies. In two ways, as the Holy Spirit may enable
   us, we will read the words before us. It is God's argument for
   mercy--"For Christ's sake." It is our reason for service--"For Christ's
   sake."

   I. GOD'S ARGUMENT FOR MERCY. He forgives us "for Christ's sake." Here
   let us first look at the force of this motive. And then, secondly, let
   us notice some qualifications in it which may, through God's blessing,
   be the means of comforting seeking sinners who desire to find rest in
   and through Jesus Christ.

   1. Let us consider the force of this motive by which God is moved to
   forgive sinners, "for Christ's sake." You know that if we do a thing
   for the sake of a person, several considerations may work together to
   make our motive powerful. We may be willing not only to do some things,
   but many things--no, all things--for the sake of the individual admired
   or beloved. The first thing which will move us to do anything for
   another's sake is his person, with its various additions of position
   and character. The excellence of a man's person has often moved others
   to high enthusiasm, to the spending of their lives--yes, to the
   endurance of cruel deaths for his sake.

   In the day of battle, if the advancing column wavered for a single
   moment, Napoleon's presence made every man a hero. When Alexander led
   the van there was not a man in all the Macedonian ranks who would have
   hesitated to lose his life in following him. For David's sake the three
   mighties broke through the host, at imminent peril of their lives, to
   bring him water from the well of Bethlehem.

   Some men have a charm about them which enthralls the souls of other men
   who are fascinated by them and count it their highest delight to do
   them honor. There have been, in different ages, leaders, both warlike
   and religious, who have so entirely possessed the hearts of their
   followers that no sacrifice was counted too great, no labor too severe.
   There is much to move the heart in the excellence of a person. How
   shall I, in a fitting manner, lead you to contemplate the Person of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, seeing that His charms far exceed all human
   attractions as the sun outshines the stars?

   Yet this much I will be bold to say, that He is so glorious that even
   the God of Heaven may well consent to do ten thousand things for His
   sake! Brothers and Sisters, we believe our Lord Jesus Christ to be very
   God of very God, co-equal and co-eternal with the Father, essential
   Deity. Jesus is no distinct God, separate from the Father, but, in a
   mysterious manner, He is One with the Father, so that the old Jewish
   watchword still stands true. "Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is one
   Lord." And yet Jesus is Jehovah-Tsidkenu, the Lord our righteousness.

   Besides this, He, for us men and for our salvation, took upon Himself
   the form and nature of man--became Incarnate, as the virgin's son and,
   as such, lived a life of perfection, never sinning, always full of love
   and holy service, both to God and man. There He stands--by the eye of
   faith we may see Him--"God over all, blessed forever." And yet Man, of
   the substance of His mother, He stands to plead before the eternal
   Throne--Almighty God, all-perfect Man. He wears upon His head a crown,
   for he is a Prince of the house of David, and His dominion is an
   everlasting dominion.

   Upon His bosom glitters the bejeweled breastplate, for He is a Priest
   forever, after the order of Melchisedek and over His shoulders hangs
   the mantle of prophecy, for He is a Prophet and more than a Prophet.
   Now, as He stands there, adored of angels, worshipped by cherubim and
   seraphim, having the keys of Heaven and earth and Hell at His side--
   Master of winds and waves, Lord of Providence, the Wonderful, the
   Counselor, the mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace,
   the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords--I wonder not that such a Person
   should prevail with the Father, and that God, for His sake, should
   bestow innumerable blessings upon the unworthy for whom He pleads!

   He is the chief among ten thousand and the altogether lovely! His head
   is as much fine gold! His lips like lilies dropping sweet smelling
   myrrh! His countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars! His
   mouth is most sweet--yes, He is altogether lovely. The whole creation
   can afford--

   "But some faint shadows of my Lord. Nature, to make His beauties known,
   Must mingle colors not her own. Nor earth, nor seas, nor sun, nor
   stars, Nor Heaven, His full resemblance bears. His beauties we can
   never trace, Till we behold Him face to face." In the surpassing
   majesty of His Person lies a part of the force of the plea. A far
   greater power lies in near and dear relationship. The mother, whose son
   had been many years at sea, pined for him with all a mother's fondness.
   She was a widow and her heart had but this one object left. One day
   there came to the cottage door a ragged sailor. He was limping on a
   crutch and seeking alms. He had been asking at several houses for a
   widow of such-and-such a name. He had now found her out.

   She was glad to see a sailor, for never since her son had gone to sea
   had she turned one away from her door, for her son's sake. The present
   visitor told her that he had served in the same ship with her beloved
   boy--that they had been wrecked together and cast upon a barren
   shore--that her son had died in his arms and that he had charged him
   with his dying breath to take his Bible to his mother. She would know
   by that sign that it was her son--and to charge her to receive his
   comrade affectionately and kindly for her son's sake. You may well
   conceive how the best of the house was set before the stranger! He was
   but a common sailor. There was nothing in him to recommend him. His
   weather-beaten cheeks told of service, but it was not service rendered
   to her--he had no claim on her and yet there was bed and board and the
   widow's hearth for him.

   Why? Because she seemed to see in his eyes the picture of her son--and
   that Book, the sure token of good faith, opened her heart and her house
   to the stranger. Relationship will frequently do far more than the mere
   excellence of the person. Think, Brothers and Sisters--Jesus Christ is
   the Only-Begotten Son of God! Our God had but one begotten Son and that
   Son the darling of His bosom. Oh, how the Father loves Him! It is not
   possible for us to measure Divine love, for we have no measuring line.
   Human love at best is only finite even when it reaches its very
   highest. When we plunge into the depths of human love, there is yet a
   bottom!

   But Divine love has neither shore nor boundary. Little can we tell what
   unity of essence means. The Divine Persons are one in Essence--one God.
   We cannot, therefore, conceive what affection must spring from this
   closest of all known unities. Oh, how Jehovah loves Him! And yet that
   dear Son of His, for our sakes left the starry throne of Heaven, became
   a Man, suffered--bled and died! And when we come to mercy's bar,
   bringing with us Christ's own promise, the Eternal Father sees Jesus in
   our eyes--bids us welcome to mercy's table and to mercy's house for the
   sake of Him who is His Only-Begotten Son.

   Still I have only advanced to the border of my subject. The force of
   the words, "for Christ's sake," must be found deeper still, namely in
   the worthiness of the Person and of His acts. Many peerages have been
   created in this realm which descend from generation to generation--with
   large estates--the gift of a generous nation and why? Because this
   nation has received some signal benefits from one man and has been
   content to ennoble his heirs forever for his sake. I do not think there
   was any error committed when Marlborough or Wellington were lifted to
   the peerage--having saved their country in war it was right that they
   should be honored in peace. And when, for the sake of the parents,
   perpetual estates were entailed upon their descendants and honors in
   perpetuity conferred upon their sons, it was only acting according to
   the laws of gratitude.

   Let us think of what Jesus Christ has done and let us understand how
   strong must be that plea--"for Jesus' sake." The Law of God was
   violated. Jesus Christ came into the world and kept it--kept it so that
   out of the whole Ten Commands there is not one whose clamorous tongue
   can lay anything to His charge. Here was a Divine dilemma--God must be
   just, yet He willed to save His people. How could these two things
   meet? Where was the man who could break down the mountain which
   separated Justice and Mercy, so that they could kiss each other? God
   must punish sin and yet He will be gracious to whom He will be
   gracious. How shall these two things agree?

   Forth came the priests, with their various sacrifices. But the
   slaughter of bullocks and heifers and rams and he-goats, could not make
   God just. What comparison could there be between rivers of blood of fed
   beasts and the sin of man? But Jesus came--the great Solution of the
   Divine enigma--Jesus came--eternal God, but yet perfect Man and He
   bowed His head to the ignominious death of the Cross! His hands were
   pierced! His feet were nailed--His soul was sorrowful, even unto
   death--

   "Jesus, our Lord and God, Bore sin's tremendous load. Praise His name!
   Tell what His arm has done,
   What spoils from death He won! Sing His great name alone.
   Worthy the Lamb!"

   God was just--He punished human guilt in the Person of man's
   representative, Jesus of Nazareth. God is gracious--He accepts every
   believing sinner for the sake of Jesus Christ.

   Think, then, of what Christ has done and you will see the force of the
   argument. He has honored the Law of God which man had dishonored and
   has opened a way for God's mercy which man's sin had fast closed up.
   Oh, God, Your Son has brought back what He took not away--He has taken
   the prey from the mighty and the lawful captive He has delivered. Like
   another David He has snatched the sheep from the jaws of the lion and
   delivered the lamb from the paws of the bear. Like another Samson He
   has slain Your enemies and taken the gates of their strongholds upon
   His shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill. Every wound
   which He endured upon the Cross, every stroke which He felt in Pilate's
   hall, every drop of blood which He sweat in Gethsemane strengthens the
   plea, "for Christ's sake."

   Still, still I think I have not yet arrived at the force of the words.
   If any stipulation has been made, then the term, "for His sake," become
   more forcible--because they are backed by engagements, promises,
   covenants. In Christ's case solemn promises have been exchanged. There
   was a distinct engagement made between the Judge of men and the
   Redeemer of our souls. The Prophet Isaiah has published the engagement,
   "He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days and the pleasure of
   the Lord shall prosper in His hand."

   Yet again, "I will divide Him a portion with the great, and He shall
   divide the spoil with the strong." And still further, "He shall see of
   the travail of His soul and shall be satisfied. By His knowledge shall
   My righteous servant justify many; for He shall bear their iniquities."
   There was a distinct transaction, then, of ancient date between the
   Father and the Son in which the Son stipulated that He would bear the
   sin of His people. He was to be the Scapegoat for His people Israel.
   And then it was solemnly engaged on the part of the Divine Judge of all
   the earth that He would give Him the souls of the redeemed to be His
   portion forever.

   Now, Brethren, there is a strength in the plea, "for Christ's sake." Oh
   God, with reverence would we speak of You, but how could You be just if
   You did not save those for whom Jesus shed His precious blood?
   Brethren, we speak as unto honest men--would you, being men, first of
   all accept a surety and a substitute and then expect the debtor to pay
   the debt himself? Look at human governments--if a man were drafted into
   the army and should find a substitute, does the law afterwards seize
   the man himself? And shall God be less just than man? Shall the supreme
   king of Heaven be less just than the kings of earth? If Christ has paid
   my debt, God's justice cannot demand payment of me! It cannot expect
   the same debt to be paid twice. Justice cannot demand payment--

   "First at my bleeding Surety's hands, And then again at mine."

   If Christ served in that dread warfare for me as my Substitute, how can
   it be that after this I should myself be driven to the edge of the
   sword? Impossible! Beloved, see that scapegoat yonder? Israel's sins
   have been confessed upon it. The High Priest has laid his hand on the
   victim's head. It is led away by the hand of a fit man. He sets it
   free. He watches it-- it is out of sight. He climbs a rock, looks far
   away to the east, the west, the north, the south--he cannot see it. He
   waits awhile--looks with anxious eyes--it is gone! He comes back and
   tells the people of Israel that the sin has been typically carried away
   upon the scapegoat's head.

   Now, Christ is the fulfillment of the scapegoat. Our sins were laid on
   Him--He is gone--gone where? "You shall seek Me but you shall not find
   Me," He says. He is gone into the desolate regions of the dead. The
   Scapegoat, Christ, has carried away into His own tomb, the sins of all
   His people forever. Now, was that a farce, or was it a reality? Did
   Christ take away sin, or not? If He did, then how can men be punished
   for sins which Jesus took away, for the sins for which Christ was
   punished? If He did not suffer for sin, then where is the deliverance
   for any soul born of Adam? Oh you that receive general redemption, you
   know not what you receive! You who talk of a universal atonement which
   does not make an atonement for all sin, know not what you affirm!

   But we who speak of a special Atonement made for every soul that ever
   has believed or ever shall believe--we speak of something sure,
   certain, worthy of the soul's resting itself upon--since it does save
   every soul for whom it was offered up! There remains only one other
   thought upon this point. It tends very much to strengthen the plea,
   "for Christ's sake," if it is well known that it is the desire of the
   person that the gift should be granted and if, especially, that desire
   has been and is earnestly expressed. Oh how glad we ought to be to
   think that Christ, when we plead His name, never tells us that we are
   going too far and taking liberties! No, Beloved, if I anxiously ask for
   mercy, Christ has asked for mercy for me long ago!

   There is never a blessing for which a Believer pleads but Christ pleads
   for it, too! "He ever lives to make intercession for us." Our
   supplications become His supplications and our desires, when excited of
   the Spirit, are His desires. In Heaven He points to His wounds, the
   mementoes of His grief, and He cries--"Father, for My sake grant this
   favor to these poor undeserving ones. Give them blessing as You would
   give Me blessings. Be kind and gracious to them, as You would be kind
   and tender towards Me." This makes the plea omnipotent. It is not
   possible but that it should mightily prevail with God.

   2. Pausing a minute let us enumerate some few other qualifications of
   this plea by way of comfort to trembling seekers. This motive, we may
   observe, is with God a standing motive. It cannot change. Suppose, poor
   Sinner, that God offered to forgive for your own sake. Then if at one
   time you were penitent and broken-hearted, there would be hope for you.
   But at another time you might be bemoaning the hardness of your heart
   and powerlessness to repent and then there would be no motive why God
   should bless you. But, you see, Christ is always as much worthy at one
   time as another and therefore God has the same reason for blessing
   you--a poor wandering soul today--as He can have had twenty years ago!

   And if you have grown grey in sin--if you have become like a dry piece
   of wood ready for the fire--yet this motive does not wear out! It has
   the dew of its youth upon it. God, for Christ's sake, forgives little
   children and for the same reason He can forgive the man who has passed
   his threescore years and ten. As long as you are in this world, this is
   a standing reason for mercy. Remember, again, that this is a mighty
   reason. It is not merely a reason why God should forgive little sins,
   or else it would be a slur upon Christ--as though He deserved but
   little.

   Can you tell how great your sin is? "Oh," you say, "it is high as
   Heaven, it is deep as Hell!" Now can you tell how great Christ's
   worthiness is? I will tell you that His worthiness is deeper than Hell
   can be and higher than Heaven itself. What? If your sin could reach
   from east to west and from the highest star to the depth of the abyss,
   yet the worthiness of Christ is a fullness which fills all in all and
   therefore it would cover all your sins! Your sins, like Egypt's hosts,
   are many and mighty--Christ's worthiness is like the flood of the Red
   Sea--able to drown the whole so that not one of their host shall be
   left. They shall sink into the bottom like a stone.

   Your sins are like Noah's flood which drowned all mankind. Christ's
   worthiness is like Noah's ark which swims above the tide and mounts
   higher as the flood grows deeper. The deeper your sin the more is
   Christ's merit exalted above the heavens when Jehovah forgives you all
   your iniquities! Think not little of Christ! I would not have you think
   little of sin--but still think more of Christ. Sin is finite. It is the
   creature's act. Christ is Infinite. He is Omnipotent. Whatever, then,
   your sin may be, Christ is greater than your sin and able to take it
   away.

   Then, Brothers and Sisters, it is a most clear and satisfactory--I was
   about to say most reasonable reason--a motive which appeals to your own
   common sense! Can you not already see how God can be gracious to you
   for Christ's sake? We have heard of persons who have given money to
   beggars, to the poor. Not because they deserved it, but because they
   would commemorate some deserving friend. On a certain day in the year
   our Horticultural Gardens are opened free to the public. Why, why
   should they be opened free? What has the public done? Nothing. They
   receive the gift in commemoration of the good Prince Albert.

   Is not that a sensible reason? Yes. Every day in the year the gates of
   Heaven are opened free to sinners. Why? For Jesus Christ's sake! Is it
   not a most fitting reason? If God would glorify His Son, how could He
   do better than by saying, "For the sake of My dear Son set the pearly
   gates of Heaven wide open and admit His chosen ones. See these myriads
   of spirits--they are all admitted to their throne of immortal glory for
   the sake of My dear Son. They are happy, but they are happy for His
   sake. They are holy, but they are holy for His sake." Casting their
   crowns at His feet, they sing, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to
   receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory,
   and blessing."

   You perceive at once that this reason appeals to common sense and
   therefore, I hope, dear Friends, you will lay hold of it. Let me say,
   poor Sinner, that it is a reason applicable to your case. If you can,
   think of any good and solid reason why God should forgive you! Turn
   them all over. You cannot see one! I know the time when I could not
   find a half a reason why God should save me, but I could find fifty
   thousand reasons why He should damn me! And when I see that, "for
   Christ's sake," O that is a reason! That is a good reason--it is a
   reason I can get hold of! Suppose me to be the blackest sinner out of
   Hell. How it will glorify Christ if, for Christ's sake, the blackest
   sinner that ever lived should be snatched from Hell and taken to Heaven
   for His sake!

   Suppose I have been a blasphemer, unchaste, an adulterer, a
   murderer--what then? "For Christ's sake." The more sin I have, the more
   glorious will the merit of Christ seem to be, when, in opposition to
   all my unworthiness, it brings me pardon and eternal life and takes me
   to the enjoyments of His right hand! Sinner, grasp this motive! I know
   where you have been--you have been raking about in that filthy dunghill
   of your own heart. You have been turning the filth over to find a jewel
   in it. You will never find one! The jewels which once belonged to
   mankind were all lost by our father, Adam.

   I know what you have been doing! You have been trying to be better in
   order to deserve well of God. Thus you thought you would manufacture a
   reason which should move the heart of God. Leave off this foolish
   work--come with nothing in your hands but Christ! When the Molossians
   were threatened by their king to be cut to pieces for their rebellion,
   they pleaded very hard, but no argument would touch his heart. Then,
   one day one of their ambassadors saw his son in the palace. Catching
   him up in his arms, he took and laid him down before his father's feet
   and said, "For your son's sake, have pity upon us."

   Now, do this, Sinner--take Christ in your arms and say, "For Christ's
   sake." The whole heart of the Gospel lies here. All true theology is
   comprehended in this, "For Christ's sake." Substitution--saving the
   guilty through the innocent. Substitution blessing--the unworthy
   through the worthy. Try this precious plea, poor Soul, and I will
   warrant you that, before long, you shall find peace with God if you can
   understand the power of this argument! I may close these reflections by
   observing that this is the only motive, the only motive which can ever
   move the heart of God!

   You may cry as long as you will, reform as much as you please, pray as
   earnestly as you like--but the gate of Heaven will never stir to your
   knockings till you plead, "For Jesus' sake!" There is the, "Open
   Sesame," which will make the gates of the city turn on their hinges.
   But if you have not this watchword all your doings and almsgivings and
   praying and what not will be but a heap of filth piled up against
   Heaven's gate. Remember, "other foundation can no man lay than that
   which is laid." And that, "there is none other name under Heaven given
   among men, whereby we must be saved," save Jesus Christ, the Righteous.
   Use that! Plead that and you shall succeed with God!

   II. "FOR CHRIST'S SAKE" IS THE BELIEVER'S GREAT MOTIVE FOR SERVICE. Two
   or three hints as to what kind of service may be expected of us. Then a
   little exhortation by way of stirring us up to do this service for
   Christ.

   1. We begin with a few hints as to what service is expected of us. One
   of the first things which every Christian should feel bound to do, "for
   Christ's sake," is to avenge His death. "Avenge His death?" asks one.
   "Upon whom?" Upon His murderers. And who were they? Our sins! Our
   SINS!--

   "Each of our crimes became a nail, And unbelief the spear."

   The very thought of sin having put Jesus to death should make the
   Christian hate it with a terrible hatred. I do not wonder that the
   Highlanders bit their lips and marched with awful determination and
   dread resolve of vengeance against the rebel Sepoys when they
   remembered how the murdered women filled up the well of Cawnpore.

   Every man must have felt, then, that he was twenty men in one for
   retribution. And when his arm smote, he wished to concentrate all the
   might of justice into each stroke of his sword. When I remember that my
   sins tore my Savior's body on the tree, took the crown from His head
   and the comfort from His heart--and sent Him down into the shades of
   death--I vow revenge against them. "O sin! Happy shall he be that takes
   your little ones and dashes them against a stone!" Yes, doubly blessed
   is he who, like Samuel, shall hew the Agag of his sins in pieces before
   the Lord and not spare so much as one single fault, or folly, or vice,
   because it slew the Savior. Be holy, be pure, be just--be you separate
   from sinners for Christ's sake!

   Then, next, the Christian is expected to exalt his Master's name and to
   do much to honor His memory, for Christ's sake. You remember that
   queen, who, when her husband died, thought she could never honor him
   too much and built a tomb so famous that though it was only named for
   him, it remains, to this day, the name of every splendid memorial--the
   mausoleum. Now let us feel that we cannot erect anything too famous for
   the honor of Christ--that our life will be well spent in making His
   name famous. Let us pile up the unhewn stones of goodness, self-denial,
   kindness, virtue, grace--let us lay these one upon another and build up
   a memorial for Jesus Christ so that whoever passes by may know that we
   have been with Jesus and have learned of Him!

   Should we not, for His sake, care for the growth of His kingdom and the
   welfare of His subjects? Ought we not to minister to the wants of His
   servants and comfort the sorrows of His friends? If He has a poor
   brother anywhere, is it not at once an honor and a duty to aid him? As
   David cherished Mephibosheth, who was lame in his feet, for the sake of
   Jonathan, so should you and I look after every heavy-laden,
   faint-hearted Christian, for the sake of Jesus! Should we not be
   bearing one another's burdens because Christ bore our burdens? Weeping
   with them that weep because Jesus wept? Helping those who ask our help
   because God has laid help upon One that is mighty, even our Redeemer?
   And above all, "for Jesus' sake" should be a motive to fill us with
   intense sympathy with Him.

   He has many sheep and some of them are wandering--let us go after them,
   my Brothers and Sisters, for the Shepherd's sake. He has pieces of
   money which He has lost--let us sweep the house and light our candle
   and seek diligently till we find them, "for Jesus' sake." He has
   brethren who are playing the prodigal--let us seek to bring them
   back--"for Christ's sake." Let the soul of the poorest little street
   Arab--let the soul of the grossest scoundrel and the most abandoned
   harlot be very dear to us for Jesus' sake--let us care even for the
   obstinate and rebellious for Jesus' sake.

   As you look at souls imagine you see Jesus weeping over them. As you
   look at perishing sinners imagine you see His blood bespattered on them
   and you will love them, "for Jesus' sake." Oh, Brethren, you who are
   doing nothing for Christ--you who come here and listen to me--and sit
   at His Table and take the bread and wine in remembrance of Him--what
   will you do when your Master comes and you have to confess that you did
   nothing for Him? That your love was of such a sort that you never
   showed it--you talked of it--but you never gave to His cause, you never
   worked for His name?

   Away with such love as that! What do men think of it--a love that never
   shows itself in action? Why, they say, "Open rebuke is better than
   secret love of that kind." You had better have rebuked Christ than to
   have had a sneaking, miserable, untrue, unloving love to Him--a love so
   weak that it was never powerful enough to actuate you to a single deed
   of self-denial, of generosity, of heroism, or zeal! Oh, Brothers and
   Sisters, let it not be so with us any longer, but let us seek, by God's
   Grace, that "for Jesus' sake" we may have a sympathy with Him in
   yearning over the souls of men and endeavoring to bring them to a
   knowledge of His salvation!

   2. A few words, lastly, by way of exhortation on this point and I will
   not weary your attention by longer talk. Clear as the sound of a
   trumpet startling men from slumber and bewitching as the sound of
   martial music to the soldier when he marches to the conflict ought to
   be the matchless melody of this word, "for Christ's sake." It ought to
   make men perform deeds which should fit them to rank with angels. It
   ought to bring out of every regenerate man more than was ever forced
   from manhood by any other word--let it have what charm it might. It
   ought to make the least among us valiant as David and David as the
   servant of the Lord.

   Think, my Brethren, what mighty wonders other words have worked. For
   philosophy's sake what have men not suffered? They have wasted their
   health over unhealthy furnaces--breathing noxious gases. They have worn
   out their days and their nights burning the midnight oil. They have
   spent their last farthing to acquire the secrets of nature! They have
   beggared themselves and their families to unravel mysteries which have
   brought no more substantial reward than the honor of learned
   approbation and conscious power. The martyrs of science are
   innumerable. If someone would write their story it would make a bright
   page in human history!

   Think again of what men have done for discovery's sake by way of
   traveling. Take down the books of modern travelers and you will be
   astounded at their zeal, their courage and disinterestedness! They have
   mocked the fever, have laughed at death, have left friends and kindred
   and the comfort of home! They have gone to inhospitable climates among
   more inhospitable men, have wandered about in weariness, wet with the
   rain, frozen with the cold, or burnt up with the heat! They have gone
   hungry and thirsty, sick and weary--have journeyed on and on to find
   the source of a river or a passage through a frozen strait!

   When I think of such expeditions as those of Ross and Franklin, I
   marvel at and reverence the endurance of humanity! How these bold men
   have braved old Boreas in his own ice-palace and faced grim desolation
   in its own domain! The text, "Quit you like men," gets a new emphasis
   when we think of these conquerors of famine and cold and peril. And
   shall the in-quisitiveness of mankind prove a stronger motive than
   God-given love to Jesus? If so, shame upon us! Think, again, of what
   men have done for false religion's sake! In years gone by the scimitar
   flashed from the Arab's sheath and the Arab's eyes flashed fire at the
   very name of Mahomet! For the one dogma, "God is God and Mahomet is his
   Prophet," blood flowed in rivers and fields were strewn with the slain
   rejoicing to be slain because they dreamed that Paradise was to be
   found under the shadow of swords.

   Think how the heathen cast themselves before the car of Juggernaut to
   be crushed into a hideous mass of mangled flesh and broken bones and
   oozing blood for their god's sake! Their filthy, horrid god's sake! How
   many have given themselves to die by Gunga's stream? How many a woman
   has gone up to the funeral pile and thrown herself upon her husband's
   dead body, giving herself an offering to her cruel gods? I know not
   what men have not suffered for the horrid deities which they have
   chosen for themselves.

   Martyrs to fanaticism and deception are not a few and shall the Truth
   of God find us unready and unwilling to run risks for its sake? Review,
   my Brethren, the heroic struggles of the Lord's people and here we turn
   to the brightest page of the world's annals! Think of the suffering of
   God's people through the Maccabean war! How marvelous was their courage
   when Antiochus Epiphanes took the feeblest among the Jews to constrain
   them to break the law and found himself weak as water before their
   dauntless resolve! Aged women and feeble children overcame the tyrant.
   Their tongues were torn out. They were sawn asunder. They were broiled
   on the fire. They were pierced with knives--but no kind of torture
   could subdue the indomitable spirit of God's chosen people.

   Think of the Christian heroism of the first centuries! Remember
   Blandina tossed upon the horns of bulls and set in a red-hot iron
   chair! Think of the martyrs given up to the lions in the amphitheatre
   amidst the reviling of the Roman mob-- dragged to their death at the
   heels of wild horses, or, like Marcus Arethusa, smeared with honey and
   stung to death by bees.

   And yet in which case did the enemy triumph? In none! They were more
   than conquerors through Him that loved them! And why? Because they did
   it all, "for Christ's sake," and Christ's sake alone.

   Think of the cruelty which stained the snows of the Switzer's Alps and
   the grass of Piedmont's Valleys blood-red with the murdered Waldenses
   and Albigenses and honor the heroism of those who, in their deaths,
   counted not their lives dear to them "for Christ's sake." Walk this
   afternoon to your own Smithfield and stand upon the sacred spot where
   the martyrs leaped into their chariot of fire, leaving their ashes on
   the ground, "for Jesus' sake!" In Edinburgh, stand on the well-known
   stones consecrated with covenanting gore where the axe and the hangman
   set free the spirits of men who rejoiced to suffer for Christ's sake!

   Remember those fugitives, for Christ's sake, "meeting in the glens and
   crags of Scotia's every hill." They were daunted by nothing--they dared
   everything--"for Christ's sake." Think, too, of what missionaries have
   done, "for Christ's sake." With no weapon but the Bible they have
   landed among cannibals and have subdued them to the power of the
   Gospel! With no hope of gain except in the reward which the Lord has
   reserved for every faithful one, they have gone where the most
   enterprising trader dared not go! They have passed through barriers
   impenetrable to the courage of men who sought after gold--but to be
   pierced by men who sought after souls.

   Think of the Moravians, first and choice warriors for God. Think of
   them selling themselves for slaves that they might teach other slaves
   the liberty of the Gospel--consenting to be confined in the lazar house
   for life--with the absolute certainty of rotting away piece-meal with
   leprosy and with diseases fouler still! Why? Only that they might save
   the leper's soul and have an opportunity of teaching the poor diseased
   one the way by which his spirit might be made whole through Jesus the
   great Physician!

   And what have you and I ever done? Oh, pigmies, dwarfs, sons of
   nobodies! Our names will never be remembered. What have we done?
   Preached a few times, but with how little fire? Prayed at certain
   seasons, but with how little passion? Talked now and then to sinners.
   With what half-heartedness given to the cause of Christ, but seldom
   given till we denied ourselves and made a real sacrifice! Believed in
   God at times, but oh with what unbelief mixed with our faith! Loved
   Christ, but with what cold, stolid hearts. "For Christ's sake." Do you
   feel the power of it? Then let it be like a rushing mighty wind to your
   soul to sweep out the clouds of your worldliness and clear away the
   mists of sin!

   "For Christ's sake!" Be this the tongue of fire that shall sit on every
   one of you! "For Christ's sake!" Be this the Divine rapture, the
   heavenly impulse to bear you aloft from earth! The Divine spirit that
   shall make us bold as lions and swift as eagles in our Lord's service!
   Fixed, fixed on God with a constancy that is not to be shaken, resolve
   to honor Him with a determination that is not to be turned aside and
   pressing on with an ardor never to be wearied.

   I cannot preach as I would on such a theme as this, but I leave it with
   you. How much do you owe to my Lord? Has He ever done anything for you?
   Has He forgiven your sins? Has He covered you with a robe of
   righteousness? Has He set your feet upon a rock? Has He established
   your goings? Has He prepared Heaven for you? Has He prepared you for
   Heaven? Has He written your name in His Book of Life? Has He given you
   countless blessings? Has He a store of mercies which eyes have not seen
   nor ears heard?

   Then do something for Christ worthy of His love. Wake up from natural
   sleepiness and this very day, before the sun goes down, do something in
   some way by which you shall prove that you feel the power of that
   Divine motive, "for Christ's sake." May God accept and bless you, dear
   friends, "for Jesus' sake." Amen.

   "See from His head, His hands, His feet,
   Sorrow and love flow mingled down!
   Did ever such love and sorrow meet,
   Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
   His dying crimson, like a robe,
   Spreads over His body on the tree.
   Then am I dead to all the globe,
   And all the globe is dead to me.
   Were the whole realm of nature mine,
   That were a present far too small!
   Love so amazing, so Divine,
   Demands my soul, my life, my all."

                        Human Depravity And Divine Mercy

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 19, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And the Lord smelled a sweet savor. And the Lord said in His heart, I
   will not again curse the ground anymore for man's sake; for the
   imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again
   destroy anymore every thing living as I have done."

   Genesis 8:21.

   PETER tells us that Noah's ark and Baptism are figures of salvation. He
   puts the two together as pictures of the way by which we are saved.
   Noah was not saved by the world's being gradually reformed and restored
   to its primitive innocence, but a sentence of condemnation was
   pronounced and death, burial and resurrection ensued. Noah must go into
   the ark and become dead to the world. The floods must descend from
   Heaven and rise upward from their secret fountains beneath the earth.
   The ark must be submerged with many waters--here was burial. And then
   after a time Noah and his family must come out into a totally new world
   of resurrection life.

   It is the same in the figure of Baptism. The person baptized, if he is
   already dead with Christ, is buried--not purified and improved--but
   buried beneath the waves. And when he rises he professes that he enjoys
   newness of life. Baptism is setting forth just what Noah's ark set
   forth--that salvation is by death and burial. You must be dead to the
   world. The flesh must be dead with Christ, buried with Christ--not
   improved, not made better, but utterly put aside as unimprovable, as
   worthless, dead--a thing to be buried and to be forgotten.

   And we must come forth in resurrection life, feeling that above us
   there is a new Heaven and beneath us a new earth where righteousness
   dwells, seeing that we are new creatures in Christ Jesus. It would be
   very instructive to dwell upon each point of the resemblance between
   Noah's deliverance and the salvation of every elect soul. Noah enters
   into the ark--there is a time when we distinctly enter into Christ and
   become one with Him. Noah was shut in the ark so that he could never
   come out again till God should open the door. There is a time when
   every child of God is shut in--when faith and full assurance give him
   an evidence that he is indissolubly one with Christ Jesus. He is
   grasped in Christ's hand so that none can pluck him out. He is hidden
   in Christ's loins so that none can separate him from the love of God.

   Then comes the flood--there is a season in the Christian's experience
   when he discovers his own depravity. He is saved. He is in the ark. He
   is, however, still a sinner, still the subject of inbred lusts.
   Suddenly all these corruptions break up! They beat upon his ark, they
   assail his faith, they endeavor, if possible, to drown his soul in sin.
   But he is not destroyed by them--for, by the grace of God, he is where
   other men are not--he is where he cannot be drowned by sin. He is in
   Christ Jesus! He mounts as the floods deepen. The more he feels the
   depth of his depravity, the more he admires the fullness of the atoning
   sacrifice! The more terrible the temptation, the more joyous is his
   consolation in Christ Jesus.

   And so he rises in holy communion towards his God. Then comes the
   wind--typical of the breath of the sacred Spirit by which the floods of
   corruption are calmed and peace reigns within and the soul sings,
   "Therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our
   Lord Jesus Christ." Then the tops of the mountains
   appear--sanctification takes place upon a part of the man. There are
   some bright graces which glisten out of the general flood of
   corruption. There are some points of his new-born nature which delight
   him with their beauty. His ark has grounded and settled-- he no longer
   floats, so to speak, tossed about with a struggling faith and
   contending unbelief--he feels that as Christ Jesus is forever seated
   firmly at the right hand of God, so he, in Christ Jesus, has entered
   into rest.

   The ark grounded on the top of Ararat--so does the Believer's
   experience come to a settled condition. He is no more moved about with
   fears and questions, but rejoices in hope of the Glory of God. He sends
   forth his thoughts in search after evidence of his complete salvation,
   and probably he sends out some of his own ignorant carnal expectations,
   just as Noah sent out the raven. These ignorant imaginations of what
   the work of the Spirit is go forth and they never return because no
   unclean child of the old Adam can be a discerner of the new world. Then
   he sends out the dove--holy desires, earnest prayers go to and fro. By
   and by they come back with a token for good, some choice mercy from the
   hand of God--an olive branch of assured peace--and the Believer surely
   knows not only that he is in Christ, not only that he is grounded in
   Christ, but that all the waters are calmed, all sin is gone, all danger
   removed, all death destroyed!

   Then occurs a period where God opens the door. Christ had been as a
   sort of prison to the Christian up till then. The Cross had been a
   burden. He did not rejoice in liberty. But God the Father now comes
   with the blessed Spirit and opens the door and the Believer is fully at
   liberty in the new world. The saved soul's first act is, like Noah, to
   build an altar unto God and, as a priest, to offer sacrifice, which, as
   it rises to Heaven, is accepted because it is a memorial of Christ. The
   Lord smells a sweat savor and though the believing man is still full of
   sin and from his youth up has an evil imagination, yet he hears the
   Covenant voice which says, "I will no more curse, I will no more
   destroy."

   He hears the Covenant promise which confirms forever the faithfulness
   of God and he rejoices to inherit, like Noah, a new world where
   righteousness dwells. I do not lay any stress upon these
   interpretations, but I know the Apostle says concerning Hagar and
   Sarah, "which things are an allegory." I believe that the book of
   Genesis is a book of dispensa-tional Truth and if it were rightly read,
   not by the eye of curiosity, but by the heart of the student who has
   been made wise to see the deep things of God, very much of Divine and
   holy teaching would be discoverable in it.

   But now I come to the text itself. We have here, first, a very sad and
   painful fact, "the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth."
   We have, secondly, God's most extraordinary reasoning, "I will not
   again curse the ground for man's sake, for the imagination of man's
   heart is evil." Then, thirdly, we have some inferences less
   extraordinary but practical to ourselves from the text.

   I. To begin, then, with the text, we have here A MOST PAINFUL FACT that
   man's nature is incurable--"the imagination of man's heart is evil from
   his youth." You will remember, beforethe flood, in the fifth verse of
   the sixth chapter it is written, "God saw that the wickedness of man
   was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of
   his heart was only continually evil." After the flood it is just the
   same. The description in the sixth chapter belonged to all the
   antediluvian race.

   You might have hoped that after so terrible a judgment, when only a
   few--a picked and peculiar few--that is, eight, were saved by water,
   that then, as man began anew with a better stock, the old branches that
   were sere and rotten being cut away--that now the nature of man would
   be improved. It is not one whit so. The same God who, looking at man,
   declared that his imagination was evil before the flood, pronounces the
   very same verdict upon them afterwards. Oh God! How hopeless is human
   nature! How impossible is it that the carnal mind should be reconciled
   to God! How needful is it that You should give us new hearts and right
   spirits, seeing that the old nature is so evil that even the floods of
   Your judgments cannot cure it of its evil imaginations!

   I would have you studiously notice the words used in both these
   passages--the antediluvian and the postdiluvian verdict of God. Look at
   the fifth verse of the sixth chapter--God saw not only outward sin that
   was great and multiplied and cried to Him for vengeance--He saw sin in
   the sons of men, the descendants of Cain. Worse still, He saw treachery
   and departure from God in the sons of the chosen ones, the sons of Seth
   had gone astray, also. The sons of God saw the daughters of men, that
   they were fair and the two races became mingled so as to produce
   monsters of iniquity. But, worse than that, He saw that the thoughts of
   men's hearts were evil--man could not think without being evil.

   No, more! The substratum which underlies actual thought--unformed,
   unfashioned thought--the eggs, the embryos of thought, called here the
   imagination of the thought, the first conception, the infant motions of
   the soul--all these God found to be evil. But observe, He says they
   were, "only evil." Not one trace of good! No gold amidst the dross, no
   light amidst the darkness--they were "only evil." And then He adds that
   word "continually." What? Never any repentance? Never any yearning
   towards the right? No pure drops of holiness now and then? No, never!

   "Every imagination"--notice that word. The whole verse is most clear, a
   broom that sweeps man clean of all boasted good. "Every
   imagination"--when he was at his best, when he stood at God's altar,
   when he tried to be right-- even then his thoughts had evil in them!
   Dr. Dick says, "All man's thoughts, all his desires, all his purposes
   are evil, expressly or by implication because the subject of them is
   avowedly sinful, or because they do not proceed from a holy principle
   and are not directed to a proper end. It is not occasionally that the
   human soul is thus under the influence of de- pravity. This is its
   habit and state. It seems impossible to construct a sentence which
   should more distinctly express its total corruption than this."

   Look at this other passage which is our text. You will see it gives a
   different phase of the same evil, but it does not abate one jot or
   tittle of it. It is still, "the imagination of man's heart." It is
   still the inward character, the core, the pith, the marrow of mankind
   which God is dealing with. It is not the stream which comes from man
   that is foul but the fountain of man--the innermost source of the
   fountain! The imagination of his heart is evil--and we are told here
   what we are not told in the other text--that his thoughts are evil from
   his youth, that is to say, from his earliest childhood.

   And it would not be evil from his childhood in every case if there were
   not certain seeds of evil sown before that and therefore we can go
   further and in the words of Holy Scripture we can confess with
   sorrowful truthfulness--"Behold I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin
   did my mother conceive me." From the very earliest imaginable period in
   which human nature exists it is a defiled, tainted thing and only
   worthy of God's utter abhorrence! And were it not that He smells a
   sweet savor in the sacrifice of Christ, He would say, as He did say in
   the sixth chapter, "He repented that He had made man on the earth and
   it grieved Him at His heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom
   I have created from the face of the earth."

   I have thus brought out this painful fact distinctly, I hope, before
   you. It is true both before and after the flood. If you want any proof
   of its being true now turn to the scores of passages of Scripture which
   all prove it. I think, however, if our time were limited, as it is this
   morning, I should prefer to mention the third chapter of Paul's Epistle
   to the Romans. It is the most sweeping description of the universality
   of human depravity that could possibly have been penned. I will read
   from the ninth to the nineteenth verse--"What then? Are we better than
   they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles,
   that they are all under sin as it is written, There is none righteous,
   no, not one: there is none that understands, there is none that seeks
   after God.

   "They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
   unprofitable. There is none that does good, no, not one. Their throat
   is an open sepulcher. With their tongues have they used deceit. The
   poison of asps is under their lips: whose mouth is full of cursing and
   bitterness: their feet are swift to shed blood: destruction and misery
   are in their ways: and the way of peace they have not known: there is
   no fear of God before their eyes. Now we know that what things so ever
   the Law says, it says to them who are under the Law: that every mouth
   may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God."

   Jonathan Edwards says upon this passage, "If the words which the
   Apostle uses here (Rom. 3:10-19) do not most fully and determinately
   signify a universality, no words ever used in the Bible, or elsewhere,
   are sufficient to do it. I might challenge any man to produce any one
   paragraph in the Scripture, from the beginning to the end, where there
   is such a repetition and accumulation of terms so strongly and
   emphatically and carefully formulated to express the most perfect and
   absolutely universality, or any place to be compared to it. What
   instance is there in the Scripture, or indeed any other writing when
   the meaning is only the much greater part?

   "Where this meaning is signified in such a manner by repeating such
   expressions, 'They are all,' 'they are all together,' 'every one,' 'all
   the world' joined to multiplied negative terms, to show the
   universality to be without exception? Saying, 'There is no flesh,'
   'there is none, there is none, there is none, there is none,' four
   times over. Besides the addition of, 'no, not one,' 'no, not one,' once
   and again. . . So that if this matter [universal depravity] is not here
   set forth plainly, expressly and fully, it must be because no words can
   do it. And it is not in the power of language, or any manner of terms
   and phrases, however contrived and heaped one upon another,
   determinately to let us remember the confessions of God's people."

   You never heard a saint on his knees yet tell the Lord that he had a
   good nature, that he did not need renewing. Saints, as they grow in
   Divine Grace, are made to feel more and more acutely the evil of their
   old nature. You will find that those who are most like Christ have the
   deepest knowledge of their own depravity and are most humble while they
   confess their sinfulness. Those men who know not their own hearts may
   be able to boast, but that is simple ignorance, for if you will take
   down the biographies of any persons esteemed among us for holiness and
   for knowledge in the things of God, you will find them frequently
   crying out under a sense of inward carnality and sin.

   If I may return to Scripture I cannot help quoting David, "Behold I was
   born in sin and shapen in iniquity." It is a most villainous thing that
   some persons try to slander David's mother and to suppose that there
   was something irregular about his birth which made him speak as he has
   done! Whereas there cannot be the slightest imputation upon that
   admirable woman. David himself speaks of her with intense respect and
   says, "Save the son of Your handmaid" as though he felt it no discredit
   to be the son of such a woman.

   She was, doubtless, one of the excellent of the earth and yet,
   excellent as she was, it could not but be otherwise that in sin her son
   was conceived. Let us not at all attempt to escape from the force of
   what David says. He is using no exaggerated expressions. There is no
   indication of hyperbole throughout the whole Psalm. He is a
   broken-hearted man on his knees. He is confessing his own sin with
   Bathsheba and is not likely either to bring any accusation against his
   own mother or to use exaggerated terms! Beloved it is so. We, all of
   us, the best of us still have to bear about with us the marks of the
   unclean thing from which we sprang.

   Take Paul again--was there ever a man who knew more of what sanctity of
   nature means, or who was brought nearer to the image of Christ? Yet he
   cries out, "Oh, wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the
   body of this death." He finds no joy until he can say, "I thank God
   through Jesus Christ our Lord." Still I think we have another proof,
   namely, our own observation. We have lived long enough to observe with
   our own eyes and by our reading that sin is the universal disease of
   manhood. Is it not certain, according to observation, that man's heart
   is evil? They used to tell pretty tales about the charming innocence of
   men dwelling in the wooded bowers of primeval forests, untainted by the
   vices of civilization, unpolluted by the inventions of commerce and
   art.

   The woods of America were searched and no such sweet babes of grace
   were discovered. The ferocity and cruelty of the Indians justify my
   saying that they were hateful and hating one another. The blood-red
   tomahawk might have been emblazoned as the Redman's coat of arms and
   his eyes glaring with revenge might be taken as the true index of his
   character. Travelers have penetrated of late into the center of Africa
   where we may expect to see nature in its primitive excellence and what
   is the report that is brought back to us? Why, it is nature in its
   primitive devilry, that is all!

   Let such abominable tyrants as Messrs. Grant and Speke describe to us
   indicate to us what man is when he is left in his primeval state,
   untainted by civilization--he is simply a greater devil--he is naked
   and he is not ashamed! In this, only, is he like our unfallen parents.
   Again, try the mildest races. There is the mild Hindu. You look into
   his gentle face and you cannot suppose him capable of cruelty. Trust
   well that mild Hindu, subdued by British arms so speedily and so
   cheerfully bowing his neck to the yoke. But you may as well trust the
   sleek and cunning tiger from his jungle--let the story of the Sepoy
   rebellion of a few years ago show us the gentleness of the mild Hindu!

   Live among the mild Hindu and if you dare read the first chapter of
   Paul's Epistle to the Romans, remember that it is a decent account of
   what, in ordinary life, is practiced among the Hindu but which could
   not be more clearly described, because the mouth of modesty would
   refuse to speak it and the ears of modesty would tingle at the hearing
   of it. The life of the most respectable Hindu is tainted with vices too
   vile to mention. "Yes, but still," says one, "we must look at children,
   because sin may enter into us through education--let us look at
   children."

   Very well, I am willing to look at children and I am unwilling that
   anybody should say a word that is harsh or severe against children's
   nature. But I will say that any man who declares children to be born
   perfect never was a father! If he would only watch his own child--not
   merely when that child has its toys around it and is pleased and happy,
   but when its little temper is ruffled--he would soon perceive evil
   nestling there. Your child without evil? You without eyes, you mean!!
   If you will only look and listen you will soon discover, if no other
   fault, this one, "they go astray from the womb, speaking lies."

   One of the earliest vices of children which needs to be corrected with
   most constant and wise rigor is the tendency towards falsehood. It is
   all very pretty for people to talk about the innocence of children. But
   I would like them to have to keep one of the nursery schools like those
   at Manchester, where the children are left while the mothers are at
   work in the mills! They would soon discover in their pulling one
   another's hair, and scratching at one another's eyes, and such like
   pretty little diversions and innocent freaks, that they are not
   altogether the sweet babes of innocence they are supposed to be!

   "Well," says one, "still, human nature may have some spiritual good in
   it. Look at the men who make illustrious the page of history--look at
   Socrates, for instance--religion did nothing for Socrates, but yet what
   a fine character he was." Who told you that? I will venture to say that
   the philosopher's character would not bear description in a decent
   assembly. We know from undoubted authority that the purest philosophers
   at times indulged in bestiality and filth. So- lon and Socrates were no
   exceptions. When Infidels hold up these sages as being such patterns of
   what human nature might become, they have history dead against them.
   "The whole head is sick and the whole heart faint. There is no
   soundness in it."

   And this, be it remembered, is without an exception in the long history
   of humanity, say six thousand years. There is not one that has escaped
   contamination, not one who has come into the world clean, not one who
   dares go before his Maker's bar and say, "Great God, I have never
   sinned, but have kept Your Law from my youth up."

   II. Now I want you to notice, in the second place, a most extraordinary
   thing--when I noticed it yesterday I was surprised and overwhelmed with
   grateful admiration--that is, GOD'S EXTRAORDINARY REASONING. Good
   reasoning, but most extraordinary. He says, "I will not again curse the
   ground anymore for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is
   evil from his youth." Strange logic! In the sixth chapter He said man
   was evil and therefore He destroyed him. In the eighth chapter He says
   man is evil from his youth and therefore He will not destroy him!

   Strange reasoning! Strange reasoning!--to be accounted for by the
   little circumstance in the beginning of the verse, "the Lord smelled a
   sweet savor." There was a sacrifice there--that makes all the
   difference! When God looks on sin apart from sacrifice, Justice says,
   "Destroy! Destroy! Smite! Curse! Destroy!" But when there is a
   sacrifice, God looks on sin with eyes of mercy and though Justice says,
   "Destroy," He says, "No, I have punished My dear Son. I have punished
   Him and will spare the sinner." Mercy looks to see if she cannot find
   some loophole, something that she can make into an excuse why she may
   spare mankind.

   Is then, natural depravity, an excuse for sin? Does God use it as such?
   No, Beloved--that our heart is vile is rather an aggravation of the
   vileness of our action than any excuse for it. Yet there is this one
   thing--we are born sinners and God sees there, I will say, a sort of
   loophole. Rightly, upon the terms of Justice, there is no conceivable
   reason why He should have mercy upon us. But Divine Grace makes and
   invents a reason. O may I be helped, while I try to show you where I
   think the ground of mercy lies! Devils fell separately--we have every
   reason to believe that every fallen angel sinned on his own account and
   fell. And it is very likely that on this account there was no
   possibility, as we know of, of their restoration--every separate fallen
   spirit was given up forever to chains and darkness and flames of fire.

   But men! Men did not fall separately and individually. Our case is a
   somewhat different one from that of fallen angels. We, all of us, fell
   without our own consent, without having, in fact, any finger in it,
   actually. We fell federally in our covenant head--it is in consequence
   of our falling in Adam that our heart becomes evil from our youth. Now
   it looks to me as if God's mercy caught that. He seemed to say, "These
   My creatures have, according to my arrangement of federation, fallen
   representatively. Then I can save them representatively. They perished
   in one, Adam. I will save them in Another. They fell not by their own
   overt act, though, indeed, their own overt acts have added to this and
   deserve My wrath, but their first fall was not through themselves. They
   are sinful from their very infancy. Therefore He says, "I will deliver
   them by Another as they fell by another."

   I do not know whether I can make it clear. I do not think that this was
   any reason before the bar of Justice why God should save us, for I
   believe that He might justly have condemned the whole race of Adam on
   account of Adam's sin and their own guilt. But I do think that this was
   a blessed loophole through which His mercy could, as it were, come
   fairly to the sons of men. "There," He says, "I made them not distinct
   individuals but a race. They fell as a race, they shall rise as an
   elect race--'As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
   alive.' 'As by the transgression of one many were made sinners, so by
   the righteousness of one shall many be made righteous.' "

   I think you see the drift of it, then. Man's being sinful, is in the
   logic of justice, a reason for punishment. Man's being sinful from his
   youth by inheritance from his federal head becomes, through mercy, a
   reason why Sovereign Grace should light upon men while fallen angels
   are left to perish forever. Oh, I bless God that I did not fall first
   of all myself. I do bless the day, now, that I fell in Adam, for it may
   be if I had never fallen in Adam I should have fallen in myself and
   then I must have been, like fallen angels, shut out forever from the
   Presence of God and in the flames of Hell! One of the old Divines used
   to say of Adam's sin, "Beata culpa"--"Happy fault!"

   I dare not say that, but in one sense I will say, blessed Fall that
   renders it possible for me to rise! Blessed way of ruin which renders
   it possible for the blessed way of salvation to be brought
   about--salvation by Substitution! Salvation by Sacrifice! Salvation by
   a new Covenant Head, who for us is offered up that God may smell a
   sweet savor and may deliver us! I hope nobody will misconstrue what I
   have said and make out that I teach that human depravity is an excuse
   for sin--God forbid! It is only in the eyes of Divine Grace that it
   becomes the door of mercy.

   You know if your child has offended you, you do not want to chastise
   him and yet you feel he deserves it. How you do try, if you are a
   loving parent, to find some reason why you may let him go. There is no
   reason--you know that. If you deal with him in terms of justice, there
   is no reason why having sinned he should not smart for it. But you keep
   casting about for an excuse--perhaps it is his mother's birthday and
   you let him off for that. Or else there was some little circumstance
   which softened the offense for which you may have him excused.

   I do not know whether the story is true, but it is said of Queen
   Victoria when she was just queen--just a girl--she was asked to sign a
   death warrant for a person who, by court martial, had been condemned to
   die. It is told that she said to the Duke, "Cannot you find any reason
   why this man should be pardoned?" The Duke said, "No, it was a very
   great offense, he ought to be punished." "But was he a good soldier?"
   The Duke said he was a shamefully bad soldier, had always been noted as
   a bad soldier. "Well, cannot you invent for me any reason?" "Well," he
   said, "I have every reason to believe from testimony that he was a good
   man as a man, although a bad soldier." "That will do," she said, and
   she wrote across the warrant, "pardoned"--not because the man deserved
   it--but because she wanted a reason for having mercy.

   So my God seems to look upon man and after He has looked him through
   and through and cannot see anything, at last He says, "He is evil from
   his youth," and he writes "Pardoned." He smells the sweet savor first
   and His heart is turned towards the poor rebel. Then He turns to him
   with mercy and blesses him.

   III. But now, thirdly, by your leave and patience, I shall have to lead
   you to a few inferences from the doctrine of the depravity of man. If
   the heart is so evil, then it is impossible for us to enter Heaven as
   we are. We cannot suppose that those holy gates shall enclose those
   whose imaginations and thoughts are evil, and evil continually. No, if
   that is the place into which nothing shall enter that defiles, then no
   man being what he was in his first birth can ever stand there!

   Another step. Then it is quite clear that if I am to enter Heaven no
   outwardreform will ever do, for if I wash my face, that does not change
   my heart And if I give up all my outward sins and become outwardly what
   I ought to be, yet still, if it is true that my heart is the villainous
   thing which Scripture says it is, then my outward reformation cannot
   touch that and I am still shut out of Heaven. If inside that cup and
   platter there is all this filthiness, I may cleanse the outside, but I
   have not touched that which will shut me out of Heaven.

   I go, then, a little farther and I observe that I must have a new
   nature--not new practice only, but a new nature-- not new thoughts or
   new words, but a new nature so as to become a totally new man. And when
   I draw the inference, I have Scripture to back me at once, for what
   does Jesus say to Nicodemus? "You must be born again." But what is to
   be born again? To my first birth, I owe all I am by nature. I must get
   a secondbirth to which I am to owe all I am as I enter Heaven.
   Multitudes of persons have been saying, "What is Regeneration?" Here
   they have been writing hundreds of pamphlets and no two of them agree
   upon what Regeneration is except that they say that a man may be
   regenerated and not converted.

   Here is an extraordinary thing! An unconverted man who is regenerated?
   One who is an enemy to God and yet he has in himself a new nature? He
   has been born again and yet is not converted to God? What? A
   Regeneration that does not convert? A Regeneration, in fact, that
   leaves men just where they were before? But to every babe in Christ the
   word, "regenerate," is as plain as possible--he wants no definition, no
   description. "To be born again? Why," he says, "I comprehend that it is
   to be made over again, a new creature in Christ Jesus! My first birth
   makes me a creature--my second birth makes me a newcreature and I
   become what I never was before."

   I must remember that what is needed in me is not to bring out and
   develop what is good in me, for, according to God's Word in the sixth
   of Genesis, there is nothing good, it is only evil. Grace does not
   enter to educate the germs of holiness within me, for there is no germ
   of good in man at all--he is "evil continually"-- and every imagination
   is "only evil." I must, then, die to sin! My old nature must be slain,
   it cannot be mended! It is too bad, too rotten to be patched up--that
   must die. By the death of Jesus it must be destroyed. It must be buried
   with Christ and I must rise in resurrection life to conformity with my
   Lord Jesus.

   Well then, advancing one step further--It is clear if I must be this
   before I can enter Heaven that I cannot give myself a new nature. A
   crab tree cannot transform itself into an apple tree! If I am a wolf I
   cannot make myself a sheep. Water can rise to its own proper level, but
   it cannot go beyond it without pressure. I must have, then, something
   worked in me more than I can work in myself and this, indeed, is good
   Scriptural doctrine. "That which is born of the flesh"--what is it?
   When the flesh has done its very best what is it?--"That which is born
   of the flesh is flesh"--it is filthy to begin with and filth comes of
   it--only "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit: marvel not that I
   said unto you you must be born again."

   My soul must come under the hand of the Spirit. Just as a piece of clay
   is on the potter's wheel and is made to revolve and is touched by the
   fingers of the potter and molded into what he wishes it to be, so must
   I lie passively in the hands of the Spirit of God and He must work in
   me to will and to do of His own good pleasure. And then I shall begin
   to work out my own salvation with fear and trembling, but never, never
   till then. I must have more than nature can give me, more than my
   mother gave me, more than my father gave me, more than flesh and blood
   can produce under the most favorable circumstances. I must have the
   Spirit of God from Heaven.

   Then comes this inquiry, "Have I received it? What is the best evidence
   of it?" The best evidence of it is this--Am I resting upon Christ
   Jesus, alone, for salvation? You generally find on potters' vessels
   that there is a certain mark so that you can know who made them. I want
   to know whether I am a vessel fit for the Master's use, molded by His
   hands and fashioned by His Spirit. Now, every single vessel that comes
   out of God's hands has a Cross on it. Have you the Cross on you? Are
   you resting upon Christ's bloody Atonement made on Calvary? Is He to
   your soul your one rock of refuge-- your one only hope? Can you say
   this morning--

   "Nothing in my hands I bring,
   Simply to Your Cross I cling--
   Naked, come to You for dress;
   Helpless, look to You for Grace.
   Black, I to the fountain fly,
   Wash me, Savior, or I die"?

   Then, my Brothers and Sisters, you have a new heart and a right spirit!
   You are a new creature in Christ Jesus, for simple faith in Christ is
   what the old Adam never could attain! A simple faith in Jesus is the
   great, sure mark of a work of the Holy Spirit in your soul by which you
   are made to be a partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light.
   "Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God." Do you
   believe that Jesus is the Christ? Do you take Him to be God's Anointed
   to you? Do you trust yourself to Him to plead for you, to work for you,
   to fulfill the Law for you, to offer Atonement for you?

   If so, if Jesus is the Christ to you--you are born of God. The Spirit
   which is in you now will drive out the old nature, slay it utterly, cut
   it up root and branch and you shall one day bear the image of the
   heavenly, even as you have till now borne the image of the earthly. May
   God bless these words of mine to your souls' good.

   "Eternal Spirit, we confess
   And sing the wonders of Your Grace!
   Your power conveys our blessings down
   From God the Father and the Son.
   Enlightened by Your heavenly ray,
   Our shades and darkness turn to day.
   Your inward teachings make us know
   Our danger and our refuge, too.
   Your power and glory works within,
   And breaks the chains of reigning sin,
   Does our imperious lusts subdue,
   And forms our wretched hearts anew.
   The troubled conscience knows Your voice,
   Your cheering Words awake our joys;
   Your Words allay the stormy wind,
   And calm the surges of the mind."

                   The Special Call And The Unfailing Result

   A SERMON DELIVERED SUNDAY EVENING BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE
   METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "God is faithful, by whom you were called unto the fellowship of His
   Son Jesus, Christ our Lord."

   1 Corinthians 1:9.

   AS I look round upon this large Church, numbering far above two
   thousand members, my soul is often cast down within me. Yes, I am
   brought into the lowest depths of anxiety! Who is sufficient for these
   things? To order and distribute its sacred offices aright, to govern
   with discretion, to exercise discipline with prudence, to hide a strong
   hand and to show at all times a loving heart--such thoughts roll in,
   wave after wave, till they threaten to overwhelm the mind! And then at
   last to render unto the Master an account according to my earnest
   expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed. To be saluted
   of my God at His coming as a faithful and wise servant who has given to
   His household meat in due season. To be approved as a faithful steward
   of the mysteries of God, not having "shunned to declare the whole
   counsel of God," as well to those that did forbear as to those that did
   hear. If such aims do sometimes wind up one's nerves to extraordinary
   energy, they verily make the heart palpitate at other times with the
   fear that haunts and the solemnity that awes our soul.

   Well, well could I be content to renounce so tremendous a charge if it
   were possible! This, however, is always the most painful qualm that
   troubles me. Will all these people hold on their way? They have
   professed to be converted. Many of them have come out from the world,
   and for several years their lives have been distinguished by all
   virtues. These hands have baptized them in the name of the Father, and
   of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. And so far there appears reasonable
   evidence that the Spirit of God has set His seal to their being His
   genuine work by maintaining them in the Truth of God and holiness.

   But will they persevere? Will they hold on? When the world is so full
   of temptations in the midst of this age of sham. When godliness, when
   true godliness is as much hated as ever it was and when spiritual
   religion is as great a mystery as it was to the sages of Areopagus in
   the days of Paul--will these men and women, especially the younger ones
   of them--will they all be found faithful--or will they disgrace the
   cause? Will they stain the escutcheon of Christ? Will they turn their
   backs in the day of battle and prove recreant cowards, traitors to our
   Lord and Master?

   Such a text as this, then, is refreshing, indeed! It comes so softly
   into one's ear and breathes such gentle music because it gives the
   comfort which just meets the difficulty. Yes, yes, they will hold on
   their way! There may be some who will go out from us because they were
   not of us--for if they were of us, doubtless they would have continued
   with us--but still the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal,
   "The Lord knows them that are His." Yes, they shall stand, for God is
   faithful, who has called them unto the fellowship of His Son Jesus
   Christ our Lord!

   Well, now, dear Brothers and Sisters, have you not the same sort of
   trouble rising in your own minds? You look within. You think you see
   what Divine Grace has done for you. You feel as you never did feel
   before conversion. The things you once hated you now love and what you
   once loved you now hate. You feel that there has been a radical change
   in you--one that nature could not effect and your spirit is very glad
   in the prospect of what this will all lead to--"the rest which remains
   for the people of God," and the crown of everlasting life that fades
   not away.

   But here comes in this awkward "but"--you see so much corruption
   within! You feel so much weakness which aids and abets this corruption!
   You foresee so many trials awaiting you that the pale shadow of
   despondency falls on your heart and fitful doubts and questions vex
   your brain. You have no sooner overcome one adversary than you are
   attacked by another and sometimes the evil spirit howls in your ear,
   "God has forsaken you! Now it is all over with you!" And you are ready
   to lie down and die in despair, saying, "I shall one day fall by the
   hand of the enemy, I shall never see His face with joy."

   To you, also, my text comes like a whisper from Heaven--"God is
   faithful" who has called you "unto the fellowship of His Son Jesus
   Christ." My drift this evening will be, while reminding you of your
   calling and of your fellowship, to comfort your hearts with regard to
   your perseverance. He is able to confirm and keep you even to the end
   and He will do it! He will present you blameless in the day of our Lord
   Jesus Christ for this very reason--that He has called you to fellowship
   with Him. What shall we say, then? First, I want to refresh your
   memories with your calling. Secondly, I want to make you exercise your
   fellowship. And, thirdly, I want you to perceive your security.

   I. Beloved Brothers and Sisters in Christ, LET ME REFRESH YOUR MEMORIES
   WITH YOUR CALLING. Was there not a day, the mementoes of which you
   fondly cherish, when you were called from death unto life? Fly back,
   now, to the day and hour if you can and, if not, light upon the season
   thereabouts when the great transaction took place, in which you were
   made Christ's forever, by the voluntary surrender of yourself to Him.
   In looking back, does it not strike you that your calling must have
   been of Divine origin?

   The text says, "God called you"--does not your experience prove the
   same? We thought, perhaps, as the season transpired, that we had had no
   other call than that which came in the word that was addressed to us
   through our godly parents, through our Bibles, through the good books
   that we read. Yet we perceive, in looking back, as the crisis passes
   before us in review, that none of these things ever could have produced
   the effect which has been taking place in us. Did we not read the same
   books years before? They never touched a chord in our hearts! We
   listened to the same minstrel, it may be, scores of times--but he never
   could strike a spark into our dark natures! We had our convictions
   before this, but they were the mere disquietudes of natural conscience
   which died away like the morning's frost, when the sun rises and
   scatters it all.

   Therefore we conclude that this time it must have been something
   special and we think every man that has experienced it will say at
   once, "Yes, I see the finger of God in this! I am absolutely certain it
   was not moral persuasion. It was not the oratory of the preacher. It
   was not the earnestness, even, of my pleading teacher or friend--but
   the hand of God as clear in my conversion as in the resurrection of
   Jesus Christ from the dead." And, being so, Beloved, do you not notice
   at once how irresistible that call was? Oh, we had been called scores
   of times before but we always turned a deaf ear! I can say earnestly
   that I had been dragged to the Cross of Christ before and yet I would
   not go. It was with me as the old proverb has it, "One man may lead a
   horse to water, but twenty cannot make him drink."

   How many times was I lead to the water? Brought to the foot of the
   Cross? Pointed to Christ, pleaded with to look to Him? Urged to put my
   trust in Him, but I would not? I preferred the things of this world and
   I would gladly have followed the devices of my own heart--my own
   willingness and doing and judging--rather than yield to the will, and
   wisdom and kindness of God!

   But when this particular call came, did you struggle against it?
   Perhaps you did, but you had more than your match! Oh, the Divine
   influence, when you threw down your sword and said, "Great God, I
   yield. I know not how it is, but I feel sweet yearnings within. My soul
   relents. I can be Your enemy no more. Your love has destroyed me and
   made me powerless to resist. You have whispered something in my ear--I
   know not how You did it, but 'tis there and I surrender at discretion.
   Do what You will with me, only allow me to know Yourself, that I may be
   saved."

   How gracious that calling must have been since it came to you from God!
   It came to you irresistibly and came to you with such personal
   demonstration! What Grace was here! What was there in you to suggest a
   motive why God should call you? Oh, Beloved, we can hardly ask you that
   question without tears rising in our own eyes--

   "What was there in us that could merit esteem,
   Or give the Creator delight?
   'Twas even so, Father!' we ever must sing,
   'Because it seemed good in Your sight.'"

   Some of you were drunkards, were profane, were injurious. Many of you
   cared neither for God nor man. How often have you mocked at God's Word!
   How frequently have you despised God's ministers! How constantly has
   the holy name of the Most High been used in a flippant, if not in a
   profane manner by you! And yet for all that, He fixed His eyes upon you
   and would not withdraw. And when you spurned the Divine Grace that
   would have saved you, still He followed you, determined to save, till
   at last, in the appointed time, He got the grasp of you and would not
   let you go until He had made you His friend, turned your heart to love
   Him and made your spirit obedient to His Grace!

   I think, throughout eternity, if we had this problem to solve--"why did
   He call me"--we should still go on making wrong guesses! We could never
   arrive at the right conclusion unless we should say, once and for all,
   "I do not know." He did as He willed. He will have mercy on whom He
   will have mercy. He will have compassion on whom He will have
   compassion. And here, let me say, if these things are so, oh should not
   this calling of ours tonight evoke our most intense gratitude, our most
   earnest love? Oh, if He had not called you, where had you been tonight?
   You shall sit tonight at the Lord's Table--where would you have been
   but for Divine Grace?

   To repeat the old saying of John Bradford when he saw a cartful of men
   going off to Tyburn to be hanged, "There goes John Bradford but for the
   Grace of God." When you see the swearer in the street, or the drunkard
   rolling home at night--there are you, there am I--but for the Grace of
   God. Who am I--what should I have been if the Lord, in mercy, had not
   stopped me in my mad career! I know there are some of us who can
   remember the old story of Rowland Hill, when a good Scotchman called to
   see him and without saying a word, sat still for some five minutes,
   looking into the good old gentleman's face.

   At last Rowland Hill asked him what engaged his attention. Said he, "I
   was looking at the lines of your face." Well, what do you make of them?
   "Why," said he, "that if the Grace of God hadn't been in you, you would
   have been the biggest rascal living!" And some of us feel just
   that--that if it had not been for the Grace of God we should have been
   out-and-out ringleaders in every kind of infamy and sin. I know for
   myself I can never do things by halves. If I had served Baal I would
   have built him an altar and made victims smoke upon it day and night.
   And if we serve God zealously and earnestly we have the more reason to
   be humble and to lay low in the dust. For that very zeal of spirit
   would have been turned to the very worst account unless Divine Grace
   had been pleased to transform us.

   Why, there are some people in the world that seem too insipid to do any
   good or hurt and they have reason to be thankful if they are converted.
   But still not that reason that others have, who, if they did mischief,
   would do it with both hands and if they do anything for God, must do it
   with all their might. This was a kind and gracious call, when we
   consider what we might have been. Stand up now, Believer, and look at
   this and remember the Grace of this call when you consider what you
   are.

   Why, Man, tonight, what are you? A pardoned sinner--not a sin against
   you in God's book. What are you?--A justified person. The righteousness
   of Christ girds you--even the eyes of God cannot see a spot in you! You
   are in Christ all fair. There is no spot in you--justified freely by
   His Grace--roll that thought under your tongue as a sweet morsel. What
   are you tonight? You are a son of God, an adopted heir of Heaven, joint
   heir with Christ! You are accepted in the Beloved and very precious to
   Jehovah, Himself. What are you? You are an heir of immortality. Heaven
   is your certain inheritance. Oh, I wish you could believe this! You
   that are Christians and know this to be true, I wish you could realize
   it--that within ten minutes you may be in Heaven with Christ, and that
   within a few years you will be there! Eternal life is yours--not maybe,
   not perhaps--but is yours tonight and you have but to heave one gentle
   sigh and the dust is left behind and the spirit waves the palm and
   wears the crown and sings the eternal hymn before the Throne of God!

   God has called us! Let us look back upon the time of our calling and if
   some such thoughts as these should rise in our minds, they will not be
   unprofitable. They will fill your souls with grateful joy in retracing
   the steps by which you have been led. They will put courage into your
   souls in realizing the Grace by which you now stand. They will clear
   the mist from your eyes in looking forward with cheerful hope to the
   future. I think they will prompt you to take your harp down from the
   willows and touch the strings with melodious song--

   "Every fallen soul, by sinning,
   Merits everlasting pain.
   But Your love, without beginning,
   Has restored Your sons again.
   Countless millions
   Shall in life, through Jesus, reign.
   Pause, my Soul! Adore and wonder!
   Ask, 'O why such love to me?'
   Grace has put me in the number
   Of the Savior's family--Hallelujah,
   Thanks, eternal thanks, to You!"

   II. To what end, or for what purpose did God call you? He called you,
   as we had it this morning, that you might receive Christ and walk in
   Him, or, as the text has it, that you might have fellowship with
   Christ. Now the word "fellowship," [koinonia,] is not properly to be
   interpreted here as a society, but as the result of society--that is to
   say, fellowship lies in mutual and identical interests. A man and his
   wife have fellowship with each other in that which is common to both
   and enjoyed in communion accordingly. All their possessions are joint
   possessions. They are one together in love. And if the wife has
   anything, it is the husband's and the husband, in his love, thinks all
   that he has to be his wife's.

   Now, when we were called to Christ, we were called to have fellowship
   with Him of this peculiar kind--that we became relatively and
   absolutely identical with Christ. We were made one with Him so that
   everything Christ had became ours. This was the act of faith to let us
   take hold of what Christ had. And this is the result of faith--to give
   us Christ and to give us to Christ--so that we are in kinship together
   and made one person, Christ the Head and we the members. Now we have a
   unity to Christ, a fellowship to Christ, first in His loves. What
   Christ loves we love. He loves the saints--so do we.

   He loves sinners--so do we. He loves the world and pants to see it
   transformed into the garden of the Lord--so do we. Whatever Christ
   loves, our heart loves, for our heart and Christ's heart are welded
   together--put into the same furnace and then made into one--so that
   what He loves we love and what He hates and detests and abhors, we also
   deprecate and loathe. Then we are one with Christ in His desires. Does
   Christ desire anything?--So do we. He desires to see multitudes
   saved--so do we. He desires the Glory of God--we also labor for the
   same. He desires that the saints may be with Him where He is--we desire
   to be with Him there, too. He desires to drive out sin--behold we fight
   under His banner.

   He desires that his Father's name may be loved and adored by all His
   creatures--we pray daily, "Let Your kingdom come and Your will be done
   on earth, even as it is in Heaven." We are called, then, to a
   fellowship with Christ in having the same loves and the same desires.
   So, too, in our measure we have the same sufferings. We are not nailed
   to the Cross, nor do we die a bloody death. Yet many of our compeers
   that have gone before have done so and if it ever came to that, there
   are still millions of us, with true hearts, as ever became sacrifices
   to God in England. And when Christ is reproached, we are reproached and
   we have learned to bear His reproach, too.

   It is a very sweet thing to be blamed for Christ's sake--to be despised
   for following the Master, to have the wits of the world against
   us--'tis well, 'tis well. It was so with Him. The servant would not be
   above his master, nor the disciple above his Lord. Some few drops of
   His cup we drink and they are but few. And yet it has been given to
   some more than to others to "fill up that which is behind of the
   afflictions of Christ for His body's sake, which is the Church." And,
   Beloved, we also have fellowship with Christ in His joys as well as in
   His trials. Is He happy? We are happy to think Christ is happy.

   I do not know whether you have ever drank that joy, Believer, but I
   have found it a very sweet joy to be joyful because Christ is joyful.
   You may have known some friend, perhaps, who had another dear friend
   and he saw that friend prospering in the world. He did not get on
   himself as he could wish. He was sickly, he was often low in
   spirit--but somehow, as often as ever he saw his friend, marked his
   prosperity, saw his happy wife and smiling children, he said, "It
   always makes me happy to think how you prosper." There was true
   friendship. Now between Christ and His people there is such love that
   if Christ is crowned, never mind where I am--if God also has highly
   exalted Him, what does it matter, what does it matter even though He
   crush me in the very dust?

   I think a man must undergo some overwhelming trouble before he can lay
   hold on this as a comfort. But if he can once get it, from my own
   experience I bear witness, there is no sweeter, more thrilling delight
   to be known this side of Heaven than that of having Christ's joy
   fulfilled in us that our joy may be full. Oh, see Him rise! See Him
   crowned! Hear the songs of angels! Mark the terror of devils! Know that
   His name is high over all in Heaven and earth and sky and you will
   feel, "Well, well, all these things that I have to suffer are nothing.
   It does not matter--it is all well, Christ is exalted--and I am
   perfectly content." This is to have fellowship with the Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   Nor does the fellowship end here! Nor is it possible tonight to go
   through the whole of it, for our fellowship with Christ leads us to be
   partakers of all His riches. Whatever Christ has belongs to us. If He
   has riches in pardoning, supporting, instructing, illuminating,
   sanctifying, preserving or perfecting Christians, they are all ours. Is
   His blood precious? It is mine. Is His righteousness complete? It is
   mine. Are His merits sweet? They are mine. Has He power in inter-
   cession? It is mine. Has He wisdom, righteousness--has He anything? It
   is mine. The father has called us to have fellowship with Christ and to
   be partakers in all He has. So is it with all His Glory. There is not a
   crown He wears but we have part of it--no, there is not a gem that
   sparkles in a crown He wears but it sparkles for us as well as for Him!

   For us the golden streets! For us the chariot in which He rides along
   them! For us the crowding angels! For us the joyous acclamations! For
   us those chords of music! For us the shout of, "Hallelujah, Hallelujah!
   For You were slain and have redeemed the saints unto God by Your
   blood." For us the Second Advent with all its splendors. For us the
   universal reign of Christ, the gathered scepters and the congregated
   crowns. For us the Day of Judgment with the reeling columns of the sky,
   and the rocks dissolved before the heat of the blast of His anger. For
   us the angels as they gather up the righteous and even for us the
   triumph of the Lord, when with shout of archangel He shall destroy His
   adversaries with the breath of His nostrils forever!

   There is nothing to come in Scripture, or in all the prophecies that
   are yet to be fulfilled when Christ shall come-- there is nothing
   anywhere to be revealed concerning Christ, but what is ours, since our
   fellowship is with Him. And all this, Brothers and Sisters, leads to
   practical spiritual fellowship with Christ! I hope that you who are in
   Christ will strive tonight to realize that you are in Him. Come now, I
   am not trying to preach. I want to talk this over with you. If you
   believe you are in Christ you are one with Him tonight. Say, then, to
   your soul, "You are one with Christ even now. In yourself you are
   everything that is vile, but in Him you are nothing of the sort. My
   Soul, tonight you are strong and rich and blessedly perfect. In Him you
   are in Heaven. In Him there is nothing to taunt you, nothing to accuse
   you, much less any thing to condemn you."

   Come, put on your silver sandals, daughter of Zion! Wrap yourself now
   in your scarlet and fine linen which your Lord has bought for you! Come
   with Him up to the mountain and sit with Him awhile, "Far from this
   world of grief and sin," and let Him speak to you while He tells you,
   "You are Mine and I am yours." Then will you be able to say, "Truly,
   our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ."

   III. Now we conclude by noticing the third point in two or three words.
   All this leads us to perceive our security. Saints must be saved--it
   cannot be otherwise--for two reasons. First, because God has called
   them. Now the gifts and calling of God are, according to Scripture,
   "without repentance," that is to say, if He has once called a man, He
   never sends him back again. What? Give me quickening Grace and let me
   die after it? Give me to taste the joys of the Spirit and yet take them
   away from my lips forever?

   Why this were unheard of cruelty! For God to destroy the guilty in Hell
   is just, but, I venture to say, that for God to give spiritual
   enjoyments, the intense, the unutterable intense delights of spiritual
   enjoyment and not intend that the person should always enjoy these--to
   take them away forever--would be to put a sting into Hell which I
   cannot conceive of, because He is faithful in all His ways and
   righteous in all His judgments. No, let the sinner bear his guilt, but
   do not add the unnecessary torment of letting him, first of all, know
   the hope of eternal life and then find himself disappointed.

   Does God play fast and loose? Does He give and then take back again?
   Does He make us nobles and then degrade us into beggars? Does He put
   crowns on our heads and then slay us? Does He make us His children and
   then cast us out of the family? God forbid! These are unheard of things
   for a God to do. God is faithful who has called you. Having called you,
   He has justified you! Having justified you He will glorify you! Then
   again, there is another reason why you are saved. He has called you
   into fellowship with Christ and that fellowship, if God is faithful,
   must be complete. You have shared His sufferings, you have had to bear
   a part of His reproach--His faithfulness secures the rest. He is "the
   strength," yes, the eternity of Israel! "He is not a man that He should
   repent."

   Pronounce His name with reverence--it has in it more virtue than ten
   thousand material pledges. He is God-- therefore He will maintain the
   fellowship all the way through. Am I to bear the Cross and not to wear
   the crown? Am I to come as a guilty sinner and have fellowship in His
   blood and yet not have fellowship in the Heaven into which, by that
   blood, He entered as my representative? Am I to come and trust Christ
   and have fellowship in the merit of that dying Savior and yet have no
   fellowship in His living power? Am I today, by faith, to be in
   fellowship with Him and never by sight to have the same? Oh this were
   strange! Oh this were two modes of acting, sowing many seeds! This were
   having mixed weights in the bag!

   God acts on one principle, not on two--and where He calls us to be His
   sons and to be partners with Christ--He will carry out the deed of
   partnership and we shall see His face! And we shall wear His crown and
   we shall sit upon His Throne--and all that shall come by-and-by.
   Therefore, courage, Brothers and Sisters, and let us rejoice tonight,
   while we come to the Table, that we are secure, for God has called
   us--we must be saved, for we have fellowship with Christ.

   Now I have been preaching only to the people of God and there is a
   large number of my hearers that are not of this happy family. I wish I
   were preaching to them also! But the time has fled. Let me say this
   word of encouragement to them--the Divine Grace that called us can call
   you! You cannot save yourself, but He can save you and here is a
   promise which He gives you--"Whoever shall call upon the name of the
   Lord shall be saved." To call upon that name is to invoke it in
   prayer--venture upon it in fact and trust it by faith.

   If you believe in Christ you shall be saved. I know not who you may be.
   To every creature under Heaven the same Gospel is preached, "Believe in
   the Lord Jesus Christ and you"--I know not to whom that refers just
   now--"you"-- tough you are the vilest sinner living--"you shall be
   saved." Trust Christ now and your sins are gone! Rest on Him and you
   are snatched from the kingdom of evil and put into the republic of
   life--you become members of Christ's body--you are, by His Grace,
   saved!--

   "Oh, believe the message true, God to you His Son has given." Cast
   yourself upon Him! Trust His Grace and Heaven is yours forever! The
   Lord add His blessing, now, for Christ's sake. Amen.

                        Christ Our Life--Soon To Appear

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 26, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear
   with Him in glory."

   Colossians 3:4.

   MY discourse on Sunday mornings is very frequently the gathering up of
   the thoughts and experiences of the week-- a handful of barley which I
   have gleaned among the sheaves. But I could not thrust upon you, this
   morning, the poverty-stricken productions of my own insufferable
   dullness of brain, weariness of heart and sickness of spirit during
   this week, for this were a sure method of making you partakers of my
   misery. I have wandered through a wilderness, but I will not scatter
   handfuls of the hot sand among you. I have traversed the valley of the
   shadow of death, but I will not repeat the howling of Apollyon.

   This day of rest is appointed for a far better purpose. Scarcely
   knowing how to fulfill the appointed service of this morning, I sit
   down and remember the ancient minstrel, who, when the genius of song
   had for a time departed from him, was nevertheless called upon to
   discourse sweet music. What could he do but play his fingers among the
   strings of his harp and begin some old accustomed strain? His fingers
   and his lips moved at first mechanically. The first few stanzas dropped
   from him from mere force of habit and fell like stones without life or
   power. But by and by he struck a string which woke the echoes of his
   soul--a note fell on his heart like a blazing torch and the smoldering
   fire within his soul suddenly flamed up. The Heaven-born muse was with
   him and he sang as in his better times.

   So may it be my happy lot this morning--to place my fingers on the
   strings which know so well the name of Jesus-- and begin to discourse
   upon a theme which so constantly has made these walls ring! Although at
   first insipid periods may try your patient ears, yet shall they
   nevertheless lead to something that may kindle in you hope and joy and
   love, if not rapture and delight! O for the wings of eagles to bear our
   souls upward towards the Throne of our God! Already my heart warms with
   the expectation of a blessing!

   Does the earth feel the rising of the sun before the first bright beams
   gild the east? Are there not sharp-witted birds which know within
   themselves that the sunbeams are on the road and therefore begin right
   joyously to wake up their fellows to tell them that the morning comes
   leaping over the hills? Certain hopeful, joyful thoughts have entered
   within our heart--prophetic of the Comforter's Divine appearing--to
   make glad our souls. Does not the whole earth prophecy the coming of
   the happy days of spring? There are certain little bulbs that swell,
   and flowers that peep from under the black mold and say, "We know what
   others do not know, that the summer's coming, coming very soon."

   And surely there are rising hopes within us this morning which show
   their golden flowers above our heaviness and assure us with joyful
   accents that Christ is coming to cheer our hearts yet again! Believer,
   you shall once again behold His comfortable Presence! You shall no
   longer cry unto Him out of the depths, but your soul shall lean upon
   His arm and drink deep of His love! Beloved, I proceed in the hope that
   the gracious Lord will favor His most unworthy servant and in His mercy
   fulfill our best expectations.

   Our text is a very simple one and bears upon its surface four thoughts.
   First, that Christ is our life. That, secondly, Christ is hidden and so
   is our life. That thirdly, Christ will one day appear. And, fourthly,
   that when He appears, we, also, shall appear with Him in glory.

   I. The first most precious and experimental doctrine lies in these
   words, "CHRIST WHO IS OUR LIFE." We hardly realize that we are reading
   in Colossians when we meet with this marvelously rich expression. It is
   so like John's way of talking.

   See his opening words in his Gospel, "In Him was life and the life was
   the light of men." Remember how he reports the words at Lazarus' tomb,
   "I am the resurrection and the life." How familiarly he speaks of the
   Lord Jesus under the same Character in his first Epistle--"That which
   was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with
   our eyes, which we have looked upon and our hands have handled, of the
   Word of life. For the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear
   witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the Father
   and was manifested unto us."

   How closely John cleaves to Jesus! He does not say, as the preacher of
   this morning will--Christ is the food of our life and the joy of our
   life and the object of our life and so on. No, but "Christ is our
   life." I think that Peter or James would have said, "He is the strength
   or guide of our life," but John must put his head right on the Savior's
   bosom--he cannot talk at a distance, or whisper from a second seat--his
   head must go sweetly down upon the Savior's heaving bosom.

   He must feel himself in the closest, nearest possible contact with his
   Lord. And so he puts it, "The life was manifested," getting to the very
   pith and marrow of it at once. Paul has somewhat of the same loving
   spirit, and if not entitled to be called, "that disciple whom Jesus
   loved," the angel might well have addressed him as he did Daniel, "O
   man, greatly beloved." Therefore, you see, he leaps at once into the
   depths of the Truth of God and delights to dive in it. Whereas others,
   like the Israelites, stand outside the bound which surrounds the mount,
   he, like Moses, enters into the place where God is and beholds the
   excellent glory.

   We, I fear, must compass this holy Truth round about before we can
   fully enter into it. Blessed is it to wait at the doors of such a
   Truth, though far better to enter in. Let it be understood that it is
   not natural but spiritual life of which the text treats and then we
   shall not mislead the ignorant.

   1. Christ is the source of our life. "For as the Father raises up the
   dead, and quickens them, even so the Son quickens whom He will." Our
   Lord's own words are--"Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that hears My
   Word and believes on Him that sent Me has everlasting life and shall
   not come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life. Verily,
   verily, I say unto you, the hour is coming and now is, when the dead
   shall hear the voice of the Son of God. And they that hear shall live."

   Four verilies, as if to show the importance of the Truth here taught to
   us. We are dead in sin. That same voice which brought Lazarus out of
   the tomb brings us out of our grave of sin. We hear the Word of God and
   we live according to the promise--"Awake you that sleep and arise from
   the dead and Christ shall give you light" (Eph. 5:14). Jesus is our
   Alpha, as well as our Omega--He is the Author of our faith, as well as
   its Finisher. We should have been to this day dead in trespasses and
   sins if it had not been said, "And you has He quickened." It is by His
   life that we live. He gives us the living water which is in us a well
   of water springing up unto everlasting life.

   2. Christ is the Substance of our spiritual life. What is life? The
   physician cannot discover it. The anatomist hunts in vain for it
   through flesh and nerve and brain. Be quick, Sir, with that scalpel of
   yours! "Life's just departed," men say. Cut quick to the heart and see
   if you cannot find, at least, some lingering footprint of the departed
   thing called life. Subtle anatomist, what have you found? Look at that
   brain--what can you see there but a certain quantity of matter
   strangely fashioned? Can you discover what is life?

   It is true that somewhere in that brain and in that spinal cord it
   dwells and that heart with its perpetual pumping and heaving has
   something or other to do with it--but where is the substance, the real
   substance of the thing called life? Ariel's wings cannot pursue it--it
   is too subtle. Thought knows it but cannot grasp it--knows it from its
   being like itself, but cannot give a picture of it--nor represent what
   it is. In the new nature of the Christian there is much mystery, but
   there is none as to what is its life! If you could cut into the center
   of the renewed heart you would find sure footprints of Divine life, for
   you would find love to Jesus.

   No, you would find Christ Himself there! If you walk in search of the
   springs of the sea of the new nature, you will find the Lord Jesus at
   the fount of all. "All my springs are in You," said David. Christ
   creates the life-throbs of the Believer's soul! He sends the
   life-floods through the man according to His own will! If you could
   penetrate the brain of the Believer you would find Christ to be the
   central thought moving every other thought and causing every other
   thought to take root and grow out of itself! You would find Christ to
   be the true Substance of the inner life of the spiritual nature of
   every soul quickened by the breath of Heaven's life.

   3. Christ is the Sustenance of our life. What can the Christian feed
   upon but Jesus' flesh and blood? As to his natural life he needs bread,
   but as to his spiritual life, of which, alone, we are now speaking, he
   has learned that, "man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word
   which proceeds out of the mouth of God shall man live." "This is the
   bread which comes down from Heaven, that a man may eat of it and not
   die. I am the living bread which came down from Heaven. If any man eats
   of this bread, he shall live forever--and the bread that I will give is
   My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."

   We cannot live on the sand of the wilderness. We want the manna which
   drops from on high. Our skin bottles of creature confidence cannot
   yield us a drop of moisture--we drink of the Rock which follows us and
   that rock is Christ. O wayworn Pilgrims in this wilderness of sin! You
   never get a morsel, much less a meal to satisfy the craving hunger of
   your spirits except you find it in Christ Jesus! When you feed on Him
   your soul can sing, "He has satisfied my mouth with good things, so
   that my youth is renewed like the eagle's." But if you have Him not,
   your bursting wine vat and your well-filled barn can give you no sort
   of satisfaction--rather you will lament over them in the words of
   Wisdom-- "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity!"

   O how true are Jesus' own Words, "For My flesh is meat, indeed, and My
   blood is drink, indeed. He that eats My flesh and drinks My blood
   dwells in Me and I in him. As the living Father has sent Me and I live
   by the Father: so he that eats Me, even he shall live by Me." Christ is
   the solace of our life! Noah's ark had but one window and we must not
   expect more. Jesus is the only window which lets light into the
   Christian's spirit when he is under sharp affliction. Kirke White's
   picture of his midnight voyage, when one star alone of all the train
   could guide the mariner's foundering boat to the port of peace, is a
   faint but truthful representation of the Christian's life in its hour
   of peril.

   Paul says that during his disastrous voyage, "neither sun nor stars for
   many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on them and all hope that
   they should be saved was taken away, but then, just then, the Angel of
   God stood at his side." And even so will the Lord Jesus appear to His
   saints in their extremities and be their joy and safety. And, Brethren,
   if Christ appears, what matters it where we are?--

   "Midst darkest shades if He appears My dawning is begun. He is my
   soul's bright morning star, And He my rising sun."

   Do not talk of poverty! Our tents are the curtains of Solomon and not
   the smoke-dried skins of Kedar when Christ is present! Speak not of
   need! There are all manner of precious fruits laid up for my Beloved
   when He comes into my cot. Speak not of sickness! My soul is no longer
   sick except it is of love, but full of holy health when once the Sun of
   Righteousness has risen with healing beneath His wings! Christ is the
   very soul of my soul's life. His loving kindness is better than life!
   There is nothing in life worth living for but Christ. "Whom have I in
   Heaven but You and there is none upon earth that I desire beside You!"

   The rest is mere skim milk and curds fit to be given to the swine, but
   Christ is the cream. All else is but the husk and bran and coarse
   gritty meal. The Lord Jesus is the pure flour. All that remains is the
   chaff--fan it and the wind shall carry it away, or the fire shall burn
   it and little shall be the loss! Christ is the golden grain, the only
   thing worth having. Life's true life, the true heart's blood, the
   innermost fount of life is in Jesus. To the true Christian, Christ is
   the object of his life. As speeds the ship towards the port, so hastens
   the Believer towards the haven of his Savior's bosom. As flies the
   arrow to its goal, so flies the Christian towards the perfecting of his
   fellowship with Christ Jesus. As the soldier fights for his captain and
   is crowned in his captain's victory, so the Believer contends for
   Christ and gets his triumph out of the triumphs of his Master.

   "For him to live is Christ"--at least it is this he seeks after and
   counts that all life apart from this is merely death in another form.
   That wicked flesh of his. That cumbrous clay. Those many temptations.
   That Satanic trinity of the world, the flesh, and the devil--all these
   mar his outward actions. But if he could be what he would be, he would
   stand like the bullock at Christ's altar to be slaughtered, or march
   forward like a bullock in Christ's furrow to plough the blood-bought
   field. He desires that he may not have a hair of his head
   unconsecrated, nor heave one breath which is not for his Savior, nor
   speak one word which is not for the glory of his Lord!

   His heart's ambition is to live so long as he can better glorify Christ
   on earth than in Heaven and to be taken up when it shall be better for
   him and more honorable for his Master that he should be with Jesus
   where He is. As the river seeks the sea, so, Jesus, I seek You! O let
   me find You and melt my life into Yours forever! It follows from all
   this that Christ is the Exemplar of our life. A Christian lays the life
   of Christ before him as the schoolboy puts his copy at the top of the
   page and he tries to draw each line, down-stroke and up-stroke,
   according to the handwriting of Christ Jesus.

   He has the portrait of Christ before him as the artist has in his
   studio his Greek sculptures, busts and torsos. He knows that there is
   all the true anatomy of virtue in Christ. If he wants to study life, he
   studies from Christ, or, if he would closely learn the beauties of the
   antique, he studies from the Savior, for Christ is ancient and modern,
   antique and living, too! Therefore God's artists in their
   life-sculpture keep to the Savior and count that if they imitate every
   vein and fetch out every muscle of their great Copy, they shall then
   have produced the perfection of manhood. I would give nothing for your
   religion if you do not seek to be like Christ! Where there is the same
   life within, there will, there must be, to a great extent, the same
   developments without.

   I have heard it said and I think I have sometimes noticed it, that
   husbands and wives who are truly knit together in near and dear
   conjugal affection, grow somewhat like each other in expression, if not
   in feature. This I well know, that if the heart is truly wedded to the
   Lord Jesus and lives in near fellowship with Him, it must grow like He
   is. Grace is the light, our loving heart is the sensitive plate, Jesus
   is the Person who fills the lens of our soul and soon a heavenly
   photograph of His Character is produced. There will be a similarity of
   spirit, temper, motive and action. It will not be manifest merely in
   great things but in little matters, too, for even our speech will
   betray us.

   Thus you see I have only been wading along the banks, or at best
   conducting you up to the knees in the gently flowing stream of my text.
   Experience must lead you further, for there is a great deep here. Paul
   could perceive it, for he does not say as I have been saving, "Jesus is
   the Source of our life, the Substance of our life, the Solace of our
   life, the Object of our life, the Exemplar of our life." Paul says,
   "Christ is our life," and so He is, indeed.

   Just as we have a natural life of which we know so little, so we have a
   spiritual life which is more mysterious by far and of that we know
   beyond its effects and operations little more than this--that Christ is
   that life. That when we get Christ we have eternal life. That if we
   have life it is only because we have Christ in us, the hope of Glory. I
   must pause a minute here to say that what is true concerning our
   spiritual life, now, is equally true of our spiritual life in Heaven.
   Different as are the circumstances of the life in Heaven and the life
   on earth, yet as to real essence there is only one life in both places.
   Saints in Heaven live by precisely the same life which makes them live
   here.

   Spiritual life in the kingdom of Grace and in the kingdom of Glory is
   the same--only here it is uneducated spiritual life--there it is
   educated and trained. Here it is undeveloped, it is the babe, the
   child--there it is developed, manifested, perfected. But in very deed
   the life is precisely the same. Saints need not to be born again after
   once being regenerate. You who have been born again have now within you
   the life which will last on throughout eternity! You have the very same
   vital spark of heavenly flame which will burn in Glory, world without
   end. It will be no digression if we here remark that as we have eternal
   life in having Christ, this marks our dignity.

   "Christ our life!" Why, this cannot be said of princes or kings! What
   is their life? Talk of blue blood and pedigree, and so on--here is
   something more, here is God's own Son--our life! You cannot say this of
   angels. Bright spirits, your songs are sweet and your lives are happy,
   but Christ is not your life! No, this cannot be asserted of archangels.
   Gabriel! You may bend yourself before God's Throne and worship Him in
   praises too high for me, but you cannot boast what I can surely
   claim--that Christ is my life!

   Even those mysterious presences--angels of whom we read in Ezekiel and
   Revelation called the four living creatures--though they seem to bear
   up the moving throne of Deity, creatures who appear to be an embodiment
   of Divine power and glory--yet even of these it is not written that
   Christ is their life! Herein men--redeemed, elect, favored men rise to
   a supernatural light, for they can say what no spirits but those
   redeemed by blood may venture to assert--"Christ is our life." Does not
   this account for Christian holiness? How can a man live in sin if
   Christ is his life? Jesus dwells in him and he continues in sin?
   Impossible! Can he sin without his life? He must do so if he sins,
   because Christ cannot sin and Christ is his life.

   Why, if I see the saint ever so self-denying, ever so zealous, ever so
   earnest, ever so like his Lord, it is no wonder now, when I understand
   that Christ is his life! See how secure the Christian is. No dagger can
   reach his life, for it is hidden beyond the skies. No temptation, no
   hellish blast, no exhalation from the Stygian pits of temptation can
   ever, with burning fever or chill consumption, waste the life of the
   Christian spiritually. No, it is hid with Christ! It is Christ and
   unless Christ dies, the Christian's life dies not. Oh how safe, how
   honored, how happy is the Christian!

   But we may not linger longer, time warns us to proceed. There is much
   more than ever we shall be able to bring out. Let down your
   buckets--here is a deep well! I hope you have something to draw
   with--and you that have life within have. You that have not may look
   down the well and see the darkness, or the reflection of the water--but
   you cannot reach the cooling flood. It is only you who can draw who can
   know the excellence of this living water. I pray the Lord help you to
   drink to the full and draw again! There is no fear of ever draining the
   inexhaustible fullness of this deep Truth of God.

   II. Now, as our Lord Jesus has not yet appeared in His Glory, OUR LIFE
   IS THEREFORE HIDDEN. "The earnest expectation of the creature waits for
   the manifestation of the sons of God," but as yet they are unknown and
   unmani-fested. The major part of the Believer's life is not seen at all
   and never can be by the unspiritual eye. Where is Christ? To the
   worldling at the present moment there is no such Person as Christ. He
   says, "I cannot see Him, touch Him, hear Him. He is beyond all
   cognizance of my senses. I do not believe in Him." Just such is
   spiritual life to the unbeliever.

   You must not expect, because you are a Christian, that unbelievers will
   begin to admire you and say, "What a mystery! This man has a new life
   in him! What an admirable thing, what a desirable possession! We wish
   we partook of the same." Nothing of the kind. They do not know that you
   have such a life at all. They can see your outward actions, but your
   inward life is quite out of reach of their observation.

   Christ is in Heaven today. He is full of joy. But the world does not
   know His joy. No worldly heart is boasting and rejoicing because Christ
   is glad in Heaven. Christ today is pleading before the Father's Throne,
   but the world does not see Christ's engagements. Christ's occupations
   are all hidden from carnal eyes. Christ at this present moment reigns
   and has power in Heaven and earth and Hell--but what does the worldly
   man see of it? Jesus has fellowship with all His saints everywhere--but
   what does the ungodly discern? I might stand and preach until midnight
   concerning my Lord, but all that men who are unconverted would gain
   would be to hear what I have to tell and then to say, "Perhaps it is
   true." But they could not possibly discern it--the thing is beyond the
   cognizance of sense.

   So is our spiritual life. Beloved, you may reign over sin, but the
   sinner does not comprehend your being a king. You may officiate as a
   priest before God, but the ungodly man does not perceive your
   priesthood and your worship. Do not expect him to do so! Your labor is
   lost if you try by any way to introduce him to these mysteries except
   by the same door through which you came yourself. I never try to teach
   a horse astronomy--and to teach an unconverted man spiritual experience
   would be a folly of the same sort. The man who knows nothing of our
   inner life takes up "Pilgrim's Progress," and he says, "Yes, it is a
   very wonderful allegory."

   It is, Sir, but unrenewed minds know nothing about it. When we have
   sometimes read explanations of the Pilgrim's Progress, we could not but
   detect that the writer of the explanation had need to have had it
   explained to himself. He could describe the shell, but the kernel of
   the nut was far beyond his reach! He had not learned to crack the shell
   and to feed upon the meat. Now it must be so, it must be so, if Christ
   is our life. Christ has gone away and cannot be seen. It must be so
   that the greater proportion of the spiritual life must be forever a
   secret to all but spiritual men.

   But there is a part which men do see and that I may liken to Christ
   when He was on earth--Christ seen of men and angels. What did the world
   do with Christ as soon as they saw Him? Set Him in the chair of State
   and fall down and worship His absolute perfection? No, not they--"He
   was despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with
   grief." Outside of the camp was His place! Cross-bearing was for Him
   His occupation, not of one day, but of every day. Did the world yield
   Him solace and rest?

   Foxes, you have your holes! Birds of the air, you have your nests! But
   the Son of Man had no where to lay His head! Earth could afford Him no
   bed, no house, no shelter! At last it cast Him out for death and
   crucified Him and then would have denied Him a tomb if one of His
   disciples had not begged His body! Such you must expect to be the lot
   of the part of your spiritual life which men can see. As soon as they
   see it to be spiritual life, they will treat it as they treated the
   Savior.

   They will despise it. "Sure!" they say, "pretty fancies, fine airs,
   nice ideas." You expect them to give you comfort, do you? Worldlings to
   give you comfort? Do you think that Christ will have anywhere to lay
   His head in this world today any more than He had 1800 years ago? You
   go about to find what God gives the foxes and the birds--but what He
   never meant to give to you in this world--a place to lay your head.
   Your place to lay your head is up yonder on your Savior's bosom, but
   not here. You dream that men will admire you, that the more holy you
   are and the more Christ-like you are, the more peaceable people will be
   towards you. My dear Friends, you do not know what you are thinking!

   "It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master and the servant
   as his lord. If they have called the master of the house, Beelzebub,
   how much more shall they call them of His household?" I believe if we
   were more like Christ we should be much more loved by His friends and
   much more hated by His enemies. I do not believe the world would be
   half so lenient to the Church, today, if it were not that the Church
   has grown complacent to the world.

   When any of us speak up boldly, mercenary motives are imputed to us!
   Our language is turned upside down and we are abhorred of men. We get
   smooth things, Brethren, because I am afraid we are too much like the
   false prophets who prophesied peace, peace, where there was no peace.
   Let us be true to our Master! Stand out and come out and be like He,
   and we must expect the same treatment which He had. And if we receive
   it we can only say, "This is what I expected."--

   " ' Tis, no surprising thing
   That we should be unknown.
   The Jewish world knew not their king,
   God's everlasting Son."

   III. CHRIST WILL APPEAR. The text speaks of it as a fact to be taken
   for granted. "When Christ, who is our life, shall appear." It is not a
   matter of question in the Christian Church whether Christ will appear
   or not. Has not Christ appeared once? Yes, after a certain sort. I
   remember reading a quaint expression of some old Divine that the book
   of Revelation might quite as well be called an Obvelation, for it was
   rather a hiding than a revealing of things to come. So, when Jesus came
   it was hardly a revealing, it was a hiding of our Lord.

   It is true that He was "manifest in the flesh," but it is equally true
   that the flesh shrouded and concealed His Glory. The first
   manifestation was very partial--it was Christ seen through a
   glass--Christ in the mist of grief and the cloud of humiliation. Christ
   is yet to appear in the strong sense of the word "appearing." He is to
   come out and shine forth. He is to leave the robes of scorn and shame
   behind and to come in the Glory of the Father and all His holy angels
   with Him. This is the constant teaching of the Word of God and the
   constant hope of the Church, that Christ will appear.

   A thousand questions at once suggest themselves--How will Christ
   appear? When will Christ appear? Where will Christ appear? And so on.
   What God answers we may enquire, but some of our questions are mere
   impertinence. How will Christ appear? I believe Christ will appear in
   Person. Whenever I think of the Second Coming, I never can tolerate the
   idea of a spiritual coming. That always seems to me to be the most
   transparent folly that can possibly be put together, because Christ
   cannot come spiritually--He is always here! "Lo! I am with you always,
   even unto the end of the world."

   Christ's spiritual coming never can be that which is spoken of in
   Scripture, as the day of our release. I sometimes say to Brethren, "Do
   you think if Christ were to come spiritually now, we should observe the
   ordinances better?" "Yes, certainly." "Do you think, for instance, the
   ordinance of the Lord's Supper would be better attended to?" "Yes, no
   doubt it would." Yes, but then this proves that this is not the coming
   which the Bible speaks of, because it is expressly said of the Lord's
   Supper that we are to do it in remembrance of Him, till He comes. A
   spiritual coming would make us do it more zealously.

   There must be another form of coming which would justify our giving up
   the Supper altogether and that must be of a personal character--for
   then, and then only, might the Supper properly cease. We shall not need
   to have a supper to remind us of the Person, when the Person Himself
   shall be present in our midst reigning and triumphant in His Church! We
   believe in a Personal reign and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. But
   how will He come? He will doubtless come with great splendor. The
   angels of God shall be His attendants. We gather from Scripture that He
   will come to reign in the midst of His people. That the house of Israel
   will acknowledge Him as King--yes, that all nations shall bow down
   before Him and kings shall pay Him homage.

   None shall be able to stand against Him. "Those that pierced Him shall
   wail because of Him." He will come to discern between the righteous and
   the wicked, to separate the goats from the sheep. He will come
   graciously to adjudge His people their reward according to their works.
   He will give to those who have been faithful over a few things to be
   rulers over many things. And those who have been faithful over many
   things shall be rulers over many cities. He will come to discern
   between the works of His people--such as are only wood, hay and stubble
   will be consumed. Such as are gold and silver and precious stones will
   stand the fire.

   He will come to condemn the wicked to eternal punishment and to take
   His people up to their everlasting mansions in the skies. We look for
   such a coming and without entering into minute details, drawing charts
   and painting pictures, we are content to believe that He is coming in
   His Glory to show Himself to be what He always was--King of kings and
   Lord of lords, God over all, blessed forever! He is to be adored and
   worshipped and no more to be despised and rejected of men.

   When will He come? That is a question which Unbelief asks with a start.
   Faith replies, "It is not for you to know the times and seasons. Of
   that day and of that hour no man knows." Some simpleton says, "But we
   may know the week, month, or year." Do not trifle with God's Word and
   make a fool of yourself because you must know that the expression means
   that you do not know anything about the time at all and never will.
   Christ will come in a time when we look not for Him. Perhaps when the
   world and the Church are most asleep. When the wise and the foolish
   virgins have, alike, fallen into a deep slumber. When the stewards
   shall begin to beat their fellow servants and to drink and to be drunk.
   At midnight, or perhaps not till cock-crowing, He will come like a
   thief and the house shall be suddenly broken up.

   But come He will, and that is enough for you and for me to know. And
   when He comes we shall appear, for as He shall appear, we shall also
   appear with Him in glory.

   IV. The fourth thought is THAT WHEN CHRIST SHALL APPEAR, WE ALSO SHALL
   APPEAR. Do you ever feel like those lions in the Zoological Gardens,
   restlessly walking up and down before the bars of their cage and
   seeming to feel that they were never meant to be confined within those
   narrow limits? Sometimes they are for thrusting their heads through the
   bars and then for dashing back and tearing the back of their dungeon,
   or for rending up the pavement beneath them as if they yearned for
   liberty. Do you ever feel like that?

   Does your soul ever want to get free from her cage? Here is an iron bar
   of sin, of doubt, and there is another iron bar of mistrust and
   infirmity. Oh, if you could tear them away, could get rid of them all
   you would do something for Christ--you would be like Christ! Oh, if you
   could but by some means or other burst the bands of this captivity! But
   you cannot and therefore you feel uneasy. You may have seen an eagle
   with a chain upon its foot, standing on a rock--poor unhappy thing! It
   flaps its wings--looks up to the sun--wants to fly right straight ahead
   at it and stare the sun out of countenance--looks to the blue sky and
   seems as if it could sniff the blue beyond the dusky clouds and wants
   to be away.

   And so it tries its wings and dreams of mounting--but that chain, that
   cruel chain, remorselessly holds it down. Has not it often been so with
   you? You feel, "I am not meant to be what I am. I am sure I am not. I
   have a something in me which is adapted for something better and higher
   and I want to mount and soar--but that chain--that dragging chain of
   the body of sin and death keeps me down."

   Now it is to such as you that this text comes and says to you, "Yes,
   your present state is not your soul's true condition. You have a hidden
   life in you. That life of yours pants to get out of the bonds and
   fetters which control it and it shall be delivered soon, for Christ is
   coming! And when Christ shall appear you shall appear--the same
   appearance that belongs to Him belongs to you! He shall come and then
   your day of true happiness and joy and peace and everything that you
   are panting for and longing for shall certainly come."

   I wonder whether the little oak inside the acorn--for there is a whole
   oak there and there are all the roots and all the boughs and everything
   inside that acorn--I wonder whether that little oak inside the acorn
   ever has any premonition of the summer weather that will float over it
   a hundred years from now and of the mists that will hang in autumn on
   its sere leaves and of the hundreds of acorns which itself will cast,
   every autumn, upon the earth, when it shall become in the forest a
   great tree?

   You and I are like that acorn! Inside of each of us are the germs of
   great things. There is the tree that we are to be--I mean there is the
   spiritual thing we are to be--both in body and soul! Even now within us
   and sometimes here below, in happy moments, we get some inklings of
   what we are to be. And then how we want to burst the shell, to get out
   of the acorn and to be the oak! Yes, but stop. Christ has not come,
   Christian, and you cannot get out of that till the time shall come for
   Jesus to appear. Then shall you appear with Him in glory.

   You will very soon perceive in your rainwater, certain ugly little
   things which swim and twist about in it, always trying, if they can, to
   reach the surface and breathe through one end of their bodies. What
   makes these little things so lively, those innumerable little things
   like very small tadpoles? Why are they so lively? Possibly they have an
   idea of what they are going to be. The day will come when all of a
   sudden there will come out of the case of the creature that you have
   had swimming about in your water, a long-legged thing with two bright
   gauze-like wings which will mount into the air and on a summer's
   evening will dance in the sunlight!

   It is nothing more nor less than a gnat! You have, swimming there, a
   gnat in one of its earliest stages. You are just like that--you are an
   undeveloped being--you have not your wings yet and yet sometimes, in
   your activity for Christ, when the strong desires for something better
   are upon you, you leap in foretaste of the bliss to come! I do not know
   what

   I am to be, but I feel that there is a heart within me too big for
   these ribs to hold! I have an immortal spark which cannot have been
   intended to burn on this poor earth and then to go out. It must have
   been meant to burn on Heaven's altar.

   Wait a bit and when Christ comes you will know what you are. We are in
   the chrysalis state now and those who are the liveliest worms among us
   grow more and more uneasy in that chrysalis state. Some are so frozen
   up in it that they forget the hereafter and appear content to remain a
   chrysalis forever. But others of us feel we would sooner not be than be
   what we now are forever. We feel as if we must burst our bonds and when
   that time of bursting shall come, when the chrysalis shall get its
   painted wings and mount to the land of flowers, then shall we be
   satisfied.

   The text tells us--"When Christ, who is our life, shall appear"--when
   He comes out in all His Glory--"we also shall appear with Him in
   glory." If you would like these gracious promises drawn out into detail
   with regard to the body you may listen to just such words as these. "It
   is sown a soulish body, it is raised a Spiritual body. The first man is
   of the earth earthy, the second man is the Lord from Heaven. As is the
   earthy such are they, also, that are earthy. As is the heavenly such
   are they, also, that are heavenly."

   Whatever Christ's body is in Heaven, our body is to be like it.
   Whatever its glory and strength and power, our vile body is to be
   fashioned like unto His glorious body! As for our soul, whatever of
   absolute perfection--whatever of immortal joy Christ possesses, we are
   to possess that. And as for honor--whatever of esteem and love Christ
   may have from intelligent beings, we are to share in the same. And as
   for position before God--whatever Christ has--we are to stand where He
   stands.

   Are His enemies put to confusion? So are ours. Do all worlds discern
   His Glory? They shall discern ours, too. Is all dishonor wiped away
   from Him? So shall it be from us. Do they forget forever the shame and
   spitting, the Cross and the nails? So shall they in our case. Is it
   forever, "Gory! And honor! And power! And dominion! And bliss without
   end!"? So shall it be in our case! Let us comfort one another,
   therefore, with these words and look up out of our wormwood and our
   chrysalis state to that happier and better day when we shall be like
   Christ, for we shall see Him as He is.

   All this has nothing to do with a great many of you. You will die but
   you will never rise like Christ. You will die and you will die--why did
   I say, "and you will die?" Why, because you will have to feel the
   Second Death, and that second death, mark you, is as much more
   horrifying than the first as the trumpet of the angel is more terrible
   than the voice of the preacher can be this morning!

   Oh, I would that Christ were your life, but you are dead and God will
   say of you one of these days as Abraham said of Sarah, "Bury the dead
   out of My sight," and you must be put out of His sight as an obnoxious
   putrid thing. Oh that He would quicken you this day! "There is life,"
   says the hymn, "in a look at the Crucified One." God help you to
   exercise one look at that Christ of whom I spoke and then you shall
   join with the rest of His people in saying, "Christ is our life."

   May God bless these feeble words of mine and own them because of their
   weakness--the more to illustrate His own Grace and power, for Jesus'
   sake. Amen.

                      The Great Physician And His Patients

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MARCH 5, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE
   METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick."
   Matthew 9:12.

   THIS was Christ's apology for mingling with publicans and sinners when
   the Pharisees murmured against Him. He triumphantly cleared Himself by
   showing that according to the fitness of things He was perfectly in
   order. He was acting according to His official Character. A physician
   should be found where there is work for him to do and that it is where
   healing is required. There was evidently none among the Pharisees--if
   their own opinion of themselves were to hold good--for they were
   perfectly whole. There was much to do, according to their own
   admission, among the publicans and sinners, for they were sorely sick.
   Therefore our Lord was in His place and fittingly executing His office
   when He sought out those who needed Him.

   I. We shall have no time for a preface this morning and therefore let
   us enter at once into the text by observing that MERCY GRACIOUSLY
   REGARDS SIN AS A DISEASE. Sin is more than a disease. If it were only a
   sickness, men were to be pitied for suffering it. But the element of
   the perverse will, of voluntary rebellion and designed offense enters
   into sin, otherwise it were far less truly sin. And this makes it more
   than a sickness and worse than a malady. Let us not think that the
   picture of disease really does set forth all the heinous nature of
   sin--it is only a generous way in which Mercy chooses to look at it and
   to deal with it.

   As Justice views it, all the plagues, venom, virus and disease in the
   world would be sweet and harmless compared with one single evil thought
   or imagination! But Mercy leniently and graciously chooses, in order
   that it may have a sort of apology for its operations under the great
   plan of salvation, to view sin as a disease. It is justified in such a
   view, for almost everything that may be said of deadly maladies may be
   said of sin. Let us come to particulars. Sin is an hereditary
   disease--we are born with a tendency towards it--no, we are born in it.
   The taint is in our blood--the very center of our being feels the
   infection.

   Born in sin and shaped in iniquity, in sin did our mothers conceive us
   and our offspring, in like measure, received from us that original sin
   which is part of our fallen nature. Every man born into the world bears
   within him, in the bias and current of his mind, the seeds of sin. Nor
   is this to be wondered at, for, "Who can bring a clean thing out of an
   unclean? Not one." "How can he be clean that is born of a woman?" Sin,
   like sickness, is very disabling. A sick man cannot carry burdens,
   climb mountains, run in service, walk with perseverance or leap for
   joy. The occupations and the pleasures of other men are things from
   which he is shut out. Even so does sin prevent our serving God.

   We cannot pray to Him--we cannot praise Him aright. In every duty we
   are weak and for every good we are feeble. There is not a single moral
   power of manhood which sin has not stripped of its strength and glory.
   If we wished to run in the ways of God's commands, then sin has
   crippled us. If we would grasp God's promises, evil has paralyzed us.
   If we desired to see into the mysteries of Divine Grace, guilt has
   blinded us. If we would hear the voice of God, transgression has struck
   us with deafness. And if our voices would swell the song of cherubim
   and seraphim, alas, the plague of our heart within has made us dumb!

   Of all of us in our measure it may be said we are, through sin,
   "unstable as water and shall not excel." Sin weakens man's nature for
   all good. Sin also, like certain diseases, is a very loathsome thing.
   Some diseases are so extremely disgusting that scarcely can their names
   be mentioned. But, oh, they are sweetness itself when compared with
   sin! The most putrid poisonous air that ever blew from a fever hospital
   never had such foulness in it as dwells in sin. Pest-houses and
   lazar-houses are clean and safe compared with the haunts of vice. In
   God's esteem and in the esteem of all holy minds the most detestable,
   obnoxious, dreadful thing in the whole world is moral evil.

   If that could be gotten rid of, all other evil would cease to be. This
   is the mother and nurse of all evil, the egg of all mischief, the
   fountain of bitterness, the root of misery. Here you have the distilled
   essence of Hell. The "quintessence," as the old Divines would say, of
   everything that is unlovely, disreputable, dishonest, impure,
   abominable--in a word-- damnable! Like some diseases, sin is fearfully
   polluting. As the leper cannot be tolerated abroad, as the
   plague-stricken are separated from their fellows--even so, sin
   separates us from communion with God and holy beings. It is not their
   unwillingness to associate with us, as much as our horrible unfitness
   to have fellowship with them. It is dreadful to bear about with us a
   cancer which has reached the stage of sickening rottenness. And yet
   this is not half so terribly disgusting as sin is to the heart of God.

   God is very gracious but He cannot endure sin in His Presence and to
   set forth His hatred of it in type and figure He forbade diseased
   persons to enter His courts or even to mingle with the camp of His
   people. For the unclean there was a plain and clear separation until he
   had been purified. Sin necessarily shuts us out from God's Presence.
   Into His holy fellowship we must not come--we dare not attempt to come.
   The fire of His anger would consume us, as it did Nadab and Abihu, if
   we, as sinners should venture near Him apart from Christ Jesus. We
   cannot stand at the altar to officiate as priests before God, though
   this were the proper lot of manhood, by reason of the leprosy that is
   on our brow.

   Our praising God, simple as that might seem, cannot be acceptable in
   His sight because of the defilement of our un-circumcised lips.
   Almighty Grace must take away our uncleanliness or we cannot worship.
   Iniquity is a polluting thing. Everything we do and everything we think
   of grows polluted through our corruption. The unclean person could not
   touch a vessel, sit on a bed, or come near a garment without defiling
   it. And our sin has much the same effect. Our prayers have stains in
   them. Our faith is mixed with unbelief. Our repentance is not so tender
   as it should be. Our communion is distant and interrupted. We cannot
   pray without sinning and there is filth even in our tears. Well was it
   for Israel that there was an Aaron to bear the sins of their holy
   things and blessed is it for us that Jesus takes the sins even of our
   best works and casts them into the depths of the sea.

   Sin, too, may be likened to many sicknesses from its being contagious.
   A man cannot be a sinner alone. "One sinner destroys much good." The
   seeds of sin are winged like thistle seeds--you may shut up the leper
   in a lazar-house, but there is no such way of shutting up sin--it will
   get out and spread itself. A man, if he is evil, will make others evil.
   His children will imitate him. His dependants, feeling his influence,
   will walk in his footsteps. Even his neighbors cannot look upon his sin
   without being in some measure infected by it, for, "the thought of evil
   is sin." There is a fierce contig-uousness in every form of moral
   evil--like fire among stubble it spreads most rapidly.

   Sin moreover, like many diseases, is very painful. And yet, on the
   other hand, at certain stages it brings on a dead-ness, a numbness of
   soul-preventing pain. The most of men are unconscious of the misery of
   the Fall. They think themselves rich and increased in goods, having
   need of nothing, when they are naked and poor and miserable. Sin causes
   a madness which makes sick souls dream that they are in sound health.
   They talk as though Heaven were their heritage, when they are sitting
   on the brink of Hell. But when sin is really discerned, then it becomes
   painful. I would sooner suf-fer--I know not what may be the pangs of
   some disease, but I feel sure I may say this--I would sooner suffer a
   complication of all the ills that flesh is heir to than suffer the
   plague of a guilty, awakened, enlightened, quickened conscience!

   When conscience accuses a man there is no rest for him either day or
   night. Its little finger is heavier than the loins of all other grief.
   When sin becomes exceedingly sinful before the eyes, then there is a
   gloom and a heaviness of spirit which crushes the soul into despair,
   making life bitter, as Pharaoh did the lives of the children of Israel.
   Speak of Egyptian darkness--it was bright as noonday compared with the
   darkness of a mind borne down with its own guilt. Oh what wretchedness
   was mine before I laid hold on Christ. There are some who feel not so
   acutely the agony of conflict with sin, but it was my lot to feel a
   horror of great darkness, verging upon despair, so that had I not soon
   found a Savior my soul had chosen strangling rather than life.

   Believe me, there is no pain so bitter as the pain of sin and no curse
   so heavy as the curse which comes from the black lips of our civil
   iniquities. And yet I would to God that some of you felt it now that
   you might not feel it hereafter. I would that this whip would fall upon
   your backs that you might be flogged out of your self-righteousness and
   made to fly to Jesus Christ and find a shelter there. The disease of
   sin is deep-seated and has its throne in the heart. It does not lie in
   the hand or foot, it is not to be removed by amputation, much less by
   outward applications. No knife can reach it, it is impossible to
   cauterize it.

   The skill of a physician can often extract the roots of disease, but no
   skill can ever reach this. It has entered the marrow, the very core and
   center of our being and only the Divine One is able to purge us from
   it--

   "No outward forms can make me clean The leprosy lies deep within."

   It is in its own nature wholly incurable. "Can the Ethiopian change his
   skin, or the leopard his spots?" If so, then can he that is accustomed
   to do evil learn to do well? Can a brine fountain send forth sweet
   waters? Shall the thorn suddenly yield olives? Can the waterfall which
   has been forever dashing down the cliffs reverse its course and return
   towards the riverhead?

   Shall fire suddenly become gentle and lose its consuming power while
   the fuel is round about it? Shall the lion of himself eat straw like
   the ox? Shall the leopard bleat like a lamb? Such changes, being
   changes of nature, are only to be worked by Divine strength. And so it
   is not possible for the disease of sin ever to be cured by any human
   remedies. Man cannot cure himself. He may reform. He may drive the
   disease inward and prevent its coming out upon the skin. He may so
   model and guide and restrain himself that the coarser forms of sin
   which are condemned among men may not appear in him. But the virus, the
   essential poison of sin, no man can ever extract from his own
   heart--nor can another man do it for him.

   Jehovah Rophi, the healing Lord, must manifest His Omnipotent power.
   The utmost religionist, the most devout prayers, the greatest possible
   circumspection will not avail to remove the taint of sin if they spring
   from an unrenewed heart. The carnal mind is enmity against God and is
   not reconciled to God, neither, indeed, can it be. And so, let us close
   the story of this sickness of sin by observing that it is a mortal
   disease. It kills not just now, but it will kill before long. Not
   merely shall the body die as the result of sin, but the soul must be
   killed forever with eternal wrath. O Sinner, you little know what your
   sin will bring you to! But if you will read in God's Word, you shall
   discover that it will bring you to the worm that never dies and to the
   fire that never can be quenched.

   Perhaps tomorrow you may know what a full-blown sin is. Perhaps
   tomorrow, I said--that word may be prophetic to some of you--but if not
   tomorrow, it is but a matter of time, a few months, more or less and
   you will be in torment. Sin, when it is ripened, brings forth death and
   damnation. Oh, you do not know what those words, "to be damned," mean!
   You can play with them sometimes and lightly hurl them at your fellow
   creatures--but could you only once hear the shriek of a damned soul!
   Could you only once see a spirit cast out from the Presence of God into
   eternal misery-- surely it would compel you to cry--"What must I do to
   be saved?"

   Enough of this--it is clear that there is a very excellent parallel to
   be drawn between sin and disease. Humbling as it is, the fact is,
   nevertheless, most certain--we are all suffering under the disease of
   sin.

   II. But now, secondly, IT PLEASES DIVINE MERCY TO GIVE TO CHRIST THE
   CHARACTER OF A PHYSICIAN. Having deigned to consider sin as a disease,
   which is a great proof of mercy, it now graciously confers upon Christ
   the character of a physician. Be it forever understood that Jesus
   Christ never came into the world merely to explain what sin is. Moses
   had for his mission the exposition of sin--Christ has for His mission
   the eradication of it.

   We know what sin is through the Law--that is as much as the Law can do
   for us. Christ comes, not merely to tell us what it is, but to inform
   us how it can be removed. Jesus did not come to apologize for
   sin--Christ never died in order that sin might appear less sinful--that
   God might be less severe towards sin, or hate it less. God forbid! We
   never see sin to be so black as when we view its evil as revealed in
   the sufferings of Jesus. Nor is God's wrath ever more intolerable than
   when we behold it consuming His Only-Begotten Son.

   "Behold and see if there is any sorrow like unto My sorrow, which is
   done unto Me, wherewith the Lord has afflicted Me in the day of His
   fierce anger." Christ did not come to lay a flattering unction to men's
   souls, to prevent distress of conscience, to say to them, "Peace,
   Peace!" where there is no peace. No, He came to cure sin, not to film
   it over--not to make men forget the disease by drugging them with
   presumptuous draughts of consolation--but by absolutely removing that
   which is the cause of their dread and of their fear to make them whole.
   Christ Jesus did not come in order that you might continue in sin and
   escape the penalty of it! He did not come to prevent the disease being
   mortal, but to take the disease itself away.

   Many people think that when we preach salvation, we mean salvation from
   going to Hell. We do not mean that! We mean a great deal more! We
   preach salvation from sin. We say that Christ is able to save a man.
   And we mean by that that

   He is able to save him from sin and to make him holy--to make him a new
   man. No person has any right to say, "I am saved," while he continues
   in sin as he did before. How can you be saved from sin while you are
   living in it? A man that is drowning cannot say he is saved from the
   water while he is sinking in it! A man that is frostbitten cannot say,
   with any truth, that he is saved from the cold while he is stiffened in
   the wintry blast.

   No, Christ did not come to save you in your sins, but to save you from
   your sins. He did not come to make the disease so that it should not
   kill you, but to let it remain in itself mortal and, nevertheless, to
   remove it from you and you from it. Christ Jesus came, then, to heal us
   from the plague of sin--to touch us with His hand and say, "I will, be
   you clean." When a physician presents himself, one of the first
   enquiries is, "Is he a regular practitioner? Has he a right to
   practice? Has he a diploma?"

   Very properly the law requires that a man shall not be allowed to hack
   our bodies and poison us with drugs at his own pleasure without having
   at least a show of knowing what he is doing. It has been tartly said
   that, "a doctor is a man who pours drugs, of which he knows little,
   into a body of which he knows still less." I fear that is often the
   case. Still a diploma is the best safeguard mortals have devised.

   Christ has the best authority for practicing as a physician. He has a
   Divine diploma! Would you like to see His diploma? I will read you a
   few words of it--it comes from the highest authority, not from the
   College of Physicians, but from the God of Physicians. Here are the
   words of it in the sixty-first chapter of Isaiah, "The Spirit of the
   Lord is upon Me, because the Lord has anointed Me to preach good
   tidings unto the meek. He has sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted."

   He has a diploma for binding up broken hearts. I should not like to
   trust myself to a physician who was a mere self-dubbed doctor who could
   not show any authorization! I must have him know as much as a man can
   know, little as I believe that will probably be. He must have a
   diploma. It must be signed and sealed, too, and be in a regular
   manner--for few sensible men will risk their lives with ignorant
   quacks. Now Jesus Christ has His diploma and there it is--God has sent
   Him to bind up the brokenhearted.

   The next thing you want in a physician is experience. You want to know
   that he is thoroughly qualified. He must have walked the hospitals. And
   certainly our Lord Jesus Christ has done so. What form of disease did
   He not meet with? When He was here among men it pleased God to let the
   devil loose in order that there might be more than usual venom in the
   veins of poor diseased manhood. And Christ met the devil at His darkest
   hour and fought with the great enemy when he had full liberty to do his
   worst with Him.

   Jesus did, indeed, enter into the woes of men--He walked the hospitals!
   Why the whole world was an infirmary and Christ the one only Physician,
   going from couch to couch healing the sons of men. Something more, be
   it observed, may be said of Him--He is experimentally as well as by
   education--qualified in the healing arts. I have heard of a celebrated
   physician that was known to try the effect of his medicines upon
   himself. This has been done in our Master's case.

   There is not a single disease which He does not know
   experimentally--for He Himself took our sicknesses and infirmities. He
   was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin. He knows His
   patient's case by having passed through the case Himself. There is no
   brokenness of heart, there is no grief of soul which Jesus Christ has
   not Himself participated in. And though you may say He knows not sin in
   its infection, yet He knows sin in its imputation and is, by having
   suffered all its penalties, perfectly well acquainted with it.

   One likes a physician, too, who has a wide practice. One does not care
   for a man's merely understanding his tools. We like to know whether he
   has used them and whether he has been successful in his art. Blessed be
   the name of the beloved Physician! He has the widest imaginable
   practice. These 1800 years He has been healing sin-sick souls--what am
   I saying?--these 6000 years He has been "mighty to save." Before He
   bodily gave Himself to the Cross, the virtue of the medicine of His own
   blood had begun to operate upon the sons of men.

   O Souls! You may see in Heaven the multitudes whom He has healed!
   There, before the Eternal Throne, you may view the myriads who have
   been delivered from all sorts of diseases through the power and virtue
   of His touch. You need not fear to trust yourselves in His hands, for
   even the hem of His garment heals our diseases!

   To sum up the virtues of this Physician in a very few words--His cures
   are very speedy--there is life in a look at Him. His cures are
   radical--He strikes at the very center of the disease and His cures are
   very sure and certain. He never fails and the disease never returns.
   There is no relapse where Christ heals--no fear that one of His
   patients should be but patched up for a season. He makes a new man of
   him--a new heart also does He give him and a right spirit does He put
   within him!

   He is a physician, one of a thousand, because He is well-skilled in all
   diseases. Physicians generally have some specialty. They may know a
   little about almost all our pains and ills, but there is usually one
   disease which they have studied the most carefully--one part of the
   human frame whose anatomy is as well-known to them as the rooms and
   cupboards of their own house.

   Jesus Christ has made the whole of human nature His specialty. He is as
   much at home with one sinner as with another sinner and never yet did
   He meet with an out-of-the-way case that was out of the way for Him. He
   has had extraordinary complications of strange diseases to deal with
   but He has known exactly, in one moment, with one glance of His eyes,
   how to treat the patient. He is the only universal doctor "at home" in
   every case.

   The medicine He gives is a catholicon--it heals in every instance,
   never failing. His medicine is Himself! If there is a smart caused by
   it, it is borne upon His own back. "By His stripes we are healed." "His
   flesh is meat, indeed. His blood is drink, indeed"--He Himself casts
   out the disease from poor dying men. We do but trust Him and sin
   dies--we love Him and Divine Grace lives! We wait for Him and Grace is
   strengthened. We see Him, as we soon shall, and Grace is perfected
   forever! O blessed Physician for this desperate disease!

   III. I cannot, however, tarry longer on that point, but come to the
   third, which is the main one that I am driving at, namely, THAT NEED IS
   THAT ALONE WHICH MOVES OUR GRACIOUS PHYSICIAN TO COME TO OUR AID.

   He says, "They that are whole need not a physician," and you will see
   the natural conclusion from His line of reasoning is, "I do not go to
   the whole, because they do not need Me. I go to the sick because they
   do need Me. The reason why I go anywhere is because I am needed."

   I believe, dear Friends, though doubtless there are some exceptions,
   that if you were to take the medical profession through, you would
   perceive larger-heartedness and more humanity there than almost
   anywhere. And you would find that there is scarcely a physician,
   certainly none known to me, who would, if he had two urgent cases to
   consider, make any distinction between the two except that he would
   give his first attention to the sufferer who needed him most.

   Of course if the matters are both trivial, common sense allows a man to
   select that which will best remunerate him for his skill. But in
   imminently dangerous cases, necessity decides. The true physician is
   born with a physician's heart and feels for the woes of his fellow men.
   And, though a man has obtained a diploma, he is no physician and ought
   not to practice if his soul is not in his work and his heart full of
   benevolence to the afflicted. The true physician, having a sympathy and
   an intense desire to be of service, if there are two persons requiring
   him, would say, "This one is in the more imminent danger. I shall go to
   him first."

   Now what is most certainly only fair to acknowledge concerning human
   physicians, we must admit with a far greater cogency concerning the
   Great Physician of souls. If there were two sinners both perishing and
   Christ were not able to save at the same moment more than one, He would
   go to that one first which needed Him most. This is His rule. He acts
   according to sovereignty, but that sovereignty is under the control of
   His own infinite mercy. If He hears a cry from two hearts today, if He
   should give any preference, the preference would be given to that which
   was the cry of the most lost, the most abject, the most needy sinner.

   Now think this over and you will see that it is true, and most
   consolatory. What was it that made Christ a physician at all? Was is
   not because men were sick with sin? Suppose they had been
   perfect--would Christ have ever been a Savior if men had not been lost?
   Brethren, it would have been a work of supererogation--it would have
   been a folly, a monstrous folly, on His part--to undertake an office
   which was not required of Him! It is sin which makes room for His work
   as a Savior. I say it--you will understand me--He is only a Savior
   because there are sinners and His Saviorship is based upon our
   sinnership!

   He takes that position because He is needed. Again, what was the main
   thought which was upon Him when He was compounding His great medicine?
   What was it that made Him shed great drops of blood? Was it human
   guilt? Or do you think, perhaps, human merit? Why guilt, and guilt
   alone! What made Him give His back to the scourgers and His cheeks to
   the smiters? What made Him stretch His arms to the Cross and give His
   feet to the nails?

   What made Him bear the insufferable wrath of Almighty God? Was it man's
   goodness? Why you cannot think of such a thing! It was human vileness,
   villainy, degradation, iniquity which made such sufferings as these all
   necessary! As I see, then, Christ in His great surgery, compounding the
   Almighty medicine which is to expel the disease from the veins of
   humanity, I see Him every moment thinking of sin! Sin! SIN! Man's sin
   makes Him die. And now that He is in Heaven, Beloved, what is it that
   Christ is thinking of there?

   "He makes intercession"--what for? For the righteous? If they were
   self-righteous, perfectly righteous, they would not need intercession
   from Him. "He makes intercession for the transgressors." He is exalted
   on high--what for? To reward the good? No, verily, but to give
   repentance and remission of sins--evidently to those who have no
   repentance and whose sins have need to be forgiven. Up in Heaven Christ
   still has His eyes upon sinners--sinners are the jewels whom He seeks!

   Where, again, was Jesus Christ when He was on earth? Did He not spend
   the most of His time among sinners? Was He not always dealing out
   healing to the sick, life to the dead, and so on? You might ask again,
   on the other hand, to whom is the Gospel sent? What is it? "This is a
   faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came
   into the world to save sinners." That is the Gospel--"He that believes
   and is baptized shall be saved. He that believes not shall be damned."

   So those who are bid to believe are evidently those who deserve to be
   damned. Need, need, need alone quickens the Physician's footsteps,
   bringing Jesus from the Throne of Glory to the Cross, and in His
   spiritual power bringing Him every day from the Throne of His Father
   down to brokenhearted heavy-laden souls. Now this is very plain talking
   and you all receive it--but still most of the people do not understand
   it. A minister, when he had done preaching in a country village, said
   to a farm-laborer who had been listening to him, "Do you think Jesus
   Christ died to save good people, or bad people?"

   "Well, Sir," said the man, "I should say He died to save good people."
   "But did He die to save bad people?" "No, Sir. No, certainly not, Sir."
   "Well, then, what will become of you and me?" "Well, Sir, I do not
   know. I dare say you are pretty good, Sir. And I try to be as good as I
   can." That is just the common doctrine. And though we think it has died
   out among us, that is the religion of ninety-nine English people out of
   every hundred who know nothing of Divine Grace--we are to be as good as
   we can. We are to go to church or to chapel and do all that we can and
   then Jesus Christ died for us and we shall be saved.

   Whereas the Gospel is that He did not do anything at all for people who
   can rely on themselves--but gave Himself for lost and ruined ones. He
   did not come into the world to save self-righteous people! On their own
   testimony, they do not want to be saved. He comes because we need Him,
   and therefore He comes only to those who need Him! And if we do not
   need Him and are such good, respectable people, we must find our own
   way to Heaven. Need, need alone, is that which quickens the Physician's
   footsteps.

   IV. We therefore come to another point, upon which we shall not stay
   many minutes. It follows, therefore, and the text positively asserts
   it, that THE WHOLE--THAT THOSE WHO HAVE NO GREAT NEED--NO NEED AT ALL,
   WILL BE UNAIDED BY CHRIST.

   Of course they ought to be left alone. No physician in his right mind
   thinks of sending a prescription, nor does any surgeon think of sending
   his bottles and his boxes of pills to people who profess to be
   perfectly well! The prescription would be put into the fire and the
   medicine thrown in the streets--the man himself would reckon it to be a
   gross insult. Christ did not come into the world merely to insult
   humanity. If humanity is the fine thing it thinks it is, then let it
   exalt itself as it may and let it go on with the health it thinks it
   possesses! Let it work out its own salvation if it will even allow that
   this is required.

   To send a physician to those who are whole is an insult to the
   physician, too. He knocks at the door, "Who is ill here?" is the first
   question. "Nobody, we are all well, thank you, Sir. We are all well, we
   thank God--we are not as other men are down the street there, we have
   no fever. The smallpox never comes here, we never catch scarlet fever.
   We have nothing of the kind, Sir! We are glad to see you--glad to see
   you--but we have nothing the matter with us."

   The physician would find at once that he had been hoaxed in being asked
   there. And that truly is the treatment Jesus Christ gets from a great
   many people. You hear them say, "Lord have mercy upon us miserable
   sinners." They are dressed in satin and all sorts of fine clothes, and
   as good a people as you would find in all the parish. And if you come
   to question them, they are not "miserable sinners" at all. I would like
   to chalk "miserable sinners" on their backs and see whether they could
   bear it. It is the same with you--you come here and if I pray about
   sinners, there are some of you who say, "Yes, yes, we are sinners."

   But if I came round and said, "Now let us take the Ten
   Commandments--have you broken them?" I daresay there are some here who
   would say, "Really, I do not know that I have in particular done
   anything wrong. I do not feel that I have erred very remarkably." No,
   the fact is you insult Christ by sending to Him when you are not ill
   and it is nothing better than impertinence, though you think it to be a
   compliment! The whole have no need of a physician--there is no need for
   a physician's skill. "Why," says the doctor, as he looks round upon all
   his store of knowledge, what is the good of this? A fool is as good as
   I am to a man who is not ill. If you were sick, I would try to do my
   best, but as there is nothing the matter with you, there is no room for
   me."

   You may fetch any crossing-sweeper and he will be of as much use to you
   as the best physician when you are not ill. So if you do not confess
   yourselves really to be sinners, Jesus will have no preciousness in
   your eyes. He will be but an ordinary person. If you are not sick,
   there is no likelihood of gratitude. Men will not thank a physician for
   doing nothing. You will never be thankful to Christ for saving you if
   you do not feel that you need saving.

   Then again, there will be no honor to Him. Suppose you went to Heaven
   and entered there in the same self-righteous frame of mind as you are
   in now--what would you say? "Well done!" There would be no honor to
   Christ, no glory to Jesus. A man must have a deep and conscious need of
   Christ or else he cannot illuminate the Throne of Christ with glory by
   his praise when he shall enter Heaven. Now I think there is some sweet
   music in what I have been saying to those of you who do need--though it
   must sound like a mockery to those of you who think you do not need it.
   ' V. To conclude, it follows then, that THOSE WHO ARE SICK SHALL BE
   HELPED BY JESUS. Let the question go round these galleries and this
   area this morning, "Am I sick? Am I sinful? Then I have a need of Jesus
   and need is the only thing that will bring Jesus to me!" "Oh," says
   one, "but I am so very sinful." Then you have a very great need and
   there is room for very great power on the Savior's part! And that
   display of Divine Grace shall give Him very great glory!

   Sinner, believe on Him, that He can save you! Trust Him to save you and
   let not your great sin keep you back. "Oh, but I have so many sins!"
   Then, again, you have the greater need! And as it is need that brings
   the doctor, so your many needs will be so many knocks at His door, so
   many rings at His bell! He will come the faster--only plead earnestly
   every one of your sins and ask Him to have pity upon you. "Yes," you
   say, "but I have been so long sick." Then your case is a very bad one
   and there is the more need of His care. He healed the woman that had
   been thirty-six years disabled, and if you have been thirty-six
   years--yes, if it is eighty years--He is still able to heal all your
   need--let us keep to that-- your need is your only plea. You have
   evidently a very strong plea, for you have a very great need.

   "Ah," says another, "but I have relapsed since I thought I was
   healed--I have backslidden." Now there is a special promise given to
   that form or sickness, "I will heal their backsliding." He does not
   specially say, "I will heal their drunkenness and so on," but here is a
   special promise for a special case! Now you need Him. This is a great
   sin, this backsliding. Go to Him--rather ask Him to come to you. "Yes,"
   says another, "but I cannot feel my sin as I would." This only proves
   how much you need the Lord Jesus, since you have not even that form of
   fitness which lies in a deep sense of need! You cannot even feel, for
   you have a heart of stone.

   Oh, make this a plea with Him. Say, "Jesus I need You more than anybody
   else, for there are some who have a little health. They can feel they
   are diseased, but I have not even that. I need You, oh I need You more
   than any other!" Perhaps you will say, "But I cannot believe on Him as
   I would." Then add that, also, to your other sins--confess your
   unbelief! Tell Him you have great need of Him to give you faith. And go
   to Him and oh, may He help you to believe that He is able to forgive
   this sin, also. "Well," says one, "but I grow worse the more I think
   about these things." I am glad of it, dear Friend! This growing worse
   is a part of the cure!

   Suppose you should keep on growing worse--if you should get to feel
   yourself as black as the devil and as damned as a lost soul--yet while
   you are in this world the Great Physician can heal you! And you still
   have this great plea--that you need Him--you NEED Him. "Oh," says one,
   "I cannot see how I can plead my need as the only thing." My dear
   Friend, what would you plead? Suppose you were publicly begging. If I
   had to turn to the trade of a beggar, believe me, I would not wear this
   black coat, or, if I did, I would take care to have it pretty well
   riddled with holes! Because the great thing you have to do when you
   plead in the street is to convince the passers-by that you are in need.

   Some lean, wretched-looking fellows have faces which are worth a
   fortune to them! Their cheeks white with con-sumption--their bodies
   thin and lean as with starvation--with scarcely a handful of rags on
   them. They squat down in some corner and write on a paper, "I am
   starving," and as you pass them you cannot help it--your hand goes into
   your pocket! "Here is a case of destitution," you say--and you give
   them relief. Imitate these vagabonds in all but their deception! Use
   their logic, the rational argument that need is a beggar's best plea!

   You are destitute! You are starving! Spread your case before God. The
   best case you can make out in order to prevail with God is a bad one.
   Let it be as bad as it can be and I venture to say the worst is the
   best. Do not be apologizing, attempting to make your sins less than
   they are. Tell Him you are a wretch undone without His Sovereign Grace.
   And there, guilty and vile, and self-abhorred, fall flat before Him and
   say, "Lord Jesus, if You want someone to heal, I am just the man. If
   You want a case that can be blazoned abroad and that will make the
   public ears ring and ring again with the praise of Your all-healing
   medicine, I am Your man, Lord. "If You want one full of sores and
   wounds and putrefying disease like Job upon a dunghill. If You want one
   that is very far gone--that is rotten through and through--Lord, I am
   Your man."

   O believe, Sinner, He is your Savior, for while He loves to meet with
   such cases as yours, you should rejoice to meet with such a Savior as
   He is! And all you are asked to do is to believe that He can save you
   and to trust Him to do it! If you knew Him, you would believe Him. He
   loves to save. He can save the vilest! Trust Him then and may the
   Spirit of God so lead you to understand Him that you can rely upon Him!
   And, if you do, He will say, "Sinner, your sins are forgiven you, be of
   good cheer, go on your way rejoicing." May God bless these words, for
   Christ's sake. Amen.

                            The Golden Key Of Prayer

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MARCH 12, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Call unto Me and I will answer you and show you great and mighty
   things, which you know not." Jeremiah 33:3.

   SOME of the most learned works in the world smell of midnight oil. But
   the most spiritual and most comforting books and sayings of men usually
   have a savor about them of prison dampness. I might quote many
   instances--John Bunyan's Pilgrim may suffice instead of a hundred
   others. And this good text of ours, all moldy and cold with the prison
   in which Jeremiah lay, has nevertheless a brightness and a beauty about
   it which it might never have had if it had not come as a cheering word
   to the prisoner of the Lord shut up in the court of the prison.

   God's people have always, in their worst condition, found out the best
   of their God. He is good at all times, but He seems to be at His best
   when they are at their worst. "How could you bear your long
   imprisonment so well?" said one to the Landgrave of Hesse who had been
   shut up for his attachment to the principles of the Reformation. He
   replied, "The Divine consolations of martyrs were with me."

   Doubtless there is a consolation more deep, more strong than any other
   which God keeps for those who, being His faithful witnesses, have to
   endure exceedingly great tribulation from the enmity of man. There is a
   glorious aurora for the frigid zone. And stars glisten in northern
   skies with unusual splendor. Rutherford had a quaint saying that when
   he was cast into the cellars of affliction, he remembered that the
   great King always kept his wine there and he began to seek at once for
   the wine bottles and to drink of the "wines on the lees well refined."

   They who dive in the sea of affliction bring up rare pearls. You know,
   my companions in affliction, that it is so. You whose bones have been
   ready to come through the skin through long lying upon the weary couch.
   You who have seen your earthly goods carried away from you and have
   been reduced well-near to penury. You who have gone to the grave these
   seven times, till you have feared that your last earthly friend would
   be borne away by unpitying Death. You have all proven that He is a
   faithful God and that as your tribulations abound, so your consolations
   also abound by Christ Jesus!

   My prayer is, in taking this text this morning, that some other
   prisoners of the Lord may have its joyous promise spoken home to them!
   That you who are shut up and cannot come forth by reason of present
   heaviness of spirit may hear Him say, as with a soft whisper in your
   ears and in your hearts, "Call upon Me and I will answer you and show
   you great and mighty things, which you know not."

   The text naturally splits itself up into three distinct particles of
   the Truth of God. Upon these let us speak as we are enabled by God the
   Holy Spirit. First, prayer commanded--"Call unto Me." Secondly, an
   answer promised--"And I will answer you." Thirdly, faith
   encouraged--"And show you great and mighty things, which you know not."

   I. The first head is PRAYER COMMANDED. We are not merely counseled and
   recommended to pray, but bid to pray. This is great condescension. An
   hospital is built--it is considered sufficient that free admission
   shall be given to the sick when they seek it. But no order in council
   is made that a man must enter its gates. A soup kitchen is well
   provided for in the depth of winter. Notice is promulgated that those
   who are poor may receive food on application. But no one thinks of
   passing an Act of Parliament compelling the poor to come and wait at
   the door to take the charity.

   It is thought to be enough to proffer it without issuing any sort of
   mandate that men shall accept it. Yet so strange is the infatuation of
   man, on the one hand, which makes him need a command to be merciful to
   his own soul! And so marvelous is the condescension of our gracious God
   on the other--that He issues a command of love without which not a man
   of Adam born would partake of the Gospel feast, but would rather starve
   than come! In the matter of prayer it is even so. God's own people
   need, or else they would not receive it, a command to pray.

   Why is this? Because, dear Friends, we are very subject to fits of
   worldliness, if indeed that is not our usual state. We do not forget to
   eat--we do not forget to take the shop shutters down--we do not forget
   to be diligent in business--we do not forget to go to our beds to
   rest--but we often forget to wrestle with God in prayer and to spend,
   as we ought to spend, long periods in consecrated fellowship with our
   Father and our God. With too many professors the ledger is so bulky
   that you cannot move it! And the Bible, representing their devotion, is
   so small that you might almost put it in your waistcoat pocket.

   Hours for the world! Moments for Christ! The world has our best and our
   prayer closet the remnants of our time. We give our strength and
   freshness to the ways of mammon and our fatigue to the ways of God.
   Therefore it is that we need to be commanded to attend to that very act
   which it ought to be our greatest happiness, as it is our highest
   privilege to perform--to meet with our God! "Call upon Me," He says,
   for He knows that we are apt to forget to call upon God.

   "What do you mean, oh, Sleeper? Arise and call upon your God," is an
   exhortation which is needed by us as well as by Jonah in the storm. He
   understands what heavy hearts we have, sometimes, when under a sense of
   sin. Satan says to us, "Why should you pray? How can you hope to
   prevail? You say in vain, 'I will arise and go to my Father,' for you
   are not worthy to be one of His hired servants! How can you see the
   King's face after you have played the traitor against Him? How will you
   dare to approach unto the altar when you have, yourself, defiled it and
   when the sacrifice which you would bring there is a poor polluted one?"

   O Brothers and Sisters, it is well for us that we are commanded to
   pray, or else in times of heaviness we might give it up! If God
   commands me, unfit as I may be, I will creep to the footstool of Divine
   Grace. And since He says, "Pray without ceasing," though my words fail
   me and my heart itself will wander, yet I will still stammer out the
   wishes of my hungering soul and say, "O God, at least teach me to pray
   and help me to prevail with You."

   Are we not commanded to pray, also, because of our frequent unbelief?
   Unbelief whispers, "What profit is there if you should seek the Lord
   upon such-and-such a matter? This is a case quite out of the list of
   those things wherein God has interposed and, therefore, (says the
   devil), if you were in any other position you might rest upon the
   mighty arm of God. But here your prayer will not avail you. Either it
   is too trivial a matter, or it is too connected with temporals, or else
   it is a matter in which you have sinned too much, or else it is too
   high, too hard, too complicated a piece of business--you have no right
   to take that before God!" So suggests the foul Fiend of Hell.

   Therefore there stands written as an everyday precept suitable to every
   case into which a Christian can be cast, "Call unto Me." "Call unto Me.
   Are you sick? Would you be healed? Cry unto Me, for I am the Great
   Physician. Does Providence trouble you? Are you fearful that you shall
   not provide things honest in the sight of man? Call unto Me! Do your
   children vex you? Do you feel that which is sharper than an adder's
   tooth--a thankless child? Call unto Me! Are your griefs little, yet
   painful, like small points and pricks of thorns? Call unto Me! Is your
   burden heavy as though it would make your back break beneath its load?
   Call unto Me! Cast your burden upon the Lord and He shall sustain you!
   He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved."

   In the valley--on the mountain--on the barren rock--in the briny sea!
   Submerged beneath the billows and lifted up by-and-by upon the crest of
   the waves--in the furnace when the coals are glowing--in the gates of
   death when the jaws of Hell would shut themselves upon you--cease not,
   for the commandment forevermore addresses you with, "Call unto Me."
   Prayer is still mighty and must prevail with God to bring you your
   deliverance. These are some of the reasons why the privilege of
   supplication is also in Holy Scripture spoken of as a duty--there are
   many more--but these will suffice this morning.

   We must not leave our first part till we have made another remark. We
   ought to be very glad that God has given us this command in His Word
   that it may be sure and abiding. You may turn to fifty passages where
   the same precept is uttered. I do not often read in Scripture, "You
   shall not kill." "You shall not covet." Twice the Law is given, but I
   often read Gospel precepts, for if the Law is given twice, the Gospel
   is given seventy times seven. For every precept which I cannot keep by
   reason of my being weak through the flesh, I find a thousand precepts
   which it is sweet and pleasant for me to keep by reason of the power of
   the Holy Spirit which dwells in the children of God!

   And this command to pray is insisted upon again and again. It may be a
   seasonable exercise for some of you to find out how often in Scripture
   you are told to pray. You will be surprised to find how many times such
   words as these are given--"Call upon Me in the day of trouble and I
   will deliver you." "You people, pour out your heart before Him."

   "Seek you the Lord while He may be found. Call you upon Him while He is
   near." "Ask and it shall be given you. Seek and you shall find. Knock
   and it shall be opened unto you." "Watch and pray, lest you enter into
   temptation." "Pray without ceasing." "Come boldly unto the Throne of
   Grace." "Draw near to God and He will draw near to you." "Continue in
   prayer."

   I need not multiply where I could not possibly exhaust. I pick two or
   three out of this great bag of pearls. Come, Christian, you ought never
   to question whether you have a right to pray--you should never ask,
   "May I be permitted to come into His Presence?" When you have so many
   commands, (and God's commands are all promises and all enablings), you
   may come boldly unto the Throne of Grace by the new and living way
   through the rent veil. But there are times when God not only commands
   His people to pray in the Bible--He also commands them to pray directly
   by the motions of His Holy Spirit.

   You who know the inner life comprehend me at once. You feel suddenly,
   possibly in the midst of business, the pressing thought that you must
   retire to pray. It may be you do not at first take particular notice of
   the inclination, but it comes again and again and again--"Retire and
   pray!" I find that in the matter of prayer I am myself very much like a
   water-wheel which runs well when there is plenty of water, but which
   turns with very little force when the brook is growing shallow. Or,
   like the ship which flies over the waves putting out all her canvas
   when the wind is favorable, but which has to tack about most
   laboriously when there is but little of the favoring breeze.

   Now it strikes me that whenever our Lord gives you the special
   inclination to pray that you should double your diligence. You ought
   always to pray and not to faint--yet when He gives you the special
   longing after prayer and you feel a peculiar aptness and enjoyment in
   it, you have, over and above the command which is constantly binding,
   another command which should compel you to cheerful obedience. At such
   times I think we may stand in the position of David to whom the Lord
   said. "When you hear a sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry
   trees, then shall you bestir yourself."

   That going in the tops of the mulberry trees may have been the
   footfalls of angels hastening to the help of David and then David was
   to smite the Philistines. And when God's mercies are coming, their
   footfalls are our desires to pray. And our desires to pray should be at
   once an indication that the set time to favor Zion is come. Sow
   plentifully now, for you can sow in hope! Plow joyously now, for your
   harvest is sure! Wrestle now, Jacob, for you are about to be made a
   prevailing prince and your name shall be called Israel! Now is your
   time, spiritual merchantmen! The market is high, trade much--your
   profit shall be large. See to it that you use right well the golden
   hour and reap your harvest while the sun shines.

   When we enjoy visitations from on high we should be peculiarly constant
   in prayer. And if some other duty less pressing should have first place
   for a season, it will not be amiss and we shall be no loser--for when
   God bids us specially pray by the monitions of His Spirit, then should
   we bestir ourselves in prayer.

   II. Let us now take the second head--AN ANSWER PROMISED. We ought not
   to tolerate for a minute the ghastly and grievous thought that God will
   not answer prayer! His Nature, as manifested in Christ Jesus, demands
   it. He has revealed Himself in the Gospel as a God of love, full of
   Grace and truth. And how can He refuse to help those of His creatures
   who humbly, in His own appointed way, seek His face and favor? When the
   Athenian senate upon one occasion found it most convenient to meet
   together in the open air, as they were sitting in their deliberations,
   a sparrow, pursued by a hawk, flew in the direction of the senate.

   Being hard pressed by the bird of prey, it sought shelter in the bosom
   of one of the senators. He, being a man of rough and vulgar mold, took
   the bird from his bosom, dashed it on the ground and so killed it.
   Whereupon the whole senate rose in uproar and without one single
   dissenting voice, condemned him to die, as being unworthy of a seat in
   the senate with them, or to be called an Athenian if he did not render
   succor to a creature that confided in him. Can we suppose that the God
   of Heaven, whose Nature is love, could tear out of His bosom the poor
   fluttering dove that flies from the eagle of Justice into the bosom of
   His Mercy?

   Will He give the invitation to us to seek His face and when we, as He
   knows, with so much trepidation of fear, yet summon courage enough to
   fly into His bosom--will He then be unjust and ungracious enough to
   forget to hear our cry and to answer us? Let us not think so harshly of
   the God of Heaven! Let us recollect next His vast Character as well as
   His Nature. I mean the Character which He has won for Himself by His
   past deeds of Grace. Consider, my Brothers and Sis- ters, that one
   stupendous display of bounty--if I were to mention a thousand I could
   not give a better illustration of the Character of God than that one
   deed--"He that spared not His own Son, but freely delivered Him up for
   us all." And it is not my inference only, but the inspired conclusion
   of an Apostle--"How shall He not with Him also freely give us all
   things?"

   If the Lord did not refuse to listen to my voice when I was a guilty
   sinner and an enemy, how can He disregard my cry now, that I am
   justified and saved? How is it that He heard the voice of my misery
   when my heart knew it not and would not seek relief, if after all He
   will not hear me now that I am His child, His friend? The streaming
   wounds of Jesus are the sure guarantees for answered prayer. George
   Herbert represents in that quaint poem of his, "The Bag," the Savior
   saying--

   "If you ha ve anything to send or write (I ha ve no bag, but here is
   room) Unto My Father's hands and sight, (Belie ve me) it shall safely
   come. That I shall mind what you impart Look, you may put it very near
   My heart, Or if hereafter any of friends Will use Me in this kind, the
   door Shall still be open; what he sends I will present and somewhat
   more Not to his hurt."

   Surely, George Herbert's thought was that the Atonement was in itself a
   guarantee that prayer must be heard--that the great gash made near the
   Savior's heart which let the light into the very depths of the heart of
   Deity--was proof that He who sits in Heaven would hear the cry of His
   people! You misread Calvary if you think that prayer is useless. But,
   Beloved, we have the Lord's own promise for it and He is a God that
   cannot lie--"Call upon Me in the day of trouble and I will answer you."
   Has He not said, "Whatever you shall ask in prayer, believe that you
   shall have it and you shall have it"? We cannot pray, indeed, unless we
   believe this doctrine--"for he that comes to God must believe that He
   is and that He is the rewarder of them that diligently seek Him."

   And if we have any question at all about whether our prayer will be
   heard, we are comparable to him that wavers-- "for he who wavers is
   like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed. Let not that
   man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord." Furthermore, it
   is not necessary, but still it may strengthen the point if we add that
   our own experience leads us to believe that God will answer prayer. I
   must not speak for you, but I may speak for myself. If there is
   anything I know, anything that I am quite assured of beyond all
   question, it is that praying breath is never spent in vain. If no other
   man here can say it, I dare to say it and I know that I can prove it.

   My own conversion is the result of prayer--long, affectionate, earnest,
   importunate. Parents prayed for me! God heard their cries and here I am
   to preach the Gospel. Since then I have adventured upon some things
   that were far beyond my capacity, as I thought. But I have never
   failed, because I have cast myself upon the Lord. You know as a Church
   that I have not scrupled to indulge large ideas of what we might do for
   God. And we have accomplished all that we purposed. I have sought God's
   aid and assistance and help in all my manifold undertakings! And though
   I cannot tell here the story of my private life in God's work, yet if
   it were written it would be a standing proof that there is a God that
   answers prayer!

   He has heard my prayers, not now and then, nor once or twice, but so
   many times that it has grown into a habit with me to spread my case
   before God with the absolute certainty that whatever I ask of God, He
   will give it to me. It is not now a, "perhaps," or a possibility--I
   know that my Lord answers me and I dare not doubt! It were, indeed,
   folly if I did. As I am sure that a certain amount of leverage will
   lift a weight, so I know that a certain amount of prayer will get
   anything from God. As the rain cloud brings the shower, so prayer
   brings the blessing. As spring scatters flowers, so supplication
   ensures mercies. In all labor there is profit, but most of all in the
   work of intercession--I am sure of this--for I have reaped it.

   As I put trust in the queen's money and have never failed yet to buy
   what I want when I produce the cash, so I put my trust in God's
   promises and mean to do so till I find that He shall tell me just once
   that they are base coins and will not do to trade with in Heaven's
   market. But why should I speak? O Brothers and Sisters, you all know in
   your own selves that God hears prayer! If you do not, then where is
   your Christianity? Where is your religion? You will need to learn what
   are the first elements of the Truth of God, for all saints, young or
   old, set it down as certain that He does hear prayer!

   Still, remember that prayer is always to be offered in submission to
   God's will. When we say, "God hears prayer," we do not intend by that
   that He always gives us literally what we ask for. We do mean, however,
   this--that He gives us what is best for us. And that if He does not
   give us the mercy we ask for in silver, He bestows it upon us in gold.
   If He does not take away the thorn in the flesh, yet He says, "My Grace
   is sufficient for you," and that comes to the same in the end. Lord
   Bolingbroke said to the Countess of Huntingdon, "I cannot understand,
   Your Ladyship, how you can make out earnest prayer to be consistent
   with submission to the Divine will."

   "My Lord," she said, "that is a matter of no difficulty. If I were a
   courtier of some generous king and he gave me permission to ask any
   favor I pleased of him, I should be sure to put it thus, 'Will Your
   Majesty be graciously pleased to grant me such-and-such a favor--but at
   the same time, though I very much desire it, if it would in any way
   detract from Your Majesty's honor, or if in Your Majesty's judgment it
   should seem better that I did not have this favor, I shall be quite as
   content to go without it as to receive it.' So you see I might
   earnestly offer a petition and yet I might submissively leave it in the
   king's hands."

   So with God. We never offer up prayer without inserting that clause,
   either in spirit or in words, "Nevertheless, not as I will, but as You
   will. Not my will but Yours be done." We can only pray without an "if
   when we are quite sure that our will must be God's will, because God's
   will is fully our will. A much-slandered poet has well said--"Man,
   regard your prayers as a purpose of love to your soul. Esteem the
   Providence that led to them as an index of God's good will. So shall
   you pray aright and your words shall meet with acceptance. Also, in
   pleading for others, be thankful for the fullness of your prayer. For
   if you are ready to ask, the Lord is more than ready to bestow. The
   salt preserves the sea and the saints uphold the earth. Their prayers
   are the thousand pillars that prop the canopy of Nature.

   "Verily, an hour without prayer, from some terrestrial mind, were a
   curse in the calendar of time, a spot of the blackness of darkness.
   Perchance the terrible day when the world must rock into ruins, will be
   one unwhitened by prayer--shall He find faith on the earth? For there
   is an economy of mercy, as of wisdom and power and means. Neither is
   one blessing granted unbesought from the treasury of good--and the
   charitable heart of the Being, to depend upon whom is happiness, never
   withholds a bounty, so long as His subject prays. Yes, ask what you
   will, to the second throne in Heaven, it is yours, for whom it was
   appointed. There is no limit unto prayer--but if you cease to ask,
   tremble, you self-suspended creature, for your strength is cut off as
   was Samson's--and the hour of your doom is come."

   III. I come to our third point, which I think is full of encouragement
   to all those who exercise the hallowed art of prayer--ENCOURAGEMENT TO
   FAITH. "I will show you great and mighty things, which you know not."
   Let us just remark that this was originally spoken to a Prophet in
   prison, and therefore it applies, in the first place, to every teacher
   and, indeed, as every teacher must be a learner, it has a bearing upon
   every learner in Divine Truth.

   The best way by which a prophet and teacher and learner can know the
   reserved Truths of God--the higher and more mysterious Truths of
   God--is by waiting upon God in prayer. I noticed very specially
   yesterday in reading the Book of the Prophet Daniel, how Daniel found
   out Nebuchadnezzar's dream. The soothsayers, the magicians, the
   astrologers of the Chaldeans brought out their curious books and their
   strange-looking instruments and began to mutter their abracadabra and
   all sorts of mysterious incantations, but they all failed.

   What did Daniel do? He set himself to prayer, and knowing that the
   prayer of a united body of men has more prevalence than the prayer of
   one, we find that Daniel called together his brethren and bade them
   unite with him in earnest prayer that God would be pleased in His
   infinite mercy to open up the vision. "Then Daniel went to his house
   and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, his
   companions, that they would desire mercies of the God of Heaven
   concerning this secret, that Daniel and his fellows should not perish
   with the rest of the wise men of Babylon."

   And in the case of John, who was the Daniel of the New Testament, you
   remember he saw a book in the right hand of Him that sat on the
   Throne--a book sealed with seven seals which none was found worthy to
   open or to look upon. What did John do? The book was by-and-by opened
   by the Lion of the Tribe of Judah who had prevailed to open the book.
   But it is written, first, before the book was opened, "I wept much."
   Yes, and the tears of John which were his liquid prayers, were, as far
   as he was concerned, the sacred keys by which the folded book was
   opened.

   Brethren in the ministry, you who are teachers in the Sunday school and
   all of you who are learners in the college of Christ Jesus, I pray you
   remember that prayer is your best means of study--like Daniel you shall
   understand the dream and the interpretation when you have sought God.
   And like John you shall see the seven seals of the precious Truth of
   God unloosed after you have wept much. "Yes, if you cry after knowledge
   and lift up your voice for understanding: if you seek her as silver and
   search for her as for hid treasures: then shall you understand the fear
   of the Lord and find the knowledge of God."

   Stones are not broken except by an earnest use of the hammer. And the
   stone-breaker usually goes down on his knees. Use the hammer of
   diligence and let the knees of prayer be exercised, too, and there is
   not a stony doctrine in Revelation which is useful for you to
   understand which will not fly into shivers under the exercise of prayer
   and faith. "Bene orasse est bene studuisse" was a wise sentence of
   Luther which has been so often quoted that we hardly venture but to
   hint at it. "To have prayed well is to have studied well."

   You may force your way through anything with the leverage of prayers.
   Thoughts and reasoning may be like the steel wedges which may open a
   way into the Truth of God. But prayer is the lever which forces open
   the iron chest of sacred mystery so that we may get at the treasure
   that is hidden there for those who can force their way to reach it. The
   kingdom of Heaven still suffers violence and the violent takes it by
   force. Take care that you work always with the mighty implement of
   prayer and nothing can stand against you.

   We must not, however, stop there. We have applied the text to only one
   case--it is applicable to a hundred. We single out another. The saint
   may expect to discover deeper experience and to know more of the higher
   spiritual life by being much in prayer. There are different
   translations of my text. One version renders it, "I will show you great
   and fortified things, which you know not." Another reads, "Great and
   reserved things, which you know not." Now all the developments of
   spiritual life are not alike easy of attainment. There are the common
   frames and feelings of repentance and faith and joy and hope which are
   enjoyed by the entire family--but there is an upper realm of rapture,
   of communion and conscious union with Christ--which is far from being
   the common dwelling place of Believers.

   All Believers see Christ, but all Believers do not put their fingers
   into the prints of the nails, nor thrust their hand into His side. We
   have not the high privilege of John to lean upon Jesus' bosom, nor of
   Paul to be caught up into the third Heaven. In the ark of salvation we
   find a lower, second and third story. All are in the ark, but all are
   not in the same story. Most Christians, as to the river of experience,
   are only up to the ankles. Some others have waded till the stream is up
   to the knees. A few find it chest high. And a few--oh, how few!--find
   it a river to swim in, the bottom of which they cannot touch.

   My Brethren, there are heights in experimental knowledge of the things
   of God which the eagle's eye of acumen and philosophical thought has
   never seen. And there are secret paths which the lion's whelp of reason
   and judgment has not as yet learned to travel. God alone can bear us
   there, but the chariot in which He takes us up, and the fiery steeds
   with which that chariot is dragged are prevailing PRAYERS. Prevailing
   prayer is victorious over the God of Mercy. "By his strength he had
   power with God: yes, he had power over the angel and prevailed: he wept
   and made supplication unto Him: he found Him in Bethel, and there He
   spoke with us." Prevailing prayer takes the Christian to Carmel and
   enables him to cover Heaven with clouds of blessing and earth with
   floods of mercy.

   Prevailing prayer bears the Christian aloft to Pisgah and shows him the
   inheritance reserved. Yes, and it elevates him to Tabor and
   transfigures him, till in the likeness of his Lord, as He is, so are
   we! In this world, if you would reach to something higher than ordinary
   groveling experience, look to the Rock that is higher than you and look
   with the eye of faith through the windows of importunate prayer. To
   grow in experience then, there must be much prayer.

   You must have patience with me while I apply this text to two or three
   more cases. It is certainly true of the sufferer under trial--if he
   waits upon God in prayer he shall receive much greater deliverances
   than he has ever dreamed of-- "great and mighty things, which you know
   not." Here is Jeremiah's testimony--"You drew near in the day that I
   called upon You: You said, Fear not. O Lord, You have pleaded the
   causes of my soul. You have redeemed my life." And David's is the
   same--"I called upon the Lord in distress: the Lord answered me and set
   me in a large place...I will praise You: for You have heard me and are
   become my salvation."

   And yet again--"Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and He
   delivered them out of their distresses. And He led them forth by the
   right way, that they might go to a city of habitation." "My husband is
   dead," said the poor woman, "and my creditor is come to take my two
   sons as bondsmen." She hoped that Elijah would possibly say, "What are
   your debts? I will pay them." Instead of that, he multiplies her oil
   till it is written, "Go and pay your debts and"-- what was the
   "and"?--"live you and your children upon the rest." So often it will
   happen that God will not only help His people through the miry places
   of the way so that they may just stand on the other side of the
   slough--but He will bring them safely far on the journey.

   That was a remarkable miracle, when in the midst of the storm, Jesus
   Christ came walking upon the sea! The disciples received Him into the
   ship and not only was the sea calm, but it is recorded, "Immediately
   the ship was at the land where they went." That was a mercy over and
   above what they asked. I sometimes hear you pray and make use of a
   quotation which is not in the Bible--"He is able to do exceeding
   abundantly above what we can ask or even think." It is not so written
   in the Bible. I do not know what we can ask or what we can think. But
   it is said, "He is able to do exceeding abundantly above what we ask or
   even think."

   Let us, then, dear Friends, when we are in great trial, only say, "Now
   I am in prison. Like Jeremiah I will pray as he did, for I have God's
   command to do it. And I will look out as he did, expecting that He will
   show me reserved mercies which I know nothing of at present." He will
   not merely bring His people through the battle, covering their heads in
   it, but He will bring them forth with banners waving to divide the
   spoil with the mighty and to claim their portion with the strong!
   Expect great things of a God who gives such great promises as these!

   Again, here is encouragement for the worker. Most of you are doing
   something for Christ. I am happy to be able to say this, knowing that I
   do not flatter you. My dear Friends, wait upon God much in prayer and
   you have the promise that He will do greater things for you than you
   know of. We know not how much capacity for usefulness there may be in
   us. That ass's jawbone lying there upon the earth--what can it do?
   Nobody knows what it can do. It gets into Samson's hands--what can it
   not do? No one knows what it cannot do now that a Samson wields it! And
   you, Friend, have often thought yourself to be as contemptible as that
   bone and you have said, "What can I do?" Yes, but when Christ, by His
   Spirit grips you--what can you not do?

   Truly you may adopt Paul's language and say, "I can do all things
   through Christ who strengthens me." However, do not depend upon prayer
   without effort. In a certain school there was one girl who knew the
   Lord. She was a very gracious, simple-hearted, trustful child. As
   usual, Divine Grace developed itself in the child according to the
   child's position. Her lessons were always best said of any in the
   class. Another girl said to her, "How is it that your lessons are
   always so well said?" "I pray God to help me," she said, "to learn my
   lesson." "Well," thought the other, "then I will do the same." The next
   morning when she stood up in the class she knew nothing. And when she
   was in disgrace she complained to the other, "I prayed God to help me
   learn my lesson and I do not know anything of it. What is the use of
   prayer?"

   "But did you sit down and try to learn it?" "Oh, no," she said, "I
   never looked at the book." "Ah, then," said the other, "I asked God to
   help me to learn my lesson--but I then sat down to it studiously and I
   kept at it till I knew it well and I learned it easily, because my
   earnest desire, which I had expressed to God was, help me to be
   diligent in endeavoring to do my duty." So is it with some who come up
   to Prayer Meetings and pray and then they fold their arms and go away
   hoping that God's work will go on. Like the Negro woman singing, "Fly
   abroad, you mighty Gospel," but not putting a penny in the plate--so
   that her friend touched her and said, "But how can it fly if you don't
   give it wings to fly with?"

   There are many who appear to be very mighty in prayer, wondrous in
   supplications! But then they require God to do what they can do
   themselves and therefore God does nothing at all for them. "I shall
   leave my camel untied," said an Arab once to Mahomet, "and trust to
   providence." "Tie it up," said Mahomet, "and then trust to providence."
   So you that say, "I shall pray and trust my Church, or my class, or my
   work to God's goodness," may rather hear the voice of Experience and
   Wisdom which say, "Do your best. Work as if all rested upon your
   toil--as if your own aim would bring your salvation. And when you have
   done all, cast yourself on Him without whom it is in vain to rise up
   early and to sit up late and to eat the bread of carefulness. And if He
   speeds you give Him the praise."

   I shall not detain you many minutes longer, but I want to notice that
   this promise ought to prove useful for the comforting of those who are
   intercessors for others. You who are calling upon God to save your
   children, to bless your neighbors, to remember your husbands or your
   wives in mercy may take comfort from this! "I will show you great and
   mighty things, which you know not." A celebrated minister in the last
   century, one Mr. Bailey, was the child of a godly mother. This mother
   had almost ceased to pray for her husband who was a man of a most
   ungodly stamp and a bitter persecutor.

   The mother prayed for her boy and while he was yet eleven or twelve
   years of age, eternal mercy met with him. So sweetly instructed was the
   child in the things of the kingdom of God that the mother requested
   him--and for some time he always did so--to conduct family prayer in
   the house. Morning and evening this little one laid open the Bible. And
   though the father would not deign to stop for the family prayer, yet on
   one occasion he was rather curious to know, "what sort of an out the
   boy would make of it," so he stopped on the other side of the door and
   God blessed the prayer of his own child under thirteen years of age to
   his conversion!

   Said the mother, "I might well have read my text with streaming eyes
   and said, 'Yes, Lord, You have shown me great and mighty things, which
   I knew not! You have not only saved my boy, but through my boy You have
   brought my husband to the Truth." You cannot guess how greatly God will
   bless you! Only go and stand at His door--you cannot tell what is in
   reserve for you. If you do not beg at all, you will get nothing. But if
   you beg He may not only give you, as it were, the bones and broken
   meat, but He may say to the servant at His table, "Take that dainty
   meat and set that before the poor man."

   Ruth went to glean. She expected to get a few good ears--but Boaz said,
   "Let her glean even among the sheaves and rebuke her not." He said,
   moreover, to her, "At mealtime come here and eat of the bread and dip
   your morsel in the vinegar." She found a husband where she only
   expected to find a handful of barley. So in prayer for others, God may
   give us such mercies that we shall be astounded at them since we
   expected but little. Hear what is said of Job and learn its lesson,
   "And the Lord said, My servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I
   accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that you have not
   spoken of Me the thing which is right, like My servant Job...And the
   Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also
   the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before."

   Now, this word to close with. Some of you are seekers for your own
   conversion. God has quickened you to solemn prayer about your own
   souls. You are not content to go to Hell. You want Heaven. You want
   washing in the precious blood--you want eternal life. Dear Friends, I
   pray you take this text--God Himself speaks it to you--"Call unto Me
   and I will answer you and show you great and mighty things, which you
   know not." At once take God at His Word. Get home--go into your chamber
   and shut the door and try Him!

   Young man, I say, Try the Lord! Young woman, prove Him--see whether He
   is true or not! If God is true, you cannot seek mercy at His hands
   through Jesus Christ and get a negative reply. He must--for His own
   promise and Character bind him to it--open Mercy's gate to you who
   knock with all your heart! God help you, believing in Christ Jesus, to
   cry aloud unto God and His answer of peace is already on the way to
   meet you! You shall hear Him say, "Your sins, which are many, are all
   forgiven." The Lord bless you for His love's sake. Amen.

   [NOTE--In a former sermon, while denouncing the error of the
   "non-confession of sin by Believers," we wrongly imputed that gross
   heresy to the Plymouth Brethren. We have since learned that the persons
   to whom we alluded have been expelled from that body and we therefore
   desire to exonerate the community from a fault of which they are not
   guilty. We are sorry to have made this charge, as it is far from our
   wish to speak evil of any, but we were not aware of the expulsion of
   the guilty persons.]

                      A Warning Against Hardness Of Heart

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MARCH 19, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But exhort one another daily, while it is called 'Today,'lest any of
   you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin." Hebrews 3:13.

   THE children of Israel, in their coming out of Egypt and in their forty
   years' sojourn in the wilderness, represented the visible Church of the
   living God--not the secret and elect body of the redeemed--but the
   professing company of the outward Church. They were very prone to the
   great sin of unbelief. They believed in God after a fashion while they
   saw His wonders, but the moment they were brought into straits or
   difficulties, they at once began to doubt the power of Jehovah and to
   cast off all reverence for His authority. Therefore they fell into
   another sin which at last fastened on them so as to become a part of
   their nature--they became stiff-necked, obstinate, rebellious, perverse
   and hard of heart.

   They would not learn, although their lesson-book had miracles for its
   pictures. Their hearts became so hard that albeit they saw all the
   great things which God did for them, they despised the pleasant land
   and were ready at times for the sake of the flesh-pots of Egypt, to
   wear again the yoke of Pharaoh and to die the inglorious death of
   slaves. Such, too, are the great sins of the Christian Church--unbelief
   the root--and obstinacy the fruit.

   Brothers and Sisters, if we know our own hearts we must confess that
   unbelief is a sin which does very easily beset us and that our
   obstinacy may well provoke the Lord to anger. We rejoice in God while
   the rocks run with rivers and while the daily manna drops about our
   tents. But when the fiery serpent bites us, or the wells are bitter, or
   our comforts are in any way interfered with, we begin to distrust and
   to suspect the faithfulness of God. And as the result of this, there is
   an obstinacy about us which often inclines us to stand out against the
   plain precepts of God, because, in the judgment of our unbelief,
   obedience might lead us into trouble and disobedience might make our
   path smooth.

   Oh that it were not so! It is sadly true that God's people are liable
   to be overtaken by the worst of sins! Egypt itself did not produce
   worse sins than those which provoked the Lord to anger in the camp of
   Israel. And to this day the Church has some in it who defile her with
   all the sins of the world. I do not mean to insinuate that the Church
   of God is not infinitely to be preferred to the world in character--God
   forbid that I should slander the fair bride of Christ--she is as much
   superior to the world as the curtains of Solomon excel the
   smoke-blacked tents of Kedar!

   But who dares deny that there are specimens to be found of the worst of
   sins occurring among the best of men? Just as in the most carefully
   tended garden there will spring up here and there some of the most
   noxious weeds--not that the weeds are permitted to smother the whole
   garden and kill the flowers--but that their coming while men sleep is
   an indication of what the soil is. And it is a plain manifestation that
   although the garden is very different from the piece of waste ground on
   the other side of the wall, yet it differs not in nature--but owes all
   its superiority to the culture of the farmer! Even so, the saints owe
   all their excellence above the very chief of sinners to the guardian
   care and Omnipotent Grace of the great lover of souls.

   It seems, dear Friends, that it is really necessary to warn God's
   people, although they have received the new nature and are partakers of
   the adoption, against being hardened in heart through the deceitfulness
   of sin. But there is a machinery provided by which the saints may be
   preserved from this great evil. "Exhort one another daily, lest any of
   you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin."

   We will talk together thus this morning. First, we shall dwell for a
   season upon the hardening effect of sin upon men, whether saints or
   sinners. Then we shall show the peculiar power by which sin hardens,
   namely, through its deceitfulness. Then we will consider the remedy
   which we are to use with others--"Exhort one another daily." But what
   if we should be diseased ourselves with this same hardness of heart?
   Then it will be necessary for us to have a few words concerning what to
   do for ourselves if we have to complain of a growing insensibility of
   Spirit, as I am afraid some of us may most justly do.

   I. First, then, dear Friends, THE HARDENING CHARACTER OF SIN. This is
   matter of experience. The first sin which came into the world hardened
   man's heart in a most terrific manner so that he dared to excuse
   himself and even to charge God as being indirectly the author of his
   sin, by giving him the woman! No sooner had Adam tasted of the
   forbidden fruit than a stony hardness came upon his moral nature. The
   heart of sensitive flesh was suddenly petrified and became hard,
   unfeeling stone.

   He no longer shrank from the thought of sin, but tried to hide himself
   from the Presence of his best Friend. He felt his nakedness in some
   degree but that which made him naked he did not lament or even confess
   before his God. He would never have been content with an apron of fig
   leaves if he had known the full measure of his degradation. His unborn
   children in that dread hour participated in his fall and are now born
   into the world with a stone in their hearts. Man's heart, naturally, is
   like that of Leviathan, of which the Lord says, "It is as firm as a
   stone, yes, hard as a piece of the nether millstone."

   The lower stone of the two in the mill was always chosen on account of
   its peculiar hardness. Still, hard as the heart is by nature, it may
   grow harder by practice and by association with sin, even as Zechariah
   writes of sinners in his day, "Yes, they made their hearts as an
   adamant stone, lest they should hear the Law" (Zech. 7:12). There is no
   doubt whatever that living among sinners has a hardening tendency upon
   men. You cannot walk about in this great lazar-house without receiving
   some contagion, though you were pure in heart. Unless you had the
   absolute perfection and Godhead of Christ Jesus to protect you, the
   Prince of this world would make you his prey. It were hard to dwell in
   so foul a world as this without contracting some impurity.

   Those black coals which fill this earthly cellar--if they will not burn
   us--will at least blacken us. When so many fires of sin are pouring
   forth their smoke, the whitest of linen cannot escape the falling ash.
   If "the thought of foolishness is sin," and we have Divine authority
   for so judging, then even to think of sin exercises a polluting
   influence. Can I read a description of another man's sin without
   getting my heart hardened? I question if reading the daily reports of
   crime in the police news is not a very fertile cause of sin. Great
   crimes usually produce their like in congenial winds and even in the
   purest hearts their recital cannot but have an injurious effect.

   The tree of knowledge of good and evil bears dangerous fruit--it were
   well if we restrained our curiosity--and left foul deeds alone,
   unknown, unread by us. What good can come from turning over the foul
   dunghill of crime? Let those traverse our sewers whose business it is
   to do so. Is it not better for the most of us to keep out of them?
   Those who are called in Providence to deal daily with the coarser sins
   had need to set a special watch over themselves lest they fall by
   little and little. Let me here remark that the sins of God's people are
   peculiarly operative in this manner.

   If I see a drunk intoxicated, I am simply shocked at him--but I am not
   likely to imitate his example. But if I see the same vice in a man whom
   I respect and whose example has up to now been to me the guide of my
   life, I may be greatly grieved at first, but the tendency of my mind
   will be to make an excuse for him. And when one has succeeded in
   framing a plausible excuse for the sin of another, it is very natural
   to use it on one's own behalf.

   Association with inconsistent Christians has been the downfall of many
   young Believers. The devil delights to use God's own birds as a decoy
   for his nets. "I could not have thought it," says the young Christian,
   "that men whom I esteemed as saints would have acted so." "Well, well,"
   is the next reflection, "if these are good men and go to Heaven and yet
   act so badly, then I need not be so precise." And thus, by a course of
   reasoning which sin makes as easy as casting up accounts by a ready
   reckoner, we arrive at the conclusion that perhaps what we avoided as a
   sin may have been no sin at all! And we therefore indulge in it without
   stint and step by step come down to the level of this evil generation.

   He who handles edged tools, is apt to cut his fingers and none the less
   so because the knife is made of the best steel. Let us walk warily
   among men like a man with naked feet when going over thorny ground,
   lest our hurt be grievous. I am fearful that even preaching against sin
   may have an injurious effect upon the preacher. I frankly confess, my
   Brethren, that there is a tendency with those of us who have to speak
   upon these themes to treat them professionally, rather than to make
   application of them to ourselves. And thus we lose our dread of evil in
   some degree--just as young doctors soon lose their tender nervousness
   in the operating room.

   We are compelled in our office to see ten thousand things which at
   first are heart breakers to us. In our young ministry, when we meet
   with hypocrisy and inconsistency, we are ready to lie down and die. but
   the tendency in after years is to take these terrible evils as matters
   of course. Worldliness, covetousness and carnality shock us most at the
   outset of our work--is not this a sad sign that even God's ministers
   may feel the hardening effect of sin? I daily feel that the atmosphere
   of earth has as much a tendency to harden my heart as to harden plaster
   which is newly spread upon the wall. And unless I am baptized anew with
   the Spirit of God and constantly stand at the foot of the
   Cross--reading the curse of sin in the crimson hieroglyphics of my
   Savior's dying agonies--I shall become as steeled and insensible as the
   mass of professors already are.

   I cannot enter at length into the whole matter, but let me trace the
   gradual process of hardening of heart which may take place in a measure
   in a true Christian--but in its full extent in the mere professor whose
   religion lacks the inward vital principle. You must understand that the
   hardening of a tender conscience is a gradual process, something like
   the covering of a pond with ice on a frosty night. At first you can
   scarcely see that freezing is going on at all. There are certain signs
   which a thoroughly practiced eye may be able to detect as prognostics
   of ice, but the most of us would see nothing. By and by, there is ice,
   but it would scarcely support a pin. If you should place a needle upon
   it ever so gently, it would fall through.

   In due time you perceive a thin coating which might sustain a pebble
   and before long a child trips merrily over it and if old Winter holds
   his court long enough, it may be that a loaded wagon may be driven over
   the frozen lake, or a whole army may march without fear across the
   stream. There may be no rapid congelation at any one moment and yet the
   freezing is complete enough in the end. Apostates and great backsliders
   do not reach their worst at one bound. The descent to Hell is sometimes
   a precipice--but far oftener a smooth and gentle slope. It were hard to
   find out in the worst of men exactly when they were utterly given up to
   judicial blindness. It is often a long and laborious process by which
   conscience is completely seared.

   This dreadful work usually begins thus--the man's first carefulness and
   tenderness departs. When you were first converted you felt afraid to
   put one foot down before another for fear you should go astray. You
   scarcely ever ventured from your house without an anxiety to be kept by
   the Grace of God. You used to pray in the morning with great ardor and
   earnestness that not a thought might be awry, not one single word
   amiss. And, when business was over at night you felt uneasy lest in
   anything, however trivial, you might have injured your profession and
   grieved the Spirit of God.

   Well do I recollect when I was the subject of excessive
   tenderness--some people called it "morbid sensibility." How I shuddered
   and shivered at the very thought of sin which then appeared exceedingly
   sinful. I would to God I could always feel as I then did! O Believer,
   your new-born character was then white as the lily and the smallest
   grain of dust would show upon it! Your life was bright and shining and
   the least speck could be discovered and you, yourself, were like the
   sensitive plant--the slightest touch of sin sent a thrill of horror
   through every fiber of your soul. But it is not so now, at least not to
   the same admirable degree.

   It may be you can hear talk to which formerly you would have closed
   your ears. You can tolerate sins which once you would have shunned as
   though they were deadly serpents. Your walk is somewhat careless
   now--great sins you avoid right heedfully--but secret sin gives you
   little or no concern. The departure of that blessed sensibility of soul
   which marks the new birth is one very serious mark of declension. It
   may not seem a great evil to have less abhorrence of evil, but this
   truly is the egg from which the worst mischief may come. Hear me
   attentively, O my Brothers and Sisters to whom this message is
   directed--as I rebuke you in the words of the Savior in the
   Revelation--"Nevertheless, I have something against you, because you
   have left your first love."

   The next distressing sign of growing hardness is increasing neglect or
   laxity of private devotion without any corresponding shock of the
   spiritual sensibilities on account of it. The daily prayer will become
   shorter and shorter, if not irregular. Occasionally the period allotted
   to the reading of the Word will be given to business or worldly
   pleasure and perhaps frequently forgotten and neglected. It may perhaps
   have happened at the first that on some occasion we could not
   conveniently read the Scriptures according to our desire and our
   prayers were necessarily shortened. But then we sought to make up for
   the loss at the first opportunity and we felt like men who, having been
   cut short at their meals, must eat the more freely next time.

   But now I am afraid these things become common with some professors and
   they scarcely care to invent an excuse for their slackness in Divine
   things. O what poor pleas do some men offer for deserting their
   closets! How unjustly may unread Bibles accuse those pretenders to
   Divine Grace who treat them so ill! Alas, Brothers and Sisters, we may
   look each other in the face and few of us can plead, "Guiltless."
   Divine Spirit, help us to awake out of sleep and to shake off this
   deadly lethargy!

   Another symptom of increasing callousness of heart is the fact that
   hidings of the Savior's face do not cause that acute and poignant
   sorrow which they produced in former times. Ah, my soul recollects when
   she walked in the full blaze of Jesus' love--when the very thought of
   His turning His face away seemed like the chill blast of winter nipping
   the summer flowers of my soul. Then I sang--

   "Your shining face can cheer, This dungeon where I dwell 'Tis Paradise
   if You are here, If You depart, 'tis Hell."

   I have sometimes walked in darkness and have seen no light. And I
   confess deep shame and profound sorrow that I have occasionally been
   half indifferent whether Jesus shone forth or not.

   The spouse who fondly loves her husband longs for his return if he is
   absent. A long protracted separation from her mate is a semi-death to
   her spirit--and so with souls who love the Savior much. They must see
   His face--they cannot bear that He should be away upon the mountains of
   Bether and no more hold communion with them. A child that is full of
   love to its parent cannot endure a frown. An angry pat is heavy--a
   stroke cuts to the very heart. A reproaching look, a glance of rebuke,
   an uplifted finger will be grievous to good and loving children who
   fear to offend their tender father and are only happy in his smile.

   Oh, Beloved, it was so once with you! A text of Scripture, a threat, a
   touch of the rod of affliction and you went to your Father's feet,
   crying, "Show me why You contend with me." Is it so now? Are you
   content to follow Jesus afar off? Content to be a wanderer from your
   Father's house? Can you contemplate suspended communion with Christ
   without alarm? Can you bear to have your Beloved walking contrary to
   you because you walk contrary to Him? Have your sins separated you and
   your God, and is your heart at rest? O my beloved Brothers and Sisters,
   let me affectionately and even tearfully warn you--it is a grievous
   token of hardness of heart when we can live contentedly without the
   present enjoyment of the Savior's face!

   Still further, when the soul is hardened to this extent, it is probable
   that sin will no longer cause such grief as it once did. Brother, you
   remember how you humbled yourself before God with many fears when in
   your former days you felt that you had made a slip in your
   conversation? You could not sleep that night. Even that precious
   promise, which you tried to lay hold of, could hardly quiet your
   agitated mind. You bemoaned yourself most piteously, crying out upon
   your bed, "I have dishonored the Lord that bought me! I have been false
   to my profession and my love to Jesus!"

   Your spirit had no rest even the next day, nor could time assuage your
   bitterness of grief. It was only when the Savior had, by His sweet
   consolations and the application of His precious blood, effectually
   purged your conscience that your soul at last had rest. My Brother, it
   may be you have lately sinned far worse than you did then, but you do
   not smart half so severely. Your life is not so pure as it once was,
   but still your heart is quite as peaceful, for an evil spirit whispers,
   "Peace, peace," where there is no peace.

   Dr. Preston tells us of a professor who on one occasion was found
   drunk. And when much depressed on account of his folly, the devil said
   to him by way of temptation, "Do it again, do it again," for said he,
   "the grief you feel about it now, you will never feel any more if you
   commit the sin again." Dr. Preston says that the man yielded to the
   temptation and from that time he never did feel the slightest regret at
   his drunkenness and lived and died a confirmed sot, though formerly he
   had been a very high professor. Take special heed of the second sin if
   you have already fallen into the first, for that second fall may most
   effectually prevent your repenting and returning to the right way--the
   habit will take you as in an iron net and hold you fast to be dragged
   down with other hypocrites like you to the lowest depths of Hell.

   It is a sad sign of coming declension, no, of decline already come,
   when we can talk of sin lightly, make excuses for it, or make jokes
   about it--when we can see it in others without sorrow--and in ourselves
   without the greatest shame. The next stop in this ladder, down, down,
   down to destruction is that sin, thus causing less grief, is indulged
   in more freely. The man had fallen the first time--the second time he
   deliberately lies down. The first time he was overtaken in a fault--
   the second time he overtakes the fault and runs after the sin. The
   first time he was a victim--the second time he is most willingly given
   up to it.

   The first time he drank the cup by mistake, or by a kind of
   compulsion--but the second time he comes to the feast like that of
   Ahasuerus, where none compel and yet he rejoices to be a ringleader in
   rioting. First he sipped, but now, like the ox, he drinks by the
   bucketful. At first he carried only a spark in his bosom, but now he
   bears a whole brazier of burning coals and cries that it is sport. The
   man may not be ripe enough yet for outward sins under the immediate eye
   of the world--the probability is that he keeps his iniquities private.
   He eats the bread of sin in secret. He drinks, but no one calls him a
   drunk because it is done at home.

   He commits lust, but no one charges him with it because he carefully
   conceals his tracks and indulges himself only when he is out of sight
   of his fellows. He robs in business, but no one can detect it. Perhaps
   even the ledger does not show it--there is a particular way of making
   ends meet in dishonesty by which a tradesman may be a gross thief and
   continue to be so and yet by putting a gloss on matters, can maintain
   his repute and be considered honest. Into such a state of heart I fear
   that even some of God's children may for a time, be suffered to
   fall--but the far greater probability is that those who descend so low
   are hypocrites and know not the Grace of God in truth. I pray God we
   may never prove by experience how nearly an heir of Heaven may become
   like a child of wrath.

   After this there is still a greater hardening of heart--the man comes
   to dislike rebukes. He has sinned so long and yet he has been held in
   such respect in the Christian Church that if you give half a hint about
   his sin, he looks at you with a sharp look as if you were insulting
   him. He is not to be talked to or spoken with--he has been taken for a
   flaming professor so many years that he is not to be suspected now. You
   may rebuke the sins of the congregation and he will be gratified if you
   do not make too particular an application. You may declaim against his
   sin in public, but woe unto the friend who shall be daring enough to
   give a private admonition.

   The more a man loves his sin and needs rebuke the more heartily will he
   hate the person who, with the best of motives, lays it at his door!
   Mark this word--if this hardening work goes on, the day comes at last
   to such a man that the Word of God loses all effect upon him--whether
   he reads it or hears it, it ceases to be an accusing voice any longer.
   He rather finds a song of lullaby in it, and rocked in the cradle of
   his sin he sleeps on to his own eternal ruin. You say, "Can a child of
   God come as far as this?" I believe not, my Brothers and Sisters, but I
   am speaking now of professors at large. These professors have, at last,
   learned to sleep over the mouth of Hell and dream of Heaven while
   damnation is denounced upon them.

   I fear that some here are as easy under the thunders of God's Law as
   the blacksmith's dog under the sound of his master's hammer with the
   sparks flying about him. Some of you have heard the Gospel so long and
   have made a profession of being saved so long, that being still
   unconverted there is now little hope for you! The Gospel has no power
   over you-- you know it so well and love it so little. If your character
   could be photographed, you would not acknowledge it. If we preach
   against hypocrisy, hypocrites say, "Admirable! Admirable!" If we deal
   out threats against secret sin, secret sinners feel a little twinge,
   but forget it all and say--"An excellent discourse."

   They have hardened their neck against God's Word! They have made their
   brows like flints and their hearts adamant stones and now they might
   just as well stay away from the House of God as not! There is but
   little hope that the Word will ever be blest to them--their soul has
   become hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. And yet would I have
   them keep from the means of Grace? No, for with God nothing is
   impossible! The Sovereign Grace of God may yet step in and He who has
   power to heal may yet in the mighty majesty of His love speak to the
   heart of stone and make it gush forth with rivers of repentance like
   the rock in the wilderness of old!

   II. We come, in the second place, to notice THE PECULIAR POWER WHICH
   LIES IN SIN TO HARDEN THE

   HEART. It is the deceitfulness of sin. The heart is deceitful and sin
   is deceitful. And when these two deceitful ones lay their heads
   together to make up a case there is no wonder if man, like a silly
   dove, is taken in their net! One of the first ways in which sin
   deceives the professor is by saving, "You see no hurt has come of it.
   The thing is hid--nobody has mentioned it to the Church officers. It is
   not known among the members. In fact, nobody has heard of it--you may
   as well enjoy yourself as not. You are not doing any mischief--if there
   is anything wrong it is confined to yourself."

   "Really," says Sin, "I cannot see that you are any the worse. You
   preached quite well last Sunday. You prayed quite well at the Prayer
   Meeting and as far as the family altar is concerned, there was not much
   difference there. Evidently sin has not hurt you--do it again! Do it
   again!" You must not forget that the immediate results of sin are not
   always apparent in this world, and that if hardness of heart is not
   apparent it is all the more real--for if a man could perceive the
   hardness or his own heart it would be pretty good evidence that it was
   somewhat softened.

   Then Sin will whisper next, "This would be sin in other people, but it
   is not in you. You see you were placed in a peculiar position. There is
   indulgence for you which could not be accorded to other men--you are
   young," says Sin, "nobody could accuse you if you did go a little
   rashly to work--if you were an older professor it would be very wrong."
   Then if it is an old man who is to be deceived, Sin will cry, "You must
   take care of yourself! You need more indulgence than others." If a man
   is in private life, Sin will then suggest, "It does not matter in
   you--it would be wrong in a deacon, or any other Church officer--but
   nobody knows it in your case."

   If it is some person in high repute, then Sin whispers, "Your character
   is so well established it will bear it." There is a way in which you
   can look at things and see them as they are not. Sin knows how to use
   the distorting glass so that a man will turn round on this side and
   condemn his fellow for a sin and call him some terrible name--and then
   he will turn to the other side and commit the same sin himself! And,
   like the adulterous woman in the Proverbs, he will wipe his mouth and
   say, "I have done no wickedness."

   Sin, if it cannot deceive in this way, will beguile its victim by
   insinuating, "Now this is a dangerous thing for others to do. But in
   your case, you have so much prudence and have acquired so much
   experience that you can stop when you reach a certain point. I know,"
   says Sin, "young So-and-So was ruined by frequenting such-and-such
   places, but you may go in and out of the same doors because you have so
   much discretion. It would be dangerous to expose your son to such a
   temptation, and of course you would not like the Church to know that
   you go there. But really, you are a person so well established and you
   know the world so thoroughly, that you may do without the slightest
   hurt what others may not even dream of."

   It is a great and grievous lie, as we ought to know, that sin can ever
   be touched without injury, but yet this suffices for many--"I will go
   to the verge of the precipice. I will look down. I will get the
   delicious feeling of the sublimity of danger and then will go back. I
   will mix with bad company sufficiently to know its evils. I would not
   go over the line for all the world--I shall be sure to stop just on
   this side of it." Such boasters remind one of that simple story of the
   lady who wanted a coachman. When three applied, she had them in one by
   one. "Well," she said to the first, "How near can you drive to danger?"
   "Madam," said he, "I believe I could drive within a foot without fear."
   "You will not do for me" she said.

   To the second she said, "How near could you drive to danger?" "Within a
   hair's breadth, Madam," said he, "and yet, you would be perfectly
   safe." "You will not suit me," she said. The third came in and when
   asked the same question "How near could you drive to danger?" he said,
   "Please Ma'am, I never tried. I always drive as far off as ever I can."
   Such should the Christian act. Some, through the deceitfulness of sin,
   are always testing how near they can go to the edge so as not to fall
   over. How near they can sail to the rock and not dash upon it. How much
   sin they can indulge in and yet remain respected Church members. Shame
   on us, that any of us should be guilty of such tampering with that
   accursed thing which slew the Lord of Glory!

   Again, sin will sometimes have the impudence to say, "It is very easy
   to repent of it. If you have once plunged into the mire, you can at any
   time see the evil of it and you have only to repent and straightway
   there is forgiveness." This vile traitor is even dastardly enough to
   take the Doctrines of Grace and turn them into a reason for sin. The
   old serpent hisses out, as none but the devil dares do, "God will not
   cast you off! He never casts away His people. He can soon visit you in
   mercy and lift you up to the highest state of spirituality! Though you
   may have fallen into the lowest condition of degradation, you run no
   risks as others would for the eternal purpose of God is engaged to keep
   you from final perdition and therefore you may drink the deadly thing
   and it shall not hurt you. You may tread upon serpents and they shall
   not bite you."

   "Their damnation is just," says the Apostle, of those who use the
   Doctrines of Grace as an argument for licentiousness. The child of God
   scorns the thought of making the love of God a reason for sin! When a
   little boy was tempted to steal from an orchard, the others said to
   him, "You my safely do it. Your father is so fond of you that he will
   not beat you." "No, no," said the little fellow, "that is the very
   reason why I would not go a thieving, for I should grieve my fa- ther
   who is so kind and so good to me." Yet the deceitfulness of sin is such
   that it will turn the strongest motive for holiness into an argument
   for rebellion against God!

   My dear Friends, I feel the weight of this subject pressing down on my
   own heart. And for that very reason I cannot bring out these Truths of
   God as I would desire, so as to make them flash into your faces. But I
   do feel that it must be true of some of you who make a profession of
   religion, that sin, through its deceitfulness, is tampering with your
   spirits, trying to make you traitors to God--seeking, if it possibly
   can--to pervert your mind from hatred of sin and from true love to
   Jesus, Christ.

   III. I pass on, however, to hint at THE REMEDY WHICH IS PROVIDED IN THE
   TEXT FOR US TO USE WITH OTHERS. "Exhort one another," and we are told
   when to do it--"daily," and when to begin to do it--"while it is called
   today." Doubtless many professors would be saved from gross sins if
   mutual exhortation were more commonly practiced in the Churches of God
   in the power of the Holy Spirit.

   This duty belongs primarily to the pastor and to Church officers. We
   are set in the Church to see after the good of the people and it is our
   business both in public and in private, as far as we have opportunity,
   to exhort daily. And especially where we see any coldness creeping over
   men. Where there begins to be a decline in the ways of God, it is our
   duty to be most earnest in exhortation. The duty belongs to you all,
   too, "Exhort one another daily." Parents should be careful concerning
   their children in this matter. You act not the part of a true father
   unless you see to it your son is in church membership.

   Upon the slightest inconsistency your children should receive a gentle
   word of rebuke from you. You matrons in Israel--you are not true
   mothers of the Church unless you look after the young sisters to keep
   them out of sin. Sunday school teachers, this is peculiarly your work
   with regard to your own classes. In this Church so many have been
   brought out of the school into the Church, that I may insist the more
   earnestly upon this duty. Watch over your children, not only that they
   may be converted, but that after being converted they may be as watered
   gardens--no plants withering-- but all the Graces of the Spirit coming
   to perfection through your care.

   Here is work for the elders among us. You whose grey heads betoken
   years of experience and whose years of experience ought to have given
   you wisdom and knowledge, you may use the superiority which age affords
   you to offer a word of exhortation, lovingly and tenderly, to the
   young. You can speak as those of us who are younger cannot speak--for
   you can tell what you have tasted and have handled. Perhaps you can
   even tell where you have smarted by reason of your own faults and
   follies. All of you, without exception, whether you are rich or poor,
   see to each others' souls! Say not, "Am I my brother's keeper?" but
   seek your brother's good for edification.

   I do hope there will be a larger degree of sociality among the members
   of this Church than ever, although up to now I have had no cause of
   complaint. Some churches never can practice mutual exhortation because
   the members do not know each other. The members are lumps of ice
   floating about--huge blocks of ice without connection with one another.
   It ought not to be so--the very fact of Church membership, drinking of
   the same cup, eating of the same bread, it seems to me, entitles every
   man to admonish and to be admonished. No, it makes it the imperative
   duty of every such person to see that he cares for the soul of his
   fellow.

   I would not abolish social distinctions, God forbid! They must ever
   exist, I believe, at least till the Lord comes. But in the Church of
   God, membership and brotherhood should, at least when you come together
   here, override all social distinctions. And as in Cromwell's army, the
   private might often be heard around the campfire talking to the major
   and the captain taking it upon himself to rebuke the colonel--so should
   it be among us. We should feel that we are one in Christ Jesus--that
   while we regard distinctions among men in civil life, yet in spiritual
   things we so care for each other's good and so desire the edification
   of the entire body of Christ that we watch over one another carefully
   and prayerfully--and exhort one another daily.

   In such a Church as this there is peculiar need of it. What can we, a
   handful of Church officers, do among three thousand of you? If you do
   not exercise oversight over one another, what can be done? I thank God
   the duty is not altogether neglected, but I would stimulate you to a
   greater diligence in the exercise of it. You know of someone, perhaps,
   who is backsliding--do not tell anybody else--go privately to him. You
   know of a Sister whose spiritual life is in a decline. Do not talk to
   your neighbors, or even, at first, communicate with us about it--labor
   to get your own heart right and then seek to restore such an one in the
   spirit of meekness, remembering yourself lest you also be tempted.

   If we do not do this, we shall as a Church suffer great dishonor. It is
   unavoidable in so many but that we should be troubled with some
   hypocrites. How can our Church be kept right, instrumentally, except by
   much watchfulness? We do not wish to be dishonored. We do not desire by
   great falls to grieve the name of Christ. Then let us watch over one
   another. It is so pleasant and so blessed to restore a Brother from the
   error of his ways that I can offer you no greater reward than these
   two-- to screen the name of Christ from shame--and to have the pleasure
   of saving a soul from death and covering a multitude of sins.

   IV. Lastly, SUPPOSE THIS TO BE THE CASE WITH ANY ONE OF US, WHAT THEN?
   We cannot very well, as a rule, ask a Brother to exhort us when we feel
   conscious of insensibility, although it were well if some dear friend
   could be trusted to give us, every now and then, a solemn admonition.
   Some of us are in such a position that we are not very likely to be
   exhorted--we are keepers of the vineyard and have none who would take
   upon themselves to admonish us.

   Our enemies, however, very ably supply the lack--for they often tell us
   very profitable, but very unpleasant truths which do us a deal of good
   and they are never restrained by any fear of hurting our feelings. We
   have great reason to thank God for some men's enmity--it is the only
   way in which they could serve us. Failing this--and private Christians
   miss this bitter medicine--what is to be done? Suppose we have begun to
   falter? What is to be done? Shall I say, "Suppose?" Come, pass the
   question round, dear Friends. Is it not true with too many of us that
   we are growing careless and insensible?

   Do I not hear some honest hearts cry, "There is no supposition in the
   case, we have already gone back"? Public services to some of you have
   grown dull compared with what they used to be and yet the preacher is
   the same! Prayer Meetings you scarcely attend, or if you are there,
   your hearts are not on fire with vehement longings after your God.
   Private prayer drags heavily. Bible reading is almost given up.
   Communion with Christ is becoming a thing of the past. Holy joys and
   Divine ecstasies are things which you have read of and heard about--but
   do not yourselves enjoy! May it not be so with you!

   I feel, sometimes as if were I cut in my heart with a sword, I would
   bless the sword, so long as I could but smart and bleed under it. Oh it
   is a horrible thing, an accursed thing, to abide in a state of
   insensibility! Oh, for heartbreaks! To have a heart broken thoroughly
   would be a blessing! Yes, to be driven to despair might be an enviable
   thing rather than not to feel at all! I will not, therefore, say,
   "Suppose," but I will say it is so with a great many! Then what had we
   better do? My Brethren, let us labor to feel what an evil thing this
   is--little love to our own dying Savior--little joy in our precious
   Jesus! Little fellowship with our spiritual and well-beloved Husband,
   our Lord, our covenant Head.

   Be ashamed and be confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel!
   Cover your faces, Brothers and Sisters, and let boasting be put away.
   Put on sackcloth! Heap ashes on your heads! Hold a true Lent in your
   souls, while you sorrow over your hardness of heart. Do not stop at
   sorrow! Remember where you first received salvation. Go at once to the
   Cross. There, and there only, can you got your spirit quickened. There
   hangs the Savior! There was life in Him ten or twenty years ago, when
   you first looked. There is life in Him still!

   If your experience should seem to you to have been a delusion and your
   faith to have been presumption, Christ is a Savior still! He came into
   the world to save sinners--and if you are not a saint--you are a
   sinner! Go to Him as such. Let us, my Brethren, begin again! Let us go
   to the starting point. Let us lay again the fundamentals. Let us sing--

   "Just as I am, without one plea, But that Your blood was shed for me,
   And that You bid me come to You, O Lamb of God, I come!"

   No matter how hard, how insensible, how dead we may have become--let us
   go again in all the rags and poverty and defilement of our natural
   condition and throw ourselves flat on our faces before His mighty
   Cross!

   "With all my sin and all my hardness of heart," let the Believer say,
   "I do believe that Jesus died for me." Let him clasp that Cross! Let
   him look into those listless eyes! Let him bathe in that fountain
   filled with blood--this will bring back to him his first love! This
   will restore the ancient holiness of his faith and the former
   tenderness of his soul! To you who think that you never were converted
   and probably never were--who have grown very hard and fear you never
   could by any possibility melt in repentance--I give this exhortation,
   and O, may the Holy Spirit enable you to obey it:

   Come to Jesus you vilest of men! Laboring ones, heavy laden ones, come
   to Jesus! Black, foul, filthy, hard-hearted ones, come to Jesus! He is
   able to save unto the uttermost them that come unto God by Him. We are
   not in Hell yet! The iron door has not grated on its hinges! The dread
   bolt has not yet slid into its socket! There is hope--for there is
   life. There is hope--for there is a promise! There is hope for there
   hangs the Savior--there is hope for me, for you, for both of us--if we
   go humbly to the Mercy Seat and take Christ to be our All in All! God
   help us to do it for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                          The Precious Blood Of Christ

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MARCH 26, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The precious blood of Christ." 1 Peter 1:19.

   IT is frequently my fear I should fall into the habit of preaching
   about the Gospel rather than directly preaching the Gospel. And then I
   labor to return to the first principle of our faith and often take a
   text upon which it would not be possible to say anything new, but which
   will compel me to recapitulate in your hearing those things which are
   vital, essential and fundamental to the life of our souls. With such a
   text as this before me, if I do not preach the Gospel I shall do
   violence both to the sacred Word and to my own conscience. Surely I may
   hope that while endeavoring to unfold my text and to proclaim the
   saving Word, the Holy Spirit will be present to take of the things of
   Christ and to show them unto us and make them saving to our souls.

   Blood has from the beginning been regarded by God as a most precious
   thing. He has hedged about this fountain of vitality with the most
   solemn sanctions. The Lord thus commanded Noah and his descendants,
   "Flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall you not
   eat." Man had every moving thing that lives given him for meat, but
   they were by no means to eat the blood with the flesh. Things strangled
   were to be considered unfit for food, since God would not have man
   became too familiar with blood by eating or drinking it in any shape or
   form. Even the blood of bulls and goats thus had a sacredness put upon
   it by God's decrees.

   As for the blood of man, you remember how God's threats ran, "And
   surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every
   beast will I require it and at the hand of man; at the hand of every
   man's brother will I require the life of man. Whoever sheds man's
   blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made He
   man." It is true that the first murderer had not his blood shed by man,
   but then the crime was new and the penalty had not then been settled
   and proclaimed. And therefore the case was clearly exceptional and one
   by itself. And, moreover, Cain's doom was probably far more terrible
   than if he had been slain upon the spot--he was permitted to fill up
   his measure of wickedness, to be a wanderer and a vagabond upon the
   face of the earth--and then to enter into the dreadful heritage of
   wrath, which his life of sin had doubtless greatly increased.

   Under the theocratic dispensation, in which God was the King and
   governed Israel, murder was always punished in the most exemplary
   manner and there was never any toleration or excuse for it. Eye for
   eye, tooth for tooth, life for life was the stern inexorable law. It is
   expressly written, "You shall take no satisfaction for the life of a
   murderer which is guilty of death: but he shall surely be put to
   death." Even in cases where life was taken in chance medley or
   misadventure, the matter was not overlooked. The slayer fled at once to
   a City of Refuge, where, after having his case properly tried, he was
   allowed to reside. But there was no safety for him elsewhere until the
   death of the high priest.

   The general law in all cases was, "So you shall not pollute the land
   wherein you are: for blood defiles the land: and the land cannot be
   cleansed of the blood that is shed there, but by the blood of him that
   shed it. Defile not, therefore, the land which you shall inhabit,
   wherein I dwell: for I, the Lord, dwell among the children of Israel."
   Strange is it that that very thing which defiles should turn out to be
   that which alone can cleanse! It is clear, then, that blood was ever
   precious in God's sight and He would have it so in ours.

   He first forbids the blood of beasts as food of man, then avenges the
   blood of man shed in anger. And, furthermore, takes care that even
   accidents shall not pour it out unheeded. Nor is this all. We hear
   within us the echo of that law. We feel that God has truly made blood a
   sacred thing. Though some can, through use and habit, read the story of
   war with patience, if not with pleasure--though the sound of the
   trumpet and the drum and the tramp of soldiery will stir our heart and
   make us, for the moment, sympathize with the martial spirit--yet, if we
   could see war as it really is, if we could only walk but halfway across
   a battlefield or see but one wounded man, a cold shiver would shoot
   through the very marrow of our bones and we should have experimental
   proof that blood is, indeed, a sacred thing.

   The other night, when I listened to one who professed to have come from
   battlefields of the American war, I felt a faintness and clammy sweat
   steal over me as he shocked and horrified us with the details of
   mutilated bodies and spoke of standing up to the tops of his boots in
   pools of human gore. The shudder which ran through us all was a sure
   confirmation of the sanctity with which God has forever guarded the
   symbol and nutriment of life. We cannot even contemplate the
   probability of the shedding of blood without fear and trembling.

   And comforts which entail high risks in their production or procuring
   will lose all sweetness to men of humane dispositions. Who does not
   sympathize with David in his action with regard to the water procured
   by his three mighties! The three heroes broke through the hosts of the
   Philistines to bring David water from the well of Bethlehem. But as
   soon as he received that water, though very thirsty and much longing
   for it, yet he felt he could not touch it because these men had run
   such dreadful risks in breaking thrice through the Philistine hosts to
   bring it to him! He, therefore, took the water and poured it out before
   the Lord, as if it was not meet that men should run risk of life for
   any but God who gave life!

   His words were very touching, "My God forbid it me, that I should do
   this thing! Shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their
   lives in jeopardy? For with the jeopardy or their lives they brought
   it." I wonder at the cruelty of the great crowds who delight to see men
   and women running such fearful risks of life in rope-dancing. How is it
   that they can feed their morbid curiosity on such dreadful food and
   greet the man who is foolish enough to run such hazards with
   acclamations because of his foolhardiness? How much more Christ-like
   the regret of David that he should have led any man to risk his life
   for his comfort! How much more laudable was his belief that nothing
   short of the highest benevolence to man, or the highest devotion to God
   can justify such jeopardy of life!

   Further permit me to observe that the seal of the sanctity of blood is
   usually set upon the conscience even of the most depraved of men--not
   merely upon gentle souls and sanctified spirits--but even upon the most
   hardened. You will notice that men, bad as they are, shrink from the
   disgrace of taking blood money. Even those high priests who could sit
   down and gloat their eyes with the sufferings of the Savior would not
   receive the price of blood into the treasury. And even Judas, that son
   of perdition, who could contemplate without horror the treachery by
   which he betrayed his Master--yet when he had the thirty pieces of
   silver in his palm, found the money too hot to hold! He threw it down
   in the temple, for he could not bear or abide the sight of "the price
   of blood." This is another proof that even when virtue has become
   extinct and vice reigns, yet God has put the broad arrow of His own
   Sovereignty so manifestly upon the very thought of blood that even
   these worst of spirits are compelled to shrink from tampering with it.

   Now, if in ordinary cases the shedding of life is thus precious, can
   you guess how fully God utters His heart's meaning when He says,
   "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints"? If the
   death of a rebel is precious, what must be the death of a child? If He
   will not contemplate the shedding of the blood of His own enemies and
   of them that curse Him without proclaiming vengeance, what do you think
   He feels concerning His own elect, of whom He says, "Precious shall
   their blood be in His sight"? Will He not avenge them, though He bears
   long with them?

   Shall the cup which the Harlot of Rome filled with the blood of the
   saints long remain unavenged? Shall not the martyrs from Piedmont and
   the Alps and from our Smithfield and from the hills of covenanting
   Scotland yet obtain from God the vengeance due for all that they
   suffered and all the blood which they poured forth in the defense of
   His cause? I have taken you up, you see, from the beast to man--from
   man to God's chosen men--the martyrs. I have another step to indicate
   to you--it is a far larger one--it is to the blood OF JESUS CHRIST.

   Here powers of speech would fail to convey to you an idea of the
   preciousness! Behold here, a Person innocent-- without taint within, or
   flaw without! A Person meritorious who magnified the Law and made it
   honorable--a Person who served both God and man even unto death. No,
   here you have a Divine Person--so Divine that in the Acts of the
   Apostles Paul calls His blood the "blood of God." Place innocence and
   merit and dignity and position and Godhead itself in the scale and then
   conceive what must be the inestimable value of the blood which Jesus
   Christ poured forth!

   Angels must have seen that matchless blood-shedding with wonder and
   amazement, and even God Himself saw what never before was seen in
   creation or in Providence--He saw Himself more gloriously displayed
   than the whole universe beside. Let us come nearer to the text and try
   to show forth the preciousness of the blood of Christ. We shall confine
   ourselves to an enumeration of some of the many properties possessed by
   this precious blood.

   I felt, as I was studying, that I should have so many divisions this
   morning that some of you would compare my sermon to the bones in
   Ezekiel's vision--they were very many and they were very dry--but I am
   in hopes that God's Holy Spirit may so descend upon the bones in my
   sermon--which would be but dry of themselves--that they being quickened
   and full of life you may admire the exceeding great army of God's
   thoughts of loving-kindness towards His people in the sacrifice of His
   own dear Son.

   The precious blood of Christ is useful to God's people in a thousand
   ways--we intend to speak of twelve of them. After all, the real
   preciousness of a thing in the time of pinch and trial must depend upon
   its usefulness. A bag of pearls would be to us, this morning, far more
   precious than a bag of bread. But you have all heard the story of the
   man in the desert who stumbled, when near to death, upon a bag. He
   opened it, hoping that it might be the wallet of some passerby, and he
   found in it nothing but pearls! If they had been crusts of bread, how
   much more precious would they have been! I say, in the hour of
   necessity and peril, the use of a thing really constitutes the
   preciousness of it. This may not be according to political economy, but
   it is according to common sense.

   1. The precious blood of Christ has a REDEEMING POWER. It redeems from
   the Law. We were all under the Law which says, "Do this and live." We
   were slaves to it--Christ has paid the ransom price and the Law is no
   longer our tyrant master. We are entirely free from it. The Law had a
   dreadful curse--it threatened that whoever should violate one of its
   precepts should die--"Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law,
   being made a curse for us."

   By the fear of this curse the Law inflicted a continual dread on those
   who were under it. They knew they had disobeyed it and they were all
   their lifetime subject to bondage, fearful lest death and destruction
   should come upon them at any moment. But we are not under the Law, but
   under Grace, and consequently, "We have not received the spirit of
   bondage again to fear, but we have received the spirit of adoption
   whereby we cry, 'Abba, Father.' " We are not afraid of the Law now--its
   worst thunders cannot affect us for they are not hurled at us!

   Its most tremendous lightning cannot touch us for we are sheltered
   beneath the Cross of Christ, where the thunder loses its terror and the
   lightning its fury. We read the Law of God with pleasure now! We look
   upon it as in the ark covered with the Mercy Seat and not thundering in
   tempests from Sinai's fiery brow. Happy is that man who knows his full
   redemption from the Law, its curse, its penalty, its present dread!

   My Brethren, the life of a Jew, happy as it was compared with that of a
   heathen, was perfect drudgery compared to yours and mine! He was hedged
   in with a thousand commands and prohibitions. His forms and ceremonies
   were abundant and their details minutely arranged. He was always in
   danger of making himself unclean. If he sat upon a bed or upon a stool
   he might be defiled. If he drank out of an earthen pitcher, or even
   touched the wall of a house--a leprous man might have put his hand
   there before him and he would thus become defiled. A thousand sins of
   ignorance were like so many hidden pits in his way. He must be
   perpetually in fear lest he should be cut off from the people of God.

   When he had done his best any one day, he knew he had not finished--no
   Jew could ever talk of a finished work. The bullock was offered, but he
   must bring another. The lamb was offered this morning, but another must
   be offered this evening, another tomorrow and another the next day. The
   Passover is celebrated with holy rites--it must be kept in the same
   manner next year. The high priest has gone within the veil once, but be
   must go there again. The thing is never finished--it is always
   beginning. He never comes any nearer to the end. "The Law could not
   make the comer thereunto perfect."

   But see our position--we are redeemed from this! Our Law is fulfilled,
   for Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness! Our Passover is
   slain, for Jesus died! Our righteousness is finished, for we are
   complete in Him! Our victim is slain, our Priest has gone within the
   veil, the blood is sprinkled! We are clean and clean beyond any fear of
   defilement, "For He has perfected forever those that were set apart."
   Value this precious blood, my Beloved, because thus it has redeemed you
   from the thralldom and bondage which the Law imposed upon its votaries.

   2. The value of the blood lies much in its ATONING EFFICACY. We are
   told in Leviticus, that, "it is the blood which makes an atonement for
   the soul." God never forgave sin apart from blood under the Law. This
   stood as a constant text--"Without shedding of blood there is no
   remission." Meal and honey, sweet spices and incense would not avail
   without shedding of blood. There was no remission promised to future
   diligence or deep repentance--without shedding of blood pardon never
   came. The blood, and the blood alone, put away sin and permitted a man
   to come to God's courts to worship--because it made him one with God.

   The blood is the great at-one-ment. There is no hope of pardon for the
   sin of any man except through its punishment being fully endured. God
   must punish sin. It is not an arbitrary arrangement that sin shall be
   punished, but it is a part of the very constitution of moral government
   that sin must be punished. Never did God swerve from that and never
   will He. "He will by no means clear the guilty."

   Christ, therefore, came and was punished in the place of all His
   people. Ten thousands times ten thousands are the souls for whom Jesus
   shed His blood. He, for the sins of all the elect, has made a complete
   Atonement. For every man born of Adam who has believed or shall believe
   on Him, or who is taken to Glory before being capable of believing,
   Christ has made a complete Atonement. And there is none other plan by
   which sinners can be made at one with God, except by Jesus' precious
   blood.

   I may make sacrifices. I may mortify my body. I may be baptized. I may
   receive sacraments. I may pray until my knees grow hard with kneeling.
   I may read devout words until I know them by heart. I may celebrate
   masses. I may worship in one language or in fifty languages--but I can
   never be at one with God except by blood--and that blood, "the precious
   blood of Christ."

   My dear Friends, many of you have felt the power of Christ's redeeming
   blood! You are not under the Law now, but under Grace--you have also
   felt the power of the atoning blood--you know that you are reconciled
   unto God by the death of His Son. You feel that He is no angry God to
   you, that He loves you with a love unchangeable. But this is not the
   case with you all. O that it were! I do pray that you may know, this
   very day, the atoning power of the blood of Jesus! Creature, would you
   not be at one with your Creator? Puny man, would you not have Almighty
   God to be your Friend? You can not be at one with God except through
   the at-one-ment. God has set forth Christ to be a Propitiation for our
   sins. Oh, take the Propitiation through faith in His blood and be at
   one with God!

   3. Thirdly, the precious blood of Jesus Christ has A CLEANSING POWER.
   John tells us in his first Epistle, first chapter, seventh verse, "The
   blood of Jesus Christ His Son, cleanses us from all sin." Sin has a
   directly defiling effect upon the sinner, from which comes the need of
   cleansing. Suppose that God, the Holy One, were perfectly willing to be
   at one with an unholy sinner which is supposing a case that cannot be.
   Yet even should the pure eyes of the Most High wink at sin, still, as
   long as we are unclean we never could feel in our own hearts anything
   like joy and rest and peace.

   Sin is a plague to the man who has it, as well as a hateful thing to
   the God who abhors it. I must be made clean. I must have my iniquities
   washed away or I never can be happy. The first mercy that is sung of in
   the one hundred and third Psalm is, "Who forgives all your iniquities."
   Now we know it is by the precious blood that sin is cleansed. Murder,
   adultery, theft--whatever the sin may be--there is power in the veins
   of Christ to take it away at once and forever! No matter how many, nor
   how deeply-seated our offenses may be, the blood cries, "Though your
   sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they are
   red like crimson, they shall be as wool."

   It is the song of Heaven--"We have washed our robes and made them white
   in the blood of the Lamb." This is the experience of earth, for none
   was ever cleansed except in this fountain opened for the house of David
   for sin and for un-cleanness. You have heard this so often that perhaps
   if an angel told it to you, you would not take much interest in it--
   unless you have known experimentally the horror of uncleanness and the
   blessedness of being made clean. Beloved, it is a thought which ought
   to make our hearts leap within us, that through Jesus' blood there is
   not a spot left upon any Believer, not a wrinkle nor any such thing--

   "Though in myself defiled I am,
   And black as Kedar's tent, appear,
   Yet when I put Your garment on,
   Fair as the courts of Solomon."

   You have no spiritual beauty, Beloved, apart from Christ. But, having
   Christ, He Himself says, "You are all fair, My Love, there is no spot
   in you." Oh, precious blood which makes the blackamoor white as snow
   and takes out the leopard's spots! Oh, precious blood removing the
   Hell-stains of abundant iniquity and permitting me to stand accepted in
   the Beloved, notwithstanding all the many ways in which I have rebelled
   against my God!

   4. A fourth property of the blood of Christ is ITS PRESERVING POWER.
   You will rightly comprehend this when you remember that dreadful night
   of Egypt, when the destroying angel was abroad to slay God's enemies. A
   bitter cry went up from house to house as the first-born of all
   Egypt--from Pharaoh on the throne to the first-born of the woman behind
   the mill and the slave in the dungeon--all fell dead in a moment! The
   angel sped with noiseless wings through every street of Egypt's many
   cities.

   But there were some houses which he could not enter--he sheathed his
   sword and breathed no malediction there. What was it which preserved
   the houses? The inhabitants were not better than others. Their
   habitations were not more elegantly built--there was nothing except the
   bloodstain on the lintel and on the two side posts--and it is written,
   "When I see the blood I will pass over you." There was nothing whatever
   which gained the Passover for Israel but the sprinkling of blood!

   The father of the house had taken a lamb and killed it--had caught the
   blood in a basin. And while the lamb was roasted that it might be eaten
   by every inhabitant of the house, he took a bunch of hyssop, stirred
   the basin of blood and went outside with his children and began to
   strike the posts and to strike the door. And as soon as this was done
   they were all safe, all safe--no angel could touch them--the fiends of
   Hell themselves could not venture there.

   Beloved, see, we are preserved in Christ Jesus! Did not God see the
   blood before you and I saw it and was not that the reason why He spared
   our forfeited lives when, like barren fig trees, we brought forth no
   fruit for Him? When we saw the blood, let us remember it was not our
   seeing it which really saved us--one sight of it gave us peace, but it
   was God's seeing it that saved us. "When I see the blood I will pass
   over you."

   And today, if my eye of faith is dim and I see the precious blood so as
   to rejoice that I am washed but I can scarcely see it, yet God can see
   the blood and as long as the undimmed eyes of Jehovah look upon the
   atoning Sacrifice of the Lord Jesus, He cannot smite one soul that is
   covered with its scarlet mantle. Oh, how precious is this blood-red
   shield! My Soul, cower yourself down under it when the darts of Hell
   are flying! This is the chariot, the covering of purple--let the storm
   come and the deluge rise, let even the fiery hail descend beneath that
   crimson pavilion--my soul must rest secure, for what can touch me when
   I am covered with His precious blood?

   The preserving power of that blood should make us feel how precious it
   is. Beloved, let me beg you to try and realize these points. You know I
   told you before I cannot say anything new upon the subject, neither can
   I embody these old thoughts in new words. I should only spoil them and
   be making a fool of myself by trying to make a display of myself and my
   own powers, instead of the precious blood. Let me ask you to get here,
   right under the shelter of the Cross. Sit down, now, beneath the shadow
   of the Cross and feel, "I am safe, I am safe, O you devils of Hell, or
   you angels of God--I could challenge you all and say, 'Who shall
   separate me from the love of God in Christ Jesus, or who shall lay
   anything to my charge, seeing that Christ has died for me?' "

   When Heaven is on a blaze. When earth begins to shake. When the
   mountains rock. When God divides the righteous from the wicked, happy
   will they be who can find a shelter beneath the blood! But where will
   you be who have never trusted in its cleansing power? You will call to
   the rocks to hide you and to the mountains to cover you, but all in
   vain. God help you now, or even the blood will not help you then!

   5. Fifthly, the blood of Christ is precious because of its PLEADING
   PREVALENCE. Paul says in the twelfth chapter of his Epistle to the
   Hebrews, at the twenty-fourth verse, "It speaks better things than that
   of Abel." Abel's blood pleaded and prevailed. Its cry was, "Vengeance!"
   and Cain was punished. Jesus' blood pleads and prevails. Its cry is
   "Father, forgive them!" and sinners are forgiven through it.

   When I cannot pray as I would, how sweet to remember that the blood
   prays! There is no voice in my tongue, but there is always a voice in
   the blood. If I cannot, when I bow before my God, get farther than to
   say, "God be merciful to me, a sinner," yet my Advocate before the
   Throne is not dumb because I am and His plea has not lost its power
   because my faith in it may happen to be diminished. The blood is always
   alike prevalent with God. The wounds of Jesus are so many mouths to
   plead with God for sinners--what if I say they are so many chains with
   which love is lead captive and sovereign mercy bound to bless every
   favored child?

   What if I say that the wounds of Jesus have become doors of Divine
   Grace through which Divine love comes forth to the vilest of the vile
   and doors through which our wants go up to God and plead with Him that
   He would be pleased to supply them? Next time you cannot pray. Next
   time you are crying and striving and groaning up in that upper room,
   praise the value of the precious blood which makes intercession before
   the eternal Throne of God!

   6. Sixthly, the blood is precious where perhaps we little expect it to
   operate. It is precious, because of its MELTING INFLUENCE on the human
   heart. "They shall look upon Me whom they have pierced and they shall
   mourn for Him, as one that mourns for his only son and shall be in
   bitterness for Him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born."

   There is a great complaint among sinners, when they are a little
   awakened, that they feel their hearts so hard. The blood is a mighty
   melter. Alchemists of old sought after a universal solvent--the blood
   of Jesus is that. There is no nature so stubborn that a sight of the
   love of God in Christ Jesus cannot melt it, if Grace shall open the
   blind eye to see Christ. The stone in the human heart shall melt away
   when it is plunged into a bath of Divine blood. Cannot you say, dear
   Friends, that Toplady was right in his hymn--

   "Law and terrors do but harden
   All the while they work alone.
   But a sense of blood-bought pardon,
   Soon dissolves a heart of stone"?"

   Sinner, if God shall lead you to believe this morning in Christ to save
   you--if, then, you will trust your soul in His hands to have it
   saved--that hard heart of yours will melt at once! You would think
   differently of sin, my Friends, if you knew that Christ smarted for it.
   Oh, if you knew that out of those dear listless eyes there looked the
   loving heart of Jesus upon you, I know you would say, "I hate the sin
   that made Him mourn and fastened Him to the accursed tree." I do not
   think that preaching the Law generally softens men's hearts.

   Hitting men with a hard hammer may often drive the particles of a hard
   heart more closely together and make the iron yet more hard. But oh, to
   preach Christ's love--His great love with which He loved us even when
   we were dead in sins and to tell to sinners that there is life in a
   look at the Crucified One--surely this will prove that Christ was
   exalted on high to give repentance and remission of sins! Come for
   repentance, if you cannot come repenting! Come for a broken heart, if
   you cannot come with a broken heart! Come to be melted, if you are not
   melted. Come to be wounded, if you are not wounded.

   7. But then comes in a seventh property of the precious blood. The same
   blood that melts has A GRACIOUS POWER TO PACIFY. John Bunyan speaks of
   the Law as coming to sweep a chamber like a maid with a broom. And when
   she began to sweep there was a great dust which almost choked people
   and got into their eyes. But then came the Gospel with its drops of
   water and laid the dust and then the broom might be used far better.

   Now it sometimes happens that the Law of God makes such a dust in the
   sinner's soul that nothing but the precious blood of Jesus Christ can
   make that dust lie still. The sinner is so disquieted that nothing can
   ever give him any relief except to know that Jesus died for him. When I
   felt the burden of my sin, I do confess all the preaching I ever heard
   never gave me one single atom of comfort. I was told to do this and to
   do that and when I had done it all, I had not advanced one inch
   farther.

   I thought I must feel something, or pray a certain quantity. And when I
   had done that, the burden was quite as heavy. But the moment I saw that
   there was nothing whatever for me to do, that Jesus did it long, long
   ago--that all my sins were put on His back and that He suffered all I
   ought to have suffered--why then my heart had peace with God. Real
   peace by believing peace through the precious blood!

   Two soldiers were on duty in the citadel of Gibraltar. One of them had
   obtained peace through the precious blood of Christ, the other was in
   very great distress of mind. It happened to be their turn to stand
   sentinel, both of them, the same night. And there are many long
   passages in the rock, which passages are adapted to convey sounds a
   very great distance. The soldier in distress of mind was ready to beat
   his breast for grief--he felt he had rebelled against God and could not
   find how he could be reconciled--when suddenly there came through the
   air what seemed to him to be a mysterious voice from Heaven saying
   these words, "The precious blood of Christ."

   In a moment he saw it all--it was that which reconciled us to God--and
   he rejoiced with joy unspeakable and full of glory! Now did those words
   come directly from God? No. They did as far as the effect was
   concerned--they did come from the Holy Spirit. Who was it that had
   spoken those words? Curiously enough, the other sentinel at the far end
   of the passage was standing still and meditating when an officer came
   by and it was his duty, of course, to give the word for the night and
   with soldier-like promptness he did give it--but not accurately, for
   instead of giving the proper word, he was so taken up by his
   meditations that he said to the officer, "The precious blood of
   Christ."

   He corrected himself in a moment. But he had said it and it had passed
   along the passage and reached the ear for which God meant it--and the
   man found peace and spent his life in the fear of God, being in after
   years the means of completing one of our excellent translations of the
   Word of God into the Hindu language. Who can tell, dear Friends, how
   much peace you may give by only telling the story of our Savior! If I
   only had about a dozen words to speak and knew I must die, I would say,
   "This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
   Jesus came into the world to save sinners." The doctrine of
   Substitution is the pith and marrow of the Gospel, and if you can hold
   that forth, you will prove the value of the precious blood by its
   peace-giving power.

   8. We can only spare a minute now upon ITS SANCTIFYING INFLUENCE. The
   Apostle tells us in the ninth chapter and the fourteenth verse that
   Christ sanctified the people by His own blood. Certain it is that the
   same blood which justifies by taking away sin does, in its
   after-action, act upon the new nature and lead it onward to subdue sin
   and to follow out the commands of God. There is no motive for holiness
   so great as that which streams from the veins of Jesus. If you want to
   know why you should be obedient to God's will, my Brethren, go and look
   upon Him who sweat, as it were, great drops of blood and the love of
   Christ will constrain you, because you will thus judge, "That if one
   died for all, then were all dead: and that He died for all that we
   which live might not henceforth live unto ourselves, but unto Him that
   died for us and rose again."

   9. In the ninth place, another blessed property of the blood of Jesus
   is ITS POWER TO GIVE ENTRANCE. We are told that the high priest never
   went within the veil without blood. And surely we can never get into
   God's heart, nor into the secret of the Lord which is with them that
   fear Him, nor into any familiar communion with our great Father and
   Friend, except by the sprinkling of the precious blood of Jesus.

   "We have access with boldness into this grace wherein we stand," but we
   never dare go a step towards God except as we are sprinkled with this
   precious blood. I am persuaded some of us do not come near to God
   because we forget the blood. If you try to have fellowship with God in
   your graces, your experiences, your believing--you will fail. But if
   you try to come near to God as you stand in Christ Jesus--you will have
   courage to come. And on the other hand, God will run to meet you when
   He sees you in the face of His Anointed. Oh, for power to get near to
   God! But there is no getting near to God except as we got near to the
   Cross. Praise the blood, then, for its power of giving you nearness to
   God.

   10. Tenthly--a hint only. The blood is very precious, in the tenth
   place, for ITS CONFIRMING POWER. No covenant, we are told, was ever
   valid unless victims were slain and blood sprinkled. And it is the
   blood of Jesus which has ratified the New Covenant and made its
   promises sure to all the seed. Therefore it is called "the blood of the
   Everlasting Covenant." The Apostle changes the figure and he says that
   a testament is not of force except the testator is dead. The blood is a
   proof that the Testator died and now the Law holds good to every
   inheritor because Jesus Christ has signed it with His own gore.

   Beloved, let us rejoice that the promises are yes, and amen, for no
   other reason than this--because Christ Jesus died and rose again. Had
   there been no bowing of the head upon the tree, no slumbering in the
   sepulcher, no rising from the tomb, then the promises had been
   uncertain, fickle things--not "immutable things wherein it is
   impossible for God to lie"--and consequently they could never have
   afforded strong consolation to those who have fled for refuge to Christ
   Jesus. See, then, the confirming nature of the blood of Jesus and count
   it very precious.

   11. I am almost done. But there remains another. It is the eleventh
   one, and that is THE INVIGORATING POWER of the precious blood. If you
   want to know that, you must see it set forth as we often do when we
   cover the table with the white cloth and put the bread and wine on it.
   What do we mean by this ordinance? We mean by it that Christ suffered
   for us and that we, being already washed in His precious blood and so
   made clean, do come to the table to drink wine as an emblem of the way
   in which we live and feed upon His body and upon His blood.

   He tells us, "Except a man shall eat My flesh and drink My blood, there
   is no life in him." We do therefore, after a spiritual sort, drink His
   blood and He says, "My blood is drink, indeed." Superior drink!
   Transcendent drink! Strengthening drink--such drink as angels never
   taste though they drink before the eternal Throne. Oh Beloved, whenever
   your spirit faints, this wine shall comfort you! When your griefs are
   many, drink and forget your misery and remember your sufferings no
   more!

   When you are very weak and faint, take not a little of this for your
   soul's sake, but drink a full draught of the wine on the lees, well
   refined, which was set abroad by the soldier's spike and flowed from
   Christ's own heart! "Drink to the full. Yes, drink abundantly O
   Beloved," says Christ to the spouse. And do not linger when He invites.
   You see the blood has power without to cleanse and then it has power
   within to strengthen. O precious Blood, how many are Your uses! May I
   prove them all!

   12. Lastly and twelfth--twelve is the number of perfection. We have
   brought out a perfect number of its uses--the blood has AN OVERCOMING
   POWER. It is written in the Revelation, "They overcame through the
   blood of the Lamb." How could they do otherwise? He that fights with
   the precious blood of Jesus fights with a weapon that will cut through
   soul and spirit, joints and marrow--a weapon that makes Hell tremble
   and makes Heaven subservient and earth obedient to the will of the men
   who can wield it!

   The blood of Jesus! Sin dies at its presence, death ceases to be
   death--Hell itself would be dried up if that blood could operate there.
   The blood of Jesus! Heaven's gates are opened! Bars of iron are pushed
   back. The blood of Jesus! My doubts and fears flee, my troubles and
   disasters disappear! The blood of Jesus! Shall I not go on conquering
   and to conquer so long as I can plead that? In Heaven this shall be the
   choice jewel which shall glitter upon the head of Jesus--that He gives
   to His people "Victory, victory, through the blood of the Lamb."

   And now, is this blood to be had? Can it be got at? Yes, it is FREE, as
   well as full of virtue--free to every soul that believes. Whoever cares
   to come and trust in Jesus shall find the virtue of this blood in his
   case this very morning. Away from your own works! Turn those eyes of
   yours to the full Atonement made, to the utmost ransom paid! And if God
   enables you, poor Soul, this morning to say, "I take that precious
   blood to be my only hope," you are saved and you may sing with the rest
   of us--

   "Now, freed from sin, I walk at large;
   The Savior's blood's my full discharge.
   At His dear feet my soul I'll lay,
   A sinner saved and homage pay."

   God grant it may be so, for His name's sake. Amen.

                   Traveling Expenses On The Two Great Roads

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 2, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE
   METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "So he paid the fare." Jonah 1:3.

   AS a general rule, wherever we go, whatever we do, we must "pay the
   fare." Expenditure is connected with every act, work and operation. The
   sun does not constantly flood this world and all its sister spheres
   with light and heat without some kind of consumption within itself. Nor
   does the earth yield her fruits of harvest except at the cost of the
   matter of which it is composed. By the force of wind and frost, the
   very "Mountain falling comes to nothing and the rock is removed out of
   his place" (Job 14:18). The rivers do not reach the sea without wearing
   away their banks and cutting channels in the earth through which their
   floods may flow. The raindrops, the generous gifts of Heaven, have
   first been loaned from the treasury of the great deep. The air itself
   is constantly in process of consumption, and were it not that a fresh
   supply is daily being produced, even the atmosphere would become
   exhausted.

   All the processes of Nature involve a constant expenditure of power.
   Ponderous as is the engine of creation and little as it shows the
   fretting power of age, it is certain that in the whole of its
   machinery, from its most stupendous wheel down to its smallest valve,
   it is daily and necessarily experiencing an appointed amount of wear
   and tear. It is assuredly so with regard to the lesser world of man.
   The body cannot move a limb or contract a muscle without expense. The
   lifting of my hand, the pointing of my finger, the motion of my tongue,
   the stirring of my brain in thought all cost something and make a
   draught upon the inner store of strength--you cannot so much as gaze
   upon the world around you without some wear and tear of that marvelous
   optical instrument by which outward sights are brought to the inward
   mind.

   Friction operates on flesh and bone and sinew and a higher friction
   acts on mind and intellect and passion, for even these grow weak with
   strain and age--"the fare"--Nature sternly demands before she will
   loose her cable or spread her sail to the breeze. He quarrels with
   God's laws who expects something for nothing and hopes to be served
   without offering a just remuneration and to find friends without
   showing himself friendly. We must pay our fare, for the universe
   requires it--we will pay it cheerfully--for we are honest men.

   This general rule of expenditure holds good when we enter the world of
   morals and commune with spiritual things. Man plucked the forbidden
   fruit and dearly was that apple paid for in the fall of all our race.
   The Lord redeemed us in His boundless love, but not without a
   price--the free mercy of God cannot work its way among men except
   Heaven's best treasure is spent to purchase men from bondage. Expense
   occurs everywhere in our salvation--"The price of pardon was the
   Savior's blood." "To buy our souls it cost His own."--

   "There's never a gift His hand bestows, But cost His heart a groan."

   Nor is it so in the kingdom of Heaven only, for even if a man would
   pursue a foolhardy voyage across the sea of rebellion in the ship of
   sin to the horrible land of perdition, he must "pay the fare." Sinners,
   for that which is not bread, must spend their money and for that which
   profits not, must pay their labor. He who would be saved must take care
   to sit down and count the cost, lest, after having begun to build, he
   should not be able to finish it. But let him not think that he is alone
   in his expending, for the transgressor's bill of costs is no light one!
   War of any sort is costly, but ungodly men will find that a war with
   Heaven is the dearest of all. God's House, like the palace of Solomon,
   needs a large income to sustain its daily feasting--but it is not like
   the house of evil which makes a beggar of every man that comes within
   its doors.

   I. I shall, this morning, commence my discourse by endeavoring to
   direct your attention to THE COST OF TRAVELLING ON THE BROAD ROAD TO
   HELL. Phocian paid for the poison which killed him--and the sinner pays
   dearly for the sin which proves his ruin. The worldling often taunts
   the Christian because he expends his money on his religion. The
   Christian may well reply to the sinner, "I wish that your taunts were
   more true, for I fear that I do not spend one-tenth as much in the
   service of God as you do in the service of your vices." Very few except
   the most generous of Christians could venture to say that they spend as
   much upon their God as profligates squander upon their lusts.

   1. Let us begin to add up the bill! We are met at once with a heavy
   item. The man who makes the world his idol and forgets God, has at
   once, at the start of his voyage, to pay down and place in a sinking
   fund all hope of God's favor and all expectation of the blessings which
   it brings. He cannot run contrary to God's will and command and then
   expect that God will be his Friend and prosper his designs! If I set
   myself up in rebellion against Heaven's great King, I cannot suppose
   that He will make it His constant care to promote my interests, nor
   dare I dream that He will aid and abet me in my designs of evil.

   "With the obstinate You will show Yourself obstinate" (Psa. 18:26), is
   the revelation of Scripture. "If you walk contrary to Me, I will walk
   contrary to you," is the voice of the God of Sinai. The man throws down
   the glove of battle against the Lord and his Creator will let him know
   that it is, "Woe unto him that strives with his Maker." Long-suffering
   is Jehovah and He does not smite the rebel with speedy ruin, but still
   it is written, "God is angry with the wicked every day: if he turns not
   He will whet His sword, He has bent His bow and made it ready." The
   good man sees a gracious Providence smiling at his side--he knows that,
   " all things work together for good to them that love God."

   And although the wheels of Providence are too high for him to
   understand their revolutions, yet he knows that they are full of eyes,
   marking the wisdom and care of his Father in Heaven. He sings with
   rapture--

   "Your ways, O Lord, with wise design, Are framed upon Your Throne
   above. And every dark and bending line Meets in the center of Your
   love." The Almighty God is the Believer's refuge and beneath His wings
   he finds perpetual shelter. Not so the sinner. In the court of
   Providence he is an outlaw and can claim no right of protection. How
   shall Providence care for him who cares not for God? He is under its
   ban and he shall, before long, learn that, "They that plow iniquity and
   sow wickedness, reap the same. By the blast of God they perish and by
   the breath of His nostrils are they consumed."

   The ungodly cannot claim the privilege which Eliphaz ascribes to the
   righteous--"He shall deliver you in six troubles: yes, in seven there
   shall no evil touch you. At destruction and famine you shall laugh:
   neither shall you be afraid of the beasts of the earth. For you shall
   be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field
   shall be at peace with you." On the contrary, Providence may justly
   remind him of his sins and say, "Call now, if there is any that will
   answer you. And to which of the saints will you turn?"

   Our gracious God has given no charge to His angels to keep the sinner
   in all his ways. Those ministering spirits have no commission to bear
   him up lest he dash his foot against a stone. Rather, the forces of
   Nature are restrained by almighty mercy, or else the very stars in
   their courses and the waters in the rivers would fight against the
   wicked, as they did against Sisera in days of yore.

   The Christian has the Presence of God also to rejoice in. Mungo Park,
   when lost in the wilderness, observed a tiny piece of moss, and marking
   how beautifully it was fashioned, he recollected, "God is here! My
   Father is here!" So does the Christian. He is never out of his Father's
   House and consequently he is forevermore at home. The lines of Thompson
   are ours, not as poetry merely, but as matter of fact--

   " Should Fate command me to the farthest verge Of the green earth, to
   distant barbarous climes, Rivers unknown to song, where first the sun
   Gilds Indian mountains, or his setting beam Flames on the Atlantic
   isles; 'tis naught to me Since God is ever present, ever felt, In the
   void waste as in the city full And where He vital breathes, there must
   be joy. When even at last the solemn hour shall come, And wing my
   mystic flight to future worlds, I cheerfully wil obey. There with new
   powers

   Will rising wonders sing. Icannotgo

   Where UNIVERSAL LOVE not smiles around, Sustaining all yon orbs and all
   their sons, From seeming evil still educing good. And better there
   again and better still, In infinite progression."

   It is not so with the sinner? The presence of God is to him dreadful.
   If there were some valley of confusion where God's power is not known,
   its congenial desolation would become the sinner's Heaven--the place
   where God's Presence shall gleam upon him with irresistible force will
   be his Hell. Moreover, the sinner gives up every promise of God in
   choosing the road to perdition. There is not a word in this Book of
   Divine Love which can breathe comfort into the sinner's ear while he
   chooses his own ways. It is a book of threats and of curses to the
   impenitent. It woos as a mother would call her wandering child--it has
   a gentle voice forever broken, and contrite spirit--but it thunders
   like Sinai's own self against every hardened sinner who will not turn
   from his wicked way.

   O Unbeliever, you have renounced, by the very fact of your remaining
   without God and without Christ, all possession in the rich promises of
   God! You have sunk the immense capital upon the interest of which the
   Christian lives in time and in the enjoyment of which he hopes to be
   blest throughout eternity. You who know how to add, mark this one item
   of expenditure to begin with, and guess how heavy is the fare of sin!

   2. In the next place, they who follow the course of sin make a great
   expenditure of their time. However, that I dare say they do not think
   much of, for time to them is a mere drug of no clear value. Many of the
   ungodly seek after pastimes, kill-times and all sorts of inventions by
   which they may get rid of time, which to us appear sadly too little for
   our daily work. The precious privilege of existence is to them a
   nuisance. The pictured gallery of life is to them a prison or corridor
   through which they would hasten as speedily as may be, forgetting its
   end and where it leads.

   Ah, Brothers and Sisters, if they were wise they would comprehend that
   time is the stuff which life is made of and that this life is the only
   season in which we can be made qualified for the enjoyments of
   eternity. If men understood it, they would sooner cast pearls to swine
   than give their days to sin and their nights to rioting. If time is the
   chrysalis of eternity, who but a fool would treat it with contempt?

   He is the worst of prodigals who wastes that most precious of all
   treasures, his time! But what hours does fashion demand? What days will
   the debauched and the profligate give to their sensual indulgence? But
   what am I saying? It is needless to single out the more bold of
   transgressors--the rule is universal--the sinner's life is all waste,
   for it is uncon-secrated by faith, unblest by God and is therefore all
   lavished for nothing on shadows and dreams.

   3. It must not be forgotten that some ungodly men expend a deal of
   labor to gratify their evil desires. The way to Hell may be downhill,
   but it is not all smooth. There are Hills Difficulty even for the
   ungodly. "The way of transgressors is hard." Therefore the Savior says,
   "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden," for sinners
   labor and their sins prove to be a heavy burden. The same Hebrew word
   and the same Greek word, stands both for "laboring," and for "sin," for
   sinning is often hard.

   As the Prophet says, "The people labor in the very fire and weary
   themselves for vanity." Though men call sin pleasure, who does not know
   that it often jades and wearies the man worse than the hardest toil!
   How the proud man toils for honor! How the miser pinches himself for
   gold! How the thief exhausts his ingenuity to get at another man's
   wealth! How hard is the harlot's drudgery! How heavy is the yoke of
   Satan!

   4. Sinners, again, are frequently put by their sins to a great expense
   of their actual substance. Their money finds feather's for its wings in
   the gratification of their desires. Who can be a drunkard without
   coming to poverty or lessening his estate? Who fills the cup to the
   brim without before long clothing himself with rags and bringing his
   household to poverty? The prodigal wasted his substance in riotous
   living--who can do otherwise if he entertains a host of greedy sins?
   God only knows how much of the poverty of this land is due to nothing
   else but drunkenness.

   No doubt there always will be some poverty which may claim our charity,
   for the poor shall never cease out of the land. But still, it is to be
   feared that three-fourths of all the poverty of this great city is to
   be traced more or less directly to the gin palace and the beer shops.
   Drunkenness is a "reedy sin and like the horseleech it cries, 'Give,
   give.' " England, with all its liberality, does not give anything like
   so much to the cause of missions, or for the maintenance of religion,
   as men spend in intoxication.

   Then look at other sins, how costly they are! Consider those amusements
   of the world which many defend as being no offense to public morals,
   but which the spiritual avoid as being unfit occupations for heirs of
   Heaven. Even these are far from being inexpensive. I noticed yesterday
   an advertisement in the newspaper for boxes at the opera, for a certain
   term, to be let for two hundred guineas! What would people think if a
   pew in any place of worship were only to be had on terms of so heavy a
   subscription? Why, that sum would pay the charges all the year round of
   full many a place of worship!

   And yet this amount represents probably but a portion of the expense
   involved in attendance at the theater. There are far greater drains
   upon the purse than those implied in missionary societies, ministers,
   chapels and Bible-women. Who has not heard how fast debauchery burns
   the candle at both ends? Is it not said of the prodigal, that he
   devoured his living with harlots? This sin has brought many a man of
   wealth and fortune down to shiver like a beggar on a dunghill! "Remove
   your way far from her and come not near the door of her house...lest
   strangers be filled with your wealth and your labors be in the house of
   a stranger." He who sins must pay the fare.

   5. Nor is this all. Those men who go far into sin and carry out the
   desires of their hearts soon find that there is an expense of health.
   How many a man has rottenness in his bones and disease in his heart's
   core brought on by gluttony, drunkenness and vice? Well may men pray
   that they may be delivered from the sins of their youth and their
   former transgressions, for they are in a sad plight who mourn at the
   last when their flesh and their body are consumed. It is not God who
   has thickly sown this world with disease and sorrow--man's iniquity has
   done it. Men cast darnel and cockle into the furrows of life and when
   they spring up, they complain of the appointments of God, whereas, they
   are the result of their own sins!

   And there is no injustice in the rule, that whatever a man sows, that
   shall he also reap. "Can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes
   not be burned? Can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned?"
   "His bones are full of the sins of his youth which shall lie down with
   him in the dust." The fare, the full fare of sin's voyage, must be
   paid.

   6. Another expense and that one which ought not to be forgotten, is the
   loss of peace of mind. A man cannot indulge in sin and yet go to his
   bed with a quiet conscience. At least, if he can do so, this
   callousness is of itself a still greater evil. For the most part, men
   start back at the ghosts of their own crimes. "Terrors make the wicked
   afraid on every side and drive them to their feet." Even the
   respectable sinner whose life is outwardly moral, but whose heart is
   far from God, cannot avoid some qualms and disturbance of mind.

   If I am not one with God, if I am not washed in Jesus' blood, if I am
   not sanctified by God's Holy Spirit, there is an aching void within me
   which the world can never fill. There is an inward monitor which tells
   me, "There is something that you need, a something that the world
   cannot give you which you cannot earn for yourself. How is it that you
   are living in the neglect of it?" "A dreadful sound is in his ears: in
   prosperity the Destroyer shall come upon him...He wanders abroad for
   bread, saying, Where is it? He knows that the day of darkness is ready
   at his hand."

   Until I was saved by Divine Grace, I can truly say I had no lasting
   peace. But now my peace is like a river. How a trumpet will often
   blanch the sinner's cheek! The cholera comes and how the man trembles
   because death is at work next door! How fearful he is when he stands at
   the grave's brink and looks down upon the coffin of some companion with
   whom he has spent many a boisterous hour! Ah, you cannot have peace!
   You cannot have peace till you have Christ! You cannot be truly happy
   till you have given your souls to Jesus!

   The apple may look fair, but it is rotten within. You may talk of joy,
   but you know it not if you know not Jesus. Surely to lose this
   priceless pearl is an item in the bill of no mean magnitude--

   Peace has sweets That Hybla never knew. It sleeps on down

   Culled gently from beneath the cherub's wing.

   Who would throw this away for vexing, mocking, deceiving, lying
   vanities?

   7. The worst expense, however, we have only hinted at. The man who goes
   to Hell must pay the fare in another way--he loses his soul. What that
   loss may be no mortal tongue can tell. If one could come again from the
   pit, as once the rich man proposed, perhaps he might tell us in
   dolorous tones what it is to be cast out from God into the place where
   there is not a drop of water to cool the fire-tormented tongue. But it
   is not for us even to conceive what the place of torment may be.

   It is enough to hear and profit by the question of the Savior--"What
   shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own
   soul?" What is Caesar the better for his dominions? What is Croesus the
   better for his wealth? What is the philosopher the better for his
   wisdom, now that he is cast away from the favor of God forever? In
   fact, the greater the wretched beings were on earth, the more terrible
   will their doom be in eternity, when, looking from their beds of flame,
   the lesser sinners shall cry, "Are you become like one of us? Is the
   lofty one brought low? Is the proud one humbled? Is the boaster made to
   feel in the torment of this fire that he is no greater than the rest of
   us?"

   I say, the more honor and dignity and glory the man obtained on earth,
   the more terrible his shame and disgrace when, his soul being lost, he
   is cast into the pit forever! Let us, then, if we have been deluded by
   the pleasures of sin, or have been tempted in any way to forget God
   because we have thought that the way of the flesh was easy--let us
   think awhile that we shall have to pay the fare and that the fare is
   far too expensive to be paid by men of understanding. We dare not risk
   soul and body, life and death, Heaven and Hell, judgment and eternity
   merely for the sake of those paltry, passing, delusive joys which are
   all that the world can pretend to offer.

   II. Let us change our strain and say a little upon THE EXPENSE OF
   AVOIDING DUTY. Jonah's duty was to go to Nineveh and preach the
   Word--he preferred not to go--he therefore shirked the work, went down
   to Joppa and paid his fare to go to Tarshish. I hope we are not in the
   habit of doing the same, but yet there are occasions when even God's
   servants shrink from duty and seem willing to forget that where God
   calls they are bound to go.

   Possibly this remark may apply to some minister who may come under the
   Word. He is called to bear his protest against a certain sin and he
   thinks to himself, "If I so speak, some of those who hear me will never
   come again. I may lose rich subscribers. I will not say a word on that
   point." Or, he has it laid upon him to cry against the monstrous evils
   in the State Church--but he puts his finger to his lips and remains
   silent, inwardly calculating--"I had better hold my peace on that
   subject, for I may risk my popularity."

   Such a minister should reflect that it is a very expensive thing to try
   to fly to Tarshish when you ought to go to Nineveh, for a man cannot
   avoid duty without expense. I have known good people who will say, "I
   know so-and-so is what I ought to do, but still, you see, the path is
   very difficult and I do not feel called upon to make so great a
   sacrifice." Well, Friend, if you do not make the sacrifice when God
   demands it of you, He has other ways of taking away your treasured
   goods. In the long run you will find it far more expensive to shun the
   work and will of God than at once to give yourself to it. You will be a
   loser by your prudence! You shall find that the Scriptural rule holds
   good, "He that would lose his life shall save it, but he that would
   save his life shall lose it."

   If you are willing to be a loser for Christ you shall be a gainer! But
   if you insist upon being held harmless and try at all costs to make
   provision for the flesh, then you shall find that before long you will
   have to pay the fare to your own grievous hurt and injury. What did
   Jonah lose? Jonah had to pay as part of his fare the presence and
   comfortable enjoyment of God's love. He went down into the bottom of
   the vessel and hid himself from sight. I think I see him. That Jonah,
   who a few days after walked with all the boldness of a lion through the
   streets of Nineveh, crying, "Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be
   overthrown!" That Jonah who bearded Nineveh's haughty monarch and was
   not afraid to tell him that in forty days his city would be overthrown!

   That Jonah goes sneaking down among the goods at the bottom of the hold
   for fear anybody should see him and there hides his coward, craven
   head. Poor Jonah, you have lost the hallowed fellowship of your God!
   You have lost His Presence and consequently your courage has all oozed
   out of you! This is a dear price which you have paid for shunning
   Nineveh!

   When you and I serve our Lord Jesus as Believers should do, we can
   remember that our God is with us and though we have the whole world
   against us, if we have God with us what does it matter? But oh, the
   minute we start back and begin to seek our own inventions and appeal to
   our own wisdom, we are all at sea without a pilot and our great Helper
   withdraws from us. Then may we bitterly lament and groan out, "O my
   God, where have You gone? How could I have been so foolish as to shun
   Your service and in this way to lose all the brightness of Your face?
   This is a price too high! Let me return to my allegiance and to Your
   Presence."

   In the next place, Jonah lost all peace of mind. When he was in
   Nineveh, crying, "Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown," he
   was not afraid of the edge of the sword, nor of the tyrant's rage--he
   felt that he was doing God's work and he knew that when on God's
   errands he was perfectly safe. His heart beat gently, like that of a
   man in a happy, tranquil frame of mind wearing the herb called heart's
   ease in his bosom. But now, down there, in the hold of the vessel, his
   heart is palpitating--he does not know what may happen and until sleep
   happily comes in to ease the distress of his mind he is like a poor
   hunted staff, panting with alarm.

   These were two great things to lose--God's Presence and his own peace
   of mind--but these were not all his damage and injury! He was now
   brought into great peril--he must be thrown into the sea. In all
   likelihood he will meet with a watery grave. Had he gone to Nineveh
   that would not have occurred. He would have been under the care of
   God's special Providence there, but now the winds and waves threaten
   him. With what a splash he falls into the deep! As we see him engulfed
   let us, with holy caution, shun the dangerous way of disobedience.
   Other men may escape the chastisements of God in this world, but not
   the Lord's own children. "You only have I known of all the families of
   the earth, therefore I will punish you for your iniquities."

   Now, too, he is brought into great affliction of soul. He tells us that
   he, "cried by reason of affliction." He compares his state to the
   "belly of Hell." He was brought into such depths of distress, a miracle
   interposed to save his life--but not to cheer his spirit. Like the
   Savior, of whom he was a type, he was exceedingly sorrowful and very
   heavy, almost unto death.

   Sin soon destroys a Believer's comfort. It is the deadly upas tree from
   whose leaves distil deadly drops which destroy the life of joy and
   peace. Jonah, too, had lost everything upon which he might have drawn
   for comfort in any other case. He could not turn to the promise of God
   that He would keep him, for he was not in God's ways. He could not say,
   "Lord, I am Your servant," for then conscience would have said, "Yes,
   and a pretty servant, too!" He could not say, "Lord, I am on Your
   errand!" for conscience would have said, "No, you are on your own!" He
   could not say, "Lord, I meet with these difficulties in the discharge
   of my duty, therefore help me through them"--no, for there would have
   been a reply, "You are not here in the discharge of duty.

   "You flew in the teeth of the Most High. You sought to escape from a
   little difficulty--you tried to get away from the Presence of God
   altogether and you have prepared all this for yourself. If the draught
   is bitter, you mixed it. If the fruit is sharp, you planted the tree.
   If this harvest is terrible, you sowed the seed--you are reaping your
   own deeds--you are being filled with your own ways." Poor Jonah, poor
   Jonah, to be in such a state as this!

   Then here is another point--he had to go to Nineveh after all--and so
   will you. You may kick, but when God means you to do His work, you will
   be made to do it. The ox-goad has been thrust into you already because
   you hate the yoke. You do not like it and you kick against it and the
   only result is that it is driven further into you. Saul, Saul, it is
   hard for you to kick against the pricks, for with all your kicking and
   rebelling you will have to go where you were originally ordered to go.
   You might as well go at first--you will go with better Grace. You will
   go with your Master's comfortable Presence--and you will have to go one
   way or another.

   Many men have found this true. They have struggled against duty and
   perhaps year after year they have drawn back from it, finding miserable
   excuses for their consciences. But they never prospered in business,
   they could not get on in the world, they had trouble on trouble and at
   last it came to this--they had to go back to the very place where they
   were ten or twenty years ago. And there they discharged the duty which
   they had been so long seeking to avoid which had proved a burdensome
   stone to them until they were rid of it by yielding to its demands.

   Now, my dear Brothers, do not play the Jonah, for you will have to pay
   the fare of it. If you know your duty, do it. I may be speaking very
   pointedly to some of you. "I should have to sever the bonds of many a
   fond connection." Do it for Christ's sake. "I should have to leave the
   camp and go outside of it, take up a very heavy cross and bear Christ's
   reproach." You may as well do it now as by-and-by, for you will have to
   do it.

   "But," says one, "this business of mine--I have nothing left to live
   upon. I feel it is a bad business, but I do not like to give it up just
   yet." You will have to do so sooner or later. You may as well do it
   now, before, like Jonah, you have had to pay for your wit. Remember,
   "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and a good
   understanding have all they that keep His commandments." May God the
   Holy Spirit give you the wisdom which comes from above which will lead
   you to sit as a child at the feet of Jesus and learn His ways.

   "Be you not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding,
   whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near
   unto you." "But hearken diligently unto His commandments and then shall
   your peace be like a river and your righteousness like the waves of the
   sea."

   III. A few words upon another point--there is AN EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH
   GOING TO HEAVEN. It is estimated at a very high rate by some who say
   that the road is good enough, but the tolls are too high. Others
   pretend to believe that religion is only a scheme for putting money
   into ministers' pockets, whereas I can truly say for one, that what I
   receive for my ministry is not a tenth of what I could readily earn in
   an engagement infinitely less laborious and harassing than my present
   position. Although, let it be added, I would not leave my ministry for
   ten thousand worlds.

   Let us think over this matter of expense and begin with an old story.
   "An aged couple, in the vicinity of London, who, in the early part of
   life, were poor, but who, by the blessing of God upon their industry,
   enjoyed a comfortable independency in their old age, were called upon
   by a Christian minister who solicited their contributions to a charity.
   The old lady was disposed to make out some excuse and to answer in the
   negative, both for her husband and herself. And therefore replied,
   "Why, Sir, we have lost a great deal by religion since we began. My
   husband knows that very well." And being wishful to obtain her
   husband's consent to the assertion, she said, "Have we not, Thomas?"

   Thomas, after a long and solemn pause, replied, "Yes, Mary, we have
   lost a great deal by our religion! I have lost a great deal by my
   religion. Before I got religion, Mary, I had got a water pail in which
   I carried water and that you know I lost many years ago. And then I had
   an old slouched hat, a patched old coat and mended shoes and stockings.
   But I have lost them, also, long ago. And, Mary, you know that poor as
   I was, I had a habit of getting drunk and quarrelling with you. And
   that you know I have lost.

   "And then I had a burdened conscience and a wicked heart. And then I
   had ten thousand guilty feelings and fears. But all are lost,
   completely lost and, like a millstone, cast into the deepest sea. And,
   Mary, you have been a loser, too, though not so great a loser as
   myself. Before we got religion, Mary, you had a washing tray in which
   you washed for hire. And God Almighty blessed your industry--but since
   we got religion--you have lost your washing tray. And you had a gown
   and bonnet much the worse for wear, though they were all you had to
   wear. But you have lost them long ago.

   "And you had many an aching heart concerning me, at times. But those
   you happily have lost. And I could even wish that you had lost as much
   as I have lost and even more--for what we lose by our religion,
   Mary--will be our eternal gain." We need not add the preacher did not
   go away without substantial proof that Thomas deemed his losses for
   religion his most weighty obligations to the goodness of Almighty God
   as the richest gift of Divine Grace on earth and the most authentic
   pledge of Glory in the world to come!

   If some of us were to look back upon what religion has cost us we might
   cast up the amount with very much the same result. Where were you apt
   to spend your Sundays once, some of you? Where would some few of you
   have been on other occa-sions?--at the race course, at the
   theater--yes, and in the brothel. But now you are washed and cleansed
   and sanctified and rejoicing in Christ Jesus. This is what your
   religion has cost you--the giving up of nothing that made you truly
   happy--but only renouncing that which pretended to make you happy but
   which was ruining your soul forever!

   The first expense of religion is that it takes away from men spurious
   joys and gives them real ones. It takes away from them shadows and
   gives them substance. Then, again, the expense of your religion has
   been this--some of you have given a good deal of your time to the cause
   of Christ. Others of you have devoted a considerable portion of your
   money to it, but after all that you or any of us have ever given, I am
   sure we can say religion has cost us nothing which we did not give
   cheerfully-- and it has asked of us nothing which it was not our
   happiness to render! We have felt a greater joy in giving than in
   withhold-ing--a greater bliss in serving God than in being idle.
   Moreover our liberality has always been repaid to us with interest, for
   our God will be in no man's debt.

   Here is a specimen of what has been our experience from the pen of a
   tradesman: "Some years ago I heard a sermon from the words, 'Bring you
   all the tithes into the storehouse' (Mal. 3:10). I cannot describe how
   my mind was impressed with the manner in which Jehovah here
   condescended to challenge His people when He says, 'And prove Me now,'
   etc. Suffice it to say that the subject made such an impression that I
   found it my duty to do more for the cause of God than I ever had done.
   I did so, and on closing that year's accounts, I found that I had
   gained more than in any two years preceding it. Some time afterwards I
   thought the Redeemer's cause had an additional claim, as the place in
   which we worshipped Him needed some repairs. The sum I then gave was
   L20. And in a very little time afterwards I received L40 which I had
   long given up as lost."

   Our Master's service is our liberty. We count it our joy to run in the
   way of His commandments. And if the worldling pities us and says, "Poor
   man, how he must deny himself!" We reply, "In one sense it is true, but
   in another, our best self is fed and satisfied and feasted when we deny
   self. The duties we perform are not performed as duties, but as
   privileges. We do not run into them at all because we feel forced to do
   so, but because we love them. We confess that religion has cost us our
   spirit, our soul, our body. And our only regret is we have not more
   that we can give to the cause of Christ. We think we can stand at the
   foot of the Savior's Cross and say--

   "Now for the love I bear His name, What was my gain I count my loss.
   My former pride I call my shame, And nail my glory to His Cross. Yes,
   and I must and will esteem All things but loss for Jesus' sake
   may my soul be found in Him, And of His righteousness partake!"

   Religion, then, takes away from us nothing but what we are glad to
   lose. And it asks nothing of us but what we are too glad to give. And
   it returns to us in ten thousand ways all that it takes from us. It
   gives us blessings of the upper and of the nether springs. It comforts
   us in life, it cheers us in death. It makes us so happy that we can say
   with Watts--

   "I would not change my blessed estate
   For all the world calls good or great;
   And while my faith can keep her hold,
   1 envy not the sinner's gold."

   IV. In the last place, THE TRUE FARE OF GODLINESS IS ALREADY PAID--NOT
   BY US--BUT BY OUR LORD JESUS. Jonah paid his fare from Joppa to
   Tarshish, but I never find that he paid any fare back. The conveyance
   which brought him to land was far cheaper than the ship of Tarshish,
   though not quite so comfortable. He came back to land with no expense
   to himself whatever!

   So we must pay much and do much in order to be cast away--but the way
   of eternal life and salvation is perfectly free. When Jonah was thrown
   out into the midst of the sea, the whale did not swallow him because he
   was a man of money, or because he was a man of merit--he was just a
   needy, destitute sinner, subject to the wrath of God as expressed in
   that tempest and in that storm and in that boiling sea. And there came
   the friendly fish which carried him into a living grave for three days
   that his life might be preserved.

   And this is very much like our salvation--salvation by death and burial
   with Jesus. We flee away. We trust by our self-righteousness to escape
   from the tempest of God's wrath, but we cannot. At last we feel that we
   are cast right out into the sea to perish and God's anger, as we think,
   is hot against us. There is no good thing in us, nothing upon which we
   can rely. We see no hope of escape. Just then the death of Christ,
   which was our greatest crime--which seems as though it would destroy
   us-- takes us into its friendly shelter and in it we go to the bottoms
   of the mountains.

   In it we descend till all the waves and billows of God's wrath have
   rolled over us. And in it we are securely landed, to praise the name
   and love of God. When our extremity comes and there is none to help,
   then God prepares the way of deliverance for us, His people. Hear me
   for one moment, my Brothers and Sisters, this morning. We have sinned!
   God help us to feel the sin! Grievously have we offended against God by
   flying in His face and going where He would not have us go!

   Can we return? We have paid our fare to go to the place of destruction,
   but we have no means to pay our fare to Heaven. Penniless, stripped of
   all hope in ourselves, is there any way by which we can return--by
   which we can find eternal life? There is! There is--if we give
   ourselves up wholly to God, confessing our sins and if our soul rests
   alone upon the finished work of the great salvation provided in Christ
   Jesus. We need not fear because we have nothing. Our God, who has
   everything, asks nothing from us. He does not save us because we are
   righteous, but because He is gracious. He will not deliver us because
   there is something good in us--but because there is everything good in
   Himself.

   Let me say to those of you who are sleeping this morning, careless of
   your fate--If you sleep much longer, you may wake up where your waking
   will be terrible. What are you doing, O you Sleepers! Rise! I remind
   you of your future doom, of your present danger. O Spirit of God,
   arouse them! And if awakened, you cry, "What must I do to be saved?"
   The answer comes, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be
   saved."

   Though you can see no means of escape, yet there is a means provided by
   God! And when you are cast out from the ship, have left all other
   confidence and think that God's sea of wrath will cover you up--then
   Christ, who has been prepared of old as our great Deliverer, shall take
   you and bear you safely to the land of eternal Glory. I would God that
   you were made to forsake the way of the Destroyer and led in the way of
   peace, that He might have all the praise forever. May He bless these
   poor, feeble, but well-intended remarks, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                          Satan Considering the Saints

   A Sermon

   (No. 623)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, April 9th, 1865, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
   Job."--Job 1:8.

   HOW VERY UNCERTAIN are all terrestrial things! How foolish would that
   believer be who should lay up his treasure anywhere, except in heaven!
   Job's prosperity promised as much stability as anything can do beneath
   the moon. The man had round about him a large household of, doubtless,
   devoted and attached servants. He had accumulated wealth of a kind
   which does not suddenly depreciate in value. He had oxen, and asses,
   and cattle. He had not to go to markets, and fairs, and trade with his
   goods to procure food and clothing, for he carried on the processes of
   agriculture on a very large scale round about his own homestead, and
   probably grew within his own territory everything that his
   establishment required. His children were numerous enough to promise a
   long line of descendants. His prosperity wanted nothing for its
   consolidation. It had come to its flood-tide: where was the cause which
   could make it ebb?

   Up there, beyond the clouds, where no human eye could see, there was a
   scene enacted which augured no good to Job's prosperity. The spirit of
   evil stood face to face with the infinite Spirit of all good. An
   extraordinary conversation took place between these two beings. When
   called to account for his doings, the evil one boasted that he had gone
   to and fro throughout the earth, insinuating that he had met with no
   hindrance to his will, and found no one to oppose his freely moving and
   acting at his own pleasure. He had marched everywhere like a king in
   his own dominions, unhindered and unchallenged. When the great God
   reminded him that there was at least one place among men where he had
   no foothold, and where his power was unrecognized, namely, in the heart
   of Job; that there was one man who stood like an impregnable castle,
   garrisoned by integrity, and held with perfect loyalty as the
   possession of the King of Heaven; the evil one defied Jehovah to try
   the faithfulness of Job, told him that the patriarch's integrity was
   due to his prosperity, that he served God and eschewed evil from
   sinister motives, because he found his conduct profitable to himself.
   The God of heaven took up the challenge of the evil one, and gave him
   permission to take away all the mercies which he affirmed to be the
   props of Job's integrity, and to pull down all the outworks and
   buttresses and see whether the tower would not stand in its own
   inherent strength without them. In consequence of this, all Job's
   wealth went in one black day, and not even a child was left to whisper
   comfort. A second interview between the Lord and his fallen angel took
   place. Job was again the subject of conversation; and the Great One
   defied by Satan, permitted him even to touch him in his bone and in his
   flesh, till the prince became worse than a pauper, and he who was rich
   and happy was poor and wretched, filled with disease from head to foot,
   and fain to scrape himself with a miserable potsherd, to gain a poor
   relief from his pain.

   Let us see in this the mutability of all terrestrial things. He hath
   founded it upon the floods," is David's description of this world; and,
   if it be founded on the floods, can you wonder that it changes oft? Put
   not your trust in anything beneath the stars: remember that "Change" is
   written on the fore-front of nature. Say not therefore, "My mountain
   standeth firm: it shall never be moved;" the glance of Jehovah's eye
   can shake thy mountain into dust, the touch of his foot can make it
   like Sinai, to melt like wax, and to be altogether on a smoke. "Set
   your affection on things above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand
   of God," and let your heart and your treasure be where neither moth nor
   rust doth corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal." The words of
   Bernard may here instruct us: "That is the true and chief joy which is
   not conceived from the creature, but received from the Creator, which
   (being once possessed thereof) none can take from thee: compared with
   which all other pleasure is torment, all joy is grief, sweet things are
   bitter, all glory is baseness, and all delectable things are
   despicable."

   This is not, however, our subject this morning. Accept thus much as
   merely an introduction to our main discourse. The Lord said to Satan,
   "Hast thou considered my servant Job?" Let us deliberate, first, in
   what sense the evil spirit may be said to consider the people of God;
   secondly, let us notice what it is that he considers about them; and
   then, thirdly, let us comfort ourselves by the reflection that one who
   is far above Satan considers us in a higher sense.

   I. First, then, IN WHAT SENSE MAY SATAN BE SAID TO CONSIDER THE PEOPLE
   OF GOD?

   Certainly not in the usual Biblical meaning of the term "consider." "O
   Lord consider my trouble." "Consider my meditation." "Blessed is he
   that considereth the poor." Such consideration implies good-will and a
   careful inspection of the object of benevolence with regard to a wise
   distribution of favour. In that sense Satan never considers any. If he
   has any benevolence, it must be towards himself; but all his
   considerations of other creatures are of the most malevolent kind. No
   meteoric flash of good flits across the black midnight of his soul. Nor
   does he consider us as we are told to consider the works of God, that
   is, in order to derive instruction as to God's wisdom and love and
   kindness. He does not honour God by what he sees in his works, or in
   his people. It is not with him, "Go to the ant; consider her ways and
   be wise;" but he goes to the Christian and considers his ways and
   becomes more foolishly God's enemy than he was before. The
   consideration which Satan pays to God's saints is upon this wise. He
   regards them with wonder, when he considers the difference between them
   and himself. A traitor, when he knows the thorough villainy and the
   blackness of his own heart, cannot help being astounded, when he is
   forced to believe another man to be faithful. The first resort of a
   treacherous heart is to believe that all men would be just as
   treacherous, and are really so at bottom. The traitor thinks that all
   men are traitors like himself, or would be, if it paid them better than
   fidelity. When Satan looks at the Christian, and finds him faithful to
   God and to his truth, he considers him as we should consider a
   phenomenon--Perhaps despising him for his folly, but yet marveling at
   him, and wondering how he can act thus. "I," he seems to say, "a
   prince, a peer of God's parliament, would not submit my will to
   Jehovah. I thought it better to reign in hell than serve in heaven: I
   kept not my first estate, but fell from my throne. How is it that these
   stand? What grace is it which keeps these? I was a vessel of gold, and
   yet I was broken; these are earthen vessels, but I cannot break them! I
   could not stand in my glory--what can be the matchless grace which
   upholds them in their poverty, in their obscurity, in their
   persecution, still faithful to the God who doth not bless and exalt
   them as he did me!" It may be that he also wonders at their happiness.
   He feels within himself a seething sea of misery. There is an
   unfathomable gulf of anguish within his soul, and when he looks at
   believers, he sees them quiet in their souls, full of peace and
   happiness, and often without any outward means by which they should be
   comforted, yet rejoicing and full of glory. He goes up and down through
   the world and possesses great power, and there be many myrmidons to
   serve him, yet he hath not the happiness of spirit possessed by yonder
   humble cottager, obscure, unknown, having no servants to wait upon her,
   but stretched upon the bed of weakness. He admires and hates the peace
   which reigns in the believer's soul.

   His consideration may go farther than this. Do you not think that he
   considers them to detect, if possible, any flaw and fault in them, by
   way of solace to himself? "They are not pure," saith he--"these
   blood-bought ones--these elect from before the foundations of the
   world,--they still sin! These adopted children of God, for whom the
   glorious Son bowed his head and gave up the ghost!--even they offend!"
   How must he chuckle, with such delight as he is capable of, over the
   secret sins of God's people, and if he can see anything in them
   inconsistent with their profession, anything which appears to be
   deceitful, and therein like himself, he rejoices. Each sin born in the
   believer's heart, cries to him, "My father! my Father!" and he feels
   something like the joy of fatherhood as he sees his foul offspring. He
   looks at the "old man" in the Christian, and admires the tenacity with
   which it maintains its hold, the force and vehemence with which it
   struggles for the mastery, the craft and cunning with which every now
   and then, at set intervals, at convenient opportunities, it putteth
   forth all its force. He considers our sinful flesh, and makes it one of
   the books in which he diligently reads. One of the fairest prospects, I
   doubt not, which the devil's eye ever rests upon, is the inconsistency
   and the impurity which he can discover in the true child of God. In
   this respect he had very little to consider in God's true servant, Job.

   Nor is this all, but rather just the starting point of his
   consideration. We doubt not that he views the Lord's people, and
   especially the more eminent and excellent among them, as the great
   barriers to the progress of his kingdom; and just as the engineer,
   endeavouring to make a railway, keeps his eye very much fixed upon the
   hills and rivers, and especially upon the great mountain through which
   it will take years laboriously to bore a tunnel, so Satan, in looking
   upon his various plans to carry on his dominion in the world, considers
   most such men as Job. Satan must have thought much of Martin Luther. "I
   could ride the world over," says he, "if it were not for that monk. He
   stands in my way. That strong-headed man hates and mauls my firstborn
   son, the pope. If I could get rid of him I would not mind though fifty
   thousand smaller saints stood in my way." He is sure to consider God's
   servant, if there be "none like him," if he stand out distinct and
   separate from his fellows. Those of us who are called to the work of
   the ministry must expect from our position to be the special objects of
   his consideration. When the glass is at the eye of that dreadful
   warrior, he is sure to look out for those who by their regimentals are
   discovered to be the officers, and he bids his sharpshooters be very
   careful to aim at these, "For," saith he, "if the standard-bearer fall,
   then shall the victory be more readily gained to our side, and our
   opponents shall be readily put to rout." If you are more generous than
   other saints, if you live nearer to God than others, as the birds peck
   most at the ripest fruit, so may you expect Satan to be most busy
   against you. Who cares to contend for a province covered with stones
   and barren rocks, and ice-bound by frozen seas? But in all times there
   is sure to be contention after the fat valleys where the wheat-sheaves
   are plenteous, and where the husbandman's toil is well requited, and
   thus, for you who honour God most, Satan will struggle very sternly. He
   wants to pluck God's jewels from his crown, if he can, and take the
   Redeemer's precious stones even from the breastplate itself. He
   considers, then, God's people; viewing them as hindrances to his reign,
   he contrives methods by which he may remove them out of his way, or
   turn them to his own account. Darkness would cover the earth if he
   could blow out the lights; there would be no fruit to shake like
   Lebanon, if he could destroy that handful of corn upon the top of the
   mountains; hence his perpetual consideration is to make the faithful
   fail from among men.

   It needs not much wisdom to discern that the great object of Satan in
   considering God's people is to do them injury. I scarcely think he
   hopes to destroy the really chosen and blood-bought heirs of life. My
   notion is that he is too good a divine for that. He has been foiled too
   often when he has attacked God's people, that he can hardly think he
   shall be able to destroy the elect, for you remember the soothsayers
   who are very nearly related to him, spoke to Haman on this wise; "If
   Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to
   fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before
   him." He knows right well that there is a seed royal in the land
   against whom he fights in vain; and it strikes me if he could be
   absolutely certain that any one soul was chosen of God, he would
   scarcely waste his time in attempting to destroy it, although he might
   seek to worry and to dishonour it. It is however most likely that Satan
   no more knows who God's elect are than we do, for he can only judge as
   we do by outward actions, though he can form a more accurate judgment
   than we can through longer experience, and being able to see persons in
   private where we cannot intrude; yet into God's book of secret decrees
   his black eye can never peer. By their fruits he knows them, and we
   know them in the same manner. Since, however, we are often mistaken in
   our judgment, he too may be so; and it seems to me that he therefore
   makes it his policy to endeavour to destroy them all--not knowing in
   which case he may succeed. He goeth about seeking whom he may devour,
   and, as he knows not whom he may be permitted to swallow up, he attacks
   all the people of God with vehemence. Some one may say, "How can one
   devil do this?" He does not do it by himself alone. I do not know that
   many of us have ever been tempted directly by Satan: we may not be
   notable enough among men to be worth his trouble; but he has a whole
   host of inferior spirits under his supremacy and control, and as the
   centurion said of himself, so he might have said of Satan--"he saith to
   this spirit, Do this,' and he doeth it, and to his servant, Go,' and he
   goeth." Thus all the servants of God will more or less come under the
   direct or indirect assaults of the great enemy of souls, and that with
   a view of destroying them; for he would, if it were possible, deceive
   the very elect. Where he cannot destroy, there is no doubt that Satan's
   object is to worry. He does not like to see God's people happy. I
   believe the devil greatly delights in some ministers, whose tendency in
   their preaching is to multiply and foster doubts and fears, and grief,
   and despondency, as the evidences of God's people. "Ah," saith the
   devil, "preach on; you are doing my work well, for I like to see God's
   people mournful. If I can make them hang their harps on the willows,
   and go about with miserable faces, I reckon I have done my work very
   completely." My dear friends, let us watch against those specious
   temptations which pretend to make us humble, but which really aim at
   making us unbelieving. Our God takes no delight in our suspicions and
   mistrusts. See how he proves his love in the gift of his dear Son
   Jesus. Banish then all your ill surmisings, and rejoice in unmoved
   confidence. God delights to be worshipped with Joy. Oh come, let us
   sing unto the Lord: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our
   salvation. Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make
   a joyful noise unto him with psalms." "Rejoice in the Lord, ye
   righteous, and shout for joy all ye that are upright in heart."
   "Rejoice in the Lord always, and again, I say, rejoice." Satan does not
   like this. Martin Luther used to say, "Let us sing psalms and spite the
   devil," and I have no doubt Martin Luther was pretty nearly right; for
   that lover of discord hates harmonious, joyous praise. Beloved brother,
   the arch-enemy wants to make you wretched here, if he cannot have you
   hereafter; and in this, no doubt, he is aiming a blow at the honour of
   God. He is well aware that mournful Christians often dishonour the
   faithfulness of God by mistrusting it, and he thinks if he can worry us
   until we no more believe in the constancy and goodness of the Lord, he
   shall have robbed God of his praise. "He that offereth praise,
   glorifieth me," says God; and so Satan lays the axe at the root of our
   praise, that God may cease to be glorified.

   Moreover, if Satan cannot destroy a Christian, how often has he spoilt
   his usefulness? Many a believer has fallen, not to break his neck--that
   is impossible,--but he has broken some important bone, and he has gone
   limping to his grave! We can recall with grief some men once eminent in
   the ranks of the Church, who did run well, but on a sudden, through
   stress of temptation, they fell into sin, and their names were never
   mentioned in the Church again, except with bated breath. Everybody
   thought and hoped they were saved so as by fire, but certainly their
   former usefulness never could return. It is very easy to go back in the
   heavenly pilgrimage, but it is very hard to retrieve your steps. You
   may soon turn aside and put out your candle, but you cannot light it
   quite so speedily. Friend, beloved in the Lord, watch against the
   attacks of Satan and stand fast, because you, as a pillar in the house
   or God are very dear to us, and we cannot spare you. As a father, or as
   a matron in our midst, we do you honour, and oh--we would not be made
   to mourn and lament--we do not wish to be grieved by hearing the shouts
   of our adversaries while they cry "Aha! Aha! so would we have it," for
   alas! there have been many things done in our Zion which we would not
   have told in Gath, nor published in the streets of Askelon, lest the
   daughters of the uncircumcised should rejoice, and the sons of the
   Philistines should triumph. Oh may God grant us grace, as a Church, to
   stand against the wiles of Satan and his attacks, that having done his
   worst he may gain no advantage over us, and after having considered,
   and considered again, and counted well our towers and bulwarks, he may
   be compelled to retire because his battering rams cannot jar so much as
   a stone from our ramparts, and his slings cannot slay one single
   soldier on the walls.

   Before I leave this point, I should like to say, that perhaps it may be
   suggested, "How is it that God permits this constant and malevolent
   consideration of his people by the evil one?" One answer, doubtless,
   is, that God knows what is for his own glory, and that he giveth no
   account of his matters; that having permitted free agency, and having
   allowed, for some mysterious reason, the existence of evil, it does not
   seem agreeable with his having done so to destroy Satan; but he gives
   him power that it may be a fair hand-to-hand fight between sin and
   holiness, between grace and craftiness. Besides, be it remembered, that
   incidentally the temptations of Satan are of service to the people of
   God; Fenelon says they are the file which rubs off much of the rust of
   self-confidence, and I may add, they are the horrible sound in the
   sentinel's ear, which is sure to keep him awake. An experimental divine
   remarks, that there is no temptation in the world which is so bad as
   not being tempted at all; for to be tempted will tend to keep us awake:
   whereas, being without temptation, flesh and blood are weak--and though
   the spirit may be willing, yet we may be found falling into slumber.
   Children do not run away from their father's side when big dogs bark at
   them. The howlings of the devil may tend to drive us nearer to Christ,
   may teach us our own weakness, may keep us upon our own watch-tower,
   and be made the means of preservation from other ills. Let us "be
   sober, be vigilant, because our adversary the devil, like a roaring
   lion, goeth about seeking whom he may devour;" and let us who are in a
   prominent position be permitted affectionately to press upon you one
   earnest request, namely, "Brethren, pray for us." that, exposed as we
   are peculiarly to the consideration of Satan, we may be guarded by
   divine power. Let us be made rich by your faithful prayers that we may
   be kept even to the end.

   II. Secondly, WHAT IS IT THAT SATAN CONSIDERS WITH A VIEW TO THE INJURY
   OF GOD'S PEOPLE?

   It cannot be said of him as of God, that he knoweth us altogether; but
   since he has been now nearly six thousand years dealing with poor
   fallen humanity, he must have acquired a very vast experience in that
   time, and having been all over the earth, and having tempted the
   highest and the lowest, he must know exceeding well what the springs of
   human action are, and how to play upon them. Satan watches and
   considers first of all our peculiar infirmities. He looks us up and
   down, just as I have seen a horse-dealer do with a horse; and soon
   finds out wherein we are faulty. I, a common observer, might think the
   horse an exceedingly good one, as I see it running up and down the
   road, but the dealer sees what I cannot see, and he knows how to handle
   the creature just in such quarters and at such points that he soon
   discovers any hidden mischief. Satan knows how to look at us and reckon
   us up from heel to head, so that he will say of this man, "His
   infirmity is lust," or of that other, "He hath a quick tempter," or of
   this other, "He is proud," or of that other, "He is slothful." The eye
   of malice is very quick to perceive a weakness, and the hand of enmity
   soon takes advantage of it. When the arch-spy finds a weak place in the
   wall of our castle, he takes care to plant his battering-ram, and begin
   his siege. You may conceal, even from your dearest friend, your
   infirmity, but you will not conceal it from your worst enemy. He has
   lynx eyes, and detects in a moment the joint in your harness. He goes
   about with a match, and though you may think you have covered all the
   gunpowder of your heart, yet he knows how to find a crack to put his
   match through, and much mischief will he do, unless eternal mercy shall
   prevent.

   He takes care also to consider our frames and states of mind. If the
   devil would attack us when our mind is in certain moods, we should be
   more than a match for him: he knows this, and shuns the encounter. Some
   men are more ready for temptation when they are distressed and
   desponding; the fiend will then assail them. Others will be more liable
   to take fire when they are jubilant and full of joy; then will he
   strike his spark into the tinder. Certain persons, when they are much
   vexed and tossed to and fro, can be made to say almost anything; and
   others, when their souls are like perfectly placid waters, are just
   then in a condition to be navigated by the devil's vessel. As the
   worker in metals knows that one metal is to be worked at such a heat,
   and another at a different temperature; as those who have to deal with
   chemicals know that at a certain heat one fluid will boil, while
   another reaches the boiling-point much earlier, so Satan knows exactly
   the temperature at which to work us to his purpose. Small pots boil
   directly they are put on the fire, and so little men of quick temper
   are soon in a passion; larger vessels require more time and coal before
   they will boil, but when they do boil, it is a boil indeed, not soon
   forgotten or abated. The enemy, like a fisherman, watches his fish,
   adapts his bait to his prey; and knows in what seasons and times the
   fish are most likely to bite. This hunter of so souls comes upon us
   unawares, and often we are overtaken in a fault and or caught in a trap
   through an unwatchful frame of mind. That rate collector of choice
   sayings, Thomas Spencer, has the following which is to the much to the
   point--"The chameleon, when he lies on the grass to catch flies and
   grasshoppers, taketh upon him the colour of the grass, as the polypus
   doth the colour of the rock under which he lurketh, that the fish may
   boldly come near him without any suspicion of danger. In like manner,
   Satan turneth himself into that shape hich we least fear, and sets
   before us such objects of temptation as are most agreeable to our
   natures, that sohe may the sooner draw us into his net; he sails with
   every wind, and blows us that way which we incline ourselves through
   the weakness of nature. Is our knowledge in matter of faith deficient?
   He tempts us to error. Is our conscience tender? He tempts us to
   scrupulosity, and too much preciseness. Hath our conscience, like the
   ecliptic line, some latitude? He tempts us to carnal liberty. Are we
   bold spirited? He tempts us to presumption. Are we timorous and
   distrustful? He tempteth us to desperation. Are we of a flexible
   disposition? He tempteth us to inconstancy. Are we stiff? He labours to
   make obstinate heretics, schismatics, or rebels of us. Are we of an
   austere tempter? He tempteth us to cruelty. Are we soft and mild? He
   tempteth us to indulgence and foolish pity. Are we hot in matters of
   religion? He tempteth us to blind zeal and superstition. Are we cold?
   He tempteth us to Laodicean lukewarmness. Thus doth he lay his traps,
   that one way or other, he may ensnare us."

   He also takes care to consider our position among men. There are a few
   persons who are most easily tempted when they are alone; they are the
   subjects then of great heaviness of mind, and they may be driven to
   most awful crimes: perhaps the most of us are more liableiable to sin
   when we are in company. In some company I never should be led into sin;
   into another society I could scarcely venture. Many are so full of
   levity, that those of us who are inclined the same way can scarcely
   look them in the face without feeling our besetting sin set a-going;
   and others are so somber, that if they meet a brother of like mould,
   they are pretty sure between them to invent an evil report of the
   goodly land. Satan knows where to overtake you in a place where you lie
   open to his attacks; he will pounce upon you, swoop like a bird of prey
   from the sky, where he has been watching for the time to make his
   descent with a prospect of success.

   How too, will he consider our condition in the world! He looks at one
   man, and says, "That man has property: it is of no use my trying
   such-and-such arts with him; but here is another man who is very poor,
   I will catch him in that net." Then, again, he looks at the poor man,
   and says, "Now, I cannot tempt him to this folly, but I will lead the
   rich man into it." As the sportsman has a gun for wild fowl, and
   another for deer and game, so has Satan a different temptation for
   various orders of men. I do not suppose that the Queen's temptation
   ever will annoy Mary the kitchen-maid. I do not suppose, on the other
   hand, that Mary's temptation will ever be very serious to me. Probably
   you could escape from mine--I do not think you could; and I sometimes
   fancy I could bear yours--though I question if I could. Satan knows,
   however, just where to smite us, and our position, our capabilities,
   our education, our standing in society, our calling, may all be doors
   through which he may attack us. You who have no calling at all, are in
   peculiar peril--I wonder the devil does not swallow you outright. The
   most likely man to go to hell is the man who has nothing to do on
   earth. I say that seriously. I believe that there cannot happen a much
   worse evil to a person than to be placed where he has no work; and if I
   should ever be in such a state, I would get employment at once, for
   fear I should be carried off, body and soul, by the evil one. Idle
   people tempt the devil to tempt them. Let us have something to do, let
   us keep our minds occupied, for, if not, we make room for the devil.
   Industry will not make us gracious, but the want of industry may make
   us vicious. Have always something on the anvil or in the fire.

   "In books, or work, or healthful play,

   I would be busy too,

   For Satan finds some mischief still

   For idle hands to do."

   So Watts taught us in our childhood; and so let us believe in our
   manhood. Books, or works, or such recreations as are necessary for
   health, should occupy our time; for if I throw myself down in
   indolence, like an old piece of iron, I must not wonder that I grow
   rusty with sin.

   Nor have I done yet. Satan, when he makes his investigations, notices
   all the objects of our affection. I doubt not when he went round Job's
   house, he observed it as carefully as thieves do a jeweller's premises
   when they mean to break into them. They very cunningly take account of
   every door, window, and fastening: they fail not to look at the
   next-door house; for they may have to reach the treasure through the
   building which adjoins it. So, when the devil went round, jotting down
   in his mind all Job's position, he thought to himself, "There are the
   camels and the oxen, the asses, and the servants--yes, I can use all
   these very admirably." "Then," he thought, "there are the three
   daughters! There are the ten sons, and they go feasting--I shall know
   where to catch them, and if I can just blow the house down when they
   are feasting, that will afflict the father's mind the more severely,
   for he will say O that they had died when they had been praying, rather
   than when they had been feasting and drinking wine.' I will put down
   too in the inventory," says the devil I shall want her," and
   accordingly it came to that. Nobody could have done what Job's wife
   did--none of the servants could have said that sad sentence so
   stingingly--or, if she meant it very kindly, none could have said it
   with such a fascinating air as Job's own wife, "Bless God and die," as
   it may be read, or "Curse God and die." Ah, Satan, thou hast ploughed
   with Job's heifer, but thou hast not succeeded; lob's strength lies in
   his God, not in his hair, or else thou mightest have shorn him as
   Samson was shorn! Perhaps the evil one had even inspected Job's
   personal sensibilities, and so selected that form of bodily affliction
   which he knew to be most dreaded by his victim. He brought upon him a
   disease which Job may have seen and shuddered at in poor men outside
   the city gates. Brethren, Satan knows quite as much in regard to you.
   You have a child, and Satan knows that you idolize it. "Ah," says he,
   "there is a place for my wounding him." Even the partner of your bosom
   may be made a quiver in which hell's arrows shall be stored till the
   time may come, and then she may prove the bow from which Satan will
   shoot them. Watch even your neighbour and her that lieth in your bosom,
   for you know not how Satan may get an advantage over you. Our habits,
   our joys, our sorrows, our retirements, our public positions, all may
   be made weapons of attack by this desperate foe of the Lord's people.
   We have snares everywhere; in our bed and at our table, in our house
   and in the street. There are gins and trap-falls in company; there are
   pits when we are alone. We may find temptations in the house of God as
   well as in the world; traps in our high estate, and deadly poisons in
   our abasement. We must not expect to be rid of temptations till we have
   crossed the Jordan, and then, thank God, we are beyond gunshot of the
   enemy. The last howling of the dog of hell will be heard as we descend
   into the chill waters of the black stream, but when we hear the
   hallelujah of the glorified, we shall have done with the black prince
   for ever and ever.

   III. Satan considered, but THERE WAS A HIGHER CONSIDERATION WHICH
   OVERRODE HIS CONSIDERATION.

   In times of war, the sappers and miners of one party will make a mine,
   and it is a very common counteractive for the sappers and miners of the
   other party to countermine by undermining the first mine. This is just
   what God does with Satan. Satan is mining, and he thinks to light the
   fuse and to blow up God's building, but all the while God is
   undermining him, and he blows up Satan's mine before he can do any
   mischief. The devil is the greatest of all fools. He has more knowledge
   but less wisdom than any other creature, he is more subtle than all the
   beasts of the field, but it is well called subtlety, not wisdom. It is
   not true wisdom; it is only another shape of folly. All the while that
   Satan was tempting Job, he little knew that he was answering God's
   purpose, for God was looking on and considering the whole of it, and
   holding the enemy as a man holds a horse by its bridle. The Lord had
   considered exactly how far he would let Satan go. He did not the first
   time permit him to touch his flesh--perhaps that was more than Job at
   that time could have borne. Have you never noticed that if you are in
   good strong bodily health you can bear losses and crosses, and even
   bereavements with something like equanimity? Now that was the case with
   Job. Perhaps if the disease had come first and the rest had followed,
   it might have been a temptation too heavy for him, but God who knows
   just how far to let the enemy go, will say to him, "Thus far, and no
   farther." By degrees he became accustomed to his poverty; in fact, the
   trial had lost all its sting the moment Job said, "The Lord gave, and
   the Lord hath taken away." That enemy was slain--nay it was buried and
   this was the funeral oration, "Blessed be the name of the Lord." When
   the second trial came, the first trial had qualified Job to bear the
   second. It may be a more severe trial for a man in the possession of
   great worldly wealth suddenly to be deprived of the bodily power of
   enjoying it, than to lose all first, and then lose the health necessary
   to its enjoyment. Having already lost all, he might almost say, "I
   thank God that now I have nothing to enjoy, and therefore the loss of
   the power to enjoy it is not so wearisome. I have not to say, "How I
   wish I could go out in my fields, and see to my servants, for they are
   all dead. I do not wish to see my children--they are all dead and
   gone--I am thankful that they are; better so, than that they should see
   their poor father sit on a dunghill like this." He might have been
   almost glad if his wife had gone too, for certainly she was not a very
   particular mercy when she was spared; and possibly, if he had all his
   children about him, it might have been a harder trial than it was. The
   Lord who weighs mountains in scales, had meted out his servant's woe.

   Did not the Lord also consider how he should sustain his servant under
   his trial? Beloved, you do not know how blessedly our God poured the
   secret oil upon Job's fire of grace while the devil was throwing
   buckets of water on it. He saith to himself, "If Satan shall do much, I
   will do more; if he takes away much, I will give more; if he tempts the
   man to curse, I will fill him so full of love to me that he shall bless
   me. I will help him; I will strengthen him; yea, I will uphold him with
   the right hand of my righteousness." Christian, take those two thoughts
   and put them under your tongue as a wafer made with honey--you will
   never be tempted without express license from the throne where Jesus
   pleads, and, on the other hand, when he permits it, he will with the
   temptation make a way of escape, or give you grace to stand under it.

   In the next place, the Lord considered how to sanctify Job by this
   trial. Job was a much better man at the end of the story than he was at
   the beginning. He was "an incredible disgrace upon Satan. If you want
   perfect and an upright man" at first, but there was a little pride
   about him. We are poor creatures to criticize such a man as Job--but
   still there was in him just a sprinkling of self-righteousness. I
   think, and his friends brought it out, Eliphaz and Zophar said such
   irritating things that poor Job could not help replying in strong terms
   about himself that were rather too strong, one thinks; there was a
   little too much self-justification. He was not proud as some of us are,
   of a very little--he had much to be proud of, as the world would
   allow--but yet there was the tendency to be exalted with it; and though
   the devil did not know it, perhaps if he had left Job alone, that pride
   might have run to seed, and Job might have sinned; but he was in such a
   hurry, that he would not let the ill seed ripen, but hastened to cut it
   up, and so was the Lord's tool to bring Job into a more humble, and
   consequently a more safe and blessed state of mind. Moreover, observe
   how Satan was a lacquey to the Almighty! Job all this while was being
   enabled to earn a greater reward. All his prosperity is not enough; God
   loves Job so much, that he intends to give him twice the property; he
   intends to give him his children again; he means to make him a more
   famous man than ever; a man whose name shall ring down the ages; a man
   who shall be talked of through all generations. He is not to be the man
   of Uz, but of the whole world. He is not to be heard of by a handful in
   one neighbourhood, but all men are to hear of Job's patience in the
   hour of trial. Who is to do this? Who is to fashion the trump of fame
   through which Job's name is to be blown? The devil goes to the forge,
   and works away with all his might, to make Job illustrious! Foolish
   devil! he is piling up a pedestal on which God will set his servant
   Job, that he may be looked upon with wonder by all ages.

   To conclude, Job's afflictions and Job's patience have been a lasting
   blessing to the Church of God, and they have inflicted incredible
   disgrace upon Satan. If you want to make the devil angry, throw the
   story of Job in his teeth. If you desire to have your own confidence
   sustained, may God the Holy Ghost lead you into the patience of lob.
   Oh! how many saints have been comforted in their distress by this
   history of patience! How many have been saved out of the jaw of the
   lion, and from the paw of the bear by the dark experiences of the
   patriarch of Uz. Oh arch fiend, how art thou taken in thine own net!
   Thou hast thrown a stone which has fallen on thine own head. Thou
   madest a pit for Job, and hast fallen into it thyself; thou art taken
   in thine own craftiness. Jehovah has made fools of the wise and driven
   the diviners mad. Brethren, let us commit ourselves in faith to the
   care and keeping of God--come poverty, come sickness, come death, we
   will in all things through Jesus Christ's blood be conquerors, and by
   the power of his Spirit we shall overcome at the last. I would God we
   were all trusting in Jesus. May those who have not trusted him be led
   to begin this very morning, and God shall have all the praise in us
   all, evermore. Amen.

                       Present Privilege And Future Favor

   NO. 624

   DELIVERED ON WEDNESDAY EVENING, MARCH 29, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT
   UPTON CHAPEL.

   "The eternal God is your refuge and underneath are the everlasting
   arms: and He shall thrust out the enemy from before you. And shall say,
   Destroy them." Deuteronomy 33:27.

   THERE is a great satisfaction in having such a text as this, for even
   if the preacher should not be able to say anything to edification, yet
   the text itself is rich food for the saints and may fully satisfy their
   hunger. Let but a child of God really digest such a royal dainty as
   this and he shall be as well fed as was Elijah when, waking up, found
   food under the juniper tree, in the strength of which he might go for
   forty days. This one verse may, by the Holy Spirit, be made
   sufficiently nourishing to sustain a Believer from that place where he
   now is, to the gates of Glory. "The eternal God is your refuge and
   underneath are the everlasting arms."

   It is fabled that the swan sings but once and that just before it dies.
   So Moses, who had been all his life a Prophet, now closes his career a
   poet and dies singing! He praises God, setting Him above all gods and
   defying all men to find one like unto Him. "Who is like unto the God of
   Jeshurun?" Not satisfied with this, he also exalts in the highest
   degree all the people who have God to be their portion. "Happy are you,
   O Israel. Who is like unto you?" I may say that my text is a
   combination of the two--he is here extolling God, the everlasting and
   eternal God who is our refuge--and he is here admiring the privilege of
   Believers who have such a God to rest upon.

   While we are speaking, therefore, this evening, if you are not profited
   by our words, yet your hearts may be blessed if you praise God for His
   great goodness towards you. And may you also feel melted with holy joy
   at the blessed privileges which belong to you as the people of God--in
   having such a God who is so good to you. The text naturally divides
   itself into two parts--the present and the future. In the present we
   have the eternal God to be our refuge. In the future it is written that
   He shall thrust out the enemy from before us and shall say, "Destroy
   them."

   I. Beginning then, with the first part of the text, THE PRESENT
   BLESSING appeals to me to give us three distinct thoughts. God is our
   shelter. "The eternal God is your refuge." But the word, "refuge,"
   according to many of the best translators, may be read, "mansion," or
   "abiding place." So here comes a second thought--that God is our abode.
   Then the next sentence gives us the third thought, "And underneath are
   the everlasting arms," so that God is our support, as well as our
   shelter and our abode.

   1. We will begin our meditation, in the Spirit's power, by considering
   God as our shelter. The children of Israel, while they were in Egypt
   and in the wilderness, were a type of God's visible Church on earth.
   Moses was speaking primarily of them, but secondarily, of all the
   chosen ones of God in every age. Now, as God was the shelter of His
   ancient people Israel, so is He the refuge of His saints through all
   time. And first, He was eminently their shelter when they were under
   bondage and the yoke was heavy. When they had to make bricks without
   straw and the taskmasters oppressed them, then the people cried unto
   the Lord and God heard their cry and sent unto them His servant Moses.

   So also there often comes to men a time when they begin to feel the
   oppression of Satan. I believe that many ungodly men feel the slavery
   of their position. Even some of those who are never converted have
   sense enough to feel at times that the service of Satan is a hard one,
   yielding but little pleasure and involving awful risks. Some men cannot
   go long making bricks without straw without being more or less
   conscious that they are in the house of bondage. These, who are not
   God's people, under the pressure of mind consequent upon a partial
   discovery of their state, turn to some form of pleasure or
   self-righteousness in order to forget their burden and yoke.

   But God's elect people, moved by a higher power, are led to cry unto
   their God. It is one of the first signs of a chosen soul--that it seems
   to know, as if by heavenly instinct--where its true refuge is. Dear
   Brothers and Sisters, you remember that although you knew but little of
   Christ--and in doctrinal matters you were very dark, though you did not
   un- derstand, perhaps, even your own need--yet there was a something in
   you that made you pray and realize that only at the Mercy Seat could
   you find your refuge.

   Before you were a Christian, before you could say--"Christ is
   mine"--your bedside was the witness to many flowing tears when your
   aching heart poured itself out before God, perhaps in strains like
   these--"O God, I need something. I do not know what it is I need, but I
   feel a heaviness of spirit. My mind is burdened and I feel that You
   only can unburden me. I know that I am a sinner! Oh, that You would
   forgive me! I hardly understand the plan of salvation, but one thing I
   know--I want to be saved! I would arise and go unto my Father--my heart
   pants to make Your bosom my refuge."

   Now, I say that this is one of the first indications that such a soul
   is one of God's chosen, for it is true, just as it was of Israel in
   Egypt, that God is the refuge of His people even when they are under
   the yoke. When captivity is led captive, the Eternal God becomes the
   refuge of His people from their sins. The Israelites were brought out
   of Egypt. They were free--albeit they were marching they knew not
   where--yet their chains were snapped. They were emancipated and needed
   not to call any man, "Master."

   But look, Pharaoh is angry and he pursues them! With his horses and his
   chariots he hastens after them. The enemy said, "I will pursue, I will
   overtake, I will divide the spoil. My lust shall be satisfied upon
   them." Thus there is a period in the spiritual life when sin labors to
   drag back the sinner who has newly escaped from it. Like hosts ready
   for battle, all the poor sinner's past iniquities hurry after him and
   overtake him in a place where his way is hedged in. The poor fugitive
   would escape, but he cannot! What, then, must he do? You remember,
   then, Moses cried unto the Lord. When nothing else could be found to
   afford shelter to the poor escaped slaves. When the Red Sea rolled
   before them and the mountains shut them in on either side. When an
   angry foe pursued them, there was one road which was not stopped up and
   that was the king's highway upward to the Throne--the way to their
   God--and therefore they began at once to travel that road, lifting up
   their hearts in humble prayer to God, trusting that He would deliver
   them.

   You know the story too well for me to need to repeat it here--how the
   uplifted rod divided the watery deeps. How the people passed through
   the sea as a horse through the wilderness and how the Lord brought all
   the hosts of Egypt into the depths of the sea--that He might utterly
   destroy them so that not one of them was left and those who had seen
   them one day saw them no more forever.

   Beloved, in this sense God is still the refuge of His people. Our sins
   which pursued us so hotly have been drowned in the depths of the
   Savior's blood. They sank to the bottom like stones. The depths have
   covered them--there is not one, no, not one of them left--and we,
   standing upon the shore in safety can shout in triumph over our drowned
   sins! "Sing unto the Lord for He has triumphed gloriously and all our
   iniquities has He cast into the midst of the sea." While God is thus
   the refuge of His people under the yoke, and when sin seeks to overcome
   them, He is also their refuge in times of need.

   The children of Israel journeyed into the wilderness but there was
   nothing for them to feed upon there. The arid sand yielded them neither
   leeks, nor garlic, nor cucumbers. And no brooks or rivers, like the
   Nile, were there to quench their thirst. They would have famished if
   they had been left to depend upon the natural productions of the soil.
   They came to Marab, where there was a well, but the water was very
   bitter. At other stations there were no wells whatever and even bitter
   water was not to be had. What then? Why, the unfailing refuge of God's
   people in the wilderness was prayer. Moses, their representative,
   always betook himself to the Most High--at times falling upon his face
   in agony and at other seasons climbing to the top of the hill and there
   pleading in solemn communion with God that He would deliver the people.

   And you have heard full often how men did eat angels' food in the
   desert--how Jehovah rained bread from Heaven upon His people in the
   howling wilderness and how He smote the rock and waters gushed forth.
   You have not forgotten how the strong wind blew and brought them flesh
   so that they ate and were satisfied. Israel had no need unsupplied.
   Their garments waxed not old and though they went through the
   wilderness, their feet grew not sore. God supplied all their needs. We
   in our land must go to the baker, the butcher, the clothier and many
   others in order to equip ourselves fully. But the men of Israel went to
   God for everything. We have to store up our money and buy this in one
   place and that in the other--but the Eternal God was their refuge and
   their resort for everything and in every time of need they had nothing
   to do but to lift up their voice to Him.

   Now it is just so with us spiritually. Faith sees our position today to
   be just that of the children of Israel then-- whatever our needs are
   the Eternal God is our refuge. God has promised you that your bread
   shall be given you and that your water shall be sure. He who gives
   spirituals will not deny temporals. The Mighty Master will never suffer
   you to perish while He has it in His power to succor you. Go to Him
   with whatever may be the trouble which weighs you down. Do not suppose
   your case too bad, for nothing is too hard for the Lord! Dream not that
   He will refuse to undertake temporals as well as spirituals--He cares
   for you in all things.

   In everything you are to give thanks, and surely in everything by
   prayer and supplication you may make known your needs unto God. In
   times when the cruse of oil is ready to fail and the handful of meal is
   all but spent, then go to the All-Sufficient God and you shall find
   that they who trust in Him shall not lack any good thing. Furthermore,
   our God is the refuge of His saints when their enemies rage. When the
   host was passing through the wilderness they were suddenly attacked by
   the Amalekites. Unprovoked, these marauders of the desert set upon them
   and destroyed the tail end of them. And what did Israel do? The people
   did not ask to have a strong body of horsemen, hired out of the land of
   Egypt for their refuge, or even if they did wish it, He who was their
   wiser self, Moses, looked to another arm than that of man, for he cried
   unto God!

   How glorious is that picture of Moses, with uplifted hands, upon the
   top of the hill giving victory to Joshua in the plains below! Those
   uplifted arms were worth ten thousand men to the hosts of Israel. No,
   twice ten thousand had not so easily gotten a victory as did those two
   extended arms which brought down Omnipotence itself from Heaven! This
   was Israel's master-weapon of war--their confidence in God. Joshua
   shall go forth with men of war, but the Lord, Jehovah-Nissi, is the
   banner of the fight and the giver of the victory! Thus, dear Friends,
   the Eternal God is our refuge. When our foes rage we need not fear
   their fury. Let us not seek to be without enemies, but let us take our
   case and spread it before God.

   We cannot be in such a position--that the weapons of our foes can hurt
   us, while the promise stands good--"No weapon that is formed against
   you shall prosper and every tongue that rises against you in judgment
   You shall condemn." Though earth and Hell should unite in malice, the
   Eternal God is our castle and stronghold, securing to us an everlasting
   refuge. To close our remarks upon this point--when their falls into sin
   had cursed the people of God and provoked the Most High so that He sent
   fiery serpents among them--even then the Eternal God was their refuge.
   When we are conscious that sin has brought us into any mischief or
   sorrow, we are apt to feel--"I must not go to God with this, because it
   is clearly the natural and inevitable result of my sin--it is a rod of
   my own making."

   Yes, but we may go even with that, for if the Lord should send the
   fiery serpents, still, you must fly into the arms of that very God who
   has sent the serpents to bite you--for it is He, and He alone who can
   lift up the bronze serpent before your tearful eyes and give you life
   through looking at it! We make a mistake when we imagine that we may
   not go to God as sinners! We may feel unworthy to go, but we must not
   think that we shall be unwelcome. I do not go to my Heavenly Father in
   times of need because I feel there are excellencies in me which will
   qualify me for receiving His help! No! I go because I feel unfit to be
   blessed and am therefore anxious for the blessing!

   I go because I feel unworthy of deliverance and am the more desirous
   that I may get deliverance from the God of Grace. The Eternal God,
   then, is our refuge in a thousand ways. I have only given you a few
   hints on this part of the subject but we will sum them up and then you
   can enlarge on them at your leisure. Under the yoke, before sin is
   forgiven, if you are a child of God the Eternal God is your refuge.
   When you have escaped from sin and the past haunts you, still the
   Eternal God is your refuge. When, in the wilderness, your needs press
   you down, whether they are temporal or spiritual, then the Eternal God
   is your refuge. And when your enemies attack you, or your own guilt has
   brought you into such a position that God Himself chastises you
   sharply, still, even then it holds good and true that the Eternal God
   is your refuge if you believe in Him.

   2. Now take the second thought with brevity. The Eternal God is our
   mansion, our dwelling, our abiding place. The children of Israel had no
   other and therefore if God were not their dwelling place, they were
   houseless. Pilgrims of the weary foot. They found no city to dwell in.
   At eventide they pitched their tents but they struck them again in the
   morning. The trumpet sounded and they were up and away. If they were in
   a comfortable valley for one day, yet that relentless trumpet bade them
   resume their wearisome march through the wilderness in the morning.
   And, perhaps they thought they lingered the longest where an encampment
   was least desirable. Nevertheless they always had a dwelling place in
   their God.

   If I might use such a description without seeming to be fanciful, I
   would say that the great cloudy canopy which covered them all day long
   from the heat of the sun was their roof--and that the blazing pillar
   which protected them by night was their family fireside. God Himself
   dwelt in the very midst of them in the bright shining light, the
   Shekinah, within the holy place and up from the very spot there rose
   the great pillar which was cloud by day and fire by night. And so,
   within the compass of God's protecting Presence they found a perpetual
   abode. So Moses sings, "Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all
   generations."

   Wherever they were, if they were but under the shadow of that cloud
   they were quite at home and whenever they got within the radius of the
   bright pillar of fire, they felt that they were not away from the
   family circle. Now I hope that many of us can say that the Eternal God
   is our dwelling place--

   "Home, home, Sweethome,
   There's noplace like home," says the song, and certainly, if God is our
   home, the song has a depth of sweetness in it. At home one feels safe.
   An Englishman's house is his castle--who shall intrude upon him there?
   When the bolt is drawn, when the curtains are drawn, when the family
   gathers round the fireside, then we have shut the world and all our
   enemies' babbling tongues out and we dwell in quiet.
   So when we get to our God, not bolts of brass nor gates of iron could
   guard God's people so well as that wall of fire which Jehovah is to all
   His chosen. When we draw near to God in sweet communion we feel as if
   the devil himself were dumb--
   "Then, let the earth's old pillars shake, And all the wheels of Nature
   break. Our steadfast souls shall fear no more, Than solid rocks when
   billows roar."

   At home, too, we take our rest. Out in the world, in the workshop, we
   toil until the sweat streams from our face. In the pulpit, in the midst
   of our congregations, our mind is so active and on the alert that the
   brain is often wearied. But at home we cast ourselves down upon the
   couch and feel that now the day's work is over and that the happy
   evening of rest has come.

   When I get to my God, no servile works have I to do--no hewing of wood
   and drawing of water, like a Gibeonite, in God's house! But here I am,
   His servant, happy in His service and finding sweet rest in what I do
   for Him. "We that have believed, do enter into rest," and there is a
   peace which, "passes all understanding, which keeps our heart and mind,
   through Christ Jesus." At home we let our hearts loose. We cast aside
   all dignity there--we are no longer on our guard like men in armor. We
   are not afraid that our children will misunderstand us, or that our
   dear ones will misconstrue our words and sentiments. We feel at ease.

   So is it when we are with our God. I dare tell Him what I dare not tell
   anyone else. There is no secret of my heart which I would not pour into
   His ear. There is no wish that might be deemed foolish or ambitious by
   others which I would not communicate to Him. Surely, if "the secret of
   the Lord is with them that fear Him," the secrets of them that fear Him
   ought to be, and must be with their Lord. It is at home, if anywhere,
   that a man is thoroughly happy and delighted. He takes his soul's best
   solace there. His eyes sparkle most at his own fireside. Whatever the
   man may be abroad with all his cares and his troubles, he can't wait to
   get home, as going to the place of his delight.

   So I trust it is with us and our God. We go out, like Noah's dove. With
   weary wings we fly over the watery waste, ready to drop. But we come
   back again, like that same dove, into Noah's hand and there we find our
   resting place forever. It is for home that a man works and labors. I am
   sure when I see the workers filling the streets, just when work is
   over, that the most of them have a home to go to for the sake of which
   they toil. What makes that man work so hard? Why, there are three
   little ones at home who must be fed! How is it that he is content to go
   through so much toil? There is a wife at home dear to his soul and for
   her and the babes he fights the battle of life bravely.

   Be it ever so homely. Be it up ever so many pairs of stairs, yet the
   thought of that little room and of the dear ones there at home gives
   strength to the man to bear his burden and helps his fingers to fly the
   quicker over his work. In this sense, too, I think we can say that our
   gracious God is our home, our mansion. The love of God strengthens us.
   We do but think of Him in the Person of His dear Son and a glimpse of
   the suffering face of the Redeemer constrains us to labor. We feel that
   we must work, for we have brethren yet to be saved! We have uncalled
   ones yet to be brought in! We have the head of Christ to crown--we have
   the Father's heart to make glad by bringing home to Him His wayward and
   wandering sons.

   We will pause here and see if we can say, "Yes, 'tis true, Lord. You
   are, as the Eternal God, our mansion and dwelling place." I pray, dear
   Friends, do not say this in words unless you know in truth that the
   Eternal God is your dwelling place.

   3. We must be very brief on the third part of this present
   privilege--"Underneath are the everlasting arms." This means that God
   is our support, and our support just when we begin to sink. We want
   support when we are sinking and by the arms being "underneath," it
   seems that this support is given just when we are going down. At
   certain seasons the Christian sings very low in humiliation. He has a
   deep sense of his own sin. He is humbled before God till he scarcely
   knows how to lift up his face and pray because he appears, in his own
   sight, so abject, so mean, so base, so worthless.

   Well, Child of God, remember that when you are at your worst, yet
   "underneath you are the everlasting arms." Christ's Atonement dives
   deeper than your sin. Sin may sink you ever so low, but the great
   Atonement is still under all! I will give you a text which proves it.
   "He is able to save unto the uttermost them that come unto God by Him."
   You may have gone very low, but you can never have gone so low as, "the
   uttermost." Here is another. "All manner of sin and of iniquity shall
   be forgiven unto men." You have plunged into nearly all sorts of sin,
   but you have not gone into, "all manner of sin." Or if you have, it may
   be forgiven so that this promise goes underneath you. The love of God,
   the power of the blood and the prevalence of the intercession are
   deeper down than sin with all its Hell-born vileness can ever sink the
   sinner while breath is in his nostrils

   Again, the Christian sometimes sinks very deeply in sore trials from
   without. He loses his property. His children die. His wife is carried
   to the grave--every earthly prop is cut away. What then? He goes down,
   down, down--yet still underneath him are the everlasting arms! You
   cannot sink so deep in distress and affliction, but what the Covenant
   Grace of an ever-faithful God will be still lower than you are--even
   when at your very lowest! Look at your Savior--you are never so low as
   He was. Perhaps you cannot pay your rent and you are to be turned out
   of that little room--this is falling low, indeed. But what did your
   Savior say--"Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but
   I, the Son of Man, have not where to lay My head."

   I have supposed you to be in a very sad case, but, you see, underneath
   you there are the sufferings of Christ. Perhaps your friends have
   forsaken you. Yes, but hear Him--"He that eats bread with Me has lifted
   up his heel against Me." He is deeper in the mire than you. You are
   very, very, very poor, but see, there He hangs upon the Cross--stripped
   naked, without a rag to cover Him--deserted by all. You have gone very
   far, but not so far as that. Jesus represents the great goodness of God
   in its communion with your need and in Him your God puts underneath you
   His everlasting arms.

   Possibly you are sinking very deep down, under trouble from within. You
   have felt such vexatious of spirit as you never thought you could have
   known. You have waged such a conflict as you never dreamed of. The
   fountains of the great deep have been broken up. And, as a deluge, sin
   threatens to cover your spirit and drown all the life in your heart.
   Beloved, you cannot, even there, be brought so low as Christ was, for
   what did He say--"My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"

   God is still with you to be your succor and if you have lost the light
   of your Father's countenance, yet you have not lost it to so great an
   extent as your Savior did. You have not yet sweat "great drops of
   blood." You have not yet prayed with strong crying and tears and found
   that the cup could not be removed altogether. You have not yet
   descended into the depths, as your Savior did. And so we will take it
   for granted that underneath you, wherever you may be, there are the
   everlasting arms. I think I see the devil trying to drown a Believer,
   but underneath are the everlasting arms. Satan says, "I will have him
   yet," and down he dives lower still--but the everlasting arms are even
   there.

   Why, look what he did with Jonah. He got him into the whale's belly,
   but he was not content with that. The whale, of course, was near the
   surface when it first sucked Jonah in. But it goes down, perhaps half a
   mile--it must go deeper yet and so it stirs up the deep in its pain,
   for it has an indigestible morsel within and it does not know what to
   do with it. It plunges down, down, DOWN, till Jonah says he went to the
   bottoms of the mountains and the weeds were wrapped about his head and
   the earth with her bars was about him forever--yet even then,
   "underneath were the everlasting arms," and therefore the whale comes
   up and Jonah stands upon the dry land once more! So shall it be with
   you, Beloved, for in your worst trials and times of difficulty
   underneath you are the everlasting arms!

   And this, also, I may give you by way of comfort in any weary labors in
   which you may be engaged. There are some of God's servants who feel as
   if they would willingly die--for to serve God, though very pleasant--is
   at times very hard work. And when one is sincere in God's service and
   is ready to drop, one will cry out, "Oh, when shall the day of rest
   come?" Courage, courage, you fainting soldier! Underneath are the
   everlasting arms--you shall have strength equal to your day! Your shoes
   shall be iron and brass! You shall end your journey well and you shall
   fight the fight till the victory comes.

   At last, when death comes, the promise shall still hold good. We shall
   stand in the midst of Jordan and, like poor Christian, it is possible
   that we may begin to sink--but may we have some Hopeful with us then,
   to say, as Hopeful did to Christian, "Be of good cheer, my Brother. I
   feel the bottom, it is good"--for underneath us there will be the
   everlasting arms. You may be full of pain and anguish and the spirit
   may sink into a spiritual death even before the natural death comes on.
   You may feel dying to be dreadful work. But still, if the worst should
   come to worst--you shall yet in the hour of extremity win the victory!
   You shall triumph over death and enter into the Presence of God and
   bless His name because, "underneath you are the everlasting arms."

   I can scarcely venture on the second part of my subject tonight at all,
   for we have not done with the first point. I wish you to notice those
   two phrases which are the pith of the text. "The Eternal God."
   "Everlasting arms." "The Eternal God." Here is antiquity. The God who
   was before all worlds is forever my God. Oh, how I love that word,
   "eternal"! But, Brothers and Sisters, there are some people who do not
   believe in an Eternal God. At any rate they do not believe in Him as
   being theirs eternally. They do not believe that they belonged to
   Christ before they were born. They have a notion that they only had God
   to be theirs when they believed on Him for the first time. They do not
   believe in Covenant settlements and eternal decrees and the ancient
   purposes of the Most High.

   But let me say that for comfort there is no thought more full of
   sweetness than that of an Eternal God engaged in Christ Jesus to His
   people to love and bless and save them all! One who has made them the
   distinguished objects of His discriminating regard from all eternity.
   It is the ETERNAL God. And then there are the "everlasting arms"--arms
   that will never drop, arms that will never grow weary, arms that will
   never lose their strength. They put the two words, "eternal," and,
   "everlasting," together and they remind us of another sweet
   word--immutability. An everlasting God that faints not, neither is
   weary, that changes not and turns not from His promise. Such is the God
   we delight to adore and to use as our eternal shelter, our dwelling
   place and our support.

   II. The second part of the subject, AS TO THE FUTURE, I cannot dwell
   upon for want of time but only give you an outline of what one might
   have said upon it if there had been opportunity. He who has been our
   God in the past will certainly be our God in the future! And in the
   future we have two things to comfort us--Divine work, and we have a
   Divine command. Here is the Divine work--He will thrust out our enemies
   before us. Whatever your difficulties may be, whatever your sins may be
   against which you have to contend, remember, Jehovah leads the van and
   crushes your foes before you come to them.

   You have to fight, Christian, with vanquished enemies and it is an easy
   thing when you have to overcome a dragon who has had his head broken
   already by your risen Lord. Therefore Dr. Watts makes us sing for our
   comfort--

   "Hell and your sins resist your course,
   But Hell and sin are vanquished foes!
   Your Savior nailed them to the Cross,
   And sung the triumph when He rose."

   Before you get to your difficulties, your God will have removed them.
   The stone was laid at the mouth of the sepulcher and the women said,
   "Who shall roll away the stone?" But when they arrived at the spot they
   found that the stone had been rolled away by an angel long before.

   March on, Christian--the Jordan may be very deep--but as soon as the
   feet of God's priests touch the border of the river it shall be dried
   up! You shall have before you ten thousand things which may appall you,
   but if you will but go on in the strength of faith, they shall prove to
   be but the shadows which disappear when the sun rises. There is Divine
   work always going on before God's people--His shield always goes in
   front--His sword always cuts and clears the way and we have but to
   follow where He leads. When the children of Israel passed over Jordan,
   the priests who bore the ark first dipped their feet in the stream and
   it parted before the servants of the Lord because God was between the
   cherubim.

   So in every crossing which lies in the path to the city of our God,
   that better city, Jerusalem the golden, we see the footprints of one
   who is our Priest--touched with a sense of our infirmities and griefs
   because He has endured the same before us! It is He who has planted His
   feet in the darkest depths and made a path through the mightiest waters
   so that we need not fear--but may boldly plunge in--assured that we
   only follow Him whose Presence will ever enable us to say, "Though I
   walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil,
   for You are with me, Your rod and Your staff they comfort me."

   We follow the Captain of our salvation who says, "Come on, follow Me."
   He goes before. Every dart that wounds you passes by Him. Yes, He has
   felt the first smart of each poisoned arrow in the devil's quiver and
   the venomous power has been washed away in His blood. There is not a
   weapon in Hell's armory whose edge has not been turned on the armor of
   our great Champion. The keenness of every blade is gone since it was
   buried in His wounds. When Jacob wrestled with the nameless one till
   the break of day, he came out of the contest with one sinew withered so
   that he limped to his grave. And thus each of our foes has received a
   touch from the finger of Him, "who comes up from Edom with dyed
   garments from Bozrah, traveling in the greatness of His strength."

   And that touch has crippled the power of our enemies. They are spoiled
   and robbed of much of their satanic might because they have been
   beneath the heel of Him who has trod down all our foes beneath His
   feet. Still, we are not to be idle, for we have next a Divine command.
   He shall thrust out our enemies, but He will also say, "Destroy them."
   We have to take God's Word and to be obedient to it in the future.
   Whatever sins we have, there is only one thing to be done with them and
   that is to "destroy them."

   A man has a number of faults and he says, "Well, Sir, there is my
   drunkenness and my swearing and so on. I am quite agreeable to what you
   say, I will destroy them. I will hang them on a gallows as high as that
   on which Haman would have hanged Mordecai. But, Sir, I have little a
   trick in my trade--I should not like to tell everybody of it--it is a
   very profitable one and I do not think it is so very bad, for nearly
   everybody else in the trade does it. Do you not think the best way
   would be to practice it and give part of the money I get by it to God's
   cause? I will be very careful and do it only when compelled."

   My dear Friend, I have only one thing to say to you about your sin and
   that is, "destroy it!" Do not try to make it better, to dress it up,
   swear it in and make a soldier of it for Christ--no--destroy it! This
   is your work. If your eyes offend you, "pluck them out." "Oh," says
   another, "but I have a very bad temper. I sometimes fly into a passion.
   I think I must try to get over it by degrees, but still I can make a
   great many excuses for myself and am I not quite right in doing so?" My
   dear Sir, I can only say one thing and that is, "destroy it," for the
   only proper treatment of sin is to cut it off and cast it from you. Do
   not pamper it or excuse it, but destroy it! Smite it to the heart if
   you can and never be satisfied till you have utterly destroyed it.

   Look at Saul. He has been against the Amalekites and he brings home a
   very beautiful flock of sheep and bullocks and so on. He is told to
   destroy them all, but he brings them home and Agag with them. Why did
   he not kill Agag? Well, he was such a gentleman, such a thorough
   gentleman, that he did not like to kill him. It was a public duty to
   sweep the commonplace Amalekites out of the way--they were such
   rascals! But this Agag, why, he walked so delicately, he had such a
   nice way with him, he was so winning, he had such an enchanting face,
   had the manners and air, in fact, of an Israelite--it would be a pity,
   a great pity to kill him!

   So Saul brought home the best of the sheep and the beasts and the
   cattle and Agag with them. But Samuel comes in and is in no sweet mood
   when he hears the bleating of the sheep. He demands of Saul--"Have you
   done as God commanded you?" "Yes I have," said Saul. "Then what mean
   the bleating of the sheep and the lowing of the cattle that I hear?"
   "Oh," said Saul, "I did not slay them all. I thought I had better spare
   some of the best of them as an offering unto God, so I kept them alive
   and I have also kept Agag."

   What came of it? Did the Prophet spare the Amalekite? No, truly! Samuel
   first told Saul that God had put him away from being king and then he
   said, "Bring Agag," and Agag came to him. You can imagine how he would
   come--and he said, "Surely the bitterness of death is past." There he
   stood and I think I see Samuel, getting gray then, very gray and not
   very fit for such service, but he looked for the nearest sword that he
   could get and though it is not a Prophet's work to kill, yet as soon as
   he could grasp a sword he hewed Agag in pieces! He was not content to
   cut his head off, but hewed him in pieces, as a man would chop a block
   of wood--to show the anger and detestation which God had towards the
   most princely sins.

   Now, Christian, your business with sin is in the Spirit's power to
   serve it as Samuel did Agag--to hew it in pieces and show the utmost
   hatred towards it. So far from making excuses for it, seek to devise
   ways by which you may mortify it and put it to death. When the Prophet
   Elijah had received the answer to his prayer and the fire from Heaven
   had consumed the sacrifice in the presence of all the people, he called
   upon the assembled Israelites to take the priests of Baal and, said he,
   "Let not one escape." And he took them all down to the brook Kishon and
   slew them there.

   So must it be with our sins--each one must die--let not one escape!
   Spare it not for its much crying. Strike, though it be a darling sin as
   dear as an Isaac. Strike, for God struck at sin when it was on His Son.
   Even so, with stern unflinching purpose, condemn to death that sin
   which may have been the darling of your heart. Spare it not, because it
   may make sport or be of use in any way. Remember Samson, how he
   gathered strength as his locks grew once more and how he avenged
   himself upon his foes. Beware lest your sins which are only for awhile
   repressed and not totally destroyed, should rise up again and with
   new-found might should hurl you to the ground and bury you in the wreck
   of your noblest hopes and deeds.

   You will probably ask how you will be able to accomplish this work.
   Why, take the promise we have been talking about--"The eternal God is
   your refuge and underneath are the everlasting arms." If you would
   triumph over darkness set yourself in the Presence of the Sun of
   Righteousness. There is no place so well adapted for the discovery of
   sin, and recovery from its power and guilt, as the immediate Presence
   of God. Get into God's arms and you will see how to hit at sin and will
   gather strength to give the final blow which shall lay the monster in
   the dust. Job never knew how to get rid of sin half so well as he did
   when his eye of faith rested on God and he abhorred himself and
   repented in dust and ashes.

   The fine gold of the Christian is often becoming dim and the spots will
   appear upon the surface showing that we dwell among the sons of earth
   in a world which lies in the Wicked One. We want some sacred fire which
   shall consume away the dross and give us back the brightness we have
   lost. Go to God, He is a consuming fire--not to your spirit--but to
   your sins. You may so plead the work of Christ and the Covenant of
   Grace as to make the very Nature of God, which would condemn you out of
   Christ, to cleanse you, being in Christ Jesus!

   You will be sanctified by the God who would have destroyed you had you
   not fled for refuge to the hope set before you. You have strength to
   overcome sin given you in the Covenant of Grace. You have strength to
   drive out your own iniquities. You have strength to win battles for
   your Master, because in Christ Jesus He has promised to be with you
   even unto the end. May the past experience stimulate you to future
   exertion and let the goodness of God excite you to a sacred jealousy
   and to a holy revenge against those sins which are hateful in His
   sight. May God bless you, Brethren, for Christ's sake.

                       Jesus Appearing To Mary Magdalene

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 16, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE
   METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, He appeared
   first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven devils.'" Mark
   16:9.

   THE doctrine of a risen Savior is exceedingly precious. The
   Resurrection is the cornerstone of the entire building of Christianity.
   It is the keystone of the arch of our salvation. It would take us many
   a discourse to set forth all the streams of living water which flow
   from this one sacred source--the Resurrection of our dear Lord and
   Savior Jesus Christ. But to know that He has risen and to have
   fellowship with Him as such--communing with the risen Savior by
   possessing a risen life! Seeing Him leave the tomb by leaving the tomb
   of worldliness ourselves--this is even more precious!

   The doctrine is the basis of the experience, but as the flower is more
   lovely than the root, so is the experience of fellowship with the risen
   Savior more lovely than the doctrine itself. I would have you believe
   that Christ rose from the dead so as to sing of it and derive all the
   consolation which it is possible for you to extract from this
   well-ascertained and well-witnessed fact. But I beseech you rest not
   content even there.

   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, I bid you aspire to see Christ Jesus by
   the eye of faith, and though you may not touch Him, yet may you be
   privileged to converse with Him and to know that He is risen--you
   yourselves being risen in Him to newness of life. To know a crucified
   Savior as having crucified all my sins is a rich kind of knowledge. And
   to know a risen Savior as having justified me and to realize that He
   has bestowed upon me new life, given me to be a new creature through
   His own newness of life--this is a high style of experience. Short of
   it, none of us ought to be satisfied to rest.

   In fine, I would have you this morning, like the blessed Magdalene,
   among those to whom Jesus Christ should manifest Himself after His
   Resurrection, as He does not unto the world. Let us come at once to the
   consideration of this first appearance of the Savior after He had left
   the tomb. He appears to Mary Magdalene. There must have been some
   reason for the choice. We shall notice first of all, who she was. Then,
   how she sought. And, thirdly, how she found.

   I. First we shall have to take into consideration this morning who SHE
   WAS. Jesus "appeared first to Mary Magdalene." Why? One answer might be
   because He chose to do so. For in His sovereignty He may reveal Himself
   to whomever He wills and He may withhold Himself from whomever He shall
   please. "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have
   compassion on whom I will have compassion," may be a very grating truth
   to human ears, but it is a Truth of God for all that and he who does
   not acknowledge it scarcely puts God into His true place as sitting
   upon the Throne and doing as He wills with His own.

   I should be content to know that He appeared to Mary Magdalene first
   and not to ask another question if I thought it unwise to ask it, for
   "He is the Lord and let Him do what seems Him good." And if He will
   reveal Himself first to her, let it be so. Here I see His Grace and
   say, let His name be magnified in the sovereignty of His love. But we
   may go a little further into the matter, I think, and perhaps find some
   reasons. He revealed Himself first to Mary Magdalene, a woman. Was it
   not most meet that a woman should first see the risen Savior? She was
   first in the transgression--let her be first in the justification.

   In yon garden she was first to work our woe--let her in that other
   garden be the first to see Him who works our weal. She takes the apple
   of that bitter tree which brings us all our sorrow--let her be the
   first to see that mighty Gardener who has planted a tree which brings
   forth fruit unto everlasting life! A woman let it be, for woman was
   last at the Cross and last at the sepulcher--let her be earliest to
   return. The Marys embalmed the Savior and put Him into the tomb--let
   one of their company be selected to be the first to see Him. Sisters in
   Christ Jesus, there is a curse which falls more heavily on you than on
   others--a curse which is peculiar to you. But here you have reason to
   rejoice since, "Unto you a Child is born, unto you a Son is given."

   It is by that child-bearing which brings you sorrow that we have been
   delivered--even through the birth of Him, the Messiah, Emmanuel, God
   with us--whom you are privileged first to see because He is peculiarly
   yours. "The Seed of the woman who shall bruise the serpent's head." The
   text seems to indicate that the particular reason why He appeared to
   this woman first was because out of her He had cast seven devils.
   Perhaps no person mentioned in the Scripture has been more singularly
   slandered than Mary Magdalene. It has been supposed that she was a
   harlot and her name has been appended to societies which have the
   merciful object of endeavoring to reclaim the fallen.

   In that sense let me say Magdalene never was a "Magdalen." She was not
   an unchaste woman. I think I can show you that it is quite impossible
   that she could have been. She was a woman of substance and ministered
   to Christ's necessities. She was possessed of wealth and property and
   spent what she had upon the Savior and was not likely, therefore, to
   have been one who earned her living by the pitiful trade of her sin.
   Moreover, she had seven devils and that, of itself, rendered her
   utterly incapable, one would think, of having been guilty of the sins
   of the flesh. A woman, a demoniac, mad with seven devils! Who would
   dream that a poor creature under so dreadful a torture as this could
   have been a harlot?

   The thing is clearly impossible to any thoughtful mind. But mark you, I
   believe if Magdalene were here herself, she would not regret that her
   pure name has been appended to these poor fallen ones. Here she has
   communion with her Lord and Master who was, "numbered with the
   transgressors," and who gave Himself and all that He had in order that
   He might lift poor sinners from the degradation into which they had
   fallen. "No," Magdalene would say, "do not blot my name off from yonder
   building. Do not take it from that Rescue Society. I, though I have
   been kept from this iniquity, am well content to be the patron of all
   those who seek to win sinners from their sin."

   Nevertheless, there is this about it--and here is where the mistake
   first arose--the possession of a devil is typical, in the Word of God,
   of sin. When we want to translate the miracle into spiritual meaning we
   are always compelled to use the indwelling of a devil to be the
   metaphor--the picture of the indwelling of sin. Now as Mary Magdalene
   had seven devils, though she was not, therefore, any the greater sinner
   for she could not help the devils being there, yet she was thereby the
   more polluted. She was sevenfold polluted and she becomes most rightly
   the type of the great sinner, the representative, in fact, of the very
   class of sinners to whom her name has been given.

   She was not literally such a sinner, but she was typically so, for in
   her there were seven devils. Typically she stands at the head of those
   who are the greatest of all sinners against the Law and goodness and
   Grace of God, but she was not so except as a type. Now I think you see
   some reason why she should be selected as the first one to be seen by
   Christ, because she had been a special trophy of Christ's delivering
   power. In her He had won a special and signal victory over the hosts of
   Hell--a perfect number of those evil spirits had been entrenched within
   her and Christ's victorious arm had driven them all out. She would ever
   be regarded as a most illustrious specimen of what the great Savior can
   achieve. In this sense, I say, she was fitted to be the first that
   Jesus Christ should look upon and speak to. Out of all His disciples
   who were daily with Him I know not of one who had experienced such a
   cure as that which had fallen to her lot.

   Let us learn from this, that the greatness of our sin before conversion
   should never make us think that we may not be specially favored with
   the very highest grade of fellowship. If Magdalene were not a harlot,
   yet I say she stands as the type of those who are possessors of seven
   sins and deadly and damnable sins, too. And inasmuch as this woman is
   taken into the most intimate communion with Christ and has the priority
   even above Peter and James and John, there is no reason, poor fallen
   Sinner, why you should not have as rich a feast at the banquet of
   Divine mercy as the very best and most chaste, the most upright, pure
   and clean!

   If you come to Christ, if the seven devils are cast out of you, all
   these things shall never be mentioned against you! No, but you shall
   stand on a par with those who were preserved by Providence and
   restraining Grace from going into gross sins. When the prodigal came
   back he was not told that he might eat his father's bread, but it must
   be in the kitchen. He was not told that he might sit at the table, but
   it must be at the far end, below the salt. No, he sits at the table as
   the most honored guest and his father feasts with him as if he had
   never gone astray! So is it forevermore with my God, to the chief of
   sinners.

   You shall not be permitted to eat the crumbs that fall from the table,
   but the daintiest viands shall be yours! Yes, and if you wish it and
   will press forward and seek it, you shall have Benjamin's mess--you
   shall have more than others. Oh, though you have been black and vile,
   He can make you so white and fair that He will not blush to treat you
   as the man in the parable did his little ewe lamb. You shall drink of
   His cup and sleep in His bosom and be very, very dear to Him, sin- ner
   though you have been. This seems to be upon the very surface of the
   text, that Mary Magdalene was selected to be the first to see the
   Savior because she was a woman--a woman out of whom seven devils had
   been cast--a type of a great sinner.

   Again, she was a woman in whom mighty Grace had proved its power. It is
   a well known fact that devils never went out of men willingly in the
   Savior's day. They had always to be cast out. You find them foaming at
   the mouth as soon as Christ is seen and when He says, "I command you to
   come out of him," the devil tears the man, rolls him in the dust and
   subjects him to unusual spasms of pain and agony before he will depart.
   Thus seven devils had been driven out of Mary-- forced out of her. Mary
   was no free-willer. Her deliverance was achieved by irresistible,
   eternal, sovereign Grace. And surely those are privileged to see most
   of Christ who know that their salvation is not of man, neither by man,
   but by the will and power of the gracious God alone!

   My Brothers and Sisters, there may be some of you who think that the
   devils went out of you--I know they did not go out of me. They had to
   be driven out with a strong hand and an outstretched arm. There may be
   some who boast of the freeness of their wills who think that they can
   come to Christ of themselves--but Mary did not--for no demoniacs ever
   sought to find Christ. They rather shunned the Presence of the Savior,
   and cried, "What have we to do with You? Are You come to torment us
   before the time?" We rather hated Divine Grace and despised Christ.
   Offers of mercy were lost upon us. Proclamations of pardon, though
   honestly given, we trampled under foot. It was only when the mighty
   Jesus, dressed in robes of love, came forth in the greatness of His
   strength that we were compelled to yield and our captivity was led
   captive by His might!

   I think that Mary Magdalene was thus selected because she was a choice
   instance of Irresistible Grace. As soon as the devils were cast out of
   Mary she appears to have left whatever her earthly position may have
   been and to have become a constant attendant on the Savior. If you will
   kindly turn to the eighth chapter of Luke you will see that our Lord
   was attended not only by men, but by women. "It came to pass afterward,
   that He went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing
   the glad tidings of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with Him
   and certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and
   infirmities--Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils, and
   Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna and many
   others, which ministered unto Him of their substance."

   It appears, then, that Magdalene was one who abode with Christ
   Jesus--His perpetual and constant companion. Some heard Him
   occasionally--she heard Him always. Mary and Martha and Lazarus
   entertained Him with a feast now and then--she was always giving Him of
   her substance. There were many like Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea
   who were on Christ's side, but did not take up Christ's Cross--she did.
   In all His afflictions she was afflicted. When He was "despised and
   rejected of men," so was she. She was with Him, bearing His Cross and
   suffering His reproach.

   I like the thought of her being with the Savior. How much she must have
   seen! She saw the most of His miracles. How much she must have heard!
   She heard, with her own ears, His choice words. Yes, and in the secret
   conclave where He opened up His parable to His favored disciples, Mary
   was privileged to be there with a few other honorable women. I suppose
   her to have been a woman of ripe years, as probably most of the others
   were--a matron. She was neglecting no household duties. It is clear she
   never had any--a woman with seven devils could not have had domestic
   duties.

   One would think her friends must have been exceedingly glad to have her
   under the teaching of our Lord. And so long as they knew that she was
   in health with the Savior, they probably thought her to be in the place
   most fitting for her, as mad people are supposed to be most fitly
   attended when they are accompanied by their keeper or their physician.
   Having been a demoniac, she was happily freed from all household ties
   and bonds. And now what if I say that Christ was her father, her
   brother, her husband, her friend, her children, her everything? He was
   her family and there was she, daily with Him.

   We read that when Christ preached a certain Truth, "many of His
   disciples went back and walked no more with Him." Not so the Magdalene.
   Let Him preach whatever He might, the woman of Magdala still hung upon
   His lips. To her, every word was honey, every syllable was a pearl. She
   treasured all, she fed upon all--she abided with Jesus. O dear Friends,
   I wish we could get into this position--when our calling should be to
   serve Christ and when our place should be always with Christ. I do not
   wonder that Christ appeared first to her when I recollect that Christ
   had so long been her first, her chief delight. She had nothing in the
   world but Christ. It strikes me that very likely her being a demoniac
   had so separated her from all human sympathy that there were none that
   loved her, none that cared for her except the disci- ples and the
   society she had found through being a follower of Christ. And Jesus,
   pitying her, would not send her away as He did the most of those whom
   He cured.

   One thing we must not pass over--she spent her substance in relieving
   His needs. The bag was not often full, while Judas had the keeping of
   it. And while there were so many poor and Christ had such a tender
   heart, I will be bound to say that no surplus was ever allowed to mold
   there. But this woman and the other Marys took care that it should
   never be quite empty and that there should be something for the Savior
   when He needed it. She was not the woman who broke the alabaster box of
   precious ointment over Christ's head, but her whole life long her
   constant income was her alabaster box and she spent what she had in
   ministering to the needs of her Lord.

   Brothers and Sisters, if we would see much of Christ, let us serve Him.
   Depend upon it, you that live unto your-selves--that save your wealth
   when you ought to give it--you are not indulged with that fellowship
   with Jesus which others have who have consecrated themselves and their
   substance wholly to the Lord. I am sure that by not giving you miss
   infinite pleasure. I speak not now concerning your safety--I believe
   you are saved through faith in Christ Jesus-- but if you do not devote
   yourselves and all that you have to the Master's cause, you never will
   be admitted to those choicer joys, to those more intimate fellowships
   which belong to those who live close to their Savior in consecration.

   Find me the happiest Christians and I am sure they are those who are
   most attached to their Lord. Tell me who they are that sit most often
   under the banner of His love and drink the deepest draughts from the
   cup of communion and I am sure they will be those who give most, who
   serve best, and who abide closest to the bleeding heart of their dear
   Lord. Perhaps for this reason Mary was privileged by the Grace of God
   to be the first to see the risen Savior.

   II. The second enquiry was, HOW SHE SOUGHT. If any of us would have
   fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ, how are we to obtain it? We will
   use her as our guide. And first Mary sought the Savior very early in
   the morning, by which we learn when we must, many times, begin to seek
   our Lord. If you can wait for Christ and be patient in the hope of
   having fellowship with Him by-and-by, you will never have fellowship at
   all--for the heart that is fitted for communion is a hungering and a
   thirsting heart.

   If a man is hungry, you cannot say to him, "Be patient. Wait!" "My
   hunger craves," he says, "give me food. I shall die if I am not fed."
   "But you must not be impatient. You must curb your appetite. Wait, be
   still." But the poor man replies, "I cannot! My hunger is so sharp. Oh,
   give me bread or I famish! I will die!" You may reason with him, but
   there is no reasoning with a hungry stomach. And when a man's soul
   begins to hunger and thirst after Christ, it is not, "Tomorrow I will
   see Him," but, "now! Now! Now!" Today, which God calls, "the accepted
   time," the Christian thinks to be the most acceptable time. I would
   have fellowship with Jesus now.

   While standing on this platform my eyes desire to see Him. My head
   longs to place itself upon His bosom. My soul would cry with the
   spouse, "Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth, for His love is
   better than wine." If, then, you want Jesus to reveal Himself to you,
   seek Him now, where you are. This pew may be as good as the garden.
   Your own little quiet room, when the service is over, will be quite as
   near to the Savior as was the sepulcher--only seek Him at once and
   suffer no delays. Come, Jesus come, for the night is far spent! Arise
   great Sun of Righteousness and chase my gloom away!

   She sought Him also, as you will observe, with very great boldness. It
   is said she stood at the sepulcher. The disciples had fled. Read the
   eighth verse, "They went out quickly and fled from the sepulcher, for
   they trembled and were amazed. And they said nothing to anyone, for
   they were afraid." But Mary, we are told in John's account, "stood" at
   the sepul-cher. "They may run who will," she said. "Nothing can
   frighten me when I seek the Lord." There go the women--Mary and Susanna
   the wife of Chuza. There they go, all frightened. There is Peter, the
   bold Peter--he takes to his heels! And even John, the loving John,
   follows after him!

   But Mary stands still. "No," she says, "let the worst come that can,
   nothing can be worse than losing my Master--if death itself should drag
   me away it can only take me into the sepulcher where my Savior went and
   perhaps I might find Him there. And if so, death were welcome!"
   Consider how many fears this timid woman must have had. It is not
   always safe to go abroad early in the morning. Certainly it was not in
   the city of Jerusalem, when the city was crowded, for a feeble woman to
   rise early in the morning and go out to the tomb! And yet she was not
   afraid.

   Let the shadows of the morning be still on the earth--she heeds them
   not. The shadows in her own soul are worse to her. You might have
   supposed she would have fears of the angels. She was not. She had had
   dealings with devils and she was not to be frightened by angels. Seven
   devils at once dwelt in her. She knew too much of the supernatural to
   be frightened at the fall of a leaf or any noise that might make her
   weaker companions turn pale. If, then, you would have Christ to be with
   you, seek Him boldly, Beloved. Let nothing hold you back. Defy the
   world! Dare its pleasures! Laugh at its threats! Despise its promises.
   Count that "the reproach of Christ is greater riches than the treasures
   of Egypt." Press on where others flee! Be like a lion where others turn
   their backs and Christ will then show Himself to you.

   She stood at the sepulcher. She sought Christ very faithfully. Some
   find it hard to stand by a living Savior, but she will stand by a dead
   one. All the disciples forsook Him and fled when He was only in
   captivity--but she cleaves to Him when His body is in the sepulcher.
   Brave woman! You will not only stand by the Master, but by the Master's
   sepulcher. True heroine! You love even the couch where His dead form
   sleeps. I would that we sought Christ after this mode, willing to stand
   by the very form of sound words which has been delivered to
   us--standing by the doctrine as well as by the Person--cleaving and
   clinging to the very least thing that has to do with Christ and feeling
   that if He has sanctioned it, it is ours to die for the sepulcher as
   well as for the Man.

   Oh, if we sought Christ with such faithfulness we should not long lack
   the comfort of His Presence! Still note further that John tells us she,
   "stood outside the sepulcher weeping," which makes me remark that she
   sought Jesus very earnestly, for as she stood there, not finding Him,
   she wept. I do not read that the others did this. They loved the
   Savior, but they did not love Him as much. At any rate, they had not
   her sensitiveness and delicacy of soul. She wept. I think I know why
   she wept. "My Savior is gone," she said, "I cannot find Him." Then the
   thoughts of His sad death came rushing full upon her soul.

   She thought she saw that dreadful scene over again that had made her
   heart ache and throb. She fancied she saw Him again dragged through the
   howling populace, abused and despised with His poor back all covered
   with gore. She thought she beheld once more that blessed body torn with
   the nails. She marked again the anguish of the fever which came upon
   Him as He hung upon the tree. She had been the last to watch Him. She
   stood and watched Him with the other women and now she cannot bear the
   thought of all that He has suffered and the fear that He has gone,
   gone, gone forever! She weeps.

   And the Savior could not bear to see her weep. I think those teardrops
   were as spells that bound the Savior captive and made Him come forth
   and show Himself to her. If you want Christ's Presence, you are sure to
   get it if you weep after it! If you have gone so far that you cannot be
   happy unless He comes and says to you, "You are My beloved"--if you
   cannot be content without a kiss from those dear lips--you will have
   it. He cannot deny those tears--those are heart-breakers to Him--those
   drops shall burn their way into His soul! You shall look into the face
   bedewed with tears and see the loveliness and beauty of Him who was
   "despised and rejected of men," if you stand outside at the sepulcher
   weeping.

   Nor have I quite done. Mary sought him perseveringly, for as she wept
   she stooped down and looked into the sepul-cher. She had been in it and
   found nothing--what made her look again? Have you not, when you have
   been seeking for something which you felt you must find, pulled out a
   drawer and looked through it carefully, turning over everything and
   yet, being exceedingly anxious, you have gone to it once more? You were
   certain the object was not there and yet you were so anxious to find it
   that you looked again and again. And perhaps you returned six or seven
   times to the place which you had searched thoroughly at first, for you
   were so desirous to find it.

   It was so with her. She thought, "perhaps my eyes may have been
   blinded--possibly I may not have looked in the right corner--I will
   look again." And so she stooped down and looked into the sepulcher--the
   tears still flowing from her eyes. This showed her perseverance. Yes,
   and if we would know Christ, He is not to be found by those who merely
   call upon Him once. Cry to Him by the hour together if He comes not to
   you. If going into your chamber once does not give you a sight of
   Jesus, go again, go again, go again! For mark me, if you should be kept
   waiting seven years for an interview with the great King--if you should
   once be favored to see Him--if He shall stretch out the silver scepter
   to you, you will think yourself all too well rewarded!

   A thousand--a million years of seeking would be well repaid by one
   glance from His eyes and one look from His face. Therefore seek
   perseveringly, patiently and anxiously--desiring that the risen Savior
   would manifest Himself to you. We have almost done upon this point but
   we must note that she sought the Savior only. All her thoughts were
   concentrated upon Him. I think if I had been there, I should have been
   greatly gratified with a sight of the angels. It strikes me that I
   should have been observing what were the forms of beauty which angelic
   spirits bear. But she seems to have taken no note of them at all. She
   says to them, "They have taken away my Lord and I know not where they
   have laid Him."

   What cared she for angels? If as many had come as the seventy thousand
   chariots of God they could not have turned away Mary's thoughts from
   Him. To the gardener, her speech is all full of her Lord, "Sir, if you
   have borne Him from here, tell me where you have laid Him and I will
   take Him away." Mary's heart was set on one object. Like an arrow shot
   from the bow she sped right on to the target of her heart's desire.
   And, oh, if Christ is your one and only love, if your heart has cast
   out all rivals, if your spirit seeks Him and cries out for the
   Lord--even for the living God--you shall soon come and appear before
   God.

   To close this point let me say there was much ignorance in Mary. How
   was it that she sought the living among the dead? There was very little
   faith in Mary, for faith would have told her that He had risen again on
   the third day according to His own words. But, oh, there was much love
   and Jesus overlooked her want of knowledge and overlooked her weakness
   of faith because of the strength of her love! It seems to me that she
   loved more than John did, for John says, "Then went in that other
   disciple and he saw and believed." That is right, John! You have most
   faith. He believes and then he goes away expecting he should see what
   he believed. But Mary, though she has far less faith, you will perceive
   has so much love that she will not go away from the sepulcher! She just
   keeps her place there, watching at the post of His door, not satisfied
   till she can see Him.

   What love was this! Brothers and Sisters, if we would see Jesus, we
   must love Him much. I would God I loved Him as my heart desires to love
   Him. I hope you can say--

   "Yes, I love You and adore You. Oh for Grace to love You more!" Let us
   wake ourselves up to greater intensity of affection. He loved us before
   the stars were made. He loved us with His whole heart. He loved us to
   perfection. He loved us unto death. Oh, my cold Heart, why do you not
   melt? Oh, my adamantine Heart, why do you not dissolve? For such love
   as this we ought to give Jesus our warmest affection--blazing like
   coals of juniper! And if we did we should not be long without finding
   Him--for love would find Him out and fetch Him to our arms and we
   should see Him and rejoice in Him!

   III. The last point now comes and that is, HOW SHE FOUND HIM. He was
   present but she could not see Him. Christian, Christ is present here
   this morning though you cannot, perhaps, perceive Him. You have not to
   cry to the Savior to come from Heaven to visit you--"Where two or three
   are met together in My name," He says, "there am I in the midst of
   them." Jesus is here! In these aisles and pews, in this area and these
   galleries--Jesus is here. If you have no communion with Him, Believer,
   it is because unbelief darkens your eyes--or grief, or care, or sin
   makes you blind.

   But Jesus Christ was discovered to Mary by a word. I want you to notice
   that it was not a sermon, it was one word. It was not a long discourse,
   but just one word of two syllables and that not a word of mystery, but
   a simple word--a word, however, which had this about it--it came from
   Jesus' lips! It was personal and went home to her. This is all you
   want, Beloved, this morning. Fifty thousand words from me would only
   weary you! But listen to one word from the lips of the Savior, a
   personal word, waking the recollections of your spirit, proving that He
   remembers you--and cheerfully on the strength of that word your soul
   may stay on earth and finish her threescore years and ten.

   That one word was her own name--"Mary." It was spoken just as she had
   heard it in the days gone by. And oh, if He would speak to me as He has
   spoken at the hill Mizar. If He would say of Himself as He has done in
   days never to be forgotten, "I am your salvation," we should not want
   any more! One word would be enough! Oh, Beloved, keep on seeking Christ
   and you will find Him in a moment! Do not complain if you have not an
   edifying ministry, or because, perhaps this morning the discourse seems
   dull to you. Do not complain because you are lax in prayer and have not
   that enlargement you ought to have in Divine things.

   One word will take you up as on the wings of an eagle and give you joy
   and peace! Notice that as soon as the one word was given, her heart
   owned allegiance by another word. She did not make a long speech. The
   Master's heart was too full to say more than one word and so was hers.
   That one word would naturally be the most fitting for the occasion.
   What, then, is the word which suggests itself as being best adapted to
   a soul in the highest state of devotion? It is a word implying
   obedience. She said, "Master."

   You can never get into a state of mind for which this confession of
   allegiance will be a word too cold. No, when your spirit glows the most
   with heavenly fire, then you will say, "I would serve You living,
   dying. Your love has bound me with cords to the horns of the altar. I
   am Your servant--I am Your servant--You have loosed my bonds." If you
   can say, "Master," this morning, you can say much. If your soul feels
   that His will is your will, that His Law is your love-- that you would,
   if you could--in all things be conformed to His image, then, whether
   you have ecstasies or no ecstasies, whether you have joys or no
   joys--you stand in a happy, holy place!

   He must have said, "Mary," or else she could not have said, "Rabboni."
   After she had confessed allegiance, the next impulse was to seek close
   fellowship. But she made a mistake as most of us would have done--she
   wanted a manifest, carnal fellowship. So she began to clasp Him and to
   hold Him by the feet. And then He said, "Touch Me not." We are apt to
   seek for communion with Christ in a sensuous way. Let us be spiritual,
   Brethren. We shall never have Christ say to us, "Touch Me not," if the
   touch is a touch of faith and love. He only says, "Touch Me not," when
   we want to handle Him with these hands and see Him with these eyes. Let
   us walk by faith and not by sight.

   And then we may take Him in our arms and keep Him there and hold Him
   and not let Him go. And the more endearing we can be with Him
   spiritually, the better He will like it. We must shake off all those
   gross ideas which strive to mix with high and heavenly enjoyment. If
   you feel a panting this morning after near and close communion, do not
   restrain it! Press forward! Put your hands into His side and your
   finger into the print of the nails. I know that worldlings will not
   understand me, but Believers will. Let me assure you there is a
   communion with Christ which is quite as real as if we had the privilege
   which Thomas had.

   My own soul has seen the Savior and talked with Him, though these eyes
   cannot see Him, though these lips cannot speak with Him and these ears
   cannot hear Him! Yet my soul's mouth has kissed Him and my soul's ears
   have heard Him and my heart's mouth has blessed Him ten thousand times!
   And I hope to do it yet again and will never be satisfied until I can
   do it continually. Press on, Beloved--you may say as the Divine Song
   does, "Oh that You were as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my
   mother! When I should find You outside, I would kiss You." Oh, Beloved,
   hold communion with Him! Feed on Him for His flesh is meat, indeed, and
   His blood is drink, indeed.

   Further, we may notice as the result of her finding the Savior, she
   entered in His service, for He said, "Go, tell My Brethren." And away
   she went to tell others that she had found the Savior! If you have the
   privilege of seeing Christ, do not eat the morsel behind the door. Have
   you found honey? Taste it yourself, but go and tell others. You cannot
   have seen much of the Savior unless you desire to let others see Him.
   Your piety is a sham, a flash in the pan, a will-o'-the-wisp if it does
   not lead to practical service.

   Are there not some Mary Magdalenes here who have had seven devils cast
   out of them? You have felt the power of Divine Grace in your heart. You
   love your Savior. You long for communion with Him. My dear Sister, as
   soon as you have fellowship, let me charge you, in the Master's
   name--do not be afraid to speak to others what the Lord shall say in
   private to you. We do not want women to enter the pulpit--that is a
   violation both of Divine Grace and Nature--it is as much an offense to
   good manners as it is to God's own Law. But you have your own sphere,
   you have your own place of work--you can gather your own sex about you.
   There are your children, your servants. You have multitudes of
   opportunities.

   Tell others that Jesus has risen, that there is a risen life--that you
   know it and that you pant and long that others, too, should rise from
   the grave of sin to the new life in Jesus! As for you, men and
   Brothers, to whom it pertains more particularly to be teachers and
   pastors, I charge you, whatever you have found within the circle of
   fire where the closest communion is. Whatever you have seen in the deep
   mines of mystery, whatever Christ has revealed to you in hours of
   retirement when you have come nearest to Him--tell it to His family,
   feed His flock with it--bring forth these things as choice dainties
   where the beloved of the Lord may feast even to the full. "Go, tell my
   Brethren," said Christ, and so say we.

   When the two disciples had journeyed to Emmaus, and at the evening meal
   after the toil of the day's journey was over, were resting themselves,
   you remember that the mysterious stranger who had so enchanted them
   with His holy words took bread and broke it. And then it was known to
   them in the breaking of the bread--but He vanished out of their sight!
   Well, what happened then? They had constrained Him to enter in and
   abide with them because the day was far spent, but though now, much
   later, their love was a lamp to their feet! Yes, wings also, for they
   forgot the darkness and their despair. Their weariness was all gone and
   immediately they began to journey back the threescore furlongs to tell
   the gladsome news of a risen Lord who had appeared to them by the way!

   They reach the body of Christians in Jerusalem and are received by a
   burst of joyful news--before they can tell their own tale. Now,
   Brethren, these early Christians were all on fire to speak of Christ's
   Resurrection and to proclaim what they knew of the Lord. They made
   common property of their experiences. And so ought we to do. John's
   account of the sepulcher needs to be supplemented by Peter, and Mary
   can speak of something further still. Combined, we have a full
   testimony and nothing can be spared. Thus we have all peculiar gifts
   and special manifestations, but the one object God has in view is the
   benefit of the whole body of Christ. We must therefore bring our
   possessions and lay them at the Apostles' feet and make distribution
   unto all of what God has given to us.

   Keep back no part of the precious Truth of God, but speak what you know
   and testify what you have seen. Let not the toil, or darkness, or
   possible unbelief of your hearers weigh one moment in the scale. Up and
   be marching to the place of duty and there tell what great things God
   has shown to your soul! And if you hear the sweet words of Christ, I
   can promise you a holy flame of bright and beaming joy as you speak of
   the Truth of God to benefit the souls of others.

   Finally, if there are any enquirers here, as I hope there are--if you
   are seeking Jesus this morning and want to be saved by Him and through
   Him--remember, poor Enquirer, that Jesus is near you now. There is
   nothing for you to do! No climbing to Heaven, no going down to the
   depths to bring Him up. He is near you now. If you believe that Jesus
   is the Christ, if you trust your soul to Him, you are saved! Jesus is
   here to everyone who will simply give himself up to Him to be saved by
   Him. Jesus calls you this morning by your name--He gives you a special
   invitation to come to Him. Listen to that name! Respond this
   morning--say, "Master."

   Take Jesus to be your Lord--He deserves it. You are not your own, but
   you are bought with a price. Give yourself, as a blood-bought one, up
   to Him. He asks you as He asks Mary, "Woman, why do you weep?" He asks
   of each of you who are seeking Him, "whom do you seek?" Do you know
   what it is you seek? Do you seek some strange feeling? Do you seek
   signs and wonders, dreams and visions? Seek them no longer! Jesus is
   what you want! Take Him and be blest. There, close at your side, is the
   food your hungry spirit wants--look not up to Heaven--look not down to
   earth! There is in Jesus all you need!

   Feed on, Beloved--faith shall fill your mouth. Love shall enjoy the
   sweet dainty and your whole body, soul and spirit shall be sanctified
   by the Divine repast. May God bless you, dear Friends, all of you, by
   giving you, like Mary Magdalene, to seek the Lord.

                              The Waterer Watered

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 23, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE
   METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He that waters shall be watered also himself." Proverbs 11:25.

   THE general principle is that in living for the good of others we shall
   be profited ourselves. We must not isolate our own interests but feel
   that we live for others. This teaching is sustained by the analogy of
   nature, for in nature there is a law that no one thing can be
   independent of the rest of creation, but there is a mutual action and
   reaction of all upon all. All the constituent parts of the universe are
   bound to one another by invisible chains and there is not a single
   creature in it which springs up, or flourishes, or decays itself alone.

   The very planets, though they float far from one another, exercise
   attraction. And the fixed stars, though they seem to be infinitely
   remote, are still linked to one another by mysterious bonds. God has so
   constituted this universe that selfishness is the greatest possible
   offense against His Law and living for others and ministering to others
   is the strictest obedience to His will. Our surest road to our own
   happiness is to seek the good of our fellows. We store up in God's own
   bank what we generously expend on the behalf of our race. The little
   spring bubbling forth from the ancient pipe on the hillside overflows
   the stone basin and liberally supplies all the villagers with pure and
   cooling drink. In its flowing it does not waste itself, for the deep
   fountains in the heart of the earth continue unceasingly to supply it
   and both in winter's frost and summer's drought the springhead yields
   its crystal stream.

   The little brook which babbles through the woods, hiding among stones,
   leaping down the moss-grown rocks and soon deepening and swelling its
   stream, pours all its gatherings into the river hoarding not a drop.
   And though its treasure is constantly being lavished with unstinting
   liberality, yet Heaven and earth see to it that the brook shall never
   fail to sing its joyous song--

   "Men may come and go But I go on forever."

   The river hastens with its greater floods towards the all-receiving
   ocean--pouring itself out every hour with happy plenteousness, as
   though it only existed to empty itself. Yet the abundant tributaries
   which come streaming from the hills and draining the valleys are
   careful that the river shall know no lack, but shall be kept constantly
   brimming, a joyous and bounding river forevermore!

   The ocean perpetually sends up its steaming exhalations to the sky,
   grudging nothing. It puts no doors to its rolling waves, but uncovers
   all its treasure to the sun and the sun makes large draughts upon the
   royal treasury of the deep. Nevertheless the ocean is not diminished,
   for all the rivers are constantly conspiring to keep the sea full to
   the shore. The clouds of Heaven, when they are full of rain, empty
   themselves upon the earth and yet the clouds cease not to be, for,
   "they return after the rain," and the ocean down below seems but to be
   too glad to be continually feeding its sister ocean on the other side
   of the firmament.

   So, as wheels with bands are made to work together--as wheels with cogs
   working upon one an-other--the whole watery machinery is kept in motion
   by each part acting upon its neighbor and the next upon the next. Each
   wheel expends its force upon its fellow and the whole find a recompense
   in their mutual action upon one another. The same truth might be
   illustrated from other departments of nature. If we view this
   microcosm, the human body, we shall find that the heart does not
   receive the blood to store it up, but while it pumps it in at one
   valve, it sends it forth at another. The blood is always circulating
   everywhere and is stagnant nowhere.

   The same is true of all the fluids in a healthy body--they are in a
   constant state of expenditure. If one cell stores for a few moments its
   peculiar secretion, it only retains it till it is perfectly fitted for
   its appointed use in the body, for if any cell in the body should begin
   to store up its secretion, its store would soon become the cause of
   inveterate disease. No, the organ would soon lose the power to secrete
   at all if it did not give forth its products. The whole of the human
   system lives by giving. The eye cannot say to the foot, I have no need
   of you and will not guide you, for if it does not perform its watchful
   office, the whole man will be in the ditch and the eye will be covered
   with mire.

   If the members refuse to contribute to the general stock, the whole
   body will become poverty-stricken and be given up to the bankruptcy of
   death. Let us learn, then, from the analogy of Nature, the great lesson
   that to get, we must give! That to accumulate, we must scatter! That to
   make ourselves happy, we must make others happy! And that to get good
   and become spiritually vigorous, we must do good and seek the spiritual
   good of others. This is the general principle.

   The text suggests a particular personal application of the general
   principle. We shall consider it, first, in its narrowest sense--as
   belonging to ourselves personally. Secondly, in a wider sense--as it
   may refer to us as a Church. Then, thirdly, in its widest sense--as it
   may be referred to the entire body of Christ, showing that still it is
   true that as it waters, so it shall be watered itself.

   I. First, then, IN REFERENCE TO OURSELVES. There are some works, my
   Brothers and Sisters, in which we cannot all engage. Peculiar men are
   called to be God's great woodmen--to clear the way with the axe, to go
   before His army like our sappers and miners. Such men as Martin Luther
   and Calvin and Zwingli--that glorious trio of heroes marching in front
   of reformation and evangelization. They are cutting down the tall
   trees, tunneling the hills and bridging the rivers. And we smaller men
   feel that there is little of this work for us to do. But when the
   backwoodsmen have cleared the forest, after all the roots are grubbed
   and the soil is burned and plowed, then comes the sowing and the
   planting, and in this, all the household can take a place.

   And when the plants have sprung up and need water, it is not only the
   stalwart man with the axe who can now apply himself to watering, but
   even the little children can take a share in this lighter work.
   Watering is work for persons of all grades and all sorts. If I cannot
   carry about me some ponderous load as the Eastern water-bearer can, yet
   I will take my little water pot, my little jug or pitcher, and go to
   the well. If I cannot water the forest tree, I may water the tiny plant
   which grows at its root. Watering is work for all sorts of people. So,
   then, we will make a personal application to every Christian here this
   morning--you can all do something in watering--and this promise can
   therefore be realized by you all, "He that waters shall be watered also
   himself."

   All God's plants, more or less, want watering. You and I do. We cannot
   live long without fresh supplies of Divine Grace. Therefore the value
   of the promise, "I, the Lord, do keep it. I will water it every
   moment." There are no brooks at our roots as we grow in the soil of
   nature--it is only in the garden of Grace that we are "like trees
   planted by the rivers of water, bringing forth our fruit in our
   season." If the Lord Jesus, who is the stem of the vine, should cease
   to supply us with the fresh sap of Grace, would we not be like the
   withered branch which is cast over the wall to be burned in the fire?
   The Lord's people usually get this watering through instrumentality.

   God does not speak to us out of Heaven with His own voice--perhaps the
   thunder might appall us-- He does not write texts of Scripture with His
   own finger in letters of fire across the sky. But He waters us by
   instrumentality, by His Word written and His Word preached, or
   otherwise uttered by His servants. His Holy Spirit waters us by the
   admonitions of parents, by the kind suggestions of friends, by the
   teaching of His ministers, by the example of all His saints. The Holy
   Spirit waters us, but He takes care to do it by our fellow workers,
   putting an honor upon His own servants by using them in
   instrumentality.

   This being fully believed by us all, we may proceed to another Truth of
   God, namely, that some of His servants especially need watering and
   should therefore be the objects of our constant care. Some plants need
   watering from their peculiar nature. A gardener will tell you that
   certain flowers require very little water, perhaps for months they will
   grow in a stony soil. But others must be watered regularly and
   plenteously or they will soon droop. Some of you, my dear Brothers and
   Sisters, are so desponding that if you did not receive much comfort you
   would hardly hold up your heads at all. You are so weak in the faith
   that if you were not fed with milk continually you would scarcely be
   alive.

   "Comfort you, comfort you, My people, says your God"--is especially
   applicable to the mourners in Zion. Their constitutional temperament is
   such that to maintain the lamp of their joy they require much oil of
   comfort. Perhaps, too, they are ignorant, and the ignorant need much
   watering. If they knew the Doctrines of Grace more fully, they might go
   to the wells themselves--but not knowing where the water is, or
   feeling, like the woman at the well, that the well is deep and that
   there is nothing to draw with-- they cannot get the water. And we who
   are instructed in the way of God must take care that we bring up the
   water for them with our longer length of the line of knowledge so that
   they may not fail to be watered.

   It may be the need is not so much caused by the nature of the plant as
   by the position in which it is placed. Many of you, dear Brethren, are
   very happily situated where you can constantly attend the means of
   Grace--where the family altar smokes with sweet perfume--where you
   cannot help growing. You are like plants in a hothouse. But there are
   others, on the contrary, who live in houses where the jeer is far more
   frequently heard than the voice of praise. Where, instead of being
   helped in your devotions, you are hindered. Your spirit is driven to
   and fro with distractions--from the very closet where you wanted to
   commune with God you are forced out by cruel mocking.

   We ought to be very tender about your condition. You are planted on no
   fruitful hill, but on a very thirsty land where there is no water. Your
   position should lead God's people to watch you with deepest interest
   and see to it that you are well watered. I may also mention the sick.
   When our dear friends are tried with bodily pain--when they are shut up
   week after week from public gatherings--then they need watering. Their
   position is such that we ought to be especially mindful of them. It is
   written, "He carries the lambs in His bosom and gently leads those that
   are with young." And we must note the peculiar condition of the saints
   of God, being most careful of those who most need our tenderness.

   Let me also suggest the young to you. These need watering, both, let me
   say, from their character and from their position. With little
   experience and little knowledge they are prone to wander or to be
   seized by the wolf. Tend them with parental affection. When
   transplanted flowers are first put into the ground they need more water
   than they will later. When they have sent out more roots and these
   roots have abundant fibers searching through the soil for moisture they
   may not require much of the gardener's care, but just now they must
   have it or die. Therefore, I say, let the feeble, the weak, the young,
   the sick, the persecuted be watered most anxiously and lovingly by you
   all.

   Certain dear friends need watering, not so much from their position and
   character as from the present trials through which they are passing.
   Certain plants, after long standing in the sun, droop their leaves and
   look as if they must wither and die. But as soon as water is poured to
   their roots, it has sometimes perfectly surprised me to see how they
   recover! I could scarcely think that they were the same plants, their
   recovery was so sudden. The little roots beneath sent the message up to
   the main roots and said, "We have found out moisture. A friendly hand
   has given us a supply," and the root talked to the stem and the stem
   rejoiced and the great leaves drank up their share and the little
   leaves sucked up their drops till the whole plant to the very summit
   was verdant once more and rejoiced.

   Times will come to all of us when we need water. I, myself, get very
   desponding at seasons and I suppose you do, too. Unbelief dries us up.
   Oh that devil of unbelief! Why if that demon were dead, the other
   devils we might very well contend with. Personal affliction, losses,
   crosses, burdens make us just like the withering shrub and then we need
   to have the consolations of some kind friend to water us. Dear Friends,
   sometimes there are those in the Church who particularly need watering
   because they are actually withering. It is not to maintain verdure in
   their case but to restore it. Those backsliding ones--those who have
   slipped with their feet--do not cast them off, for God casts not off
   the backsliding one.

   When they begin to forsake the House of God, do not forsake them.
   Follow them with your tears. In such a Church as this, if you do not
   exercise mutual oversight over one another we shall simply become a
   mass of corruption instead of being a mountain of holiness. Watch over
   your Brethren as soon as you see the first signs of declension. When
   they forsake Prayer Meetings, gently give them a hint of the evil of
   lukewarmness and the danger of falling by little and little. When you
   mark the first sign in their outward carriage of laxity with regard to
   Divine things. When you see coldness where there was formerly zeal, be
   sure to give a gentle word of earnest, pathetic admonition.

   As I look around this Tabernacle I can but compare these rising seats
   to shelves in the conservatory and you are the plants which must all be
   watered or you will languish and wither. And I, who have to be my
   Master's under gardener, am very anxious to say to all of you who have
   any water in your watering pots--help me water these plants--that, by
   the gracious operations of God, the Holy Spirit, they may be kept
   fruitful, green, verdant in spiritual things even to the end!

   We now enter more thoroughly into our text and observe that all
   Believers have power to water others. You may not have much ability or
   influence, but you all have some power in this matter. In thinking over
   what Solomon meant, it struck me that he had in his mind's eye the plan
   of irrigation which is followed in some Eastern countries. The rivers
   at certain seasons overflow their banks. The careful farmers whose
   farms are close along the sides of the bank have large tanks and
   reservoirs in which they store up the water.

   After the flood the river is comparatively empty and the little farms,
   the vineyards and pastures on the banks begin to cry out for water.
   Then the careful farmer lets out the water from his tank or reservoir
   by slow degrees and uses it with great economy. It would sometimes
   happen that one of these farmers would have his reservoirs filled and
   his neighbor, perhaps through the bursting of a tank, or the falling
   down of the bank of earth, might have little or no water. At such times
   a greedy man would say, "I shall need all my water for myself. I will
   not lend or give so much as a drop of it. I have none to spare." But
   the generous man says, "I do not know whether God may be pleased to
   send a drought or not, but I cannot let my neighbor lose all his crops
   for the want of a little water while I have a good stock in hand." So
   he pulls up the sluice and lets such a stream as he thinks he can spare
   flow into his neighbor's channel so that he may water his fields.

   Now Solomon says that those who water others shall be watered. Next
   season it may happen that this good man may have no water himself.
   Well, then, all the farmers round about will say, "Why, he helped us
   when his tank was full and we will return his kindness into his bosom."
   "Ah," says one, "he saved me from ruin. I should not have had a crop at
   all last season if it had not been for him." So they all lend a
   portion, till he finds no difficulty whatever--even in a season of
   drought. When men cannot get water for love or money--he is sure to
   have it. The common feeling of men, as a usual rule, recognizes the law
   of gratitude and men say, "He watered others, he shall be watered
   himself."

   My dear Brother, you may be a man of talent. You may be a man of
   wealth--just turn on the big tap and let your ignorant or poor
   neighbors benefit a little by your abundance. Pull up the floodgates
   and let the more needy brethren be enriched by your fullness--open that
   mouth of yours that your wisdom may feed many! Tell of what God has
   done for your soul that the humble may hear and be glad. Do not be a
   reservoir brimmed up till the banks are ready to burst out through the
   weight which presses upon them-- let some of the treasure run out! And
   when your need shall come--and who knows when it may overtake any of
   us?--you shall find willing friends who shall run with swift feet to
   cheer your adversity.

   This simile needs to be supplemented by another--many true saints are
   unable to do much. See, then, the gardeners going down to the pond and
   dipping in their watering pots to carry the refreshing liquid to the
   flowers. A child comes into the garden and wishes to help. And yonder
   is a little watering pot for him. Now, see that little water pot?
   Though it does not carry so much, yet carries the same water. And it
   does not make any difference to the half-dozen flowers which get that
   water, whether it came out of the big pot or the little pot, so long as
   it is the same water and they get it!

   You who are like children in God's Church. You who do not know
   much--try and tell others what you do know--and if it is the same
   Gospel Truth, and it is blest by the same Spirit--it will not matter to
   the souls who get blessed by you whether they were blessed by a man of
   one or ten talents! What differ- ence will it make to me whether I was
   converted to God by means of a poor woman who was never made a blessing
   to anybody else, or by one who had brought his thousands to the
   Savior's feet? Go, my dear Brothers and Sisters, and exercise the holy
   art of watering!

   You say "How?" Why, a word may do it! A look may do it! An action may
   do it! Only zealously desire to offer sympathy, to afford instruction,
   to give needed help, to impart what you may be favored with to others
   and you shall be watered yourselves! The main point is that in so
   watering others we shall be watered ourselves. I am sure we shall, for
   God promises it and He always keeps His promise. If I need to get
   water, I must give water. Though that seems a strange way of
   self-serving I pray you try it. Was not that a very singular thing that
   when the poor woman of Sarepta had nearly exhausted all her meal, the
   Prophet asked for a cake for himself? She had been saving it. I dare
   say she had eaten only a mouthful or two every day. She and her poor
   boy were looking very thin. They had come to the last handful.

   She thought, "I will make one cake for my son and myself and then we
   will die." She is outside picking up sticks that she may bake this
   cake. God intends to bless her. How does He do it? There comes His
   Prophet, the hairy man. And the first word he says to her is, "Fetch
   me, I pray you, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink." She is
   quite ready to serve anyone and away she hastens for the water when
   Elijah cries aloud, "Bring me, I pray you, a morsel of bread in your
   hand." What? Out of that little handful-- barely enough for one? "Yes,"
   he says, "make me a little cake first and after make for you and your
   son."

   "After that?" she might have said, "what will be left after that? When
   there is only a handful of meal and a little oil in a cruse, not enough
   for one, am I to give that to you and afterwards see to myself and
   child?" Faith enabled her to obey and from that very moment neither she
   nor her son ever knew what need was. She gave from her little and her
   little multiplied. The case of the woman of Zarephath is but one of
   thousands establishing the rule of God's mode of action with His
   Church--a rule which shall not be broken ever. Let me show you how you
   will get watered yourself. In the first place, if you try to do good to
   others it will do you good by waking up your powers. Thousands of men
   do not know what they are made of. You have no idea what a fine fellow
   you are, young man, till you begin to shake yourself a little and go
   forth to fight the Lord's battles!

   We do not know what sinews we have till we climb the mountains! We do
   not know what strength there may be in our backs and arms till we have
   to carry a ponderous load and then we find it out. You have latent
   talents, dormant faculties which would work wonders if you would call
   them forth. Some people are not awake more than skin deep. All
   underneath the skin is sound asleep. They are like the great candle
   which I showed you one night with a small wick, which was only melted a
   little in the middle while all the outside was still cold, hard tallow
   and did not contribute to the light. You have not become warm through
   and through yet--your whole souls have not been wound up to the right
   pitch for serving God--you have only a little earnestness, a little
   zeal. But if you ventured upon holy enterprises you would bestir
   yourself so thoroughly that you would scarcely know yourself again!
   That would be a blessing, indeed.

   But next, you would often find that in trying to water others you
   gained instruction. Go talk to some poor saint to comfort her and she
   will tell you what will comfort you. Oh, what gracious lessons some of
   us have learned at sick beds! We went to teach the Scriptures. We came
   away blushing that we knew so little of them. We went to talk
   experimental truth and we found we were only up to the ankles, while
   here were God's poor saints chest deep in the river of Divine Love. We
   learn by teaching and our pupils often teach us.

   You will also get comfort in your work. Rest assured that working for
   others is very happy exercise. Like the two men in the snow--one chafed
   the other's limbs to keep him from dying and in so doing he kept his
   own blood in circulation and his own life was preserved. Comfort God's
   people and the comfort will return into your own soul! Watering others
   will make you humble. You will find better people in the world than
   yourself. You will be astonished to find how much Divine Grace there is
   where you thought there was none--and how much knowledge some have
   gained--while you, as yet, have made little progress with far greater
   opportunities.

   You will also win many prayers. Those who work for others get prayed
   for and that is a swift way of growing rich in Grace. Let me have your
   prayers and I can do anything! Let me be without my people's prayers
   and I can do nothing. You Sunday school teachers, if you are blessed to
   the conversion of the children, will get your children's prayers. You
   that conduct the larger classes, in the conversion of your young people
   you will be sure to have a wealth of love come back into your own
   bosoms, swimming upon the stream of supplication. You will thus be a
   blessing to yourselves. In watering others you will get honor to
   yourselves and that will help to water you by stimulating your future
   exertions.

   The Romans appointed censors in their State--not only to censure men
   for gross immoralities--but to require every man to give an account of
   what he was doing for the good of the Republic. We have deacons and
   elders--would it not be an additional blessing to have censors in the
   Church to go round and ask the members, all of them, what they are
   doing for the good of the Christian Church? A Greek historian desired
   very intensely to say a word about the people of the city where he was
   born. He felt he could not write his history without saying something
   of his own native place and accordingly he wrote this: "While Athens
   was building temples and Sparta was waging war, my countrymen were
   doing nothing."

   I am afraid there are too many Christians of whom, if the book were
   written as to what they are doing in the Church, it would have to be
   said they have been doing nothing all their lives. You would be
   delivered from that reproach if you began to water others. Let me cease
   from this subject by saying while you are watering others you will be
   manifesting and showing your love to Christ--and that will make you
   more like He--and so you will be watered while you are seeking to
   benefit your neighbors. To serve Jesus! What need I say of that? Look
   into that face bedewed with bloody sweat for you! Can you not sweat for
   Him? Look at those hands pierced for you! Shall your hands hang idly
   down and not be used for Him?

   Look at those feet fastened to the wood with nails for you! Can I ask
   of you any pilgrimage too long to repay the toil which those feet
   endured for your sake? My Brothers and Sisters, remember what Christ
   Jesus has done for you! Remember from where He came! Remember the
   riches which He left! Remember to what He came--the poverty and shame
   which He endured and how He went down into the depths that He might
   take us up to the heights!

   If you will think of these, you will have the best motive, I think, for
   beginning to look after His lambs and fighting with those lions which
   seek to devour His flock. And in that moving motive will be the main
   means by which you shall be conformed to His image and shall become
   like He--self-sacrificing--doing your Father's business. I wish I could
   speak more powerfully this morning, but the matter ought to speak for
   itself with Christians. If we love Jesus we shall not need any pleading
   with to water His plants. If you really love Him, it will not be a
   question of whether you shall do something. The only question will be,
   "What can I do?" And you will say in your pew this morning, "What shall
   I render to the Lord for all His benefits toward me?"

   He has spared your lives. He has given you health and strength. He has
   provided you with spirituals and temporals. He has made your heart leap
   for joy at the sound of His name. He has plucked you out of the
   horrible pit and out of the miry clay. He has taken you out of the
   black bondage of the Prince of Darkness and made you His sons and
   daughters. He has put the ring of His eternal love upon your finger.
   Your feet are shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace--

   "This world is yours and worlds to come, Earth is your lodge and Heaven
   your home."

   There is a crown for your head and a palm branch for your hand. There
   are pavements of gold for your feet and felicities forever for your
   entire soul! And even your body is to be raised again from the dust and
   fashioned like unto Christ's glorious body. "Eye has not seen, nor ear
   heard, neither have en- tered into the heart of man the things which
   God has prepared for you." Now what will you do for Him? Will you not
   win the promise that your soul shall be watered by seeking to water the
   souls of others?

   II. A BRIEF EXHORTATION shall suffice for the second point. This
   general principle is worthy of a wider application. We, as a Church,
   dear Friends, have enjoyed singular prosperity. While many churches
   have been depressed and decreased in numbers, we have increased. While
   other churches have had the hectic flush of a spurious revival, we have
   had one perpetual revival lasting for nearly twelve years. I do not
   know that we have increased at a more or a less rapid rate. We could
   not increase more quickly, for we have not officers enough or time
   enough to see the converts as it is.

   We have never, I think, increased less, for the work seems to have ever
   the same prosperity about it. I praise God that I can say of my
   ministry in this place and elsewhere, that to this day it has the dew
   of its youth upon it and there are as many rejoicing to find Christ
   through the agencies employed in this Church today as in the first day
   when we came among you in the freshness and vigor of our youth. We have
   had no schism. We have had no division. We have not been vexed with
   heresy. We have been blessed with something like persecution, but this
   has only bound us the closer to one another till we are like a
   three-fold cord which cannot be broken. And like iron bars made red hot
   in the furnace and hammered together, we are not soon to be separated
   from one another.

   Now, dear Friends, up to this time the policy which we have pursued has
   been this--if members of other churches want to know, we tell them! We
   have endeavored to water others. Your minister has journeyed all over
   the three kingdoms preaching the Word and you have not grumbled at his
   absence. We have undertaken many enterprises for Christ. We hope to
   undertake a great many more. We have never hindered our strength--we
   have undertaken enterprises that were enough to exhaust us--to which,
   by God's Grace, we became accustomed in due season and then we have
   gone on to something more.

   We have never sought to hinder the planting of other churches from our
   midst or in our neighborhood. It is with cheerfulness that we dismiss
   our twelves, our twenties, our fifties to form other churches. We
   encourage our members to leave us to found other churches--no--we seek
   to persuade them to do it. We ask them to scatter throughout the land
   to become the goodly seed which God shall bless. I believe that so long
   as we do this we shall prosper. I have marked other churches that have
   adopted the other way and they have not succeeded. This is what I have
   heard from some ministers--"I do not encourage village stations or, if
   I do, I do not encourage their becoming distinct churches and breaking
   bread together. I do not encourage too many young men going out to
   preach, for to have a knot of people who can preach a little may very
   soon cause dissatisfaction with my own preaching."

   I have marked those who have followed this course and I have seen that
   the effect of trying to keep all the blood in the heart is to bring on
   congestion. And very soon the whole body has been out of health. My
   Brethren, if you can do more good elsewhere than you can do here, for
   God's sake, go! And happy shall I be that you have gone. If you can
   serve my Master in the little rooms in the neighborhood--if by forming
   yourselves into smaller churches you can increase the honor of my
   Master's name I shall love you none the less for going--and I shall
   delight to think that you have Christ's spirit in you and can do and
   dare for His name's sake!

   At the present moment we rejoice to know that many a Sunday school in
   this neighborhood is indebted to the members of this Church for
   teachers. It is right. We do not want you at home and are therefore
   glad to see you at work elsewhere. No matter, so long as Christ is
   preached, whether you throw your strength into that Church or into this
   Church. Here, as being members with us, we have the first claim upon
   you. But when we do not need you by reason of our abundance of men, go
   and give your strength to any other part of Christ's Church that may
   desire you. While I speak thus much in your praise, my Brothers and
   Sisters, let me say we must keep this up.

   We must not say, "We have the College to support and we do as much as
   other churches for various societies and we can be content to sit
   still." This Church will begin to go rotten at the core the moment we
   are not working for God with might and main. Sometimes I get a pull at
   my coattail by very kind, judicious friends who think I shall ask you
   to do too much. My Brethren are welcome to pull my coat- tail, but it
   will come off before I shall stand back for a moment! As long as I live
   I must serve my Master with my whole soul and when you think I go too
   fast, you can stand back if you dare, for mark--you will be responsible
   to God if you do.

   You may start back if you will and if you dare! But I must go on, must
   go, MUST go on! You and I that are worthy of the day in which we live
   will follow, step by step, in any good project. And though I should
   seem too rash, you will redeem me from the charge of rashness by the
   enthusiasm and the earnestness with which you carry out my plans. Here
   is this great city! Was there ever such spiritual desti-tution--a
   million people who could not go to a place of worship if they had the
   heart to go there! And here we have the priest-craft of the Church of
   England increasing the spiritual destitution by building fresh
   churches--not providing for it, but increasing it, I say--for I reckon
   that wherever Puseyism is preached, there is an increase of spiritual
   destitution!

   Wherever broad Churchism comes there is an increase of spiritual
   destitution--and it is little better where they go who preach the
   Gospel in the pulpit and read Popery at the font, the grave, and the
   bedside. In this last case public morality is shocked by the perjury of
   those who swear to a Prayer Book in which they do not believe! Much as
   I respect and even love Believers in the Anglican Establishment, I can
   only feel that their presence in so corrupt a body is the reason why it
   exists. And I therefore think them to be doing mischief by buttressing
   a falling and ruinous cause.

   True Protestants, we must take upon ourselves to work for London as if
   there were no other agencies at work except those of the Free churches!
   The Hagar church, the church which has a mortal for its head--the
   harlot church which lives in alliance with the State--has too many sins
   of her own to repent of to be of much use in this hour of peril. The
   good she can do is so insignificant that it is not worth while to
   compute it--the monstrous evil which she fosters and perpetrates is a
   more than sufficient set-off against it.

   We must work and toil and labor to scatter in every lane, alley and
   court of London the pure Gospel of the blessed God. We must let men
   know that Sacramentarianism is a lie and that there is no salvation but
   in the uplifted Cross of Christ, and no salvation through ceremonies
   but only through a simple faith in Him who loved us and gave Himself
   for us. If you, among others, are come to the kingdom for such a time
   as this it shall be well with you! But if not, you shall be put away as
   things abhorred and this place shall be a hissing and a by-word in
   generations yet to come. And it shall be said of you--"There lived a
   people who were led by a man, who, with all his faults, was in earnest
   and was honest and they would not follow him. They proved unworthy of
   him and they have passed away and their names were written in water.

   "They had opportunities which they did not use. Work was allotted them
   which they were not worthy to take up. God said to them in answer to
   their request to be excused, 'You shall be excused.' And they went
   back--

   'To the vile dust from where they sprung,
   Unwept, unhonored and unsung.' "

   But it shall not be so with you, my Brethren! Though I thus speak, I
   know your zeal and love and earnestness and that you will continue to
   water others and then you shall be watered yourselves! We will pray and
   strive together for the faith once delivered to the saints! We will
   cleave closer and closer to one another and foot to foot and shoulder
   to shoulder we will march to battle for God and for His Truth! And come
   what may, whoever else may prove a coward in these days of charity and
   compromise--we will be found, in God's name, by the help of God's
   Spirit--faithful and true.

   III. And now, dear Friends, another sentence or two will close the
   sermon. On the widest scale this is true. This is true of our
   denomination and of every church. If we will water others, we shall be
   watered. From the very day when Carey and Fuller and Pearce went forth
   to preach the Gospel to the heathen, a blessing rested upon our
   denomination. I believe if we had done more for the heathen, we should
   have been stronger to do more at home. You may rest assured, though
   some may not think it, that our missionary operations are an infinite
   blessing to the churches at home.

   Relinquishing them, giving them up, stopping them would bring such a
   blight and a curse that we had need to go down on our knees and pray,
   "God send the missionary work back again! Give us an outlet for our
   liberality and our zeal, for without it we become like a pool dammed up
   that is full of filth and toads and frogs and all sorts of foul things.
   Lord, open the river for our zeal and let us once again have an
   opportunity to serve You for the nations that are far away!"

   But I must leave you to preach on that point, for my time has gone and
   you can do so more practically than I can. My sermon is reported and I
   will undertake that what you preach shall not be forgotten--it shall
   all be taken down in those boxes which shall be passed round. Say each
   of you as much as ever you can upon this subject by your contributions
   and remember, "He that waters others, shall himself be watered."

                            Justification And Glory

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 30, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE
   METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Whom He justified, them He also glorified." Romans 8:30.

   WELL said the Apostle in another place, "All things are of God." And
   here in this passage all works of Divine Grace are evidently so. The
   pronoun, "He," is repeated yet again and again, as if to set the Lord
   always before us. "Whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be
   conformed to the image of His Son." "Moreover, whom He did
   predestinate, them He also justified and whom He justified, them He
   also glorified." It is of God all the way through. There is not an inch
   of ground left to he covered by the creature's foot. The eternal
   Creator works all things in the Covenant of Grace according to the
   counsel of His own will. Haldane has an admirable note on this passage
   which we will quote in full:

   "In looking back on this passage we should observe that in all that is
   stated man acts no part, but is passive and all is done by God. He is
   elected and predestinated and called and justified and glorified by
   God. The Apostle was here concluding all that he had said before in
   enumerating topics of consolation to Believers. He is now going on to
   show that God is 'for us,' or on the part of His people. Could
   anything, then, be more consolatory to those who love God, than to be
   in this manner assured that the great concern of their salvation is not
   left in their own keeping? God, even their Covenant God, has taken the
   whole upon Himself. He has undertaken for them. There is no room, then,
   for chance or change, He will perfect that which concerns them."

   Does not this account for the majestic manner in which these Covenant
   mercies follow one another as in a triumphal procession? Foreknowledge
   leads the van with eyes beaming with love. Then come predestination,
   calling, justification, glorification--all in their proper order. Not
   one of these gigantic mercies limps along the road--but marching with
   stately tread, adorned in robes of glory, each one keeping its
   place--they make up a magnificent procession to the praise of the Glory
   of His Grace who has set them all in order and written His own name
   upon them all.

   Observe, there is no "if," no "but," no "maybe," no "perhaps" here. He
   foreknows. He predestinates. No creature lifts up its puny voice to
   object to the predestinating decree. Having predestinated, He calls and
   it is such an effectual calling, that we hear of no resistance. Having
   called, He justifies and "who is he that condemns?" Having justified
   without let or hindrance, He achieves His eternal purpose without
   impediment and brings forth the top stone of the temple of His Grace
   with shouting, as it is written, "Whom He justified, them He also
   glorified."

   Let our souls be glad as we clearly see the mighty Presence of our God
   in every work of Divine Grace. And let us understand from where the
   force, the certainty, the immutability, the majesty of the whole matter
   comes--namely, from the fact that, "He orders all things according to
   the counsel of His own will." "Who shall stay His hand, or say unto
   Him, What are you doing?"

   This morning, God the Holy Spirit, I trust, will make it to your profit
   to weigh these two precious gems of loving-kindness, to count over
   these priceless treasures of mercy, to swim in these two seas of love,
   justification and glorification. And then we shall need time carefully
   to search after the connection between them both, for they are riveted
   together by rivets of diamonds. They are fastened together so fast and
   firmly that neither death nor Hell can separate them. "Whom He
   justified, them He also glorified."

   I. Let us begin, then, by considering WHAT IT IS TO BE JUSTIFIED. If
   you wish for an answer in a few words, ask your children who have
   learned our catechism and you have it--"Justification is an act of
   God's free Grace, wherein He pardons all our sins and accepts us as
   righteous in His sight only for the righteousness of Christ imputed to
   us and received by faith alone."

   Perhaps, however, I had better unfold this Truth of God in detail. You
   will perceive by reading the connection and by a moment's reflection
   that the justification here meant is an act of God passed upon a person
   needing it-- consequently passed upon a person who could not justify
   himself--a person naturally guilty of sin and being in a state of
   condemnation naturally and needing to be lifted out of it by an act of
   justification of a Divine order. It is not possible that God should
   have devised a plan of justification for those who were already
   justified by their own actions.

   We do not talk with any wonder, or speak with any astonishment of a
   justification which a man achieves for himself. The guiltless need no
   justification. They have it already. If any man has kept the Law of God
   and made it honorable, he is in himself just and needs not to be made
   just--he is so already. Justification is an act of Divine Grace passed
   upon a sinner. Upon one who has transgressed the Law and cannot be
   justified by it and who, therefore, needs to be made just in another
   way--a way out of his own reach, above his own coming and going, as in
   the text--from God Himself. For it says, "He justifies."

   This, though it is a very commonplace observation, is a very sweet
   Truth of God to begin with. Oh, Sinner! However black your sins may
   have been, you may yet be justified! Though your sins are as scarlet,
   they may yet be as wool. And though you are red like crimson, you may
   be white as snow! It is written that, "He justifies the ungodly." Yes,
   the ungodly--such as you have been! Christ came not into the world as a
   physician for those who are whole, but for those who are sick.
   Justification is an act of Grace which looks out for a sinner upon whom
   to exercise itself. May the eyes of Grace find you out this morning,
   poor Transgressor, and make you just!

   In the next place, justification is the result of Sovereign Grace and
   of Sovereign Grace alone. We are told that, "by the works of the Law
   shall no flesh living be justified." And yet again, "justified freely
   by His Grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus." I cannot
   earn justification. Nothing which I can ever do can merit justification
   at the hands of God. I have so offended that all which is due to me is
   God's wrath and that forever. If I shall ever be accounted just it must
   be because God wills to make me just. It must be because out of His
   Divine compassion and for no other reason whatever, He looks upon me in
   my sin and misery, lifts me up from the dunghill of my ruin, and
   determines to wrap me about with the royal apparel of a righteousness
   which He has prepared!

   There is no justification, then, as an act of merit. The day for that
   was past when Adam fell and when we fell in him. Justification now
   comes as a priceless gift from the liberal hand of God's Grace.
   Justification has for its matter and means the righteousness of Jesus
   Christ set forth in His vicarious obedience both in life and death.
   Certain modern heretics, who ought to know better, have denied this and
   there were some in older times who, by reason of ignorance said that
   there was no such thing as the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ.
   He who denies this, perhaps unconsciously, cuts at the root of the
   Gospel system.

   I believe that this doctrine is involved in the whole system of
   substitution and sanctification. We all know that substitution and a
   vicarious sacrifice are the very marrow of the Gospel of Christ. The
   Law, like the God from whom it came, is absolutely immutable and can be
   satisfied by nothing else than a complete and perfect righteousness at
   once suffering the penalty for guilt incurred already and working out
   obedience to the precept which still binds those upon whom penalty has
   passed. This was rendered by the Lord Jesus as the representative of
   His chosen and is the sole legal ground for the justification of the
   elect.

   As for me, I can never doubt that Christ's righteousness is mine when I
   find that Christ Himself and all that He has belongs to me! If I find
   that He gives me everything, surely He gives me His righteousness among
   the rest. And what am I to do with that if not to wear it? Am I to lay
   it by in a wardrobe and not put it on? Well, Sirs, let others wear what
   they will--my soul rejoices in the royal apparel! For me the term, "the
   Lord our righteousness" is significant and has a weight of meaning.
   Jesus Christ shall be my righteousness so long as I read the language
   of the Apostle, "He is made of God unto us wisdom and righteousness,
   sanctification and redemption."

   My dear Brothers and Sisters, do not doubt the imputed righteousness of
   Jesus Christ whatever cavilers may say. Remember that you must have a
   righteousness. It is this which the Law requires. I do not read that
   the Law made with our first parents required suffering--it demanded it
   as a penalty after its breach--the righteousness of the Law required
   not suffering, but obedience. Suffering would not release us from the
   duty of obeying. Lost souls in Hell are still under the Law and their
   woes and pangs, if completely endured, would never justify them.
   Obedience and obedience alone can justify, and where can we have it but
   in Jesus our Substitute?

   Christ comes to magnify the Law--how does He do it but by obedience? If
   I am to enter into life by the keeping of the Commandments, as the Lord
   tells me in the nineteenth chapter of Matthew and the seventeenth
   verse, how can I, except by Christ having kept them? And how can He
   have kept the Law except by obedience to its commands? The promises in
   the Word of God are not made to suffering. They are made to
   obedience--consequently Christ's sufferings, though they may remove the
   penalty, do not, alone, make me the inheritor of the promise.

   "If you will enter into life," said Christ, "keep the Commandments." It
   is only Christ's keeping the Commandments that entitles me to enter
   life. "The Lord is well-pleased for His righteousness' sake. He will
   magnify the Law and make it honorable." I do not enter into life by
   virtue of His sufferings--those deliver me from death, those purge me
   from filthi-ness. But entering the enjoyments of the life eternal must
   be the result of obedience. And as it cannot be the result of mine, it
   is the result of His which is imputed to me.

   We find the Apostle Paul putting Christ's obedience in contrast to the
   disobedience of Adam--"As by one man's disobedience many were made
   sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous." Now
   this is not Christ's death merely, but Christ's active obedience which
   is here meant and it is by this that we are made righteous. Beloved,
   you need not sing with stammering tongues that blessed verse of our
   hymn--

   "Jesus, Your perfect righteousness, My beauty is, my glorious dress."
   In spite of all the outcry of modern times against this doctrine--it is
   written in Heaven and is a sure and precious Truth of God to be
   received by all the faithful--that we are justified by faith through
   the righteousness of Christ Jesus imputed to us.

   See what Christ has done in His living and in His dying--His acts
   becoming our acts, and His righteousness being imputed to us so that we
   are rewarded as if we were righteous--while He was punished as though
   He had been guilty. This justification, then, comes to sinners as an
   act of pure Grace, the foundation of it being Christ's righteousness.
   The practical way of its application is by faith. The sinner believes
   God and believes that Christ is sent of God and takes Christ Jesus to
   be his only confidence and trust. And by that act he becomes a
   justified soul. It is not by repenting, but by believing that we are
   justified! It is not by deep experience of the guilt of sin. It is not
   by bitter pangs and throes under the temptations of Satan. It is not by
   mortification of the body, nor by the renunciation of self. All these
   are good, but the act which justifies is a look at Christ!

   We, having nothing, being nothing, boasting of nothing and being
   utterly emptied, do look to Him whose wounds stream with life-giving
   blood. And as we look to Him, we live and are justified by His life.
   There is life in a look at the Crucified One and life in the sense of
   justification. He who a minute before was in himself a condemned
   criminal fit only to be taken to the place from where he came and to
   suffer Divine wrath, is at once, by an act of faith, made an heir of
   God, joint-heir with Jesus Christ--taken from the place of condemnation
   and put into the place of acceptance--so that now he dreads no more the
   wrath of God! The curse of God cannot touch him, for Christ was made a
   curse for him, as it is written, "Cursed is everyone that hangs on a
   tree."

   Now concerning this great mercy of justification let us say that it is
   instantaneous. Sanctification needs a whole life. Justification is the
   work of a second, perhaps it needs no appreciable time. The sinner
   looks to Christ. It is all done--his sin is gone in a moment. The
   righteousness of Christ is, as in an instant, imputed to the believing
   sinner. Sanctification, however, progresses or declines. It is a thing
   of changes. The work of the Holy Spirit sometimes ripens swiftly and at
   other times, by reason of temptation or trial within, it is but slow in
   its advance. But justification is complete in a moment! The dying thief
   was as clean one moment after he had trusted in Christ as he was when
   he was with Christ in Paradise.

   Justification in Heaven is not more complete than it is on earth. No,
   listen to me, Child of God. When your soul seems to be a very
   pandemonium through the blasphemies of Satan. When your doubts and
   fears leap upon you like so many lions. When your sins prevail against
   you so that you cannot look up, yet, if you are a Believer you are even
   then, in your worst moments, as completely and perfectly justified as
   in those happy days when on Tabor's summit you were apt to say, "Let us
   build three tabernacles and here abide." Justification never alters in
   a child of God. God pronounces him guiltless and guiltless he is!
   Jehovah justifies him and neither his holiness can improve his
   righteousness, nor his sins diminish it. He stands in Christ Jesus the
   same yesterday, today and forever--as accepted one moment as at another
   mo- ment--as sure of eternal life at one instant as at another. Oh, how
   blessed is this Truth of God--justified in a moment and justified
   completely!

   And observe, my dear Brothers and Sisters, that he who is thus
   justified is justified infallibly. There is no mistake concerning the
   transaction. "It is God that justifies." Where, then, can there be a
   mistake? If I justify myself, I am a tool and I make God a liar. But if
   God justifies me, who is he that condemns? I, a poor sinner, black as
   night, fly to the shelter of the great Shield stained with blood which
   God holds over my head and there I stand at all times. And though I
   know that every lightning of Justice might well dart its force upon me,
   as I am in myself, yet as I see my Shield, the Lord's Anointed, I am
   not afraid. Standing under that Shield, I defy Heaven, and earth and
   Hell! Crying in the language of Paul, "Who shall lay anything to the
   charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies. Who is he that
   condemns?"

   There is a prisoner at the bar and the jury has just brought in a
   verdict of, "Not guilty." The judge bids him go free. There are people
   in the court who gnash their teeth at him. There are persons in the
   street who hate him--what does he care? "I have been pronounced 'not
   guilty' by the proper tribunal. The Judge himself tells me that I am
   acquitted. No law officer can touch me. Not the fiercest enemy in the
   world can drag me into court again. I have been tried and found 'not
   guilty.' And who is he that condemns?"

   It is just so with the Christian. Christ's righteousness is put upon
   him. Christ takes his sins and when he stands before God's bar, the
   eternal Voice seems to say, "I see no sin in that man." How can He? All
   that man's sins Christ took away! The eternal Voice sounds forth again,
   "I can see righteousness there." And well He may see it, for Christ's
   righteousness is there and therefore the man is infallibly, upon
   grounds of justice which are not disputable--infallibly, upon grounds
   which he himself may realize as being certain--justified through Christ
   Jesus! Remember, dear Brethren--and I will not occupy you much longer
   over a theme where we might be tempted to say that this justification
   is irreversible!

   Once justified you shall never be condemned. Jehovah never plays fast
   and loose with men. He does not look upon a sinner and say, "I forgive
   you," and then afterwards say, "Depart, you cursed!" Arminians may
   think so, but the God of Believers will not do so. The God of
   Christians says, "I am the Lord, I change not. Therefore you sons of
   Jacob are not consumed." Having taken the prodigal into the house and
   put the ring on his finger and the shoes on his feet, He never turns
   that prodigal out of doors. Being married to His people He never sues
   for divorce, for the Lord, the God of Israel, says He hates putting
   away.

   "I, even I, am He that blots out your iniquities for My name's sake and
   will not remember them against you anymore forever." "I have cast your
   iniquities into the depths of the sea." Pardon and justification are
   irreversible and consequently the blessings which justification brings
   to us belong to us by a promise that can never be broken, forever and
   ever. If I am justified then I have peace with God and that peace shall
   be like a river, never dried up, because my righteousness is like the
   waves of the sea, never exhausted. If I am justified I can claim
   Jehovah's protection. And I shall have it, for He will not suffer the
   just man to perish. If I am justified I may come before God and ask for
   Heaven as my right, as a reward of righteousness imputed to me. And I
   shall have it, for He will never deny to a justified person the
   fullness of joy which is at His right hand forevermore. Oh, what a
   blessing to be justified!

   Once more, before I leave this point, I must ask you to be kind enough
   to question yourselves as to whether you have been justified. "Well,"
   says one, "perhaps I have been and do not know it." My dear Friend, I
   do not think so. The work of justification is generally attended with
   such a flood of joy that I think you must know it. Bunyan's pilgrim did
   not lose the burden off his back and not know it! As soon as it was
   gone, he gave three great leaps for joy and went on his way singing.
   You may have doubts about whether you are justified--I hope you will
   not be easy under them--but will seek after an assured interest in
   Christ.

   My dear Brothers and Sisters, if you have any doubt, go to Christ
   again! If you are not justified, go to Him to be justified. Just as you
   are, with nothing but the plea of His blood in your mouth--go to
   Him--for He casts out none that come unto God by Him. Know that the act
   of faith justifies and be not afraid to exercise that act of faith,
   notwithstanding all your shortcomings and your sins. "Hear me, Jesus!
   If I never was a saint, I am a sinner and You did come to save sinners
   and I cast myself on You. Your promise is that You will cast out none
   that come. Oh, cast me not out! Receive even me, and accept me for Your
   love's sake."

   II. Thus much upon justification. And now a little upon GLORY. How that
   golden word has been debased in the coinage of human speech. It has
   come to mean the glitter of war's helmet and the noise of the crowd's
   hurrahs. Smollet called it, "the fair child of peril." Johnson
   wrote--"Glory, the casual gift of thoughtless crowds. Glory, the bride
   of greedy virtue!" It is a far other and higher Glory of which we speak
   today. As high as the Heaven is above the earth is God's Glory from all
   the poor stuff which mortals dignify with that fair name.

   "Whom He justified, them He also glorified." They follow close
   together, you see. A little stream divides them, but the Apostle says
   nothing about it and you and I need not say much. It is a narrow stream
   called Death--there is no Glory without passing through that, or
   through the great change when the Lord comes. But there is nothing said
   about it and so we will not say anything. It is not worth thinking of,
   it is swallowed up in victory. It may be an enemy, but it is an enemy
   that is to be destroyed.

   Now, while speaking of Glory, I think I must divide the Glory which God
   gives to the justified into three parts. There is, first of all, the
   Glory which disembodied spirits are enjoying even now. There is,
   secondly, the Resurrection Glory, which they will enjoy when the soul
   and body shall be reunited and when, through the millennium, they shall
   be "forever with the Lord." And then there is "the eternal weight of
   Glory," which is to be revealed both in body and soul in the
   never-ending state of bliss which God has prepared for His people.

   Let us raise our thoughts a little while to the state of disembodied
   spirits. The moment that the soul leaves the body, the believing soul,
   the justified soul, is in Glory. We know that there is no preparatory
   process for it to pass through. Romanism holds that some of the best
   saints go to Heaven when they die, but that the great mass of inferior
   saints are not qualified for Heaven and must undergo a purgation for a
   series of years till they are prepared to enter Glory. They say that
   the saints who died under the Old Testament, or at least the most of
   them, went to the limbus patrurn--which some wicked Protestants call
   Limbo--where they remained without the beatific vision until the Lord
   Jesus went and preached to the spirits in prison and led them up
   afterwards to Heaven with Him.

   As for the grossly wicked who have by mortal sin lost the grace of
   Baptism, they go to Hell at once. But the better sort of partially
   sanctified Christians must suffer more or less intensely till their
   sins are atoned for and purged away. It was well said by Hugh Latimer
   that the key of Purgatory hangs in the pope's treasury, for, said he,
   it has helped to keep it pretty full--and I have no doubt it has. It
   has been a very profitable invention! More money has been paid, I
   suppose, for getting souls out of Purgatory than people have been
   tempted to pay in order to keep them out of Hell. However, we are not
   deceived in this matter! Let the Council of Trent say what it may, the
   case of the dying thief is to the point.

   He was no eminent saint. He had not for many years performed works of
   supererogation by which he reached perfection and could claim that the
   gates should be opened to him. He was a sinner up to the very last
   moment and the only good deed that we ever read of his doing, was, when
   he claimed Christ as Lord and rebuked his fellow thief for slandering
   the Savior. Yet, hear the words--"Today shall you be with Me in
   Paradise." Nor is this the only instance. We find, when Lazarus died,
   according to the parable, that he was carried by angels into Abraham's
   bosom, a place of unspeakable rest and delight which the rich man
   greatly envied.

   Stephen expected the Lord Jesus to receive his spirit and the Apostle
   Paul was in a strait betwixt two, being willing "to depart and to be
   with Christ." He evidently did not anticipate any delay between earth
   and Heaven, for he says, "knowing that while we are at home in the
   body, we are absent from the Lord." He puts the two as an alternative.
   We are not in trouble about them that sleep. We know that they that
   sleep in Jesus, He will bring with Him. In Ephesians 3:15, the Apostle
   mentions the whole family as being in Heaven and earth, but he speaks
   of none of the Lord's people being in Limbo or Purgatory.

   Those whom we are bid to follow, in Hebrews 6:12, are now inheriting
   the promises. Let the voice of God decide the case forever. Revelation
   14:13--"And I heard a voice from Heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed
   are the dead which die in the Lord from therefore. Yes, says the
   Spirit, that they may rest from their labors. And their works do follow
   them." Perhaps that word, "Paradise," which Christ uses to describe the
   state of disembodied spirits may be a help to us in judging of the
   condition of the blessed. Paradise was a place of perfect peace, of
   sinlessness, of rest, of enjoyment and freedom from evil.

   Eden! Oh, how shall we talk of its glories long since faded? Let us,
   however, remember its winding walks among trees loaded with luscious
   fruits. Let us remember the glory of its rising and its setting sun.
   The immortality, the peace, the joy, the love, the brightness which our
   first parents enjoyed in their naked innocence. That happy garden is a
   faint picture of the naked spirits, unclothed with bodies, who are now
   before the Eternal Throne. They have no pain, nor weariness, no evil,
   nor fear of death. They possess everything that can make them blessed
   except the resurrection body--

   "There fruits that never fade, On trees immortal grow. There, rocks and
   hills and floods and vales, With milk and honey flow." I think Dr.
   Watts was right when he said--

   "There everlasting spring abides, And never-withering flowers."

   They are in a blessed state of tranquility and perfection! But the
   Savior added, what was the beauty of all--"Today shall you be with Me
   in Paradise." The Glory of Paradise was that God walked there in the
   cool of the evening with His creatures. And the Glory of Heaven is that
   "they need no candle, neither light of the sun, for the Lord God gives
   them light," and the days of their mourning shall be ended. God wipes
   away all tears from their eyes and the Lamb leads them to the living
   fountains of waters. God is with them to be their God and they are with
   Him to be His happy people at His right hand where there are pleasures
   forevermore. This is the state of the justified disembodied spirits
   now.

   If I read the word aright and it is honest to admit that there is much
   room for difference of opinion here, the day will come when the Lord
   Jesus will descend from Heaven with a shout, with the trump of the
   archangel and the voice of God. Some think that this descent of the
   Lord will be post-millennial--that is, after the thousand years of His
   reign. I cannot think so. I conceive that the advent will be
   pre-millennial--that He will come first. And then will come the
   millennium as the result of His personal reign upon earth.

   But whether or not, this much is fact--Christ will suddenly come, come
   to reign and come to judge the earth in righteousness. Now at that time
   those of us who are alive and remain shall have no preference over them
   that sleep. It is true, "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
   changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for
   the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and
   we shall be changed." Christ will bring with Him those who sleep in
   Him. Their bodies are now in that state which is called sleep--that is,
   a state of hallowed rest, tran-quility and enjoyment--but they shall
   come with Him.

   Lo, He comes with ten thousands times ten thousands of His saints.
   Then, from beds of dust and silent clay their bodies shall wake up. The
   very bodies that were put into the tomb shall rise instinct with life.
   I say the very bodies. And it is not necessary that that there should
   be the very same particles of matter. My body is the same body that it
   was ten years ago, yet I am told, and I believe it, that there is not a
   particle of matter in my body now that was in it ten years ago! And yet
   its identity is not disturbed by that fact! Protect the germ, as God
   doubtless will, the life-germ of the seed corn which you sow in the
   earth--protect that and you have protected identity.

   And though when we rise it will not be as flesh and blood, "for flesh
   and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither can corruption
   inherit incorruption," yet it shall be the same body, for all bodies
   are not the same bodies, for there are bodies celestial and bodies
   terrestrial. And the glory is not the same--for there is the glory of
   the sun, the glory of the moon and of the stars. So I may have the same
   body, the same for identity and yet as to its constituent elements and
   especially as to its qualities of weakness, mortality and corruption,
   it may be as distinct and changed as light is distinct and changed from
   darkness.

   Oh, my Brethren, let this be an assured Truth of God to us that we do
   not put the body into the grave to lose it! Watts is right when he
   says--

   "Corruption, earth and worms Do but refine this flesh."

   We put the body there as the chemist puts gold into the furnace. It
   shall come out the same as to its gold, but the dross shall be left
   behind. All that was precious in the fabric shall remain--that which
   was corruptible, defiled, sinful, shall have passed away. According to
   our belief the soul will then return to the body. There will be a
   joyful meeting. Soul and body often quarrel here--but they are always
   loath to part--which proves how true is the wedlock between them. But
   what a happy meeting it will be when there will be no more quarrels
   between this husband and wife--when the soul and body shall be merged
   together in the perfection of union!

   Then, whatever may be the splendor of Christ will be the splendor of
   His people. Our bodies shall be like His glorious body and we ourselves
   shall be like He--

   "It does not yet appear How great we must be made. But when we see our
   Savior here, We shall be like our Head."

   Will He reign? We shall reign with Him. Will He judge the earth? "Know
   you not that you shall judge angels." "The saints shall judge the
   world." Will He be ruler over cities? He will make us ruler over many
   cities. All the splendor and triumph and victory and shouting--we shall
   have a share! And when the grand song of praise shall go up from earth,
   and land and sea and from the depths that are under the earth, our
   tongue shall swell the tremendous chorus and our ears shall be a
   partaker of the ever-blessed harmony! Let us not fear. "Whom He
   justified, them He also glorified"--both in the sense of giving their
   disembodied spirits joy and giving the soul and body power to reign
   with Him.

   Well, and what then? Then comes the end--when He shall have delivered
   up the kingdom to God, even the Father. When the mediatorial
   dispensation shall be finished, what then? Will the earth be renovated
   and fitted up anew as a new Heaven and a new earth? Will that new
   Jerusalem that is to come down at the coming of Christ be the future
   abode of saints? We do not know and we do not care one whit! This much
   we know--that we shall be forever with the Lord! With Christ shall be
   the Heaven of Believers forever, according to the Lord's own prayer,
   "Father, I will that they, also, whom You have given Me, be with Me
   where I am, that they may behold My Glory."

   If I might very hastily divide this Glory into its constituent
   elements, I think I should say it means perfect rest. "There remains,
   therefore, a rest for the people of God." Life in its fullest sense!
   Life with emphasis! Eternal life! Nearness to God! Closeness to the
   Divine heart! A sense of His love shed abroad in all its fullness!
   Likeness to Christ! Fullness of communion with Him! Abundance of the
   Spirit of God--being filled with all the fullness of God! An excess of
   joy! A perpetual influx of delight! Perfection of holiness! No stain
   nor thought of sin! Perfect submission to the Divine will! A delight
   and acquiescence in and conformity to that will! Absorption as it were
   into God--the creature still the crea-ture--but filled with the Creator
   to the brim!

   And more--serenity caused by a sense of safety! Continuance of heavenly
   service! An intense satisfaction in serving God day and night! Bliss in
   the society of perfect spirits and glorified angels! Delight in the
   retrospect of the past! Delight in the enjoyment of the present and in
   the prospect of the future! Something ever new and forevermore the
   same! A delightful variety of satisfaction and a heavenly sameness of
   delight! Clear knowledge! Absence of all clouds! Ripeness of
   understanding! Excellence of judgment! And, above all, an intense vigor
   of heart and the whole of that heart set upon Him whom our eye shall
   see to be altogether lovely!

   I have looked at the crests of a few of the waves as I see them
   breaking over the sea of immortality. I have tried to give you the
   names of a few of the peaks of the long alpine range of Glory. But, ah,
   what are my words, and what are my thoughts? "Eye has not seen, nor has
   ear heard the things which God has prepared for them that love Him."
   Our only satisfaction in thinking of it is that, "He has revealed them
   unto us by His Spirit." May His Spirit dwell in you and give you
   foretastes of the rest which remains--ante pasts of the eternal banquet
   where Christ will drink the new wine with us in His heavenly Father's
   kingdom.

   III. Briefly on the last point--THE BOND OF INTIMATE CONNECTION BETWEEN
   JUSTIFICATION AND

   GLORY. "Whom He justified, them He glorified." Let me show you why it
   must be--in the first place, a justified person has in him the bud of
   Glory. What is Glory? It is a state of perfect peace--"Therefore, being
   justified, we have peace with God through Jesus Christ our Lord." What
   is Glory? It is a state of rest--"We, which have believed, do enter
   into rest." What is Glory? It is a state of safety. When sin is
   pardoned I am secure. I am safe--safe now--through being justified.

   What is Heaven? It is a place of nearness to God--but He has made us
   near by the blood of His Son having justified us. What is Heaven? It is
   communion with Christ--but, Beloved, we have already boldness and
   access with boldness unto our Lord Jesus, seeing He has made us
   accepted in Himself. If you will but look carefully into justification
   you may see Heaven hidden within it. They tell us that inside the acorn
   there is the whole oak with all its branches and roots. And, certainly,
   within justification, there is Heaven with all its light, and life, and
   love, and joy, and perpetual serenity and security.

   If you are justified, my dear Brothers and Sisters, you are already in
   a sense glorified. You notice how the text puts it. It does not say,
   "Whom He justified, them He will glorify," but, "them He also
   glorified," as if the thing came at the same time. Certainly it does in
   embryo, in the germ, in the essence of the thing. He that is justified,
   is, in a certain sense, glorified, for, "He has raised us up together
   and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." Even this
   day, the life that we live is, "not I that live, but Christ that lives
   in me." Heaven is begun, Glory is begun below.

   Note again, justification is a claim to glorification. I speak with
   great reverence here and caution, I hope. But it does not strike me
   that it could be consistent with the Justice of God to deny eternal
   Glory to a justified person. Certainly, justification has its rights. I
   am now speaking forensically, using forensic or legal terms.
   Justification is a legal term, signifying that the person is right in
   the eyes of the Law. Now he that is right in the eyes of the Law has a
   claim to the protection and smile of the Law. And if I have a
   righteousness to which a promise is appended, I have a right to the
   promise appended to the righteousness which I possess.

   The promise is, "He that does these things, shall live by them." And I
   claim to live by them. I claim to live by virtue of what Christ has
   done for me! I come before God with His Son's righteousness in my
   hands. And I claim as a matter of justice to His own dear Son that He
   should give to me what His Son has merited because the merits of His
   dear Son have been by Him willed over in His dying breath to me! Oh,
   Christian, God cannot condemn you unless He should cease to be just. He
   will not, for He cannot cease to be gracious. Justification would be
   but a very sorry gift of God if it did not involve Glory.

   Oh, to be justified and then cast into Hell? Brethren, can you suppose
   such a thing? If you can so pervert your imaginations and make your
   judgments play the acrobat as to conceive a justified soul damned, then
   I ask you what greater curse could the infernal Fiend himself confer
   upon a mortal than this so-called justification? A spirit pronounced
   just and then sent down to Hell, accursed of God, accursed by the same
   lips that justified it? Blasphemous thought! To lie in those flames and
   to remember that I once had the righteousness of Christ--that I once
   was washed in His precious blood--oh, impossible! It shall not, must
   not, cannot be while the Deity is immutable and while the strong hand
   of God will not suffer the righteousness of Christ thus to be covered
   with disgrace!

   He did not begin to build and then fail to finish. "Whom He justified,
   them He also glorified." Where a man has done the greater, he does not
   fail to do the less. Now it is a greater thing to justify a man than it
   is to glorify him. I mean this--that justification cost the Savior's
   life and the Savior's death--but to glorify a man who is already
   justified costs God nothing. The expense is already laid out in the
   justification of the soul. And to take a man to Heaven is only to take
   him to a prepared place for which he is, himself, prepared. Shall He do
   the greater and then neglect the less? "He that spared not His own Son,
   but freely delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not, with Him,
   also freely give us all things?"

   The only question is, am I justified? I would say in closing, do not
   let that be a question, dear Hearer. But look to Him who freely
   justifies every believing soul and trust yourself now in His hands. May
   the Spirit of God bring you graciously to do it and you shall find it
   true, "Whom He justified, them He also glorified."

                               A Glorious Church

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 7, 1835 BY C. H. SPURGEON AT THE
   METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and
   gave Himself for her, that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the
   washing of water by the Word, that He might present her to Himself a
   glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, but
   that she should be holy and without blemish." Ephesians 5:25-27.

   WHAT a golden example Christ gives to His disciples! There are few
   masters who could venture to say, "If YOU would practice my teaching,
   imitate my life." But the life of Jesus is the exact transcript of
   perfect virtue and therefore He can point to Himself as the paragon of
   holiness, as well as the teacher of it. The Christian should take
   nothing short of Christ for his model. Under no circumstances ought we
   to be content unless we reflect the Grace which was in Christ Jesus.
   Even as a husband, which is a relationship that the Christian sustains
   in common with the rest of men, he is to look upon Christ Jesus as
   being set before him as the picture and he is to paint according to
   that copy.

   Christ himself being the Bridegroom of the Church, the true Christian
   is to seek to be such a husband as Christ was to His spouse. I fear,
   Brethren, that we often stop short of the Master's example--we compare
   ourselves among ourselves and are therefore far from being wise. We
   think if we avoid the egregious faults of some and can attain to the
   moderate virtues of others, we have done well. Let it be so no longer.
   He would never excel in statuary who should take the works of some mere
   amateur to be his copy.

   No. The sculptor knows that he cannot rival Praxiteles or Phidias and
   yet he takes some Greek torso or bust from the antique to be his
   model--he must have perfection there--even if there is none in his own
   workmanship. The painter would never attain to eminence if he went to
   an exhibition and devoted himself to the study of some work of moderate
   worth and said, "I will attempt to reach this and there I will stop
   contented." No. He goes to the galleries of the great masters and
   though his timid pencil may not dare to hope that he shall strike out
   thoughts so clearly and make life stand out upon the canvas as they
   have done, yet he seeks to drink in their inspiration, hoping that he
   may rise to some proud eminence in art by imitating them.

   Let the Christian, then, aspire to be like his Lord who is the Author
   and Finisher of his faith. And let him, as he runs the heavenly race,
   look to Jesus and make "the Apostle and High Priest of his profession"
   his continual study and aim to be changed into His image from glory
   unto glory. You must be struck, in reading the passage before us, on
   what high ground the Apostle takes the Christian. It is possible that
   some husbands might say, "How can I love such a wife as I have?" It
   might be a supposable case that some Christian was unequally yoked
   together with an unbeliever and found himself forever bound with a
   fetter to one possessed of a morose disposition, or a obstinate temper,
   or a bitter spirit.

   He might therefore say, "Surely I am excused from loving in such a case
   as this! It cannot be expected that I should love that which is in
   itself so unlovely." But mark, Beloved, the wisdom of the Apostle. He
   silences that excuse, which may possibly have occurred to his mind
   while writing the passage, by taking the example of the Savior, who
   loved, not because there was loveliness in His Church, but in order to
   make her lovely.

   You perceive "He loved His Church and gave Himself for her, that He
   might present her to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or
   wrinkle, or any such thing." He did not admire her because there was no
   spot in her. He did not choose her because she had no wrinkles. He
   fixed His affections where there were multitudinous spots and
   wrinkles-- where everything was deformity. He still set His heart and
   would not withdraw till He had loved the spots away and loved every
   wrinkle out of her who was the object of His choice. And now He seems
   to say to every Christian man, however unhappily he may have fared:

   "If perhaps, in the lot of Providence, you have been yoked to one who
   deserves but little of your affection, yet if you cannot love because
   of esteem, love because of pity. If you cannot love because of present
   merit, then love because of future hope, for possibly, even there, in
   that bad soil, some sweet flower may grow. Be not weary of holy tillage
   and of heavenly plowing and sowing, because at the last there may
   spring up some fair harvest that shall make your soul glad." He loved
   His Church and gave Himself for her that He might present her to
   Himself a glorious Church.

   I do not intend, however, this morning, to enter into the duty of
   husbands. That is not the reason for which I selected the text, but to
   set forth the love of Jesus towards His people. And first, let us
   consider the object of the Savior's love. "He loved the Church." Then
   let us observe the work which love has carried on in pursuance of its
   gracious design. "He gave himself for her, that He might sanctify and
   cleanse her through the washing of water by the Word." Then, thirdly,
   let us look at the beloved object when the design is
   accomplished--"without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing." And then
   let us pause awhile to behold this beloved object presented by our Lord
   to Himself in the day of His triumphant espousals.

   I. First, then, may the Spirit of God help us while we look at THE
   CHOSEN CHURCH, THE OBJECT OF THE SAVIOR'S LOVE. Some of our Brethren
   are very fond of what is called the general or universal view of God's
   benevolence. I trust we are not afraid to deal with that whenever we
   come across it in Holy Scripture. We believe, "God is good to all and
   that His tender mercies are over all His works." We believe Him to have
   the love of benevolence towards all His creatures and we can preach
   without bated breath upon such a text as this--"He is not willing that
   any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."

   But some of these Brethren are very much afraid of the peculiar and
   special sign of the Savior's love and they seem to shrink from a text
   which has anything particular and discriminating in it. They shake it
   off from their hand into the fire as Paul did the viper of old. Now we
   thank God we have learned to love the distinguishing Doctrines of
   Grace, and that predestination and discrimination are not hard words
   for us to pronounce and neither do they grate upon our ears! But we
   love to read this text and put the emphasis upon the accusative case.
   Christ loved the Church and gave Himself for her.

   We perceive that Christ did not love the world in the sense in which
   the term " loved" is here meant. We see here that Christ gave Himself
   not for the world, but for her, that is the Church. In the sense in
   which He is said here to give Himself, He did so for none except His
   chosen people, the Church--His one, special, and particular object of
   affection. It is not thus that Christ has loved universal
   creatureship--and all mankind alike without exception or
   difference--but He loved the Church and gave Himself for her.

   Now what is this Church which Jesus Christ loved if it is not the
   entire company of the elect? As many as the Father gave Him from before
   the foundation of the world, whose names were written in the Lamb's
   Book of Life before the stars began to shine. As many as were taken by
   Him to be the sheep of His pasture, the jewels of His crown, the
   children of His love, the subjects of His kingdom, the members of His
   body--each one of them being particularly known to Him and chosen in
   Him before the mountains lifted their heads into the clouds--so many
   compose the Church of Christ which was the object of His redeeming
   love.

   We have to search for these chosen ones in what is called the Church
   visible. We know that they are not all Israel who are of Israel and
   that the visible Church is not identical with that Church which Christ
   loved and for which He gave Himself. There is a Church invisible and
   this is the center and life of the Church visible! What the wheat is to
   the chaff and heap upon the threshing floor, such are these living
   Christians among the mass of professors in the world. There is a
   distinction which we cannot see--which it is not for us to try and make
   manifest--lest, in endeavoring to root up the tares, we root up the
   wheat also. There is an unseen Church which becomes visible in Heaven,
   which will be apparent and manifest at the coming of the Son of Man.
   This it is which Christ loved and for which He gave Himself.

   Now observe what this Church was by nature, for that is the subject of
   our discourse just now upon this first head. The Church which Christ
   loved was in her origin as sinful as the rest of the human race. Have
   the damned in Hell fallen through Adam's transgression? So, once, had
   the saved in Glory. The sin which was imputed to lost spirits was
   equally and with as fatal consequences imputed to them--and had it not
   been for the incoming of the Covenant Head, the second Adam--they had
   forever suffered with the rest. They, too, were alike depraved in
   nature.

   Is the heart deceitful above all things in the unregenerate? So it is
   in the elect before regeneration. Was the will perverse? Was the
   understanding darkened? Was the whole head sick and the whole heart
   faint in the case of those who con- tinued in sin? It was just the
   same, at first, with those who have been, by Sovereign Grace, taken
   into the heart of Christ. "We were," says the Apostle, "by nature the
   children of wrath even as others." Remember that between the brightest
   saint in Heaven and the blackest sinner in Hell there is no difference
   except that which Christ has made! Had those glorified ones been left
   to continue in their natural state they would have sinned as foully and
   as constantly as the worst of sinners have done.

   To begin with, there is no difference between the election and the
   non-election. They are all alike fallen. "They are all gone out of the
   way--they are altogether become unprofitable. There is none that does
   good, no, not one." No, more! This Church of Christ is made up of
   persons who are actually defiled by their own transgressions. Are you
   and I members of that Church? Ah, then we are compelled to confess that
   in us by nature dwelt all manner of concupiscence, vileness, and an
   evil heart of unbelief ever prone to depart from the living God and to
   rebel against the Most High. And what have we done since? Or rather,
   what have we not done?--

   "We wandered each a different way But all the downward road."

   We did not all fall into the same vices, but still when the black
   catalog of sin is read, we have to weep over it and to say, "Such were
   some of us." And why we should be made a part of Christ's Church is a
   question that never can be answered except with this one reply, "Even
   so, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight." Do the wicked sink to
   Hell with their sins like millstones about their necks? We would have
   sunk there, too, and as rapidly and as fatally, unless Eternal Love had
   said, "Deliver him from going down into the pit, for I have found a
   ransom." Look at Christ's Church as you see her visibly in the world
   and I ask you, Brothers and Sisters, though she has much about her that
   is admirable, whether there is not much that might cause her Lord to
   cast her away?

   Even in her regenerate state she speaks truly when she says, "she is
   black as the tents of Kedar." Mark the hypocrites that come into the
   Christian Church and that mar her purity. Observe the formalists that
   crowd her courts--that sit as God's people sit, and sing as God's
   people sing--but have hearts full of rottenness and villainy! Observe
   even the true saints--how unbelieving, how often carnally-minded, how
   childish--how ready to murmur against God! How few of them are fathers
   in Israel. When they ought to be teachers they have need to be
   instructed in the first elements of the faith.

   What heresies come into the Church and how many unstable minds are
   carried away with them. What divisions there are! How one says, "I am
   of Paul," and another, "I am of Apollos," and a third, "I am of
   Christ." What envy there is, what backbiting of those that are eminent
   for usefulness. What suspicions against those who are a little more
   zealous than their fellows! My Brethren, what a need of affection we
   can see in the Church of Christ! How little brotherly kindness, how
   little sympathy!

   On the other hand, how much of pride is discovered--how much caste
   creeps in and prevails even among those who profess to be Brethren! How
   we find some claiming to be lords in God's heritage and taking to
   themselves names and titles to which they have no right, seeing that,
   "One is our Master," and we are not to be called, "Rabbi," among men.
   When I look at the Church even with a blinded eye, having no power to
   see her as God's Omniscient eye must see, yet is she covered with
   spots! Well may she wear her veil and say, "Look not upon me, because I
   am black, because the sun has looked upon me."

   Church of God, how is it that Jesus Christ could love jou? Even in your
   Church capacity and Church estate, there is so much that could make Him
   say, "You are reprobate silver. You shall be cast into the fire." Lo,
   how much there is that must make Him say of you, "Salt is good, but
   this salt has lost its savor and how shall it be seasoned? It is
   therefore good for nothing but to be trod under foot of men." And yet
   you see, dear Friends, it is written that Christ loved His Church and
   gave Himself for her.

   1 think I see it--a piece of ground untilled--neither hedged, nor
   walled, nor covered with vines, nor redolent with the perfume of sweet
   flowers. It is a spot in the wilderness filled with thorns and
   thistles. Her hedges are broken down. The stones of her walls are
   scattered. The wild boar out of the wood wastes her. All kinds of
   unclean creatures lurk among her weeds and brambles. Oh, how is it,
   Lord of Glory, that You could buy, at the price of Your heart's blood,
   such a waste piece of ground as that? What could You see in that garden
   that You should determine to make it the fairest spot of all the earth
   and that it should yield You the richest of all fruit?

   I think, again, I see the Church of God--not as a fair maid decorated
   for her marriage day with jewels and carrying herself right gloriously
   both in her person and her apparel. But I see her as a helpless child,
   neglected by her parents, cast out, unwashed, unclothed, left uncared
   for and covered with her filth and blood. No eyes pity her. No arms
   come to bring her salvation. But the eyes of the Lord Jesus looks upon
   that infant and straightway love beams forth from those eyes and speak
   from those lips and act through those hands. He says, "Live!" And the
   helpless infant is cared for--she is nurtured--she is decked with
   dainty apparel. She is fed and clothed, and sustained and made lovely
   through the loveliness of Him who chose Her. Thus it is that strong
   love moved the Grace of God and the Church found that Christ gave
   Himself for her.

   I must not, however, leave this point without reminding you of what
   kind of love it is which Jesus Christ gives to His Church--you perceive
   it is the love of a husband. Now the love of a husband is special.
   Those gentlemen who think that Christ did not love the Church more than
   He loved the rest of the world must have a very strange idea of how a
   husband ought to love his wife, for it says, "Husbands, love your
   wives, as Christ loved the Church." And surely a husband ought to love
   his wife more than he loves other people! Therefore Christ cherishes
   for the Church a special, particular affection which is set upon her
   rather than upon the rest of mankind.

   The Lord has set His Church as much above the rest of the world as He
   has fixed His own Throne above the kings and princes of this lower
   earth. And the day shall come when she, "fair as the moon and clear as
   the sun and terrible as an army with banners," shall be recognized as
   being the favorite of Heaven, the peculiar treasure of Christ--His
   regalia, the crown of His head, the bracelet of His arm, the
   breastplate of His heart--the very center and core of His own love. Let
   us not quibble at this Truth of God for it is exceedingly precious. Let
   us seek the honey out of it and believe that Christ loves the Church
   with a special love.

   Again, a husband loves his wife with a constant love and so does Christ
   His Church. He will not cast her away tomorrow having loved her today.
   He does not vary in His affection. He may change in His display of
   affection, but the affection itself is still the same. A husband loves
   his wife with an enduring love. It will never die out--he says, "Till
   death us do part will I cherish you." But Christ will not even let
   death part His love to His people. "Nothing shall separate us from the
   love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

   A husband loves his wife with a hearty love, with a love that is true
   and intense. It is not mere lip service. He does not merely speak, but
   he acts! He is ready to provide for her needs. He will defend her
   character. He will vindicate her honor because his heart is set upon
   her. It is not merely with the eyes that he delights, now and then, to
   glance upon her, but his soul has her continually in his remembrance.
   She has a mansion in his heart from where she can never be cast away.
   She has become a portion of himself--she is a member of his body--she
   is part of his flesh and of his bones. And so is the Church to Christ
   forever an eternal spouse. He says--

   "Forget you, I will not, I cannot! Your name
   Engraved on My heart does forever remain. The palms of My hands while I
   look on, I see
   The wounds I received when suffering for you."

   Now let us leave this point, only reminding you, again, that this
   Church is only the Church of Christ because He has made her so. She had
   no right or title to His affection. He loved her because He chose to do
   so and having once loved her, He never will divorce her--she shall be
   His world without end.

   II. And now I shall want your patience a few minutes on the second
   point, and that is THE WORK WHICH LOVE

   SEEKS TO ACCOMPLISH IN ITS GRACIOUS DESIGNS. Since the Church is not
   fit for Christ by nature, He resolved to make her so by Divine Grace.
   He could not be in communion with sin. Therefore it must be purged
   away. Perfect holiness was absolutely necessary in one who was to be
   the bride of Christ. He purposes to work that in her and to make her
   qualified to be His spouse eternally.

   The great means by which He attempts to do this, is, "He gave Himself
   for her." Beloved, I wish I had the power of speech this morning as one
   sometimes has it, or rather, I wish that another had to handle such a
   weighty theme as this-- for how can I set forth to you the preciousness
   of this gift? He gave Himself for His Church! Had He given His crown
   and royalty and come down to earth for awhile, that were mercy! Had He
   given up, for a time, the happiness and pleasure of

   His Father's house, this were something--and this He did. But it was
   not enough. He would not merely leave His Glory and part with His
   crown--He must give Himself!

   Here He is on earth, born of the Virgin. A helpless Infant. He slumbers
   at her breast. Throughout His life foxes had holes and birds of the air
   nests, but, "He had not where to lay His head." He has given you much
   in this. "He is despised and rejected of men, a Man of Sorrows and
   acquainted with grief." The crown of thorns is on His brow! The lash of
   the scourge is on His back! The spear is at His chest! The nails are in
   His hands and feet. He has given you much, but now He is about to give
   you all He has.

   He is stripped naked to His shame. He gives His last garment that He
   may cover the nakedness of man, but when He cries, "My God, My God, why
   have You forsaken Me!" When having drank the last drop of the bitter
   cup of woe, He bows His head and says, "It is finished!" And He gives
   up the ghost--He has given you all that He can give--for He has given
   you Himself. He gives you His Godhead that comes on earth, but is
   veiled in clay. He gives you His entire Manhood, for His body is given
   to the scourge and tomb--and His soul to agony and death--He gives
   Himself.

   Perhaps you will say, "But how does His giving Himself tend to cleanse
   His Church?" You know, Beloved, how the precious blood of His heart
   takes away sin. How the righteousness of His life covers His Church and
   makes her beautiful in the sight of God. You know how the water which
   flowed with the blood purifies and sanctifies His people. But, perhaps
   you will never realize better how Christ gives Himself to you than you
   do at the sacramental table. There in type and symbol you see in that
   bread His broken body. You see set forth in shadow in that wine, His
   blood.

   And what do you do with that bread? Do you look at it? Yes, with tears
   in your eyes! What do you do with the cup? Do you regard it? Yes, with
   loving eyes. But this is not all. "Take, eat!" says the Savior. "Drink,
   drink all of it," He says. And as you eat and drink, you are thereby
   reminded of the great Truth of God that He has given you His flesh to
   eat and His blood to drink--and that these, like some healing medicine,
   will purge you of all diseases, cleanse you of every lingering cancer,
   go through and through the secret parts of your soul and expel with
   their sanctifying influence the very roots and seeds of corruption and
   make you perfect in every good work to do His will.

   I admit that you may not feel this at present, but you have that within
   you in having received Christ which will be the death of all sin. He
   has given Himself to dwell in you, to kill every lust, to slay every
   corruption, to expel the Canaan-ites out of the Canaan of your heart
   till King David shall reign in Jerusalem and the Jebusite shall be put
   away forever. Beloved, this is the way in which He sanctifies and
   cleanses His Church--by giving Himself for her--first upon the tree and
   afterwards in the Church, by the work of the Holy Spirit as a
   quickening and cleansing power, dwelling there forev-ermore.

   When the text says, "He gave Himself for her that He might sanctify and
   cleanse her," is there not allusion here to the double cure of sin?
   Here is Christ sanctifying by the Spirit, that is to say, taking away
   the propensity to sin--killing the power of sin in us--helping us to
   reign over our corruptions that we may in heart and life be pure, even
   as our Father which is in Heaven is pure. And as to the cleansing, may
   not that allude to justification and pardon? Of that we spoke
   particularly last Sunday to our own joy if not to yours. We are
   complete in Him. We are perfect in Christ Jesus and the design of
   Christ is that sanctification shall be as perfect as
   justification--that the power of sin shall be as thoroughly slain as
   the guilt of it--that altogether sin shall cease to be in the
   Christian.

   But what is the outward instrumentality which Christ uses? The text
   says, "With the washing of water by the Word." We Baptists are
   generally thought to lay great stress upon Baptism. There can be no
   greater mistake made than to suppose that we exaggerate its importance.
   I sometimes think we do not value it enough! Those who practice infant
   Baptism might be much more fairly charged with exaggerating the
   importance of Baptism than those of us who scrupulously require a
   profession of faith from all persons before we think of baptizing them
   into the name of the Lord. I do not believe that Baptism is intended
   here, nor even referred to.

   I know that the most of commentators say it is. I do not think it. It
   strikes me that one word explains the whole. Christ sanctifies and
   cleanses us by the washing of water, but what sort of water? By the
   Word. The water which washes away sin, which cleanses and purifies the
   soul is the Word. The Word of God has a cleansing influence. It comes
   and convicts the man of sin. It makes him see his impurity so as to
   hate it. When applied with power by the Holy Spirit, it works
   repentance. It leads the man to weep and bewail himself before God.
   That same Word leads to faith in Christ Jesus and faith works by love
   and purifies the soul.

   The Word is preached, the Word is believed. And as soon as ever that
   Word is believed, it begins to act like water in the heart of man. You
   cannot receive the Gospel and yet be as filthy as you were before. My
   Brothers and Sisters, if you really welcome the Truth of God, those
   grosser sins will be washed away at once. Next, as you discover them,
   your besetting sins will be cleansed away and constantly--as you
   understand the Word better, believe it more firmly and feel its effect
   more powerfully--you will by it, as by water, be washed and cleansed
   from all indwelling sin till you are sanctified and cleansed and made
   fit to enter into Heaven!

   This one thing let me say solemnly--I go not into this world to preach
   the efficacy of baptismal water in cleansing souls from sin. Let those
   who care to do it, and think it their office, magnify their office
   exceedingly. Let those who think that sacraments have necessarily
   efficacy in them stand out and boldly declare it. But as for us, we
   believe that the water which cleanses is none other than the Word of
   God which is preached by man and applied by the Holy Spirit! We rest
   upon the uplifted Cross of Christ, upon the doctrine of His Atonement,
   on the great Truth of His abiding Presence in the Church of God and
   ever pray, "Sanctify us by Your Truth. Your Word is Truth."

   And, mark you, the world has had a fair trial of both plans. Throughout
   the dark ages the world tried the efficacy of Baptisms and
   sacraments--century after century Popery and priest-craft gutted the
   world with the idea that Baptism and the sacrament of the Lord's Supper
   were a prescription for cleansing away sin. What was the result? Were
   not the cities filled with harlots? Were not the dungeons crowded with
   prisoners? Had not the earth become an Aceldama and was not the whole
   land, like Sodom, reeking with filth?

   Then came Luther and Calvin and though these men held not all the Truth
   of God in its fullness, yet, at least they held, "the washing of water
   by the Word," and Luther and Zwingli and Calvin declared, "The world's
   great purgative is faith in Jesus Christ, not sacraments. The
   priesthood lies with Christ and not with men. Priest-craft is to be put
   away. Justification is by faith in Jesus Christ and that faith comes by
   hearing and that hearing by the preaching of the Word."

   And what happened? Why, the world woke as from a long slumber! She
   found herself in chains--she snapped the chains as Samson snapped the
   green withes. Progress came--knowledge, light, truth--and if the world
   is not holy, yet what strides has she made since the day when Tetzel's
   "Indulgence for Sin" defiled the world through and through to its very
   center with blasphemy! We have but to keep on using this washing of
   water by the continual preaching of the Word and the day shall come
   when our poor planet shall be cleansed from blood and filth and shall
   come out from the mists in which she is now enveloped and shine like
   her sister stars, bright in the light of her God!

   And the only sounds that shall be heard from her shall be songs of joy
   and peace, because the Lord God Omnipotent reigns. This, then, is
   Christ's way of cleansing and sanctifying His Church--by the washing of
   water, that is to say, by the Word of God.

   III. And now let us pass on, again troubling your patience, to the
   third point--THE LOVED ONE AS SHE IS PERFECTED. One is inclined to draw
   a veil over the face of beauty which never can be painted. She is to be
   a glorious Church. We love our own highly-favored Church. I am sure
   there is not a member of it--at least I do not know one-- that does not
   feel his heart leap every time he thinks of this Church which God has
   so prospered and blessed and honored.

   For all that, we are nothing but a militant Church and a very imperfect
   one--a Church that has cause to mourn and humble herself before God for
   many sins. And I, as pastor, looking upon you all, cannot help while I
   bless God for all I see that is excellent, bowing my own head in the
   dust because of the sins of a people favored with the Gospel who,
   nevertheless, have much to confess before God. We are not a glorious
   Church. You can cast your eyes upon such churches as the Moravians who
   gave themselves up, men and women, to Christ's cause and scattered
   themselves all over the world, preaching the Gospel.

   Greenland was not too cold. The Sahara was not too hot--they sacrificed
   everything for Christ--but yet the Moravian Church with all its
   excellence has much of which it may well repent. It is not a glorious
   Church. You may look where you like and you shall see that the dust of
   travel is still upon the wilderness Church. She has the Presence of
   God--she has her Shekinah--but alas, she is troubled within by a mixed
   multitude. Korab, Dathan and Abiram sometimes vex her. Her Master has
   to send her fiery serpents sometimes and she still needs to keep the
   bronze serpent lifted up every day. Even in her ranks there are some
   that still need to look and live.

   We have no glorious Church on earth, nor do I think we can get much
   idea of what a glorious Church is. I tried yesterday, last Sunday
   rather, (and all the days since then seem to have gone so rapidly that
   I thought it yesterday). I tried last Sunday to show what a glorious
   person was. But what must a glorious Church be? There is one lamp.
   Well, that is very bright, very pleasing. You like to have it in your
   room--but think of all London illuminated to the very top of the cross
   of St. Paul's--and what an idea you then have of brightness!

   Now, one glorified Christian is a lamp. Think, then, of all Heaven with
   its domes of Glory lit up with ten thousands times ten thousands
   companies of blood-bought spirits whom Jesus Christ has taken up--a
   glorious Church! One flower is very sweet. I smell its perfume. But I
   walk into some vast conservatories, into some gentleman's garden, acres
   in size, and there are beds of flowers--blue and scarlet, and yellow. I
   see the verbena, the calceolaria and the geranium and many others, all
   in order and in ranks. Oh, how glorious is this!

   Those undulating lawns, those well-trimmed hedges, those trees so
   daintily kept--all growing in such luxuriance. One flower is sweet, but
   a garden! A garden! Who can tell how sweet this is? So, one glorified
   saint is one of God's flowers, but a glorious Church is Christ's
   garden! A drop of water may be very precious to a thirsty tongue, but a
   river full of it! Children are pleased, when for the first time in
   their lives they sail across some little lake. But how surprised they
   are when they come to the deep and rolling sea which seems without
   shore or bottom!

   Well, so pleased am I at the very thought of the glorious Church. As
   yet I have never seen anything but one little lake--this Church--the
   Church of God in England. The Church of God in the world--what is it,
   after all, but "a drop in a bucket"? But the glorious Church--the whole
   of the people of God gathered together in one, all perfectly free from
   sin, all made like unto Christ and all bright with the Glory which
   excels even that which Moses and Elijah had when they were with Christ
   in the holy mountain! Or such as Moses had when he came down from the
   top of Horeb, when he had been forty days with God--a glorious Church,
   a mighty company of glorified beings!

   But do observe what is said of her. She is to be, "Without spot, or
   wrinkle, or any such thing." "Without spot"-- that is much. But, you
   see, spots can be taken off. The face is washed and the spot comes out.
   The garment is thoroughly cleansed and there are some chemicals and
   acids applied and the spots can be removed. Though, truly, some of us
   have scarlet spots of a crimson-like dye, yet the blood of Jesus is a
   wonderful detergent and it can get out spots of any color. Though we
   may have been lying in the lye-tub of sin even for seventy years, yet
   Christ will get all the spots out of us if we are a part of His Church.

   Though His Church is double dyed, yet Christ will make her white as
   snow. But that is not the wonder of the text. The marvel is, "without
   spot or wrinkle." You may get a spot out of your face, but you cannot
   smooth out a wrinkle! You may make what efforts you please, but you
   cannot get rid of your wrinkles. You that are getting old, if time has
   come and driven his plow across your brow, why there the furrows will
   remain--they will not come out. Yes, but the Church of Christ is to be
   without wrinkle as well as without spot! How will He get the wrinkles
   out? There is no chemical that I know of that can get rid of them.

   But Jesus Christ has a sacred art, having in Himself, by the washing of
   water, even the Word, the power to get wrinkles out! Lightfoot says
   there is an allusion here to the carefulness of the Jew in his
   ablutions. The Jew not only washes very carefully when he is purifying
   himself for worship, but lest any dust or impurity should remain in any
   crack of the skin, or in any wrinkle, he seeks by washing again and
   again with the severest care to get out the least filth that would be
   in the wrinkle.

   Very good, Dr. Lightfoot, but the Jew cannot wash wrinkles out. He can
   wash away the dirt, but he cannot get rid of the wrinkle. But Christ
   can banish away both. Another good writer says that perhaps there is an
   allusion here to the fuller's trade. The fuller gets out the spots
   first and then as the cloth may have been so folded up that there are
   creases and wrinkles in it, he uses different stretching and milling
   till at last he manages to get out the creases and wrinkles from the
   cloth as well as the spot. I do not know whether there is an allusion
   to that, but this I know--there shall not be a spot of sin on any of
   God's people, nor yet a wrinkle of infirmity!

   They shall lose the effect of old age and weakness in their bodies and
   they shall lose the defects and infirmities in their souls. The outward
   spot shall be removed and the inward deformity, which was like a
   wrinkle ingrained into their very nature, shall also be taken away. But
   do observe the next word. The Holy Spirit seems to exhaust language to
   describe this purity. He says, "Without spot, or wrinkle, or any such
   thing!" She shall have nothing like a spot, nothing that can be
   construed as a wrinkle--she shall be fair and the world shall be
   compelled to acknowledge that she is. The eyes of God shall look upon
   her. And though He sees in darkness and discovers the hidden things of
   night, even He shall discern nei- ther spot, nor wrinkle, nor any such
   thing in any one single part of the body or the soul of any one of the
   members of the mystical body of Christ!

   Oh what perfection, Beloved, is this! I cannot speak of it, but I can
   delight in thinking of it! I was trying to think last night what I
   should be like when I was freed from my spots and wrinkles. Ah, you can
   all see them now--I wonder you put up with them sometimes! But what
   shall I be when I have parted with them forever? And I shall get rid of
   them. Death is stamped on every infirmity--the Lord has put the poison
   into the heart of my inbred sins and bless His name for it. But what
   will you and I be like when we are perfect?

   No hasty temper, no sloth, no wrong thoughts, no cold hearts, no
   dilatoriness in prayer, no sluggishness in praise. Oh, Brothers and
   Sisters, there will be some of you so different we shall scarcely know
   you! When some Brethren die I believe they will go to Heaven, but they
   will be strangely altered by the time they get there. They are good
   people, but they have such crotchety ways, such strange sense of humor,
   such hot tempers that surely we shall have to be very wise people to
   know them in Heaven! We shall need to be informed who they are, they
   will be so greatly changed!

   But this will be the happy state of all--whether altered much or
   little--we shall be, "without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing." I
   must not dwell longer, though the theme invites it. Hypocrisies,
   heresies, declensions, divisions--all these will be put away from the
   Church. Infirmity, doubt, sin, fear of every kind will be put away from
   every Believer and we shall be presented blameless, holy and
   unreprovable in the sight of God!

   IV. And lastly, THE LOVED ONE IS TO BE PRESENTED. It is said, He is "to
   present her to Himself." Every day Christ presents His people to His
   Father in His intercession. The Holy Spirit presents poor sinners every
   day in conversion to Christ, but there is to be a day when Christ will
   present His glorious Church "to Himself." When He shall come, then
   shall be the wedding day. There shall be heard the cry, "Behold, the
   Bridegroom comes!"

   Then the virgins with their lamps trimmed shall go forth to meet Him
   and His Church shall enter into the supper feast, to sit down and sup
   with Him and He with her. Today the Church is like Esther bathing
   herself in spices, making herself ready for Ahasuerus, her lord and
   master. Today we are engaged--at the coming we shall be married. We are
   waiting now impatiently for Him--then we shall be in His embrace. Today
   we wear not the crown, today we wave not the palm--but tomorrow when He
   comes we shall be crowned with Him and triumph with Him.

   Let us long for His appearing. Let this bright hope sustain you in the
   dreary months of waiting and the weary hours of fighting, "He comes! He
   comes!" And when He comes He will be glorified in all His saints and
   admired in those that have believed on Him. I would to God we were all
   members of His Church! There is only one token of membership which is
   infallible and that is saving faith in Christ. If you believe in Jesus
   you shall be without spot or wrinkle. But if you believe not, you are
   not of His Church, and neither shall you be a partaker of His cleansing
   power nor of His glorious advent.

   God give you a new heart and a right spirit and wash you with water
   this day by the Word, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                                Jericho Captured

   PREACHED AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, ON BEHALF OF THE BAPTIST IRISH SOCIETY.

   "And the Lord said unto Joshua, See, I ha ve given into your hands
   Jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valor. And you shall
   compass the city, all you men of war and go round about the city once.
   Thus shall you do six days." Joshua 6:2,3.

   I SEE many ministering Brothers here. I think I shall follow the
   example of Martin Luther who observes that he frequently saw in the
   church at Wittenberg sundry learned doctors and there usually sat Dr.
   Justus Jonas and others of whom he said were infinitely greater and
   more wise than himself. "But," said Martin, "I do not, therefore, alter
   my style of preaching--I do not preach to them--I preach to those
   peasants who come in from the country and to the citizens of
   Wittenberg. For then I am quite certain that if they can understand me,
   Dr. Justus Jonas and the learned divines can understand me, too, if
   they like."

   I shall, moreover, adopt what is said to have been Mr. Wesley's
   exhortation to his preachers, namely, aim low. "There is more
   likelihood," he says, "of hitting the men than when you fire high." I
   may also frankly confess I am reduced to that precept by necessity
   since I have no capabilities of firing high and must therefore shoot
   low. We shall take our text now and try, if we can, to get something
   out of it which may be applicable to the present position of our
   Society and see if we cannot draw some words and thoughts from it which
   may strengthen, encourage and nerve us for future action in this good
   work of God.

   The Irish Society has to do with one of the citadels of Romanism and it
   strikes me that there is a very evident parallel between our efforts
   and the work which Israel had to do against this city of Jericho.
   Jericho was a strongly defended city and shut up so that none went in
   or came out. And Romanism seems to have accomplished this admirably. It
   shuts up its disciples so that they are scarcely accessible and
   converts from it are few and far between. None, I was about to say, go
   in--very few, indeed, from us--and there are very few who ever come out
   again.

   Jericho was the frontier city. That being captured, the conquest of the
   rest of Canaan would be comparatively easy. And Popery is very much the
   frontier city, the Jericho of our warfare--it stands in the way of the
   evangelization of the world--it is the great impediment to the spread
   of the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ. Let Jericho fall and Canaan
   may weep and howl, for her day has come. And let Rome be subdued--let
   Romanism be conquered--and the world shall soon be at the feet of that
   Jesus whom it once despised.

   We are attacking, I think, in the Irish Society, a Jericho, indeed, and
   we have been long at it. But it has been a very weary task and the
   Brethren have sometimes been apt to cry, "Let it be given up." I will
   speak of this on the first, the second, the third, the fourth, the
   fifth--perhaps on the sixth day of the week, to cry to these
   Brethren--"Courage, go on still with your rams' horns! Bear your
   testimony and carry the Ark of the Lord round about this city, for the
   Lord has delivered it unto your hands. Only be obedient and courageous
   and abide His time, for your victory is absolutely sure."

   I shall divide what I may have to say this evening into these three
   parts. It strikes me that the narrative before us teaches us that God
   would have His people work and wait and win. And this is what we have
   to do today as they had of old.

   I. First of all God would have His people WORK. A little upon that. We
   preach the Doctrines of Grace, and the Doctrines of Grace are always
   the best soil in which to grow good works. We daily insist upon it that
   works do not make a man live, but we equally insist upon it that
   spiritual life continually manifests itself by holy deeds. The soldiers
   of God's army, after they had crossed the Jordan, were not to lie still
   in luxurious ease till Jericho's walls should crumble down by slow
   degrees. And though God determined to send Jericho to sudden
   destruction, yet His people were not to sit still upon some neighboring
   knoll and expect the catastrophe--they were to labor and Jericho would
   fall as the result of their toil.

   Their work is to consist of a daily procession. They are to go in
   cavalcade round about the wall. The priests are to exercise their
   functions. The ark must be carried upon men's shoulders. The men of war
   are to be there to defend the ark, to clear the way, and to follow,
   also in the rear to guard it against any sudden attack or any eruption
   from the city. They are to march thus the whole of the six days--not
   one day without its parade--not one day without obedience to the great
   Captain of the host.

   So, Brethren, must it be with us. We are to win the world for Christ!
   This is our high ambition and it shall be in Christ's name our grand
   attainment. But it must be by work, by testimony-bearing, by the
   preaching of the Gospel, by continual prayer, by encompassing the city,
   perpetually serving God and walking in the path of obedience. Let us
   look at this work a little in connection with this narrative. You will
   observe that the work to be done by Israel was universal. There was a
   place for each one to occupy. The men of arms were to go round the
   city, and with them the priests were to march.

   Both the ecclesiastical and the military castes shall be represented
   here. They must neither of them sit still. It is an ill day for God's
   Church when we conceive that some few are to fight the Lord's battles
   and that the rest of us may look on and criticize or applaud. You are,
   all of you, my Brethren, called to serve God. You recognize this in
   your creed. You know yourselves to be priests and you hate the lie
   which lifts some men into a priesthood and puts the rest down as, "the
   laity," as though they were nothing better than stones. You feel that
   you are all called to bear the vessels of the Lord-- that you are a
   "royal priesthood, a peculiar people."

   You know that you are all set apart for the service of God. But while
   this is our creed, I am afraid it is not our practice. How many take
   their seats in the pew, and when they have once made themselves
   comfortable consider that their work is entirely wrapped up in
   listening to sermons or perhaps fumbling in their pockets for a
   solitary coin on collection occasions for the Missionary Society? It
   may be now and then--now and then--assisting in some enterprise of
   usefulness, but this only as an exception to the rule.

   We shall never see the Church become strong and mighty till every
   single member of the Church shall realize his responsibility. We must
   all encompass this city. Observe, when the Lord fed the multitude He
   did not take some of the five loaves, or one of the fishes, but He took
   all the loaves, though they were barley and both the fishes, though
   they were small. And He took care to break all and to divide all among
   the people. Nothing of a stock-in-hand was kept in the larder, nothing
   was laid by--all was used.

   And then, by the multiplying power of God, there was sufficient food
   for all. And so we must rummage the larder, we must bring out the
   barley cakes, we must bring forth the fishes--all must be devoted to
   the Master's cause. And, in the use, ability will be multiplied! And in
   the exercise, Divine Grace will be increased and we shall yet be
   sufficient for the world's needs.

   It has been said, and I think a little calculation will show you that
   it is correct, that if God were to enable the Christians in this huge
   city of ours to feel their responsibility and if every individual
   Christian were made the means of the conversion of one other--starting
   with fifty thousand Christians in London, (and let us hope there are as
   many Believers as that--for it is a very small proportion of the
   professing multitude)--then, considering that there are three million
   souls in London, six years would be sufficient for the conversion of
   the whole by the simple agency of each disciple bringing in one of the
   stray sheep.

   This does not seem as if it were an impossible thing. Only Divine Grace
   is wanted from on high. We must plead with God to bring down the
   blessing. And when the blessing comes on each man's labor, there
   certainly is no hindrance in the matter of time, or in the matter of
   exertion--for, with God's blessing--the conversion of a soul is not a
   matter that requires us to relinquish business, or that compels us to
   give up all our time to it. Some five minutes have been, by Divine
   Grace, a sufficient length of time and half-a-dozen words have proven
   enough. Courage, my Brethren! Vast as the work is, if we all go to it,
   with God's blessing it will be speedily accomplished.

   Our police served us all with a notice the other day, when the snow was
   on the ground, that we were each one to sweep before our own doors. It
   was very right that the passenger should go along the footpath without
   being smothered with the mud and snow commingled. Now what an expense
   it would have been to clean the streets of London by any other process!
   It would be difficult for a contractor to undertake it by the year,
   since he would scarcely know how often he would be called to work. How
   could an army of men be kept ready to do the work which comes in so
   strange a fashion--sometimes but once in the year and sometimes fifty
   times?

   But each man sweeps before his own door and then it is all done early
   in the morning and you walk the streets in comfort! Oh that we could
   but feel that we are to sweep before our own door! Oh that every man
   would build the dilapidated wall of Jerusalem before his own house! And
   when this is done, then shall God send victory to His hosts. But I fear
   it will not be till then. God would have His people work universally.

   But next, He would have them work in His own appointed way. They are
   not to go in a scramble--in a boyish race--round Jerusalem. There must
   be the soldiers in their troops, the priests in their array and then
   again, the men of war to bring up the rear. God would have His people
   work according to His revealed will. We must be very tender and jealous
   here. Whatever may be the opinions about the alteration of the
   constitution of our Missions, I do trust that we shall, all of us, when
   we come together, recognize the authority of God and feel that we can
   only expect to have His guidance, His help, His blessing, when we walk
   according to the path which He has marked for us.

   If I go upon a tour I do not expect to see certain sights which have
   been guaranteed to me by my friend unless I agree to follow the little
   chart which he has mapped out for me. I cannot expect to have that
   sublime view of the Alps if I refuse to climb a certain spot and stand
   there and view the glacier and the snow peak glittering in the sun. And
   I cannot expect to have God's blessing in my ministry and in the Sunday
   school class unless I keep to, "It is written," and in all things have
   a tender conscience and am jealous of myself lest I err.

   How much more, then, in this greater work in which the whole Church is
   engaged! My Brothers and Sisters, let us see to it that in all things
   we compass this city of Jericho according to the Divine order! For only
   so may we expect to see her walls come crumbling down. Then, again,
   remember they encompassed the city daily. So does God call His Church
   to work daily. It is very easy for us, in a moment of excitement, to
   accomplish a great work. And the most of Christian work now-a-days is,
   I fear, merely spasmodic. We build chapels by a series of fits. We pay
   off missionary society debts by stupendous efforts and we relapse again
   into debt and difficulties.

   I am afraid that as a denomination we are not fond of working too
   tryingly. We know the value of ourselves, of our time and of our money
   and we are not apt to wear ourselves out by any excessive exertion. We
   have never, I believe, at any period since the unhappy days of Munster,
   been accused of an excess of zeal! We are rather to be accused of
   quarreling about points on which we differ than of excessive love of
   sticking to the practical business of fighting the devil and winning
   the world to Christ. But we must come to this, for mark you, if we are
   to conquer the world we must each of us have our daily work and keep to
   it as God shall give us Grace.

   The wheel must revolve again and again and again--it is that perpetual
   motion of industry which produces wealth and it must be the ceaseless
   energy of our zeal which shall produce spiritual conquest. We have
   sharpened our swords and fleshed them well. The younger men among us
   have had a brush with the foe and we are beginning to think, like our
   sober sires, we may be quiet. But it must not be so--we must agitate
   for all the Truth of God, for all the doctrines we hold dear and for
   the peculiar Truths of God we hold as a denomination. We must keep on
   fighting for Christ and fighting for Christ every day.

   We must sleep in our armor! We must begin to feel that the sword
   cleaves to our hand and cannot be separated from it. We must give
   ourselves so entirely to the work to which God has called us that
   wherever we are, whatever we may be engaged in, men may take knowledge
   of us as to what is our work and calling. In this Irish Society there
   must be no standing still, no ceasing of the trumpet, no withdrawing of
   so much as a single ram's horn. The testimony must still be kept up,
   the witness-bearing must become more constant. We must preach and teach
   and pray and work and live and, if necessary, die daily until this
   Jericho is stormed.

   Nor have we exhausted the metaphors with which our text supplies us,
   for surely we may add that God would have His people work in faith. We
   are told by Paul that, "by faith the walls of Jericho fell down." It
   seems to me that was a grand spectacle when the first man went forward
   step by step, and all the rest followed, the priests too, all of them
   confident that they were doing the best thing to make Jericho's
   ramparts fall to the ground. "Why," the fool might have said, "you are
   doing nothing. You are not loosening a single stone!" And at the end of
   the fifth or sixth day, I suppose it was suggested by many, "What is
   the good of it all?"

   But at least the most of those who encompassed the city were men of
   faith--or else it could not have been said, "by faith the walls of
   Jericho fell down." "Yes," they seemed to say, "she will come down! She
   will come down! She stands like a rock. She has not moved. There is not
   a beam loosed, nor a cord broken--not a house in ruins, nor a tent that
   has fallen--not a single stone that has crumbled from her battlements.
   But she shall come down!" And on they went with steady tramp--and
   though they saw no corpses blocking up their pathway and though their
   arms were not red with blood. Though they heard no shriek of those that
   flee and could utter no shout of victory--yet they were as confident as
   they were when the walls actually began to rock and the dust and smoke
   went up to Heaven--and the shrieks of the slain made glad their ears.

   We must encompass this city in full faith. Brethren, is the preaching
   of the Gospel a power? If you think it is not, never try it again. Is
   the Gospel mighty to save? Will the Gospel come out victorious? If you
   have any doubt, slink back to your cowardly repose and let the man whom
   God sends never doubt. If you have achieved no successes, if after
   fifty years your trumpet of jubilee is exceedingly small. If after
   fifty years it is something like a ram's horn that has not been bored
   and can not make any noise at all, yet still go on! Your time for
   shouting has not yet come, but your time for compassing the city is
   always present. Get on with it! Get on with it and God will not permit
   you to end till you have won the victory!

   So let us notice once more under this head of work--they worked with
   patience and courage. God kept this people laboring in the presence of
   difficulty. They were compassing the city, taking their walks, but
   always with the formidable walls of Jericho close under their eyes.
   Surely they must have had these walls photographed on their eyes and on
   their brains. "I shall know every stone in it," says one. "Six times I
   have been round, no, twelve times and the walls have not begun to
   rock--twelve times! Seven is a perfect number, but we have gone beyond
   it and yet the walls do not stir." "Mark well her bulwarks and count
   the towers on her."

   These men were practical surveyors of Jericho. They could well
   understand the strength of the battlements, how many feet long the huge
   stones were at the corners and how near the stars the loftiest towers
   were raised. They had the difficulty, I say, always before them! Yet
   they kept on in simple faith, going round the city. Sometimes we get
   into the habit of shutting our eyes to difficulty. That will not
   do--faith is not a fool! Faith does not shut her eyes to difficulty and
   then run headlong against a brick wall--never!

   Faith sees the difficulty, surveys it all and then she says, "By my God
   will I leap over a wall." And over the wall she goes. She never brings
   out the flaming accounts of, "signs of the times," in her favor. She
   does not sit down and say that evidently public sentiment is changing.
   She does not reckon upon any undercurrents that may be at work which
   she is told by Mistress Gossip really are doing great things. Faith
   just looks at it and does not mind how bad the thing is reported to be.
   If anybody can exaggerate the difficulty, Faith is of the same noble
   mind as that famous warrior who, when told there were so many thousand
   soldiers against him, replied, "There are so many more to be killed."

   Faith reckons--"So many more difficulties, so many more things to be
   overcome." And even impossibilities she puts down as only so much
   burden to be cast upon Him with whom nothing is impossible! She keeps
   Jericho's walls before her. And I would that we, dear Friends, knew
   more than we do--the perfect hopelessness of our work of seeking to
   convert Ireland to the Gospel--for there never was a task undertaken, I
   think, that had less hopefulness about it! I want you to be driven more
   and more to think, as far as the agency of man is concerned, that the
   thing is almost out of the category of the possible and out of the
   category of the probable altogether!

   And when you can get to that point and hear the voice, "Compass the
   city seven days," yet still have courage to go on, on,
   on--notwithstanding all the manifest difficulties--then when God has
   taught you your nothingness and brought you to feel that if victory is
   given it is all His and that Divine Omnipotence and Sovereignty must
   wear the crown--then, I say, He will make the old rampart rock! And the
   harlot of the seven hills shall rue the day when Israel shouts, when
   her sons are slain and God shall triumph right gloriously! God,
   however, would have His people work-- that is the first point--we are
   agreed on that. Let us unite to carry it out.

   "The sermon is not done" said one, when he came out of Church--"it is
   all said, but it is not all done." So let me close this head with
   saying that it is not done, it is only said. I have said that God would
   have His people work. Let us go and work. Let us begin tonight. If we
   have been lazy up to now--if there are any Issachars here like the
   strong ass crouching down between two burdens--just get up, Sir
   Issachar, and carry your burden! If there is any Brother here that has
   been saying, "God will have His own," let him mind what he is doing, or
   God will never have him, for God's own do not talk at that rate and do
   not say that God's purposes are to be an excuse for man's indifference.

   Let him shake that off, for he cannot take such a plea as that before
   the judgment bar. He knows he cannot. Therefore do not let him try it
   here. Let us try and work well for God. You in your Sunday school
   classes, you in your preaching stations, you in your tract
   distributions, you here in England. You, my Brethren, across the sea
   and you in the Emerald Isle still compassing the city seven times.

   II. We now come, in the second place, to consider that God would have
   His people WAIT. The delay must have sorely tried the faith and
   patience of the Israelites. "Time flies," and time is very precious.
   These Israelites must have thought, "Why make us wait? If we have to
   tarry a long while before the walls of Jericho, why then, what a time
   it will take to conquer all the interior. And if we begin with a long
   delay, our enemies may gather courage and before we have made our
   entrenchments behind which we may shield ourselves, the host will be
   upon us and we shall be cut to pieces."

   It must have seemed to every merely thoughtful person in the camp of
   Israel that it was imperative that the first city should be taken as
   speedily as possible so that the people might be encouraged and their
   enemies scattered. And it would give to those weary pilgrims some
   settled place to which they might retire with comfort, for they were, I
   suppose, still in their tents and longing for the time when, like the
   rest of the people of the land, they might dwell in their own houses.

   But they must keep quiet. And, according to present appearances, they
   must remain so indefinitely. The people could not tell how long they
   were to tarry there. And just observe, my Brethren, how very trying it
   must have been to them to wait. I do not know so much about the
   priests, for I am afraid priests are apt to be very contented with
   doing nothing, but not so with soldiers! There are a great many
   Brethren who seem to be perfectly satisfied to rest at ease. But men of
   war do not generally seem to be of that temperament.

   When I was in the military prison at Dublin I observed a form of
   punishment there. Men were carrying large shot. A man took up a large
   shot and carried it to the end of the yard and he afterwards had to
   pick that shot up and bring it back again. I said, "How is it that you
   do not let them take all the shot to that end and pile them up there?"
   The officer said, "We used to do so but it was no use, for when the
   fellows had piled them up they felt they were doing something. But now
   we make them carry the shot from one end of the yard to the other and
   then back again and back again and they feel they have to work hard and
   do nothing. That is always miserable work to a soldier."

   Many of our soldiers at Sebastopol made bitter complaints at not being
   led to battle. And you will often hear young military men say that they
   hate the inactivity of peace--they want to be doing something. Now
   these men of war were kept for six days marching round and round the
   city and they must have felt themselves to have been doing very little
   all that week. That is what I feel with regard to this Irish Society
   and there are many of us, too, who, if we speak plainly, must say that
   we think that we have done very little, sorry little.

   We remember two or three things that have been successes. And two or
   three things that have been a very long way from success. Sometimes we
   have complained that there have been asylums provided for Brethren sent
   yonder and we have wondered why such Brethren were sent at all. We have
   said, "Well, if this do-nothing affair is to keep on much longer, we
   must get others who will do something--for at present we are in this
   position--'What is John doing?' 'Nothing.' 'What is Tom doing?'
   'Helping John.' " We want to see something done and therefore it is
   hard to wait. but we must check ourselves. Our vehemence should urge us
   to use all proper means, though it should never be of that sort which
   would make us relax our efforts because we do not immediately achieve
   all the success which we desire.

   My Brethren in Christ Jesus, though as men of war we would rather come
   to close quarters and see more done, yet as men of God we must keep to
   our posts of duty and learn how to wait. Besides this, what rendered
   the waiting so very galling was, (what must have struck their reason,
   if it did not assail their faith), the utter desperateness of the case.
   How could they hope to win that city by simply going round and round?
   "Give me a good ladder," says one, "a rope ladder, and a couple of good
   irons at the end of it! Just let me hear the clank upon the top stone
   and I am your man to lead the 'forlorn hope!' And there are fifty
   thousand of us to follow and we will soon have Judah's standard waving
   on the top and make the sons of Jericho know what the sons of Abraham
   can do."

   But no. They must just march round the place till they have compassed
   the city twelve times. And so, Brethren, there are certain spirits apt
   to say, "Could not we do more by adopting these methods and such other
   expedients." See how certain of our Brethren of another denomination
   feel that if they can but get a golden ladder--if they get the
   assistance of the regium donum--in this way Jericho's walls may be
   scaled. And there is the temptation to look about us and ask for some
   assistance over and above the power which lies in the simple
   Gospel--but we must not do it! Away with our methods and State-crafts
   and policies. Away with the suggestions of the crafty and cunning and
   all the wisdom of the worldly! God forbid that we should glory but in
   the Cross of Christ!

   With the simplicity of children let us still believe that our Father's
   means are the best. And though as soldiers we cannot understand it, yet
   as children let us believe it and keep on compassing the city for
   Jericho's walls must fall--as sure as God is in Heaven. And I think
   there is another thing which must have made it difficult and it is
   this, that most probably the citizens of Jericho insulted them from the
   walls. I should think they kept far enough off to be out of
   arrow-shot--but yet it is just possible that if they could not hear the
   taunt, "What are these feeble Jews doing," yet they must have seen the
   tokens of impudence and impertinence which came from over the wall.

   This, mark you, is very galling to men of arms. We feel our hands
   fumbling at the hilts of our swords when provoked by the taunts and
   jeers of our enemies. "What have you done," they say, "you soupers and
   Protestants and Methodists and Presbyterians, against the invincible
   bulwarks of Rome? Your paper bullets--what have they accomplished
   against the iron walls of Babylon?" We can hear their jeers. We know
   the sound of revelry and mirth. But what of this? Though, again, I say,
   as soldiers we might grow courageous and dash rashly to the fight, or
   retire from it because there is nothing to be earned but dishonor--yet,
   as Christians we will do what seems absurd to reason--but what is ever
   justifiable to faith. We will keep on in God's own style. We will fight
   His battles by His methods and we doubt not that though it does seem a
   strange, mad thing--to attempt to drive out the priests from Ireland by
   the simple proclamation of the Truth of God--yet the day shall come
   when Wisdom shall be justified of all her children.

   Now, Brethren, we know that God has His reasons for making us wait. It
   is for His own Glory, we doubt not. We know that all things work
   together for good and we believe it will be ultimately for our profit.
   When I have read some masterly tragic poem, and verse after verse has
   dwelt upon the horrible portion of the tale, did I wish it shortened?
   Would I have had the author leave out one of those dark verses? Not I!
   It is true when the poem ended with a shout of victory and with the
   tramp of martial men through the city--when they returned in
   triumph--our heart leaped! We rejoiced when we came to that last
   stanza, but we wished the poem not shortened. We never wanted to have
   any of those verses blotted out.

   God is writing a great poem of human history. The subject is the
   victory of His Truth, the destruction of AntiChrist. Let the history be
   long. Who wants it shortened? Who wants a brief story on so exceedingly
   interesting a subject as this, from so great an Author? No, let it drag
   on what some may call its weary length--we are sure that when we come
   to read it, as God will write it, we shall wish the story longer! We
   will not complain of its extent, for the result is we shall see more of
   God and learn more of His mind. You want the millennium to come
   tomorrow, do you? May you get it, but I think it is probable you will
   not. I do not know how history appears to you who profess to understand
   it, but it does not read to me like a thing which is going to end just
   yet.

   I have always been told about the "signs of the times." There always
   were such speculations--in 1766 and 1666-- but the times of the end did
   not come. And I think they will not come now. It strikes me that we
   shall have something more elaborate yet than has ever come from the
   Divine pen and we may have to go not only through another canto, but
   through several more books before we shall come to the end of the
   story. One reason why I think the world's present state will not wind
   up for the present is because all the "prophets" say it will! And they
   have always been a lying generation, from the first even to the last. I
   mean the prophets who make the business profitable--who only use
   Scripture as the Norwood Gipsy uses the cards--who shuffle texts to
   foretell fortunes for nations and men.

   We shall go on many a day yet. We may have to wait for another century,
   yes, another twenty centuries, perhaps! We cannot tell. But our
   business is still to remember that it shall be, after all, for our
   eternal benefit and for God's everlasting Glory to keep on--to wait,
   wait, wait till we grow well-near weary. But the victory comes as
   surely, after all, as though it came at first. While we are waiting,
   however, I think it is well to take a little comfort from what we are
   doing. We are waiting--that is the posture of this Irish Society. But
   we may console ourselves in it, as the men who were compassing Jericho
   might have done. "Well," they could say, "we have not taken Jericho,
   but there is Rahab that has believed--there are a few saved--you can
   count them on your fingers almost, but they are very precious and they
   are of the kind which should be esteemed very valuable.

   There is Rahab. Her name is illustrious and her story, when it is told,
   has made many another Rahab seek and find a Savior. Not altogether
   without result was that attack on Jericho. And you have not lost your
   money, you that have subscribed to our Irish Society. There has been
   many a sinner saved and many can tell of eternal love that has sought
   out with eyes of patience eternity's choice jewels. They can tell of
   Divine Sovereignty that has made its crown to glisten and glitter
   forever with those precious things when found. You have had Rahab, yes,
   and you have had some that God has made useful to others. I can bear
   witness that there have come from Ireland some of the most earnest
   young men upon whom my eyes ever rested--good men and true--who love
   their Lord and Master and whose highest delight is to speak well of His
   name. You may wait patiently on that reflection.

   Moreover, the men of arms may say, "We do not take the city, it is
   true, but yet we keep our ground." If we were to leave Jericho we
   should be giving up our foothold in Canaan. And if we forsake Ireland,
   we might relinquish all hope of the Papacy falling. But we keep our
   foothold--at least we take our stand on the rock! We have taken legal
   possession of the land and, though little, it is like the handful which
   William the Conqueror took up when he said, "I have taken the seizin of
   England hereby." And though you may amalgamate the management of this
   Society with another, you will not give up the distinctive aim and
   object of the Society which is to keep a corner at least of the Emerald
   Isle for God and for His Christ.

   And then, again, they can say, "We are bearing testimony." Every man
   that looks over the wall of Jericho can see the Ark of the Covenant. He
   can see the troopers of God with their swords upon their thighs. They
   see what they never saw before! Oh, worshippers of idols, you see today
   the Ark of the true God borne round your walls! Oh you that bow to Baal
   and adore Ashtaroth, the gods of wood and stone, the true God, the
   Mighty One, Jehovah, is come out against you and the trumpets sound
   defiance to your power while the warriors of God shout for your
   overthrow! You are bearing testimony against the sin of Ireland. If you
   do not succeed, the time has not yet come for the shaking off the dust
   of your feet! In the meantime you must preach the Gospel for a
   testimony against them.

   And one thing more, I think the men at arms felt," We are on the spot
   when anything does occur." As they went round the wall they said, "It
   stands strong and stern, but it will yield and then we are all ready
   when the breach is made." You do not know what God may have in store
   for Ireland, or for any nation. According to the law which seems to
   regulate human society, there comes, every now and then, a great
   change. Who would have dreamed of the convulsions of 1848 that thrones
   would have been so unsettled and that crowns would fall from monarchs'
   heads? Such convulsions may come again. No, unless the course of nature
   is changed, must come.

   Then we are ready. We stand watching for the gap. O God, in Your
   eternal Providence be pleased now, even now, to send a convenient
   season. But if not, we will have the men ready when Your appointed time
   shall come. It was a grand thing when the earthquake came to shake the
   prison of Philippi that there should be a Paul and a Silas there ready
   to preach the sermon to the trembling jailor and his household! And so
   when the earthquake comes to Ireland, as it will come, we shall have a
   Paul and a Silas there. We may have many such, I trust. The more the
   better and all ready to stand up with, "Thus says the Lord!"

   Why what cannot God do? Has not He lately given you an installment of
   what He can accomplish in the revival which seemed to shake the North
   of Ireland? It is true it occurred in a part where Romanism is less
   strong--but the same power which can move the stolidity of
   Protestantism can stir the fiery zeal of what is genuine religion in
   its way--I mean genuine, though mistaken--because like Paul they think
   they do God a service. The hearty spirit of the Irishman with his
   popery may certainly be reached by Divine Omnipotence, as well as the
   soul of the Irishman of the North with his much colder creed.

   Let us have hope and go on compassing the city, not changing anything
   that is right and not neglecting that which is according to Scripture,
   but waiting till the time shall come. Now upon this I think I shall say
   no more, except again to ask friends practically to carry it out. Let
   us try and wait--wait patiently--not wait idly, but continue your
   subscriptions, continue your prayers, continue your interest in the
   Society, for God would have you wait.

   III. And, thirdly, God would have His people WIN. I shall not say much
   about this. We will postpone that till the time when it occurs and then
   we shall not need to have any sermons about it but can all come
   together and hold a meeting to praise and bless God. Only let us say
   that if the analogy is carried out according to the siege of Jericho,
   the victory is very sure and, when it comes forth, very complete.
   Nothing could be more so. It may be very sudden, also, and it will be
   very glorious.

   But we shall get nothing by it, for when Jericho fell nobody gained
   anything except to offer it unto the Lord--so we have to persevere in
   disinterested service--just toiling on for the Master, remembering that
   when success comes, it will be all His--every single atom of it. The
   Glory will be to Him and not to us and He will take care to send the
   success in such a manner that nobody shall be able to say, "Glory be to
   the Irish Society." Nobody shall be able to say, "Well done, Baptist
   denomination." No single minister or Evangelist shall be able to say,
   "Well done, myself." The one shout that shall go up to Heaven will be,
   "Hallelujah, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigns!"

   I have thus spoken for the Society. I was asked to preach for it and I
   am obliged, I think, to preach with a text that bears somewhat on the
   subject. I observe many sermons that are preached for Societies might
   just as well be preached any other day of the week before any other
   assembly on any other occasion. I do not know that is exactly what is
   needed, so if we have not dived deep into the doctrines of everlasting
   love, if we have not taken you to the Savior's Cross and offered you
   the invitations of the Gospel. If we have not done this and fifty
   thousand other things, there is a time for every purpose under Heaven.
   And to everyone there is a season and if we can keep the constituency
   of this Society working and waiting and make it in this way to come to
   be among the winning, we shall rejoice exceedingly!

   Brethren, let us begin to carry out the sermon now by our
   contributions. Let us begin to do so by our prayers. Let us act out the
   spirit of it by trying to tell others what the Gospel is. Be this the
   motto of us all--

   "Now will I tell sinners round What a dear Savior I have found. Point
   them to the redeeming blood, And cry, 'Behold the way to God.'" Yet I
   dare not sit down till I say to every soul here, and especially to you
   who cannot take an interest in God's work because you are not saved
   yourself--remember we do not ask you to save and look after the souls
   of Irishmen. Your own soul must be the first concern. And the way of
   salvation is simply this--"Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you
   shall be saved."

   He it is who stands in the gap and makes an atonement for sin. Take
   Christ to be your Atonement, your Justifier, your Salvation and your
   All. And believing in Him you are saved! This is your duty and must not
   be postponed any longer. You must begin the work at home. Enlist on the
   side of Israel by following Israel's Leader. Our heavenly Joshua is the
   Son of God, believe on Him and you shall find salvation through His
   blood and acceptance before God through Christ. Then go out to be the
   means of saving others and God speed you through His blessed Spirit.
   Amen.

                      The Holy Spirit Compared To The Wind

   A SERMON PREACHED BY C. H. SPURGEON AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE,
   NEWINGTON.

   "The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it, but
   cannot tell from where it comes and where it goes. So is everyone that
   is born of the Spirit."

   John 3:8.

   AT the present moment I am not able to enter fully into the subject of
   the new birth. I am very weary, both in body and mind and cannot
   attempt that great and mysterious theme. To everything there is a
   season and a time for every purpose under Heaven and it is not the time
   to preach upon regeneration when the head is aching, nor to discourse
   upon the new nature when the mind is distracted. I selected my text
   with the intention of fixing upon one great illustration which strikes
   me just now as being so suggestive, and with Divine assistance I may be
   able to work it out with profit to you and ease to myself.

   I shall endeavor to bring before you the parallel which our Savior here
   draws between the wind and the Holy Spirit. It is a remarkable fact,
   known, I dare say to most of you, that both in the Hebrew and Greek
   languages the same word is used for spirit and for wind--so that our
   Savior, as it were, rode upon the wings of the wind, while he was
   instructing the seeking Rabbi in the deep things of God. He caught at
   the very name of the wind as a means of fastening a spiritual truth
   upon the memory of the enquirer, hinting to us that language should be
   watched by the teacher that he may find out suitable words and employ
   those which will best assist the disciple to comprehend and to retain
   his teaching. "The wind," said He, "blows," and the very same word
   would have been employed if He had meant to say, "The Spirit blows
   where He wishes."

   There was intended, doubtless, to be a very close and intimate parallel
   between the Spirit of God and the wind, or otherwise the great Ruler of
   Providence who invisibly controlled the confusion of Babel would not
   have fashioned human language so that the same word should stand for
   both. Language, as well as nature, illustrates the wisdom of God! It is
   only in His light that we see light--may the Holy Spirit be graciously
   pleased to reveal Himself in His Divine operations to all our waiting
   minds.

   We are taught in God's Word that the Holy Spirit comes upon the sons of
   men and makes them new creatures. Until He enters them they are "dead
   in trespasses and sins." They cannot discern the things of God because
   Divine Truths of God are spiritual and spiritually discerned--and
   unrenewed men are carnal and possess not the power to search out the
   deep things of God. The Spirit of God creates new in the children of
   God and then in their new-born spirituality they discover and come to
   understand spiritual things, but not before. And, therefore, my beloved
   Hearers, unless you possess the Spirit, no metaphors, however simple,
   can reveal Him to you.

   Let us not mention the name of the Holy Spirit without due honor.
   Forever blessed are You, most glorious Spirit, co-equal and co-eternal
   with the Father and with the Son! Let all the angels of God worship
   You! Be You had in honor world without end!

   I. We will consider IN WHAT SENSE THE HOLY SPIRIT MAY BE COMPARED TO
   THE WIND. The Spirit of God, to help the spiritually-minded in their
   study of His Character and Nature condescends to compare Himself to
   dew, fire, oil, water and other suggestive types. And among the rest
   our Savior uses the metaphor of wind. What is the first thought here
   but that of mystery? It was the objection on the score of mystery which
   our Lord was trying to remove from the mind of Nicodemus. Nicodemus in
   effect, said, "I cannot understand it. How can it be? A man born again
   when he is old, created over again and that from an invisible agency
   from above? How can these things be?"

   Jesus at once directed his attention to the wind, which is none the
   less real and operative because of its mysterious origin and operation.
   You cannot tell from where the wind comes--you know it blows from the
   north or from the west--but at what particular place does that wind
   start on its journey? Where will it pause in its onward flight? You see
   that it is blowing to the east or to the west, but where is it going?
   From where did these particles of air originate which rush so rapidly
   past? Where are they going? By what law are they guided in their course
   and where will their journey end?

   The gale may be blowing due east here, but it may be driving west a
   hundred miles away. In one district the wind may be rushing from the
   north and yet not far from it there may be a strong current from the
   south. Those who ascend in balloons tell us that they meet with
   crosscurrents--one wind blowing in this direction and another layer of
   air moving towards an opposite quarter--how is this? If you have
   watched the skies you must occasionally have noticed a stream of clouds
   hurrying to the right, while higher up, another company is sailing to
   the left! It is a question whether thunder and lightning may not be
   produced by the friction of two currents of air traveling in different
   directions. But why is it that this current takes it into its head to
   go this way, while another steers for quite another port? Will they
   meet across each other's path in regions far away?

   Are there whirlpools in the air as in the water? Are there eddies,
   currents, rivers of air, lakes of air? Is the whole atmosphere like the
   sea, only composed of less dense matter? If so, what is it that stirs
   up that great deep of air and bids it howl in the hurricane and then
   constrains it to subside into the calm? The philosopher may scheme some
   conjecture to prove that the "trade winds" blow at certain intervals
   because of the sun crossing the equator at those periods and that there
   must necessarily be a current of air going towards the equator because
   of the rarefaction. But he cannot tell you why the weathercock on
   yonder church steeple turned this morning from south-west to due east.

   He cannot tell me why it is that the sailor finds that his sails are at
   one time filled with wind and in a few minutes they fall loosely about
   so that he must steer upon another tack if he would make headway. The
   various motions of the air remain a mystery to all but the infinite
   Jehovah. My Brethren, the like mystery is observed in the work of the
   Spirit of God. His Person and work are not to be comprehended by the
   mind of man. He may be here tonight, but you cannot see Him--He speaks
   to one heart, but others cannot hear His voice. He is not recognizable
   by the unrefined senses of the unregenerate.

   The spiritual man discerns Him, feels Him, hears Him and delights in
   Him, but neither wit nor learning can lead a man into the secret. The
   Believer is often bowed down with the weight of the Spirit's Glory, or
   lifted up upon the wings of His majesty. But even he knows not how
   these feelings are worked in him. The fire of holy life is at seasons
   gently fanned with the soft breath of Divine comfort, or the deep sea
   of spiritual existence stirred with the mighty blast of the Spirit's
   rebuke. But still it is forevermore a mystery how the eternal God comes
   into contact with the finite mind of His creature, man. God is filling
   all Heaven, meanwhile, and yet dwelling in a human body as in a
   temple--occupying all space and yet operating upon the will, the
   judgment, the mind of the poor insignificant creature called man.

   We may enquire, but who can answer us? We may search, but who shall
   lead us into the hidden things of the Most High? He brooded over chaos
   and produced order, but who shall tell us after what fashion He worked?
   He overshadowed the Virgin and prepared a body for the Son of God, but
   into this secret who shall dare pry? His is the anointing, sealing,
   comforting and sanctifying of the saints--but how does He work all
   these things? He makes intercession for us according to the will of
   God. He dwells in us and leads us into all the Truths of God--but who
   among us can explain to his fellow man the order of the Divine working?

   Though veiled from human eye like the Glory which shone between the
   cherubim, we believe in the Holy Spirit and therefore see Him. But if
   our faith needed to sustain it, we should never believe at all. Mystery
   is far from being all which the Savior would teach by this simile.
   Surely He meant to show us that the operations of the Spirit are like
   the wind for Divinity. Who can create a wind? The most ambitious of
   human princes would scarcely attempt to turn, much less to send forth,
   the wind! These steeds of the storm know no bit nor bridle, neither
   will they come at any man's bidding. Let our senators do what they
   will, they will scarcely have the madness to legislate the winds!

   Old Boreas, as the heathens called him, is not to be bound with chains
   and welded on an earthly anvil, or in a vulca-nian forge. "The wind
   blows where it wishes." And it does so because God directs it and
   suffers it not to stay for man nor to tarry for the sons of men. So
   with the Spirit of God. All the true operations of the Spirit are due
   in no sense whatever to man, but always to God and to His Sovereign
   will. Revivalists may get up excitement with the best intentions and
   may warm peoples' hearts till they begin to cry out, but all this ends
   in nothing unless it is Divine work. Have I not said scores of times
   from this pulpit, "All that is of Nature's spinning must be unraveled"?

   Every particle which Nature puts upon the foundation will turn out to
   be but "wood, hay and stubble," and will be consumed. It is only "the
   gold, the silver and the precious stones" of God's building that will
   stand the fiery test. "You must be born again from above," for human
   regenerations are lies. You may blow with your mouth and produce some
   trifling effects upon trifles as light as air. Man in his zeal may set
   the windmills of silly minds in motion. But, truly, to stir men's
   hearts with substantial and eternal Truths of God needs a celestial
   breeze such as the Lord alone can send!

   Did not our Lord also intend to hint at the Sovereignty of the Spirit's
   work? For what other reason did He say, "The wind blows where it
   wishes?" There is an arbitrariness about the wind. It does just as it
   pleases and the laws which regulate its changes are unknown to man.
   "Free as the wind," we say--"the wild winds." So is the mighty working
   of God! It is a very solemn thought and one which should tend to make
   us humble before the Lord--that we are, as to the matter of
   salvation--entirely in His hands! If I have a moth in my hand tonight I
   can bruise its wings, or I can crush it at my will and by no attempts
   of its own can it escape from me. And every sinner is absolutely in the
   hands of God and--let him remember he is in the hand of an angry God,
   too.

   The only comfort is that he is in the hand of a God who, for Jesus'
   sake, delights to have mercy upon even the vilest of the vile. Sinner,
   God can give you the Holy Spirit if He wills. But if He should say
   concerning you, "Let him alone," your fate is sealed, your damnation is
   sure! It is a thought which some would say is "enough to freeze all
   energy." Beloved, I would to God it would freeze the energy of the
   flesh and make the flesh dead in the sense of powerlessness--for God
   never truly begins to show His might till we have seen an end of all
   human power. I tell you, Sinner, you are as dead concerning spiritual
   things as the corpse that is laid in its coffin! No, as the corpse that
   is rotting in its grave and has become, like Lazarus in the tomb,
   stinking and offensive.

   There is a voice that can call you forth out of your sepulcher, but if
   that voice comes not remember where you are-- justly damned, justly
   ruined, justly cut off forever from all hope. What do you say? Do you
   tremble at this? Do you cry, "O God! Have pity upon me"? He will hear
   your cry, Sinner, for there never yet was a sincere cry that went up to
   Heaven, though it were ever so feeble, but what it had an answer of
   peace. When one of the old saints lay dying, he could only say, "O
   Lord, I trust You languida fide," with a languid faith. It is poor work
   that, but, oh, it is safe work. You can only trust Christ with a feeble
   faith. If it is such a poor trembling faith that it does not grip Him,
   but only touchesthe hem of His garment, it nevertheless saves you!

   If you can lookat Him, though it is only a great way off, yet it saves
   you. And oh, what a comfort this is, that you are still on pleading
   terms with Him and in a place of hope! "Whoever believes is not
   condemned." But, oh, do not trifle with the day of Divine Grace, lest
   having frequently heard the warning, and hardened your neck just as
   often, you should "suddenly be destroyed and that without remedy!" If
   He shuts you out, none can bid you come in! If He does but close the
   iron bar, you are shut out in the darkness of obstinacy, obduracy and
   despair forever--the victim of your own delusions!

   Sinner, if God saves you, He shall have all the glory--for He has a
   right to do as He wills--for He says, "I will have mercy on whom I will
   have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."
   But still, I think I have not yet brought out what is in the text. Do
   you not think that the text was intended to show the varied methods in
   which the Spirit of God works in the conversion and regeneration of
   men? "The wind blows where it wishes." Now observe the different force
   of the wind. This afternoon the wind seemed as if it would tear up
   every tree and doubtless, had they been in leaf, many of those noble
   princes of the forest must have stretched themselves prone upon the
   earth. But God takes care that in these times of boisterous gales there
   should be no leaf and therefore the wind gets but little purchase with
   which to drag up a tree.

   But the wind does not always blow as it did this afternoon. On a
   summer's evening there is such a gentle zephyr that even the gnats who
   have been arranging a dance among themselves are not disturbed, but
   keep to their proper places. Yes, the aspen seems as if it could be
   quiet, though you know it keeps forever quivering, according to the old
   legend that it was the tree on which the Savior hung and therefore
   trembles still as though through fear of the sin which came upon it. It
   is but a legend. There are times when all is still and calm, when
   everything is quiet and you can scarcely detect the wind at all.

   Now just so it is with the Spirit of God. To some of us He came like a
   "rushing mighty wind." Oh, what tearing of soul there were then! My
   spirit was like a sea tossed up into tremendous waves, made, as Job
   says, "To boil like a pot," till one would think the deep were hoary.
   Oh, how that wind came crashing through my soul and every hope I had
   was bowed as the trees of the wood in the tempest! Read the story of
   John Bunyan's conversion--it was just the same. Turn to Martin
   Luther--you find his conversion of the same sort. So might I mention
   hundreds of biographies in which the Spirit of God came like a tornado
   sweeping everything before it and the men could not but feel that God
   was in the whirlwind.

   To others He comes so gently they cannot tell when first the Spirit of
   God came. They recollect that night when mother prayed so with brothers
   and sisters and when they could not sleep for hours because the big
   tears stood in their eyes on account of sin. They recollect the Sunday
   school and the teacher there. They remember that earnest minister. They
   cannot say exactly when they gave their hearts to God and they cannot
   tell about any violent convictions. They are often comforted by that
   text, "One thing I know, whereas I was blind, now I see." But they
   cannot get any farther--they sometimes wish they could.

   Well, they need not wish it, for the Spirit of God, as a Sovereign,
   will always choose His own way of operation. And if it is but the wind
   of the Holy Spirit, remember it is as saving in its gentleness as in
   its terror and is as efficient to make us new creatures when it comes
   with the zephyr's breath as when it comes with the hurricane's force.
   Do not quarrel with God's way of saving you! If you are brought to the
   Cross be thankful for it--Christ will not mind how you got there. If
   you can say, "He is all my salvation and all my desire," you never came
   to that without the Spirit of God bringing you to it. Do not,
   therefore, think you came the wrong way, for that is impossible!

   Again, the wind not only differs in force, but it differs in direction.
   We have been saying several times the wind is always shifting. Perhaps
   there never were two winds that did blow exactly in the same direction.
   I mean that if we had power to detect the minute points of the compass,
   there would be found some deviation in every current, although, of
   course, for all practical purposes it blows from certain distinct
   points which the mariner marks out. Now, the Spirit of God comes from
   different directions.

   You know very well, dear Friends, that sometimes the Spirit of God will
   blow with mighty force from one denomination of Christians. Then
   suddenly they seem to be left and God will raise up another body of
   Christians, fill them with Himself and qualify them for usefulness. In
   the days of Wesley and Whitefield there was very little of the Divine
   Spirit anywhere except among the Methodists. I am sure they have not a
   monopoly of Him now. The Divine Spirit blows also from other quarters.
   Sometimes He uses one man, sometimes another. We hear of a revival in
   the North of Ireland. By-and-by it is in the South of Scotland. It
   comes just as God wills, for direction.

   And you know, too, dear Friends, it comes through different
   instrumentalities in the same Church. Sometimes the wind blows from
   this pulpit--God blesses me to your conversion. Another time it is from
   my good sister, Mrs. Bartlett's class. On a third occasion it is the
   Sunday school. Again, it may be another class, or the preaching of the
   young men, or from the individual exertion of private Believers. God
   causes that wind to blow just which way He wills. He works, also,
   through different texts of Scripture. You were converted and blessed
   under one text--it was quite another that was made useful to me.

   Some of you were brought to Christ by terrors, others of you by love,
   by sweet wooing words. The wind blows as God directs. Now, dear
   Friends, whenever you take up a religions biography, do not sit down
   and say, "Now I will see whether I am just like this person." Nonsense!
   God never repeats Himself. Men make steel pens--thousands of grosses of
   them--all alike, but I will be bound to say that in quills from the
   common, there are no two of them precisely the same. If you look, you
   will soon discover that they differ in a variety of ways. Certain
   gardeners cut their trees into the shape of cheeses and a number of
   unnatural forms, but God's trees do not grow that way, they grow just
   anyway--gnarl their roots and twist their branches.

   Great painters do not continually paint the same picture again and
   again and again, and my Divine Master never puts His pencil on the
   canvas to produce the same picture twice. Every Christian is a distinct
   work of Divine Grace on God's part which has in it some originality,
   some portion distinct from all others. I do not believe in trying to
   make all history uniform. It is said that Richard III had a humpback.
   Whether he really was deformed, or whether history gave him the
   humpback, I cannot tell. But it is said that all his courtiers thought
   it was the most beautiful humpback that ever was seen and they all
   began to grow humpbacks, too!

   And I have known ministers who had some peculiar idiosyncrasy of
   experience which was nothing better than a spiritual humpback--but
   their people all began to have humpbacks, too--to think and talk all in
   the same way and to have the same doubts and fears. Now that will not
   do! It is not the way in which the Most High acts with regard to the
   wind and if He chooses to take all the points of the compass and make
   use of them all, let us bless and glorify His name! Are not the
   different winds various in their qualities? Few of us like an east
   wind. Most of us are very glad when the wind blows from the south.
   Vegetation seems to love much the south-west.

   A stiff northeaster is enough to make us perish. And long continuance
   of the north may well freeze the whole earth! While from the west the
   wind seems to come laden with health from the deep blue sea. And though
   sometimes too strong for the sick, yet it is never a bad time when the
   west wind blows. The ancients all had their different opinions about
   wind. Some were dry, some were rainy. Some affected this disease, some
   touched this part of men, some the other. Certain it is that God's Holy
   Spirit has different qualities. In the Canticles He blows softly with
   the sweet breath of love. Look farther and you get that same Spirit
   blowing fiercely with threats and denunciation.

   Sometimes you find Him convicting the world "of sin, of righteousness,
   of judgment." That is the north wind. At other times opening up Christ
   to the sinner and giving him joy and comfort. That is the south wind
   that blows softly and gives a balminess in which poor troubled hearts
   rejoice. And yet "all these works the same Spirit." Indeed, my subject
   is all but endless, and therefore I must stop. But even in the matter
   of duration you know how the wind will sometimes blow six weeks in this
   direction and, again, continue in another direction. And the Spirit of
   God does not always work with us--He does as He pleases--He comes and
   He goes. We may be in a happy hallowed frame at one time, and at
   another we may have to cry, "Come from the four winds, O Breath!"

   II. We will consider. in the second place, THE PARALLEL BETWEEN THE
   HOLY SPIRIT AND THE EFFECTS OF THE WIND. "You hear the sound of it."
   Ah, that we do! The wind sometimes wails as if you could hear the cry
   of mariners far out at sea, or the moans of the widows that must weep
   for them. And, oh, the Spirit of God sets men wailing with an
   exceedingly bitter cry for sin, as one that is in sorrow for his
   first-born.

   "You hear the sound of it." Oh, it is a blessed sound, that wailing!
   Angels rejoice over "one sinner that repents." Then comes the wind at
   another time with a triumphant sound, and if there is an Aeolian harp
   in the window, how it swells, sweeps, descends--then rises again! It
   gives all the tones of music and makes the air glad with its jubilant
   notes. So with the Holy Spirit--sometimes He gives us faith, makes us
   bold--other times full of assurance, confidence, joy and peace in
   believing. "You hear the sound" of a full diapason of the Holy Spirit's
   mighty melody within the soul of man filling him with peace and joy and
   rest and love.

   Sometimes the wind comes, too, with another sound as though it were
   contending. You heard it, perhaps, this afternoon. We who are a little
   in the country hear it more than you do--it is as though giants were
   struggling in the sky together. It seems as if two seas of air, both
   lashed to fury, met and dashed against some unseen cliffs with terrible
   uproar. The Spirit of God comes into the soul sometimes and makes great
   contention with the flesh. Oh, what a stern striving there is against
   unbelief, against lust, against pride, against every evil thing.

   "You hear the sound of it." You that know what Divine experience
   means--you know when to go forth to fight your sins. When you can hear
   "the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees," then you
   bestir yourself to destroy your sins. Sometimes the wind comes with a
   sweep as though it were going on forever. It comes past and dashes
   through the trees, sweeping away the rotten branches. Then away it goes
   across the Alps, dashing down an avalanche in its course, still onward.
   And as it flies, it blows away everything that is frail and weak. And
   on, on, on it speeds its way to some unknown goal.

   And thus it is sometimes the Spirit of God will come right through us,
   as if He were bearing us away to that spiritual heritage which is our
   sure future destiny--bearing away coldness, barrenness, everything
   before it. We do not lament then that we do not pray. We do not believe
   that we cannotpray--"I can do everything," is our joyful shout as we
   are carried on the wings of the wind. "You hear the sound of it." I
   hope you have heard it sometimes in all its powerful, overwhelming,
   mighty influence till your soul has been blown away.

   "You hear the sound of it." But then the wind does something more than
   make a sound. And so does the Holy Spirit. It WORKS and produces
   manifest results. Just think what the wind is doing tonight. I cannot
   tell at what pitch it may be now. It is just possible that in some part
   of the ocean a vessel scuds along almost under bare poles. The mariners
   do their best to reef the sails--away she goes--now the mast is
   gone--they do their best to bear up but they find that in the teeth of
   the gale they cannot stand.

   The ship dashes on the rocks and she is wrecked. And, oh, the Spirit of
   God is a great wrecker of false hopes and carnal confidences! I have
   seen the Spirit of God come to a sinner like a storm to a ship at sea.
   He had to take down the top gallants of the sinner's pride. Then every
   thread of carnal confidence had to be reefed and then his hope, itself,
   had to be cut away. And on, on the vessel went, until she struck a rock
   and down she went. The man from that time never dared trust in his
   merits for he had seen his merits wrecked and broken in pieces by the
   wind.

   The wind, too, remember, is a great leveler. It always aims at
   everything that is high. If you are down low in the street you escape
   its fury. But climb to the top of the Monument, or St. Paul's and see
   whether you do not feel it! Get into the valley, it is all right. The
   lower branches of the trees are scarcely moved, but the top branches
   are rocked to and fro by it. It is a great leveler! So is the Holy
   Spirit. He never sees a man high but He brings him down. He makes every
   high thought bow before the majesty of His might.

   And if you have any high thoughts tonight, rest assured that when the
   Spirit of God comes He will lay them low, even with the ground. Now do
   not let this make you fear the Holy Spirit. It is a blessed thing to be
   rocked so as to have our hopes tested and it is a precious thing to
   have our carnal confidences shaken. And how blessedly the wind purifies
   the atmosphere! In the Swiss valleys there is a heaviness in the air
   which makes the inhabitants unhealthy. They take quinine and you see
   them going about with big swellings in their necks.

   From Martigny to Bretagne, there is a great valley in which you will
   see hundreds of persons diseased. The reason is that the air does not
   circulate. They are breathing the same air, or some of it, that their
   fathers breathed before them. There seems to be no ventilation between
   the two parts of the giant Alps and the air never circulates. But if
   they have a great storm which sweeps through the valleys it is a great
   blessing to the people. And so the Spirit of God comes and cleanses out
   our evil thoughts and vain imaginations--and though we do not like the
   hurricane, yet it brings spiritual health to our soul.

   Again the wind is a great trier of the nature of things. Here comes a
   great rushing up the street. It sweeps over the heaps of rubbish lying
   in the road. Away goes all the light chaff, paper and other things
   which have no weight in them! They cannot stand the brunt of its
   whirling power. But see, the pieces of iron, the stones and all weighty
   things are left unmoved. In the country you will often see the farmer
   severing the chaff from the wheat by throwing it up into a current of
   air and the light husks all blow away, while the heavy wheat sinks on
   the heap, cleansed and purified. So is the Holy Spirit the great
   testing power and the result of His operations will be to show men what
   they are.

   Here is a hypocrite, he has passed muster up to now and reckons himself
   to be a true and genuine man. But there comes a blast from Heaven's
   mighty Spirit and he finds himself to be lighter than vanity--he has no
   weight in him, he is driven on and has no rest. He can find no peace.
   He hurries from one refuge of lies to another. "There is no peace, says
   my God, to the wicked." Thus also we try the doctrines of men, we bring
   the breath of Inspiration to bear upon them--do they abide the test? Or
   are they driven away? Can you hold that truth in the presence of God?
   Can you cling to it and find it stable in the hour of trial?

   Is it a nice pleasant speculation for a sunny day when all is calm and
   bright, or will it bear the rough rude blast of adversity when God's
   Holy Spirit is purifying you with His healthful influence? True
   Christians and sound doctrines have ballast and weight in them--they
   are not moved nor driven away. But empty professors and hollow dogmas
   are scattered like chaff before the wind when the Lord shall blow upon
   them with the breath of His Spirit. Therefore examine yourselves--try
   the doctrines and see if they are of God. "What is the chaff to the
   wheat?" says the Lord.

   Have root in yourselves--then you will not wither in the hot blast, nor
   be driven away in the tempestuous day. Is not the Spirit moreover like
   unto the wind in its developing of character? See the dust is lying all
   over the picture, you cannot see the fair features of the beauteous
   sketch beneath. Blow off the dust and the fine colors will be seen and
   once more the skill of the painter will be admired. Have you ever
   noticed some piece of fine mosaic, or perhaps some well-cut engraving
   on metal all hidden and the fine lines filled up with dust?

   You have blown off the accumulation and then you could admire the work.
   So does the Spirit of God. Men get all covered with dust in the hot
   dusty roadside of life till they are nearly the color of the earth
   itself. But they come to the hilltop of Calvary and here they stand
   till the wind of Heaven has cleansed them from all the dust that has
   gathered around their garments. Oh there is nothing like communion with
   the Spirit of God to counteract the earthly tendencies of a business
   life! There are some men that get covered with a yellow dust till they
   are almost hidden by it. They can talk of nothing else but money. Gold,
   gold, gold is getting to occupy nearly every thought.

   Now I have no quarrel with money in its right place, but I do not like
   to see men live in it. I always try to drive away that mean and
   groveling spirit which lives for nothing else but to accumulate money,
   but I cannot always succeed. Now the Spirit of God will make a man see
   his folly and put his money into its right position and place the
   Graces of the Christian character where men can see them and glorify
   God in them. Never let your business character or professional skill
   dim and hide your Christianity. If you do, God's Spirit will come to
   brighten you up and He will have no mercy on these, but will, in love
   to your soul, cleanse and give luster to God's work which is worked in
   you.

   I have also noticed how helpful the wind is to all who choose to avail
   themselves of it. In Lincolnshire, where the country is flat and below
   the level of the sea, they are obliged to drain the land by means of
   windmills and hundreds of them may be seen pumping up the water so as
   to relieve the land of the excess moisture. In many parts of the
   country nearly all the wheat and corn is ground by means of the wind.
   If it were not for the wind the inhabitants would be put to great
   inconvenience.

   The Spirit of God is thus also a mighty helper to all who will avail
   themselves of His influences. You are inundated with sin, a flood of
   iniquity comes in--you can never bale out the torrent. But with the
   help of God's Spirit it can be done! He will so assist that you shall
   see the flood gradually descending and your heart once more purified.
   You need always to ask His help--fresh sin, like falling showers, will
   be poured into you by every passing day and you will need a continuous
   power to cast it out--you may have it in God's Spirit! He will, with
   ceaseless energy, help you to combat sin and make you more than a
   conqueror!

   Or, on the other hand, if you need some power to break up and prepare
   your spiritual food for you, you will find no better help than what
   God's Spirit can give. In Eastern countries they grind corn by hand,
   two sitting at a small stone mill. But it is a poor affair at best--so
   are our own vain attempts to prepare the bread of Heaven for ourselves.
   We shall only get a little and that little badly ground. Commentators
   are good in their way, but give me the teaching of the Holy Spirit. He
   makes the passage clear and gives me to eat of the finest wheat. How
   often we have found our utter inability to understand some part of
   Divine Truth--we asked some of God's people and they helped us a
   little--but after all, we were not satisfied till we took it to the
   Throne of heavenly Grace and implored the teachings of the blessed
   Spirit!

   Then how sweetly it was opened to us! We could eat of it spiritually.
   It was no longer husk and shell, hard to be understood. It was as bread
   to us and we could eat to the full. Brethren, we must make more use of
   the wisdom which comes from above, for the Spirit, like the wind, is
   open to us all to employ for our own personal benefit. I see also here
   a thought as to the co-operation of man and the Spirit in all Christian
   work. It has pleased God to make us co-workers with Him--fellow
   laborers--both in the matter of our own salvation and also in the
   effort to benefit others. Look for a moment at yon stately boat--she
   moves not becauseof her sails but she would not reach the desired haven
   without them.

   It is the windwhich propels her forward--but the wind would not act
   upon her as it does unless she had the rigging all fixed--her masts
   standing and her sails all bent so as to catch the passing breeze. But
   now that human seamanship has done its best, see how she flies! She
   will soon reach her haven with such a favoring gale as that. You have
   only to stand still and see how the wind bears her on like a thing of
   life. And so it is with the human heart. When the Spirit comes to the
   soul that is ready to receive such influences, then He helps you on to
   Christian Grace and Christian work and makes you bear up through all
   opposition till you come to the port of peace and can anchor safely
   there. Without Him we can do nothing--without us He will not work.

   We are to preach the Gospel to every creature and while one plants and
   another waters, God adds the increase. We are to work out our own
   salvation--He works in us to will and to do of His own good pleasure.
   We must go up to possess the goodly land with our own spear and
   sword--but the hornet goes before us to drive out the foe. Jericho
   shall be captured by a Divine and miraculous interference, but even
   there rams' horns shall find a work to do and must be employed. The
   host of Midian shall be slain, but our cry is, "The sword of the Lord
   and of Gideon." We give God all the glory, nevertheless we use the
   means.

   The water of Jordan must be sought out and used by all who desire a
   cleansing like Naaman the Syrian. A lump of figs must be used if other
   Hezekiahs are to be healed--but the Spirit is, after all, the great
   Cleanser and Healer of His people Israel. The lesson is clear to
   all--the wind turns mills that men make. It fills sails that human
   hands have spread.

   And the Spirit blesses human effort, crowns with success our labors,
   establishes the work of our hands upon us and teaches all through that,
   "the hand of the diligent makes rich." And, "if a man will not work,
   neither shall he eat."

   Another thought suggests itself to my mind in connection with the wind
   and human effort. It is this--How completely dependent men are upon the
   wind as to what it shall do for them. They are entirely at its mercy as
   to its time of blowing, its strength and the direction it will take. I
   have already dwelt upon this thought of the sovereignty of the wind,
   but it comes up here in a more practical form. The steamer now can
   steer almost anywhere they please and at all times it will proceed on
   its voyage.

   But the sailing ship must tack according to the wind and when becalmed
   must wait for the breeze to spring up. The watermill and steam mill can
   be worked night and day, but the mill that depends upon the wind must
   abide by the wind's times of blowing and must turn round its sails so
   as to suit the direction of the current of air. In like manner we are
   compelled to wait on the pleasure of the Spirit. There is no reservoir
   of water which we can turn on when we will and work as we please. We
   would forget God far more than we do now if that were the case. The
   sailor who is depending on the wind anxiously looks up to the masthead
   to see how the breeze is shifting and turning round the vane. And he
   scans the heavens to see what weather he is likely to have.

   He would not need to care nearly so much as he does now that he is
   absolutely dependent on the wind, if he had steam power so as to sail
   in the very teeth of the storm if he so willed. God, then, keeps us
   looking up to Heaven by making us to be completely at His mercy as to
   the times and ways of giving us His helping power. It is a blessed
   thing to wait on God, watching for His hand and in quiet contentment
   leaving all to Him. Brethren, let us do our part faithfully, spread
   every sail, make all as perfect as human skill and wisdom can direct
   and then in patient continuance in well-doing, wait the Spirit' s
   propitious gales, neither murmuring because He tarries, nor be taken
   unawares when He comes upon us in His Sovereign pleasure to do that
   which seems good in His sight.

   Now tonight I have only given you some hints on this subject--you can
   work it out for yourselves. As you hear the wind you may get more
   sermons out of it than I can give you just now. The thing is perfectly
   inexhaustible. And I think the business of the minister is not to say
   all that can be said about the subject. Somebody remarked concerning a
   certain minister that he was a most unfair preacher because he always
   exhausted the subject and left nothing for anybody else to say.

   That will never be said of me and I would rather that it should not. A
   minister should suggest germs of thought, open up new ways and present,
   if possible, the Truth of God in such a method as to lead men to
   understand that the half is not told them. And now, my dear Hearer,
   whether you listen often to my voice or have now stepped in for the
   first time I would like to ring this in your ear. Do you know the
   Spirit of God? If you have not the Spirit, you are none of His. "You
   must be born again." "What, Lord, 'MUST?' Do You not mean 'may?' " No,
   you must. "Does it not mean, 'You can be?' " No, you must. When a man
   says, "must," it all depends upon who he is. When God says, "must,"
   there it stands and it cannot be questioned.

   There are the flames of Hell--would you escape from them? You must be
   born again. There are Heaven's glories sparkling in their own
   light--would you enjoy them? You must be born again! There is the peace
   and joy of a Believer, would you have it? You must be born again. What,
   not a crumb from off the table without this? No, not one. Not a drop of
   water to cool your burning tongues except you are born again. This is
   the one condition that never changes. God never alters it and never
   will.

   You must, must, MUST. Which shall it be? Shall your will stand, or
   God's will? O, let God's "must" ride right over you and bow yourselves
   down and say, "Lord, I must! Then I will! Ah, and it has come to
   this--I must tonight. Give me Christ, or else I die. I have hold of the
   knocker of the door of Your mercy and I must, I WILL get that door
   open. I will never let You go except You bless me! You say, must, Lord,
   and I say, must, too." "You must, you must be born again." God fulfill
   the "must" in each of your cases, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

                           Consider Before You Fight

   A SERMON PREACHED BY C. H. SPURGEON AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE,
   NEWINGTON.

   "What king, going to make war against another king, sits not down first
   and consults whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that
   comes against him with twenty thousand? Or else, while the other is yet
   a great way off, he sends a delegation and desires conditions of
   peace." Luke 14:31,32.

   EVERY sensible man endeavors to adapt his purposes to his strengths. He
   does not begin to build a house which he will not be able to finish,
   nor commence a war which he cannot hope to fight through. The religion
   of Christ is the most reasonable one in the world and Jesus Christ
   never desires to have any disciples who shall blindly follow Him
   without counting the cost. We always esteem it to be a happy thing when
   we can get men to sit down and consider. The most of you are so full of
   other thoughts and so occupied with the world--ever running here and
   there about your ordinary business--that we cannot get you to think, or
   calmly sit down and soberly look at things in the light of eternity and
   weigh them deliberately as you ought.

   And yet it is only reasonable that the Master should ask you to do for
   Him, with regard to your spiritual matters, what you will admit that
   every sensible man does continually in his business! You are poor
   traders if you never count your stock. You are likely to be, before
   long, in bankruptcy court if there is no periodical examination of
   accounts. And so Christ would have you sit down, sometimes, and take
   stock as to where you are, and what you are. And then figure up by some
   sort of arithmetic by which you may come to a truthful calculation,
   what you are able to do and not to do. And what, therefore, it is
   reasonable and unreasonable for you to undertake and where your
   position ought and where it ought not to be.

   I especially invite, this evening, those who are unconverted in this
   assembly to some few thoughts upon the war in which they are engaged
   with God. I am hoping that perhaps if they consider a little upon it,
   they will send a delegation and desire peace. When I have spoken upon
   that, there will be some, perhaps, who will he running away with the
   idea that they will at once be at peace with God and make war with
   Satan. But I shall want to pin them down a moment and make them
   estimate their chances of victory in such a war as that and see whether
   they are able to meet the Black Prince of Darkness in their own
   strength.

   We will try, if we can, to make it tonight the subject of a little
   homely talk about our souls and a little earnest personal consideration
   about our future.

   I. First, then, THERE ARE SOME HERE WHO ARE NOT THE FRIENDS OF GOD, and
   in this case he that is not with Him is against Him. If you cannot look
   up to God and say, "My Father," and feel that your heart beats true to
   Him, then remember it is a fact that you are His enemy. If you could
   have what you wish there would be no God. If it were in your power you
   would never trouble yourself again with thoughts of Him. You would like
   to live, you say, as you wish, and I know how you would wish to live.
   It would be anyway but as God commands.

   Now, as you are engaged in antagonism with Him, just think awhile--Can
   you expect to succeed? Are you likely to win the day? You have entered
   into a conflict with His Law--you do not intend to keep it. With His
   day, you do not regard it. You are thus at war with God! Now, is it
   likely that you will be successful? Is there a chance for you? If there
   is, why then, perhaps, it may be as well to go on. If you can conquer
   GOD, if the battlements of Glory may yet see the flag of sin waved
   triumphant there, why, Man, then try it!

   There will be at least an ambition worthy of Satan who desired sooner
   to reign in Hell than to be ruled by Heaven! But is there any hope for
   you? Let me put a few things before you which may, perhaps, make you
   think the conflict too unequal and thus lead you to abandon the thought
   at once. Think of God's stupendous power! What is there which He cannot
   do? We see but little of God's power comparatively in our land. Now and
   then there comes a crash of thunder in a storm and we look up with
   amazement when He sets the heavens on blaze with His lightning.

   But go and do business on the deep waters. Let your vessel fly before
   the howling hurricane! Mark how every staunch timber seems to crack as
   though it were but match board and the steady mast goes by the board
   and snaps and is broken to shivers. Mark what God does when He stirs up
   the great deep and seems to bring Heaven down and lift the earth up
   till the elements mingle in a common mass of tempest!

   Then go to the Alps and listen to the thunder of the avalanche. Stand
   amazed as you look down some grim precipice, or peer with awe-struck
   wonder into the blue mysteries of a crevasse! See the leaping
   waterfalls and mark those frozen seas, the glaciers, as they come
   sweeping down the mountain side. Stay awhile till a storm shall gather
   there and Alp shall talk to Alp and those white prophetic heads shall
   seem to bow while the wings of tempest cover them! There you may learn
   something of the power of God amidst the crash of Nature.

   If you could have stood by the side of Dr. Woolfe, when rising early
   one morning, he went out of Aleppo and upon turning his head saw that
   Aleppo was no more! It had been, in a single moment, swallowed up by an
   earthquake! Then again you might see what God can do. But why need I
   feebly recapitulate what you all know so well? Think of what that Book
   records of His deeds of prowess when He unloosed the depths and bade
   the fountains of the great deep be broken up--and the whole world that
   then was--was covered with water!

   Think of what He did at the Red Sea when the depths stood upright as an
   heap for a time while His people went through and when afterwards, with
   eager joy, the floods clasped their hands and buried His enemies in the
   deep, never to rise again! Let such names as Og, king of Bashan, Sihon,
   king of the Amorites and Sennacherib, the mighty, rise before your
   recollection and mark what God has done! Who has ever dashed upon the
   bosses of His buckler without being wounded? What iron has He not
   broken? What spear has He not shivered?

   Millions came against Him, but by the blast of the breath of His
   nostrils they fell, or they flew like the chaff before the wind! Let
   the sea roar but the rocks stand still and hurl off the waves in flakes
   of foam--and so does God when His foes are most enraged and passionate.
   He that sits in the heavens does laugh. The Lord does have them in
   derision. And He breaks them in pieces without a stroke of His hand or
   even the glance of His eyes. Think, Sinner! Think of Him with whom you
   contend!

   Have you an arm like God's? Can you thunder with a voice like His? Can
   you stamp with your foot and shake the mountains? Can you touch the
   hills and make them smoke? Can you say to the sea, "Be stirred to your
   depths," or can you call to the winds and bid the steeds of tempest be
   unloosed? If you cannot, then think of the battle! Attempt to do no
   more but get back to your bed and there commune with your heart and
   make your peace with Him against whom you can not hope to contend
   successfully.

   Think, again, O rebellious Man--you have to deal not only with
   almighty, but with an ever encompassing power! Please think how much
   you are in God's power tonight as it regards your temporal position.
   You are prospering in business--but the tide of prosperity may be
   turned in a way unknown to you. God has a thousand ways of stripping
   those whom He before seemed to clothe most lavishly. You dote upon that
   wife of yours--she may be struck before your eyes and waste with
   consumption or decline, or, more rapidly still, she may be taken from
   you at a stroke! And then where is your joy?

   Those children, those happy prattlers who make your hearth glad --could
   you hold them for a moment if God should call back their spirits? If He
   said, "Return, children of men," your prayers, the physician, your
   love--what could all these avail you? You have but to buy the coffin
   and the shroud and the grave and bury your dead out of your sight. God
   can sweep away all if He wills, and leave you penniless, childless, a
   widower, without comfort in the world. I would not contend with Him who
   has so many ways to wound me! I am vulnerable at so many points and He
   knows how to pierce me to the quick in them all.

   I will, therefore, make Him my friend rather than my foe. I had better
   not fight with Him who has the key of the castle and of the front gate
   and of the iron gate and who can storm every position along my bastion
   whenever He shall please. Think, again, how much you are personally in
   His hands! You are strong, you say--you will do a day's work with any
   man. There are few can lift a load more readily than you can, perhaps,
   and yet one second would be enough to paralyze every limb!

   Your faculties are clear. You can write with clearness--no one can see
   through an intricate account more rapidly than you can, or find out a
   secret more speedily. And yet one tick of that clock is time enough to
   reduce either you or me to a driveling idiot, or to a raving madman. A
   mysterious hand falls on that brain and cools it so that there is no
   longer the light of intellect within it--or else an awful breath fans
   its flame till it burns like Nebuchadnezzar's furnace and the soul
   walks within it a martyr--doomed to live in the midst of fire!

   Think of this--not many yards from here there stands in Bedlam an awful
   proof of what the Providence of God can do in one moment with those who
   seemed the most sane, the most witty, and the most able of men. And you
   have not to go far in either direction, before, at the gate of some
   hospital, you will find how soon the body may become very, very low,
   even to the dust, if God but wills it. I would not, O Sinner, I would
   not have God other than my friend, while I am thus helplessly in His
   control!

   If the moth is in my hand and I can crush it at my will and pleasure,
   surely if that moth had wit and sense, it would not provoke me to anger
   nor seek to bring down my plagues upon it! But, if it could, it would
   seek to nestle near my heart, that I, so able to crush it, might use my
   power for its protection and might make what wit I have to be its
   wisdom for its shelter and defense. It is well, also, to remember the
   mighty army of the Lord of Hosts and that you live amidst the creatures
   of God who are all ready to do His bidding.

   As the children of Israel journeyed in the wilderness, they were
   preserved by God from many foes and innumerable dangers which lurked
   around waiting to destroy them. Once God gave the fiery serpents
   permission to assault the host and what death and terror immediately
   filled the camp! They must have seen, then, that it was no small thing
   to be at variance with God, when He had so many allies waiting to do
   His bidding. How clearly this was shown in the plagues of Egypt, when
   frogs, locusts and lice, hail and fire, plague and death flooded the
   ill-fated land--but only when beckoned on by the uplifted finger of
   God!

   He can still call to His help the forces of creation. The stars in
   their courses fought against Sisera and God can still make all things
   work for evil as well as good if He is pleased to command them. When
   Herod fought with God he was consumed by worms and died--and God has
   still a countless army of servants who do His commandments, hearkening
   to the voice of His word. You had better wait awhile and think how you
   can meet them. Are your friends as numerous? Can you muster an army
   like God's? Is the muster roll of your hosts like His?

   Consider the heavens, for He marshals yon starry multitude and calls
   them all by name! Because He is great in strength, not one fails. Be
   wise and enter into covenant with Him through blood and rush not on to
   certain defeat by seeking to outrival God. Remember, moreover, what is
   the extent of God's wisdom and that His foolishness is greater than
   your highest knowledge. A good general is worth more than a regiment of
   men. When Stonewall Jackson was killed, his enemies and friends alike
   felt that his death was more than the loss of ten thousand men.

   Our Iron Duke, when alive, was a strength to our army beyond all
   calculation. Now mark the skill and infinite wisdom of the God who
   leads the army of the skies. All light and knowledge are His. He is the
   Ancient of Days and His experience runs back to all eternity. You are
   but of yesterday and know nothing. His plans are beyond your
   conception, and He knows the way you take. He is far above your
   thoughts and ever out of your sight--but He can see you through and
   through and knows you better than you know yourself. Do not show your
   folly by weighing your wisdom against His in the scales, or by
   expecting to outshine Him so as to triumph over Him. Poor moth rushing
   into the flame, you will be consumed amidst the pity of good men and
   the derision of evil ones.

   Yet there is another matter I want you to remember--you that are the
   enemies of God--you have a conscience. You have not got rid of it yet.
   You have a thief in that candle of the Lord, it is true, but still it
   is a light. It is not put out. And God has ways of making it to become
   a terrible plague to you, if you do not accept it as a friend.
   Conscience is meant to be man's armor bearer, beneath whose shield he
   may fight the battles of the right. But if you make it your enemy, then
   conscience often places a sword in such a way as to cut and wound you
   severely.

   You have a conscience and that is a very awkward thing for a man to
   have who is an enemy of God. If I were God's enemy I should prefer
   having no monitor to call my attention to the holy Character and
   righteous Law of the Most High. I should be glad to get rid of every
   particle of moral sense. But you have consciences and most of you are
   not yet dead to all feeling of guilt and shame. You cannot, therefore,
   sin so cheaply as others. And if you do for the present manage to put
   Mr. Conscience down, yet since he is still in you, the time will come
   when you will find his voice grow louder! And there will be a terror in
   that voice which will make it a terror for you to sleep and hard for
   you to go about your daily business with your accustomed regularity.

   Those men who serve God most faithfully find that their conscience,
   when it can accuse them of anything wrong-- though it is their best
   friend--is no very pleasant companion. It is said that David's heart
   smote him. I would sooner have anybody smite me than my own heart, for
   it strikes with so hard a blow and hits the place where one may most
   tenderly feel it. And it will be so with you unless you get your
   "conscience seared with a hot iron." I am afraid there will come a time
   when you will not rest in your beds nor be able to find peace or
   satisfaction anywhere. I think therefore, if I had a friend of God
   inside my heart, I would not like to fight with God so long as he
   continued within me. Oh, that you would be at peace with Him, "and
   thereby good shall come unto you."

   One other reflection--for I must not keep you thinking on this point
   long--it is this. Remember you must die, and therefore it is a pity to
   be at enmity with God. You may put it off and say, "I shall not die
   yet." But you do not know. How can you tell? It is possible that you
   may die tomorrow. But suppose that you live for the next twenty or
   thirty years? What is that? I am only thirty years of age and yet I
   confess that I never thought time so short as I feel it to be now. When
   we were children we thought twelve months was a great length of time.
   When we were twenty, a year seemed to be a very respectable period.

   But now it flies and some of my friends here whose hair is turning grey
   will tell you that whether it is fifty, sixty, or seventy years, it all
   seems but a mere dream--a snap of the fingers--it is gone so soon!
   Well, just push through a little interval of time, then you must die.
   My dear Friend, will it not be a very dreadful thing to die when you
   are at war with God? If you could fight this out forever under such
   circumstances as those in which you now are, I could not then commend
   the struggle. But since it must come to such an awful pause! Since
   there must be that death rattle in your throat! Since there must be
   that clammy sweat upon your brow--O you will need some better business
   than to be carrying arms against the God of Heaven in your dying
   moments!

   They that have God for their friend yet find death no very pleasant
   task. But what will you find it, who will have to strike yourselves in
   every blow that you are aiming against the Most High, whom you have
   made and continue to make your enemy? Here is this, too, to think
   of--there is a future state. When you die, you have to live again! We
   know very little about that next state and I do not intend to say much
   about it tonight. You are launched without your body, an unclothed
   spirit, into a world which you have never seen. Will you find
   companions there, or will you be alone? Where will it be? What sort of
   place will it be like?

   I should not choose to enter upon the realm of spirits without having
   God to be my friend. It would be a dreadful thing to get into that
   mysterious unknown country having nothing to take with me across its
   boundary except this--an inveterate enmity to the King that reigns
   supreme in it! If I must cross the border and go into a land I have
   never trod, I would like, at least, to carry a passport with me--or to
   be able to say, "I am a friend of the King that reigns here." But to go
   there as God's enemy--how terrible it must be!

   Besides, let me say, you cannot hope to succeed--all experience is
   against you. There never was one yet that either in this state or the
   next has fought with God and conquered. And you will not be the first,
   for they who contend with God all come to this one conclusion--"He
   comes forth in His strength and His enemies are given like stubble to
   the fire and like wax to the flame. He lifts up His voice and they melt
   away. He looks at them and that one flash of fire withers them forever.
   And out of the bottomless pit of despair they weep and wail the piteous
   but useless regret that their harvest is past and their summer is ended
   and they are not saved. For they have spent their strength against
   their God and so have brought themselves where ruin is eternal and hope
   can never come."

   Oh that you would send a delegation and be at peace! I think I hear
   some say, "Well, we wish to give up the contest--but what is to be done
   so as to be at peace with God?" I ask, Have you got an ambassador to go
   to God for you? That is the first thing. He cannot look at you. Jesus
   Christ is the Ambassador between God and man--can you commit your case
   into His hands? Will you do so? If so, your case will go well. God
   cannot deny Him any request. He has a right to all He ever asks the
   Father to give and the Father is always well-pleased in Him and
   delights to grant Him whatever He desires.

   That Savior is willing to plead your cause. He waits to be gracious. I
   am sent to tell you the good news of His love and mercy--to warn you of
   the certain doom which awaits all who turn from Christ--and to bid you
   and every sin-sick rebel to come at once, just as you are, to the
   footstool of mercy. And I can pledge the honor of God, (as being
   Christ's ambassador for this purpose), that if you come, He will in no
   wise cast you out. And the terms of peace are very brief. They are
   these--give up the traitors. There can be no peace between you and God
   while you harbor sin. Give them up and be willing to renounce every sin
   of every sort and kind, for one harbored traitor will prevent God
   concluding peace with you.

   Sinner, what do you say? Is it hard to give up your sin? Does that
   condition strike you as unreasonable? Out with the knife, man, and cut
   the throat of every iniquity! Why, there is no sin for which it is
   worth your while to be damned! A little rioting and chambering and
   wantonness--is that worth Hell fire forever? What? To have your giddy
   amusements for an hour or two--is this a due recompense for an eternity
   of fire unmitigated by a drop of water? I pray you, be reasonable.
   Barter not away your soul for trifles! Pawn not eternity for the mere
   fictions of an instant. God give you Grace, Sinner, to not kick at that
   condition, but at once cast out your enemies and gods and then lay hold
   on Christ, on Jesus Christ alone and let Him stand as Ambassador for
   you. You can not fight it out. Let peace be made. Oh may it be made
   tonight, through the blood of Jesus Christ, God's dear Son.

   Then next, confess that you deserve the King's wrath. Bow that
   head--put the rope about your neck as though you felt you deserved that
   the executioner should lead you forth. Pray to God for pardon and cry,
   "God be merciful to me, a sinner!" And then cling to the skirts of that
   appointed Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who on yonder bloody tree made
   expiation for the sins of God's enemies that they might thereby become
   God's friends. God demands of you a confession of your guilt. He will
   be honored by your humbling yourself before Him. Your sin has aimed at
   His Glory and now He will glorify Himself by your repentance.

   It were only just on His part if He spurned you away and cast you out
   into the pit which has no bottom. But He has said that whoever
   confesses his sin shall obtain forgiveness. Go, therefore, in the
   spirit of the publican--smite upon your breast and say, "God be
   merciful to me a sinner." Confess that you deserve Hell but ask for
   Heaven and you shall not plead in vain. Only honor God's justice and
   appeal to His mercy through the Lord Jesus Christ. This, surely, is not
   much for God to expect at your hands!

   If you will not submit, what can you say when God shall crush you? You
   refuse to bend the knee and to bow the head--what will you do when God
   shall trample on you in His fury and tread on you in His hot
   displeasure? You must, therefore, now in the accepted time, while it is
   still the day of mercy, seek His face and with weeping and
   supplication, "take with you words and turn unto the Lord and He will
   have mercy upon you. And to our God, for He will abundantly pardon."

   II. And now we turn the subject so as to look at THE SECOND CONTEST, IN
   WHICH I TRUST MANY ARE ANXIOUS TO BE ENGAGED. Some young spirit that
   has been touched with a sense of its own condition, and somewhat
   aroused, may be saying, "I will be God's enemy no longer--I will be His
   friend." Bowing the knee, that heart cries, "Oh God, reconcile me unto
   Yourself by the death of Your dear Son. I throw down all my weapons. I
   confess my guilt. I plead for mercy. For Jesus' sake vouchsafe it to
   me." "But," says that soul, "if I am the friend of God, I must be the
   foe of Satan and from this day I pledge myself to fight forever with
   Satan till I get the victory and am free from sin."

   My dear Friend, I want you to stop. I do not wish you to make peace
   with the Evil One, but I want you to consider what you are doing. There
   are a few things I would whisper in your ear, and one is that sin is
   sweet. The uppermost drops of sin's cup glitter and sparkle. There is
   pleasure in sin of a certain sort and for a certain season. It is a
   poisoned sweet--it is but a temporary delusion--but still the world
   does promise fair things. Its gingerbread is gilt and though it wears
   nothing but tinsel and a little gold-leaf now and then, yet it does
   look very much like gold.

   Can you? Can you resist sin, when it seems so charming? The next time
   the cup is brought to you--you know the flavor of it--oh, it is rich!
   Can you turn away? Are you certain that you will be able to dash it
   from your lips? Ah, Man, you will find it different, when the trial
   comes, to what it is now that you are sitting in the Tabernacle and
   resolving to get rid of the temptation and that you will do right!

   Remember, again, you may be enticed by friends who will be very
   persuasive. You can give up sin just now, but you do not know who may
   be the tempter at some future time. If she should allure you, who has
   tempted so well before! If she--she should speak! She! The very word
   has awakened your recollection--if she should speak as she alone can
   speak and look as only she can look--can you then resist and stand
   back? That witching voice, that fascinating eye! Oh how many souls have
   been damned for what men call love! Oh that they had but a little true
   love of themselves and others, and would not thus pander to the Prince
   of Hell!

   But alas, alas, while the cup itself looks sweet, there is to be added
   to it the hand that holds it out. It is not so easy to contend with
   Satan when he employs the service of someone whom you esteem highly and
   love with all your heart. Remember the case of Solomon whose wisdom was
   marvelous, but who was enticed by his wives and fell a prey into the
   hands of the Evil One. It needs a spirit like the Master's to be able
   to say, "Get you behind me, Satan," to the tempter, when he has the
   appearance of one of your best loved friends.

   The devil is a crafty being and if he cannot force the door, he will
   try and get the key which fits the lock and, by the means of our most
   tender love and affections, will make a way for himself into our
   hearts! You will find it no easy task, therefore, to contend with him.
   Then again, remember, Man, there is habit. Can you, all of a sudden,
   give up your sins and fight Satan? Do not tell me that you can! Can the
   Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? If so, then he
   that is accustomed to do evil may learn to do well.

   If you had never sinned as you have sinned, there were not this
   difficulty with you. But he that has gone day after day and year after
   year into sin is not so easily turned from it. As well hope to make
   Niagara leap up instead of down as make human nature flow back to
   virtue instead of going downward to sin! You do not know yourself.
   Habit is an iron bond and he that is once enveloped in it may pull and
   strain but he will tear away his flesh sooner than break the links of
   that dread chain.

   We have seen men who, convinced of the error of their ways, have sought
   to turn from them without asking the help of God. For a time they have
   made some little progress in appearance, but it has only been like the
   retreating of the waves at the rising of the tide. Their evil habits
   have returned upon them with a rush and have covered them deeper than
   before. Read the parable of our Lord concerning the unclean spirit
   which went out of the man and roamed through dry places, seeking rest
   but finding none. Finally it said, "I will return to the place from
   where I went out." It came back and found it swept and garnished and
   then took to it seven other evil spirits, more wicked than itself. So
   the last end of that man was worse than the first.

   Thus it is with those who enter upon the work of saving themselves
   without looking up by faith to God for His needed help. Satan will
   triumph over you. You are like the fly in the coils of the spider's
   web--the more it struggles, the more it will be encompassed. You must
   cry for help as you are quite unable of yourself to escape from the
   snares of the Wicked One. He has you bound fast, hand and foot--and you
   will never break his cords nor be able to cast his bands from you. You
   have not seven locks of strength like Samson! You will certainly be
   overcome.

   Again, you think you will give up sin, but ridicule is very unpleasant
   and when the finger comes to be pointed at you and they say, "Ah, so
   you have set up for a saint, I see!" When they put it as only they can
   put it, in such a sharp, cutting, grating manner! When it is wrapped up
   so wittily in an epigram that is told all round the shop against you!
   And when, moreover, there is some weakness of yours, some giddy
   weakness--and they know how to hook your attempt at saintship to your
   weakness--and they bandy that all round and there are fifty laughing
   faces at you, can you stand that?

   Yes, it is a very pretty thing for you to come here on Sundays and say
   what you will do--but it is different to do it on Mondays. To be
   laughed at is not really, to a sensible man, anything very terrible. I
   think you have only to get used to it and then you will just as much
   expect to hear people laugh at you as to hear birds singing when you
   walk out in the morning! But at first it is a very sharp trial--a trial
   of "cruel mocking." And many who have been going to fight Satan have
   drawn back, for they found they could not stand it.

   When the Jews were rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem after their return
   from captivity, one of the most severe tests of their zeal and devotion
   was the laughter of their enemies who came and looked on and said,
   "What are these feeble Jews doing? Even that which they build, if a fox
   goes up it, he shall break down their stone wall." The words of their
   foes were more cutting than swords and keenly did they feel in their
   spirits the derision of the scoffers. It is as painful now for the
   sensitive spirit as it was of old, but you must not be daunted. Heaven
   is worth buying, even though it should cost a life heaped full of
   stinging words and malicious sayings from a deriding and taunting
   world.

   Did not Christ Himself show us how to endure this trial? See His foes
   gathered around Him when He hung dying on the Cross. They laugh at Him
   even there--"He saved others, Himself He cannot save," they said as
   they wagged their heads and mocked alike His dignity and His woe. "If
   You are the Christ, come down from the Cross and we will believe on
   You." These sayings must have been more bitter to His spirit than the
   wormwood mingled with gall was to His lips. You must follow Christ
   here, also, if you would contend, as He did, with Satan.

   Then count the cost. Can you drink His cup and be baptized with His
   baptism? And yet further, let me say to you, you that are for going to
   Heaven so zealously--gain is a very pretty thing, a very pleasant
   affair. Who does not like to make money? You know if you can be
   religious and grow rich at the same time, that will just suit some of
   you! Oh yes, the two going together--that will be admirable! You will
   kill two birds with one stone. Mr. By-Ends said, "Now, if a man, by
   being religious can get a good wife who has a considerable sum of
   money. And if by being religious he gets a good shop and many
   customers, why," says he, "then religion is a good thing! To get a good
   wife is a good thing and to get customers--that is another good thing,
   and so," he says, "the whole is a good thing put together."

   But he that knows Mr. By-Ends knows that he is an old rogue,
   notwithstanding that he puts it prettily. I have known him. He is a
   member of this Church, I am sorry to say. I never went into a Church
   where he was not a member. I have tried to turn him out and did once,
   but there was another one of the family left inside and however many
   you may expel there are sure to be more of that breed remaining. But
   there sometimes comes a pinch with Mr. By-Ends. Now if you should find
   that shutting up your shop on Sundays should ruin your business, well,
   what then? Could you stand it?

   Now there are some of you that try it every now and then when you get
   spasmodically godly, but it does not pay you, you find. And so you
   begin once more to open shop on the Lord's Day. Some of you Sunday
   traders discover that it gets a little hot and strong for you when you
   come to the Tabernacle occasionally and you shut up for a season, but
   soon you say, "Well, people must live." Yes, and people must die and
   people must be damned, too, if they try to live by breaking God's Laws!

   Remember that it will not pay to be religious, some people fancy. We
   have heard of a man saying, "I cannot afford to keep a conscience--it
   is too expensive an article for me." Ah, but keep in mind the saying of
   the Lord, "What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and
   lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"
   There is such a thing as being, "Penny wise and pound foolish." And
   there is such a thing, also, as being, "worldly wise and eternally
   foolish." Think of this, then, for the trial will come to you in the
   shape of yellow gold and it will be hard to keep yourself from the
   glittering bait which the god of this world will lay before you.

   I am putting these things to you so that you may calculate whether you
   can carry on the war against the devil with all these fearful odds
   against you. If I were a recruiting sergeant I should not do this. He
   puts the shilling into the country lad's hand and the lad may say fifty
   things. "Oh never mind," says the gallant soldier, "you know, it is all
   glory, nothing but glory. There, I will just tie these ribbons round
   your hat. There are some long strips of glory to begin with and then
   all your days it will be just glory, glory forever. And you will die a
   general and be buried at Westminster Abbey and they will play the 'Dead
   March in Saul,' and all that kind of thing."

   Now I cannot thus deceive or try to cheat men to enlist under the
   banner of the Cross. I do not desire to raise objections to it. All I
   want of you is to count the cost, lest you should be like he who began
   to build without being able to finish. That is the misery of so many. I
   advise you, if you are about to declare war with Satan, to see whether
   you are able to carry it out and win the victory. "Well," says one, "it
   is hard to be saved." Nobody ever thought it was not, I hope. What does
   Peter say? "If the righteous are scarcely saved, where shall the
   ungodly and the sinner appear?"

   "It is hard to be saved," you say. Whoever said it was not? But it is
   not hard to be saved if a man is willing to be received according to
   the plan which God has appointed. If Christ undertakes it, then it is
   done! My counsel to those of you who are considering making war with
   Satan is to remember that it is too much for you, and therefore do not
   attempt it in your own strength.

   Beware of this. I know Satan will tempt you, first of all, to believe
   that you need no Savior. Then if you are not convinced of this but are
   disquieted because of sin, he suggests that you can save yourself. He
   speaks of Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus which flow close by
   your own door. He says, "Wash in these home streams and be clean. Stay
   where you are and help yourself." But if you listen to the words of the
   seducer of souls you are lost and undone forever! Can the man born
   blind see to operate upon his own scale-covered eyes so as to give
   himself sight? Can the crippled man run away from his lameness and
   outrun the feebleness of his feet? Can the dead man exert himself to
   make the life-tide flow once more in his veins and flush his cheek anew
   with the glow of health?

   Can he call back his departed spirit from the shades of the unseen
   world and make it reoccupy its decaying habitation and bid the marks of
   the mighty consumer be gone and leave no trace of Death's conquest
   behind to remind the returning inhabitant that the palace had been
   occupied by the ruthless spoiler? We answer, no. A mighty finger must
   touch and open the eyes. An Omnipotent arm must lift up the paralyzed
   and impotent man into strength and power. And most evidently, if life
   is to be secured, the voice of God alone can speak the word which shall
   make the dead live.

   On this point we wish to be clearly understood. You will never, of
   yourself, successfully resist sin so as to escape its thralldom--much
   less can you remove its guilt! The cancer is in your blood and you can
   never get it out. The black deed is done and it is written, "The soul
   that sins shall die." Oh, then at once ask help of Him who alone can
   save you from the wrath to come! Remember, poor feeble one, nothing is
   too hard for God and therefore ask almighty strength to come to your
   rescue.

   It is true you cannot contend with your besetting sins--your passions,
   your corruptions of whatever sort they may be--are much too strong for
   you! Old Adam is too mighty for you with your best intentions. But
   there is a strong One, whose hand, once pierced, is always ready and at
   the service of every sinner who would have Satan cast out. There is One
   "mighty to save" who can come to the rescue and do for you what you
   cannot do for yourself! Oh that you had Christ tonight, so that at once
   you might cry to Him, "Jesus, save me! I see the fight is too great for
   me, I cannot drive out my sins, I cannot fight my way to Heaven! Come
   and help me, Lord Jesus! I put myself into Your hands! Wash me in Your
   blood! Fill me with Your Spirit! Save me with Your great salvation, and
   let me be with You where You are!"

   "No man can save himself," says one. Yet the case is very much like
   that of the master who sent his Negro servant with a letter. The Negro
   was rather lazy and came back with it. "Why did you not deliver it?" "I
   could not." "Could not deliver it?" "No, Master." "Why not?" "A deep
   river, Sir, very deep river, I could not get across." "A deep river?"
   he said. "Yes." "Is not there a ferryman there?" "Do not know, Sir. If
   there was, he was on the other side." "Did you call across, 'Boat,
   ahoy!' " "No, Sir." "Why then, you rascal," said he, " what does it
   matter? It is no excuse. It is true, you could not get across the
   river, but then there was one there who could take you and you never
   cried to him."

   And so it is in your case. You say, "I cannot save myself." Quite true.
   But there is One who can, and you have never cried to Him. Mark you--if
   you cry to Him--if your heart says, "Oh, Savior, come and save me!" And
   if your spirit rests in Him--deep as that river of your sin certainly
   is, He knows how to bear you safely through it and land you on the
   other shore. May He do that with each of you. With God all things are
   possible, though with man it is impossible. May the blessing of the
   Most High rest upon us this night for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                             Two Loving Invitations

   A SERMON PREACHED BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE
   NEWINGTON.

   "Come and see." John 1:39.

   "Come and dine." John 21:12.

   THE one text is in the beginning and the other at the end of John's
   Gospel. There is a mystery here. Here is typified a growth which it
   were well for us to understand. "Come and see," is for babes in
   Grace--"Come and dine," is for strong men in Christ Jesus. We must
   notice the order. "Come and see," is the beginning of spiritual life as
   it is the beginning of this Gospel. "Come and dine," is a high
   after-privilege of the spiritual life and a blessed result of it. "Come
   and see," is the Gospel's cry to those outside its pale--it has nothing
   to conceal, it wears no mask, it has no most holy place into which
   entrance is forbidden. It has a "sanctum sanctorum," but the way into
   it is open. Open and above-board in all its doings, the Truth as it is
   in Jesus bares its bosom secrets and cries to every passerby, "Come and
   see."

   The seals of the book are broken, the darkness is rolled away, the
   vision is open and with clarion note the invitation is issued, "Come
   and see." Romanism may conceal its worship under the Latin tongue.
   Difficult phraseology and polished periods may hide from the multitude
   the teaching of professed Protestants, but the true preacher of Christ
   declares, "I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus
   Christ and Him crucified. And my speech and my preaching was not with
   enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and
   of power."

   The shutters of every window are open. The key is put into every lock
   and every door is thrown wide open. Investigation is courted upon every
   point--the Gospel stands at her door and says, "Come in here, come and
   see." You have this short sentence, "Come and see," as, first of all,
   an encouragement to enquirers. Many of you are like John's disciples.
   They had heard John preach and they believed his word and when they saw
   Christ, to whom John pointed, they followed Him. But not knowing Him,
   they followed Him with a question upon the tip of their
   tongues--"Master, where do You dwell?" He said, "Come and see." You
   also are anxious to know Christ. You have heard His Word preached by
   some of His witnesses and you want to know Him personally for
   yourselves. You have a pressing question to put tonight and Jesus
   encourages you to ask. No--to come and get your own answer with your
   own eyes. "Come," He says, "Come and see."

   There are three ways, I think, by which persons are to, "Come and see."
   One is by observation. We ought to give attention to the teaching of
   the Gospel, to weigh it and prove it. If it is found false we are to
   cast it away with decision. But if it is found worthy of our attention
   we are to hold it fast and never let it go. Many persons are careless.
   They will consider the last new novel, or they have been clamoring to
   get the "Life of Julius Caesar," to see what the Emperor of the French
   can have to say upon that subject. But concerning Christ Crucified they
   have no curiosity. They frequent their place of worship without feeling
   enough interest in the affair to ask themselves why they go. They do
   not expect to understand what they hear, or if they understand it they
   care not whether the thing is true or not. It is nothing to them that
   Jesus should die.

   Now surely a theme which involves eternal consequences, a matter which
   deals with my immortal spirit ought not to be put into the background
   and left to careless inadvertence. I ought, at least, to give it
   something like the consideration which it claims at my hands. But some
   look at it through colored spectacles. They are prejudiced against the
   Gospel. They observe it, they say, but their observation is tinctured
   by themselves and by their own character. Some persons make up their
   minds as to what the Gospel ought to be before they try to find out
   what it is. They do not come to the Bible, nor to the hearing of the
   Word in order to discover what the Truth of God is. No, they sit down
   and dream and fashion in their own minds just such a sort of concoction
   as they imagine Gospel Truth should be and everything which is contrary
   to this they will kick against, like the foolish ox which kicks against
   the goad.

   It would be no use for me, in astronomy, to make an hypothesis and then
   go out with a telescope and say, "That star ought not to be where it
   is. According to my theory Jupiter ought not to have moved as he has
   moved and therefore I do not believe in Jupiter, nor in the stars, for
   I do not like their goings on." Who but madmen talk thus? I must always
   shape my views to facts, and regarding the Bible as the great
   storehouse of facts, I must take care that I go to it with a candid and
   unbiased judgment. May God help me to do so. To find out what the Truth
   of God is, "Come and see," but ask God to open your eyes that you may
   behold the wondrous things which are written in His Law.

   Does anyone enquire how he can come and see in the matter of
   observation? We invite you, dear Friends, to a diligent reading of
   Scripture as one means of seeing. The worst-read book in England is the
   Bible. People read a verse of it, or half a chapter in the morning and
   think they understand it. Suppose anyone were to read a poet in that
   way. Let the world's favored poet, Shakespeare, be treated in such a
   style as that and what man could ever appreciate his beauties? If you
   get a poet, say Cowper--you read "The Task" through. You do not think
   of snatching a line or two here and there--if you did you would be like
   the Greek teacher who carried a brick about as a specimen of a house
   which he had for sale.

   If you read Young's, "Night Thoughts," it is true that almost every
   line is noteworthy and is as fine-tuned as a distinct proposition. But
   still he who would appreciate the beauties of Young must read the
   "Night Thoughts" through, or, at least, read a book at a time. Yet
   there are thousands of you who never did read one of the Gospels
   through, never read one of the Epistles through with a studious mind
   desiring to catch the drift and to understand the sense. And do you
   dream you will ever know what the Bible teaches by just recalling a
   portion here and a portion there? Impossible! Absurd! If you have any
   care to, "Come and see," read the Bible in a common-sense way and sit
   down with the determination that, as far as the human mind can find out
   what God means, you will know what He has revealed concerning His Son.
   I am not afraid of what the consequences will be if you do that! If,
   moreover, you seek the aid of the Divine Spirit, your search cannot be
   in vain. You shall see Jesus and rejoice in His great salvation.

   Then next, I earnestly desire you to hear the Gospel as well as read
   it--only take care that what you hear is the Gospel. It is very easy to
   find Divines of flowery speech and flowing tongue, from whom, in a
   course of seven years, you would probably learn nothing whatever of the
   doctrines of the Covenant of Grace. It has been said that if you were
   to hear a lecturer on geology or astronomy deliver some twelve or
   thirteen lectures you would be able to pick up a pretty clear idea of
   the system of geology or astronomy, which the lecturer meant to teach.
   But I declare and protest, and will prove it by sermons printed by
   sundry authors, that you might hear thirteen thousand sermons of some
   men without knowing what system of Divinity they taught, if, indeed,
   they have any system of Divinity at all!

   What do you go to God's House for? Is it to have your ears tickled? Do
   you go to the place of worship that you may admire the eloquence of
   man? Go to your theater or your senate if this is your desire! Such
   places are the legitimate arena for display--come not to God's House
   for that. There we should resort to learn to pray. We should come that
   we may, in the words of our text, "see." See ourselves, and better
   still, see the Lord Jesus! This should be the first enquiry as we go up
   the steps into the place of meeting--"Sirs, we would see Jesus." And if
   Jesus is not to be seen there, no matter how brilliant the display of
   fireworks with which the sermonizer may indulge you--that is not the
   proper place in which to spend the precious hours of Sunday!

   We would see Jesus! We would know what we must do to be saved! Observe
   then, observe carefully. Keep your eyes open, not only to the world of
   Nature, but to the Book of God and the lives of His people and thus,
   "Come and see." Truly, Enquirer, there is a better way of coming and
   seeing and that is by believing. If you can at once believe God's Word,
   you shall see far better than if you are merely a seeker and, surely,
   the revelation of God in Christ may well demand your implicit faith.
   See how true others have found it. If the proposition is, "can Christ
   forgive sin?"--hear what others say who can sing of pardon bought with
   blood and of promises applied to their souls with power breathing peace
   and pardon to their hearts!

   Do you remember your mother? Do you remember the glitter of her eyes in
   death's dark hour? Do you remember how she bore her dying testimony
   that all that God had said concerning Christ was true? That He was able
   to save to the uttermost them that come unto God by Him? She was no
   woman given to deception! If I remember rightly you can say of her that
   she was a common-sense, shrewd woman--not easily deceived and yet in
   that last article of death--when every sham comes crumbling down and
   all that is mere paint and tinsel is broken and dashed away, she found
   the solidity of her hopes and rejoiced in them!

   You have other friends. In business they are not second-rate men. With
   regard to matters of common sense you would trust them as well as any
   that you know. They are not hot-headed and enthusiastic. They are not
   likely to be carried away by the multitude, after some hare-brained
   prophet. And yet steadily and solemnly they tell you that Christ has
   given them new hearts and right spirits. That He has changed their
   lives. That He has given them a peace and a joy they never knew before.
   They tell you that they have answers to prayer--that whenever they
   spread their case before God, their heavenly Father hears them and
   sends them speedy relief. They tell you that they find in religion a
   spring of moral action such as was never found in the mere precepts and
   teachings of law and conscience.

   Now believe these men. If they were the worst men in the neighborhood.
   If they were the felons and rogues of trade, I would recommend you not
   to believe them--but since they are the best in the world and rank high
   in your esteem--at least trust them so far as to come, yourself, to a
   candid observation of these things and believe that at least there is
   some truth in them. I would to God, dear Friends, that you would
   believe these things to be true concerning Christ's ability to save
   because you have Cod's Word for it. And if you ask me how I know it is
   God's Word, I can take you in vision to Nineveh.

   See the excavated cities and palaces, the winged bulls and lions buried
   in the rubbish--all which tell us that that Book which spoke of them
   before they were discovered--must have a high antiquity. And the volume
   which, written in the times of their glory, yet told of their
   tremendous fall, must have had an inspiration in it not belonging to
   common books. The best proof of this inspiration is, perhaps, to be
   found in this--that we know that God wrote another book, the book of
   Nature. And as the two works of one author are quite sure to exhibit
   some common points in which you may find out the author's idioms, so
   every student of Nature and Revelation has been able to say that the
   two volumes bear marks of the same Writer. And the more they have
   studied both books, the more they have said, "We find the same God in
   the one as in the other."

   The God of Nature is kind and good. So is the God of Revelation. The
   God of Nature is the terrible God of the avalanche and thunderbolt, the
   tempest and the whirlwind. And the God of this Book is terrible out of
   His holy place when He comes to judge the sons of men. We find that the
   very same imprimatur which is set upon the book of Nature is also
   stamped upon the Book of God. We should be glad, therefore, if you
   could believe this and believing this you would soon, "come and see."
   For mark you, the best way of knowing about Christ is to try Him, to
   experience Him! And since you want to know if He can forgive sins,
   trust Him to forgive yours. You want to know if He can change the human
   heart--trust Him to change yours.

   You long to know if there is a peace that passes all understanding
   which will still the throbs of your guilty heart. Try Him and see! You
   pant to learn if there is a joy which can gild your darkest hours with
   sunlight and make the dreary passage through the shades of death to be
   full of life and hope--try Him and see! We are not afraid to stake all
   upon the trial. I will cheerfully be bondsman for my Lord and Master.
   If there can be a soul that does sincerely trust Him that shall not
   find, even in this life, salvation, and in the world to come, eternal
   joy, then I am content to be deceived, or content to suffer the
   deceiver's doom!

   Beloved, if we only promised you something to be had in the next world,
   you could not make the test at once. But that which we hold out to you
   is present salvation. It is not some future joy merely, but present
   joy! Oh, if you trust Jesus Christ you shall, "come and see," that sin
   is mastered as well as pardoned! That the guilty conscience is pacified
   forever and that your joy and peace can begin this side of the grave.
   Enquirer, "come and see!" Oh, pass not by! Neglect not the exhibition
   of Divine love and Grace, but, "come," oh, "come and see!" May the Holy
   Spirit bring you, for His name's sake.

   Very hurriedly let me notice the next point. I think this invitation
   may be well addressed to every beginner in the school of Christ as well
   as to every enquirer. We ought not to be satisfied with merely being
   saved. As soon as ever we are saved--the moment we believe in
   Christ--our next business is to learn more of Christ. You want to know
   the doctrines, dear Friends. It is well to be thoroughly established in
   the faith. "Come and see." Search the Scriptures! See what God has
   revealed and be established in His Divine Truths. Every precept as well
   as every doctrine cries to you, "Come and see!"

   Every promise says, "Come and see!" Do not run short of promises! It is
   bad when a man is out of money. And the Christian, when he is without a
   promise in his hand is somewhat like a person without ready money in
   his purse. Study the promises. "Come and see." As to experience, too,
   the Lord says, "Come and see." Do not talk of Tabor's height, as though
   you could never climb it. From the top of it there comes a voice, "Come
   and see." Do not speak of Pisgah, as though your feet might never tread
   its consecrated summit. The voice says, "Come and see." If there is any
   point of communion, or height of fellowship as yet unreached by you,
   there peals forth from its excellent glory the endearing exhortation,
   "Come and see." No boundry is set about the Mount of God! No fiery wall
   conceals the secret of the Eternal. "The Spirit of the Lord is with
   them that fear Him. He will show them His Covenant." All Revelation
   cries with one voice, "Come and see!"

   I think this is the cry of the Gospel to every sinner, "Come and see."
   Perhaps it is easier to use the eyes than any other organ except the
   ears. This I know, it is more pleasing to use the eyes than the ears.
   You can keep a set of children as happy as the birds of the air with a
   picture book--when they would probably go to sleep if you were to talk
   to them. The eye has the greatest power of conferring pleasure. Whether
   it conveys truth to the heart more rapidly than the ear does, I cannot
   say. At any rate it does so most pleasingly and for this reason, among
   others, Christ bids us to use the eyes. He hangs upon His Cross before
   you and cries, "Come and see." And He adds this promise--"Look unto Me
   and be you saved, all you ends of the earth."

   What is there to see? God made flesh! He that made the heavens veiling
   Himself in manhood! Is not this something? God came down to you, poor
   Sinner, that He might take you up to Himself! What is there to see?
   There is the Son of God bleeding for human sin! His griefs are such
   that no tongue can explain them and no pen can write them--but they are
   not for Himself--for in Him is no sin. "Come and see," for if you see
   the griefs of Jesus and take them to be your trust, you shall be saved!
   "Come and see." Do you ask what there is to see? This same Jesus rises
   from the tomb! He could not have risen if He had not been God, or if He
   had not completed the great work of His people's redemption!

   He ascends. The clouds receive Him! Up there in Heaven He stands
   pleading for sinners, pleading for us and, "He is able also to save
   them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever lives
   to make intercession for them." "Come and see!" "Come and see!" I am
   often asked, "Sir, how can I get faith?" I believe that faith comes
   from Christ and is His gift to sinners. Sit down in your chamber
   tonight when you get home, you that want to believe, and just think
   over this--GOD made flesh! If you will think of that, I pray the Holy
   Spirit visit you and then the thought will strike you-- "That is
   wonderful! Who could have dreamed of it? God suffering instead of man
   that the justice of God might be fully satisfied and the mercy of God
   might have full scope!"

   While you are thinking of this wonder and picturing the wounds and
   looking to the blood and thinking that you almost hear the dropping of
   the blood upon the Mount of Calvary, I think you will, you scarcely
   know how, find yourself ready to sing--

   "I do believe--I will believe
   That Jesus died for me;
   And on the Cross He shed His blood
   From sin to set me free."

   You cannot make yourself believe. Faith is the gift of God and the work
   of the Holy Spirit. But it comes through hearing, and hearing is
   principally blessed to the working of faith, because it gives you a
   sight of Christ in meditation and, as some say, "seeing is believing."
   Certainly such a sight as hearing gives is often made the channel by
   which the soul believes in Christ. "Come and see!"

   Oh you worldlings! Turn your eyes here and see the Savior die! Maybe
   the spectacle will cool your hot blood and drive away your fever of
   worldliness and care! Oh, you giddy, careless men and women, look here
   and see your Redeemer bleed! Possibly you may be sobered by the sight.
   Oh young men and maidens in your early youth! Since you may soon feel
   the arrows of death, look here and make your immortality secure! You
   grey-headed ones who have lost your vigor and spent your strength in
   sin, yet may the Holy Spirit bring you--"Come and see!" Oh, there is
   mercy yet, "Come and see!"

   The great sight is not withdrawn--it is no dissolving view that melts
   away--it is no burning bush from which you are bid to keep off by the
   words, "Draw not near here." But here, over the Cross, hangs the motto
   and from the Mount of Calvary rings the silvery trumpet note, "Come and
   see! Come and see!"

   "There is life in a look at the Crucified One; There is life at this
   moment for you."

   II. The second text is, "COME AND DINE." That is better--that is
   closer, nearer, dearer--more substantial than "come and see." That may
   be done at a distance, though "come" seems to invite us to make the
   distance less. But, "Come and dine"--that implies the same table, the
   same meat--yes, and sometimes it means to sit side by side and lean our
   head upon the Savior's bosom. Here is nearness familiar and
   domestic--"come and dine."

   Understand that while we are sinners faith brings us into a justified
   state by simply looking to Christ though the soul has had no enjoyment
   of Him. But after believing, faith then assists us really to enjoy
   Christ. I know some of you are wishing and expecting to enjoy Christ
   first, and believe him afterwards. I would correct your error. You must
   take God's mercies in their order and season. And you will not find,
   "come and dine," in the first chapter of John--there it is, "come and
   see." Believe Jesus first and you shall feed on Him afterwards!

   Certain of you seem to me to be content to believe Christ and to say,
   "I am safe," without wishing to know the blessed enjoyment which is to
   be found in Him. It should not be so. You are not to be content with
   the first chapter of John. But go on to the last and be not satisfied
   so long as there is a "yet" beyond. If you have seen Christ--if you
   have touched Christ--if you have put your finger into the print of the
   nails, be not satisfied till you know the meaning of the text, "Except
   a man eat My flesh and drink My blood, there is no life in him." "Come
   and dine," then, implies greater enjoyment than, "come and see."

   "Come and see" gives peace, but, "come and dine," gives
   ecstasy--rapture--what shall I call it? It gives Heaven on earth, for
   it gives Christ. "Come and dine" must be experimentally understood
   before you can read the Book of Solomon's Song with profit. "Come and
   see" can read the Evangelists. "Come and see" can read many of the
   Epistles. "Come and see" may wander delightfully through the Book of
   Psalms. "Come and see" may enrich itself with Proverbs. But the Tree of
   Life, which is in the midst of the garden--that is, the Book of
   Canticles [Song of Solomon]--is not to be eaten of except by those who
   have heard the Master say, "Come and dine." I would to God that all the
   Lord's people were not merely delivered from the chains of sin and
   washed in the Savior's blood but brought into the banqueting house,
   where waves the banner of redeeming love!

   There is more enjoyment, then, in the one than in the other. And there
   is also more nearness. When I first believed in Christ I felt a
   distance between myself and Him and the only nearness that I could get
   was to lay my hands upon His head and confess my sins. But I hope some
   of us, after a few years of believing, know what it is to sit at His
   feet with Mary! To lean upon His bosom with John! Yes, and to say with
   the spouse, "Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth, for His love
   is better than wine." O Beloved, there is a nearness to Christ which
   the worldling can only laugh at if he should hear us talk of it!

   Read "Rutherford's Letters," and you get glimpse of what it is to dine
   with Christ. Turn to "Hawker's Morning and Evening Portions," or even,
   if you will, wander amidst the quaint rhymes and sweet poetry of dear
   George Herbert-- there you have, "come and dine" carried out in
   sweetest prose. Oh, to get so close to Christ that you can sing with a
   modern hymn writer--

   "So near, so very near to God, I cannot nearer be; For in the Person of
   His Son I am as near as He! So dear, so very dear to God, I cannot
   dearer be;

   The love wherewith He loves His Son Such is His love to me!"

   This is a high attainment, but rest not satisfied till you have gained
   it. Yet, once more, "come and dine," gives us a vision of union with
   Jesus because the only meat that we can eat when we dine with Christ is
   Himself. We do not provide the supper. When He dined on that occasion
   with His disciples, Peter dragged a net full of fishes out of the sea.
   But when they came on shore they found a fire already kindled and fish
   laid on it, so that the fish they ate did not come out of the sea--by
   their net--at any rate. Christ found the fish and lit the fire. And He
   found the bread and then said, "Come and dine." Ah, and the fire that
   warms our heart when we have fellowship with Him comes from Himself!
   And the fish that we eat is His own and the wine that we drink flows
   from His own heart.

   Oh, what union is this! It is a depth that reason cannot fathom, that
   we eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ! Here we stand and look
   and look and look and though the water is clear as crystal, like the
   sea of glass before the Throne of God, yet to the bottom of it angelic
   sight can never reach! One with Jesus--by eternal union--one! What does
   this mean, Believer?--

   "One when He died. One when He rose; One when He triumphed over His
   foes! One when in Heaven He took His seat, And angels sang of Hell's
   defeat."

   Can you comprehend it?--

   "This Covenant stands secure, Though earth's old columns bow, The
   strong, the feeble and the weak Are one in Jesus now. Oh, sacred union,
   firm and strong, How great the Grace, how sweet the song, That worms of
   earth should ever be One with Incarnate Deity!"

   And yet it is so. And he that has listened to the Savior's voice, "Come
   and dine," knows it to be so and rejoices! In this, also, you find an
   invitation to enjoy fellowship with the saints. You are not to eat your
   morsel alone, but in company. We sit down in Heaven with Abraham, Isaac
   and Jacob--at the marriage supper of the Lamb--and no small part of the
   heavenly bliss is connected with the fellowship which exists among the
   saints in Gory. So also with our present feasting on the fat things
   full of marrow which Christ spreads before His chosen ones. We enjoy
   the company as well as the feast and find our happiness augmented by
   the society of kindred minds. The Supper of the Lord is the table of
   communion, not only with the Master but also with all who love Him in
   sincerity and truth.

   One of the surest ways of introducing discord into the midst of a
   Church is for the minister to starve the people. Hungry men are sure to
   be quarrelsome. On the contrary, to unite a flock in closest bonds of
   love let the minister say, "Come and dine!"--and then put before them
   the finest of the wheat, honey out of the rock and wine upon the lees
   well refined. If you would have sweetest fellowship with each other,
   live on Christ! Enter into the banqueting house, sit beneath the banner
   of love and you will find that sacred commingling of spirit with spirit
   which will prove that you are one in Christ Jesus.

   Christians may differ on a variety of points. They may not see eye to
   eye on this thing and on that, but they have all one spiritual appetite
   and if we cannot all feel alike, we can all feed alike on the Bread of
   Life sent down from Heaven. Get nearer to Christ and eat of His flesh
   and drink of His blood and you will find yourself linked more and more
   in spirit to all who are like yourself, supported by the same heavenly
   manna. We do not expect to see all Christians agreeing, but we are sure
   that one of the most likely plans for cultivating a brotherly spirit is
   to listen to Christ's words, "Come and dine."

   We see in these words the source of strength for every Christian. To
   look at Christ is to live, but for strength to serve Him you must come
   and dine. When our Lord had raised the daughter of Jairus He commanded
   them to give her meat so that she might be strengthened. And so He says
   to all of us, "Come and dine." We need as much food for the soul as for
   the body and unless we eat we shall be fainting by the way. Are there
   not many Christians who allow themselves to suffer a great deal of
   unnecessary weakness on account of neglecting this precept of the
   Master? I hold that we are bound to lift up the feeble knees and
   drooping hands--and in order to do this we must live by faith on the
   Son of God and listen to His voice as He says, "Eat, oh My Friends,
   yes, drink, oh My Beloved."

   If you want to be as Mr. Feeblemind, I can give you the receipt. Take
   only a small portion of spiritual food morning and night in your
   closets. Neglect family prayer. Never attend a Prayer Meeting. On no
   account speak about religious matters during the week. Go late to the
   House of God and fall asleep when you get there. As soon as you leave
   the place of worship talk about the weather. Confine yourself to these
   rules for a few weeks and you will very soon be reduced low enough to
   allow Satan to attack you with every chance of giving you a severe and
   dangerous fall.

   Doctors tell us that nowadays the classes of disease most prevalent are
   those which indicate a low condition of the vital forces. And I think
   that we are suffering in the Church from the same sort of maladies. You
   never hear of anyone who is too zealous, too rash in venturing himself
   for Christ! There was a time when the Church had to censure her young
   converts because they courted persecution and invited martyrdom! Now we
   need to stir up the Church and to urge on our people to more
   self-sacrifice for the cause of Christ.

   You need never fear that anyone will kill himself with too much
   work--we must rather lament that there seems so little exuberance of
   spirit and vital force among Christians. We, none of us, need to put
   ourselves on a low diet--on the contrary, we ought to accumulate
   strength and urge every power to its full dimension in the Master's
   service! For this purpose, "Come and dine." All your strength depends
   upon union with Christ! Away from Him you must wither as a branch
   severed from the vine. Feeding on Him, you will be like the branch
   which is drinking up the sap from the parent stem. You will be strong
   enough to bring forth fruit and fill your post among the other members
   of the one great band of Christians!

   We can see, moreover, in these words the foundation of the Christian's
   growth and progress in spiritual things. To see Christ is to begin the
   Christian's life, but to grow in Divine Grace we must, "come and dine."
   The early history of the first disciples is by no means satisfactory.
   They were evidently only babes in spiritual things. How little they
   seemed to comprehend the Savior's mission. He liked to say, "Have I
   been so long time with you and yet have you not known Me, Philip?" They
   misunderstood the nature of His Kingdom and were continually displaying
   a carnal and selfish spirit. It is evident that the early dawn of
   spiritual life is all they had then received. They had seen Jesus. They
   loved Him and followed Him even unto trial and disgrace--but yet they
   were far from possessing the Spirit of Christ.

   Now after they had reached this stage of living on Christ they became
   new men. It is no longer mere sight, but an inward appropriation of
   Christ Jesus by faith and the consequences are manifest. They are seen
   developing themselves under the blessed outpouring of the Holy Spirit
   into workmen that needed not to be ashamed. They endured hardness as
   good soldiers of the Cross. They fought a good fight and they finished
   their course with joy. A higher order of life is clearly theirs. They
   have risen in the scale of spiritual existence! A clearer light shines
   around them and they have manifestly grown in Grace and in the
   knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ! Beloved, we long for
   your edification! We covet for you the best gifts, and therefore we
   say, "Come and dine."

   Many Christians remain stunted and dwarfed in spiritual things so as to
   present the same appearance year after year. No upspringing of thought
   and feeling is manifest in them. They exist but do not grow. The reason
   is evident--they are not taking of Christ--and they neglect to
   appropriate to themselves the blessing which He is waiting to bestow.
   Why should you rest content with being in the tender green blade when
   you can go on and reach the ear and eventually the full corn in the
   ear? I would that all God's servants were more in earnest to develop
   that good thing which has been implanted in them by the Holy Spirit!

   It is all very well to keep other men's vineyards, but you must not
   neglect your own. Why should it ever be winter in our hearts? We must
   have our seed time, it is true, but oh, for a spring time--yes, a
   summer season--which shall give promise of an early harvest! Now if you
   would ripen in Grace you must live near Christ--in His
   Presence--basking in the sunshine of His smiles. You must hold sweet
   communion with Him. You must leave the distant view of His face and
   come near, as John did, and pillow your head on His breast. Then you
   will find yourself advancing in holiness, in love, in faith, in
   hope--yes, in every godly gift! What a joy it is to see men and women
   daily living on Christ! You may watch them grow as you have watched the
   flowers and trees in the gardens expanding under the genial showers and
   sunshine of the last few weeks.

   It robs a deathbed of its terrors to see the aged Christian rapidly
   preparing for Glory, but I would rather the man grew before he was
   about to be taken from us so that we might be the better for his
   expanded Graces and enjoy his beauty of holiness a few years here on
   earth. We do not grudge the saints in Glory anything--but it would be a
   mercy to us if Christians would try and get as much of perfection and
   maturity as possible a few years sooner--so as to gladden our eyes with
   some bright blossoms as well as the somber green blades. It is all very
   well, the fresh verdure in early spring, but

   I like also the russet hues of autumn and the rich clusters of the
   vintage with the songs of the reaper and the shout of "harvest home!"

   The golden grain is a goodly and pleasant thing to see as the field
   waves in the autumn breeze. So, also, I like to mark maturity in
   Christ's fields, as well as in the earthly ones. It is a glorious
   sight, an experienced saint--a man who has been much with Jesus and
   learned of Him--who has caught the Master's spirit and reflects it
   brightly to all around! As the sun rises first on mountaintops and
   gilds them with his light and presents one of the most charming sights
   to the eyes of the traveler, so is it one of the most delightful
   contemplations in the world to mark the glow of the Spirit's light on
   the head of some saint who has risen up in spiritual stature, like
   Saul, above his fellows! For then, like some mighty Alp, snow-capped,
   he reflects, first of all, the beams of the Sun of Righteousness and
   bears the sheen of His brilliance high aloft for all to see--and seeing
   it--to glorify His Father which is in Heaven! That you may thus grow in
   Grace, listen to the Master's voice--"Come and dine."

   We notice one more thought and then must conclude. Here is preparation
   for service. "Come and dine," says the Master. But before the feast is
   concluded, He says to Peter, "Feed My lambs." And again, "Feed My
   sheep." Further adding, "Follow Me." All the strength supplied by
   Christ is for service and for use in His vineyard. When the Prophet
   Elijah found the cake baked on the coals and the cruse of water placed
   at his head as he lay under the juniper tree, he had a commission to go
   forty days and forty nights in the strength of it, journeying towards
   Home, the mount of God. So also with us--we eat so as to be able to
   expend our strength in the Master's service. We come to the Passover
   and eat of our Paschal Lamb with loins girt and with our staff in our
   hand--so as to start off at once when we have satisfied our spirits.

   Some Christians are for living on Christ but are not so anxious to live
   for Christ. Now I rejoice to know that I can spend and be spent for the
   Lord. And I find in labor for Christ that, "it is more blessed to give
   than to receive." I never feel so like the Master as when I go about
   trying to do good. Heaven is the place where saints feast most and work
   most. They sit down at the table of our Lord and they serve Him day and
   night in His Temple. They eat of heavenly food and render perfect
   service. Now earth should be a preparation for Heaven--come and
   dine--and then go and labor! Freely you receive--freely give! Gather up
   all the fragments of your feast and go and carry it to Lazarus at the
   gate! Yes, carry the loaves and fishes to oth-ers--as the disciples did
   when the Lord had multiplied their little supply--to satisfy the
   thousands who were famishing for want of food.

   We have yet to learn more concerning the design of our Lord in giving
   us His Grace. We are not to hold the precious grains of Truth like a
   mummy does the wheat, for ages, without giving it a chance of growing.
   No, feed yourself and then go forth and bid others come and eat and
   drink. Go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in,
   that there may be many more rejoicing with you in the Light and Life of
   Christ! Why does the Lord send down rain upon the thirsty earth and
   give sunshine and genial refreshing breezes? Is it not that these may
   all help the fruits of the earth to yield food for man and beast? Even
   so the Lord calls us in to enjoyment and feasting that we may
   afterwards go out to labor and service.

   My dear Hearers, I always seek to see you fruitful in all good works,
   to do His will who provides all things for us richly to enjoy. You are
   aware that our Father is glorified if we bring forth much fruit and so
   shall we be His disciples. Eat, then! Spare not--you are welcome to as
   much as you can consume! But when you have eaten the fat and drunk of
   the sweet, go and tell of it to sinners round that the starving may
   come and find "wine and milk, without money and without price." You are
   to preach the Gospel to every creature--proclaim the good news of water
   from the Rock Christ Jesus which flows in the midst of the world's
   wilderness, so that all may drink and live. Tell of the finest of the
   wheat on which you have feasted.

   Bid the prodigal leave the husks which the swine eat and return to the
   Father's house, there to eat of the fatted calf and feast at the
   parental board. Tell them there is room in the Savior's heart! And
   never cease proclaiming His matchless love and power and His
   willingness to say to all, "Come unto Me all you that are weary and
   heavy laden and I will give you rest." "Come and dine."

   I send you away, however, wishing to make the first part of the sermon
   the more telling to most of you--"Come and see." You are black with
   sin, but blackness does not blind the eye. Your righteousness is
   nothing better than filthy rags, but the most ragged beggar may look.
   Our strange old proverb says, "A cat may look at a king," and the
   blackest sinner out of Hell may look at Christ! And though he has sin
   well near as devilish as that of Lucifer, yet, looking to Christ all
   manner of sin and of iniquity shall be forgiven him!

   Look, Sinner--look! May the Holy Spirit now open those eyes of yours
   and turn them to the Savior's Cross and make you live! May the best of
   Heaven's blessings be yours tonight and in eternity! Amen and Amen.

               Christians Kept In Time And Glorified In Eternity

   A SERMON PREACHED BY C. H. SPURGEON AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE,
   NEWINGTON.

   "Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you
   faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, to the
   only wise God our Savor, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both
   now and ever. Amen."

   Jude 24,25.

   OMITTING all preface it will be well to observe in what state of mind
   Jude was when he penned this doxology, what had been his previous
   meditations, and when we have done so we will endeavor to come directly
   to the text and observe what mercies he sums up in it and what praise
   is due from us to Him of whom he thus speaks.

   I. Then, UNDER WHAT INFLUENCE WAS JUDE'S MIND WHEN HE PENNED THIS
   DOXOLOGY. Our first observation is that in writing this very short but
   very full Epistle, he had been led to consider the grievous falls of
   many others and in contemplating those failures he could not resist the
   impulse of penning these words, "Now unto Him that is able to keep us
   from falling." You observe in reading that he mentions the Israelites
   who came out of Egypt. That was a glorious day in which the whole host
   met at Succoth, having just escaped from the thralldom of Egypt and now
   found themselves delivered from the whips and the lashes of the
   taskmasters and were no longer compelled to make bricks without straw
   and to build up palaces and tombs for the oppressors.

   That was, if possible, a more glorious day than when God divided the
   Red Sea to make a way for His people. The depths stood upright in a
   heap when the elect multitude walked through. Do you not see them, as
   with songs and praises they are led all that night through the deep as
   on dry ground? They are all landed on the other side, and then their
   leader lifts up his rod and immediately there comes a wind and the
   waters return to their place. The infatuated Egyptian king, who with
   his hosts had followed them into the depths of the sea is utterly
   destroyed. The depths have covered them.

   They sank as lead in the mighty waters! There is not one of them left.
   Then sang Moses and the children of Israel, saying, "I will sing unto
   the Lord for He has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider has
   He thrown into the sea." Is it credible, is it not too sadly incredible
   that this very people who stood by the Red Sea and marked the overthrow
   of God's enemies, within a few days were clamoring to go back into
   Egypt? And before many months had passed were for taking to themselves
   a leader that they might force their way back into the place of their
   bondage? Yes, and they who saw Jehovah's work and all His plagues in
   Zoan made to themselves a calf and bowed down before it and said,
   "These are YOUR gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of
   Egypt."

   With tears in your eyes, look at the many griefs which studded the
   pathway of their forty years' wandering, and with many fears reflect
   that out of all that multitude which came out of Egypt, there were but
   two who lived to cross the Jordan! Aaron must put off the breastplate,
   for he has sinned against God. And even Moses, the meekest of men, must
   go to the top of Nebo and is only permitted to gaze upon the prospect
   of that land which he must never actually enjoy! Except for Caleb and
   Joshua there were none found faithful among all the tribes--and these
   alone shall enter into the goodly land which flows with milk and honey.

   Now when Jude thought of this, I do not wonder that he began to
   consider the case of himself and of his fellow Believers united with
   him in Church fellowship at Jerusalem and elsewhere. And knowing that
   all of them who were truly brought up out of Egypt by Jesus shall
   surely enter into the promised rest, he cannot, he does not desire to
   resist the impulse of singing, "Now unto Him that is able to keep you
   from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of His
   glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Savior, be glory and
   majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever."

   If YOU read on to the next verse, you perceive that Jude had another
   example in his mind's eye--the angels that kept not their first estate.
   We do not know much of angels, but from what we gather in Holy
   Scripture--perhaps tinged in our reading with some of the half-inspired
   ideas of Milton--we believe that angels are spirits vastly superior to
   ourselves. In intelligence they may well be so, even if they had been
   created upon a par--for they have had many years in which to learn and
   gather experience--whereas man's existence is but a handbreadth. We
   regard an angel with intense respect and while never paying any worship
   to those noble beings, we cannot but feel how little we are when
   compared with them.

   One of these angels appears to have been named Lucifer, son of the
   morning. Perhaps he was a leader in the heavenly host and first among
   the princes of Heaven. He, together with multitudes of others, fell
   from their allegiance to God. We know not how. We have no idea if they
   were tempted, unless one of them tempted the other--but they kept not
   their first estate--they were driven out of Heaven. They were expelled
   from their starry thrones and therefore they are reserved in chains of
   darkness until the great day of account.

   Now, my Brethren, can you think of the fall of angels without
   trembling? Can you think of the morning stars put out in blackness? Of
   the cherub, whose head did wear a crown, cast into the mire and his
   crown rolled into the dust? Can you think of these bright spirits
   transformed into the hideous fiends that devils are? Their hearts, once
   temples for God, now become the haunt of every unclean
   thing--themselves the most unclean? Can you think of that without
   feeling a tremor of fear lest you, too, should fall from your first
   estate? And without another, and a higher thrill ofjoy, when you think
   of Him who is, "able to keep you from falling and to present you
   faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy"?--

   " When any turn from Zion's way (Alas, what numbers do),
   I think I hear my Savior say, ' Will you forsake Me too?
   Ah, Lord! With such a heart as mine, Unless You hold me fast, I feel I
   must, I shall decline, Andprove like them at last."

   But we can also sing right joyously--"The soul that on Jesus has leaned
   for repose, he will not, he will not, desert to its foes. That soul,
   though all Hell should endeavor to shake, He'll never, no never, no
   never, forsake." We might continue to follow Jude, but we will not do
   so. We prefer to add something which Jude has not put in his Epistle.
   Our first parent, Adam, lived in the midst of happiness and peace in
   the garden. Unlike ourselves he had no depravity--no bias towards evil.
   God made him upright. He was perfectly pure and it was in his own will
   whether he should sin or not. The balance hung evenly in his hands.

   But you have not forgotten how on that sad day he took of the forbidden
   fruit and ate and thereby cursed himself and all of us! My Brethren, as
   you think of Adam, driven out of the Garden of Eden--sent out to till
   the ground from where he was taken--compelled in the sweat of his face
   to eat bread. When you recollect the paradise he left, the happiness
   and peace that have forever passed away through his sin, do you not
   hear the voice that says to you, as a depraved and fallen creature,
   "Let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall"? Conscious of
   your own weakness as compared with your parent, Adam, you are ready to
   cry out, "O God, how can I stand where Adam falls?"

   But here comes the joyous thought--Christ, who has begun with you, will
   never cease till He has perfected you! Can you help singing with Jude,
   "Now unto Him who is able to keep us from falling"? It strikes me that
   every time we mark an apostate and see the fall of a sinner or of a
   fellow professor, we should go down on our knees and cry, "Hold You me
   up and I shall be safe," and then rise up and sing--

   "To our Redeemer God
   Eternal power belongs,
   Immortal crowns of majesty,
   And everlasting songs.
   He will present our souls
   Unblemished and complete
   Before the Glory of His face,
   With joys divinely great."

   This partly accounts for the text before us. But on a further reference
   to the Epistle we get another part of the thoughts which had exercised
   the Apostle's mind. Observe, dear Friends, that the Apostle had a very
   vivid and distinct sense of the nature of the place into which those
   fell and of their utter ruin and destruction. Notice, concerning the
   children of Israel he says that, "God destroyed them that believed
   not." What is it to be destroyed? Destroyed! This does not end with the
   white skeleton and the bleached bones which lay in the wilderness--a
   horror to the passerby! He means something more than even that!

   Brought out of Egypt and yet destroyed! Take heed, professor! You may
   be brought into something like Gospel liberty and yet may perish! Take
   heed, you carnal professor, I say! You may fancy you have escaped the
   bondage of the Law, but yet you shall never enter into the rest which
   remains for the people of God--you shall be destroyed/Let that word
   "destroyed" ring in your ears and it will make you bless God, who is
   able to keep you from falling, if it shall lead you to flee to Him for
   help!

   Next he says of the fallen angels that they are, "reserved in
   everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day."
   What that may be, we can but roughly guess. Satan is allowed to go
   about the world. Still he wears his chains and he has a tether and the
   Lord knows how to pull him in, both by Providence and direct acts of
   power. We believe that these spirits are under darkness--a gloom--a
   thick darkness that may be felt hangs perpetually over their minds.
   Wherever they may be they are waiting till Christ shall come to summon
   them as rebellious creatures before His bar that they may receive their
   sentence and begin afresh their dreadful Hell.

   And remember, dear Brothers and Sisters, unless eternal love shall
   prevent it, this case must be ours! We, too, must enter into places
   reserved in darkness, wearing everlasting chains, to endure eternal
   fire. We should do so, we must do so, if it were not for Him, "who is
   able to keep us from falling and present us faultless before the
   presence of His glory with exceeding joy." Nor is this all, for if you
   will patiently read the next verse, you will see that Jude has, if
   possible, introduced a more graphic picture.

   The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah are bright as the sun goes down. The
   inhabitants are merry with boisterous laughter. There is plenty in the
   barn. There is luxury in the hall, for the plain of Sodom was well
   watered and lacked for nothing. Down went that sun upon a disastrous
   evening--never to rise upon the most of those who were in that doomed
   city. At daybreak, just as the sun is beginning to shine upon the
   earth, angels had hastened Lot and his family out of the city--and no
   sooner had they reached the little city of Zoar than straightway the
   Heaven is red with supernatural flame and down descends a terrific
   rain--as if God had poured Hell out of Heaven! He rained fire and
   brimstone upon the cities and the smoke of their torment went up so
   that Abraham, far away to the west, could see the rolling cloud and the
   terrible brightness of the fire, even at midday.

   And as men go to the "Lacus Asphaltites," or the Dead Sea, they see to
   this day where death has reigned. There are masses of asphalt still
   floating upon the surface of that sea where there is nothing that
   lives. No fish swim in its turbid streams. There are indubitable
   evidences there of some dread judgment of God. And as Jude thought of
   this, he seemed to say, "Oh God, preserve us from such a doom, for this
   is the doom of all apostates, either in this world, or in that which is
   to come, thus to be consumed with fire." And as he remembered that God
   would keep His people, he blessed that protecting hand which covers
   every saint and he wrote down, "Now unto Him that is able to keep you
   from falling."

   I have a thought in my mind. I cannot, of course, tell whether it is
   right or not, but it strikes me just now--the author's name is
   Jude--Judas. Did he recollect Judas, his namesake that was called
   Iscariot, as he penned these words? He had known him, probably had
   respected him as the others had done. He had marked him that night when
   he sat at the table and like others said, "Is it I?" Probably Jude was
   very surprised when he saw Iscariot take the sop and dip in the dish
   with the Savior. And when he went out he could scarcely believe his own
   ears when the Savior said that he that betrayed Him had gone forth!

   He must have known how Judas kissed the Son of Man and sold Him for
   thirty pieces of silver. He could not but be aware how in remorse he
   hanged himself and how his bowels gushed out. And I think the shadow of
   the doom of Judas fell upon this better Judas while he penned these
   words--and he seems to say with greater emphasis--"Unto Him that is
   able to keep you from falling, unto Him be glory forever and ever."
   Thus you see, dear Friends, we are getting into the track, I think, of
   Jude's thoughts--he thought about the failures of others and the
   terrible way in which they had fallen.

   Yet again, by your leave, Jude had a very clear view of the greatness
   of the sins into which apostates fall. Probably there is not in the
   whole compass of Holy Writ a more fearful picture of the sin of
   backsliders and apostates than in the Epistle of Jude. I remember
   preaching to you one evening from that text, "Raging waves of the sea,
   foaming out their own shame; wandering stars to whom is reserved the
   blackness of darkness forever."

   I remember how you trembled--myself trembling most with such a terrible
   message to deliver! Where could such a text or simile be found but in
   the book of Jude? The sins of apostates are tremendous. They are
   usually not content with the average of human guilt. They must make
   themselves giants in iniquity. None make such devils as those that were
   once angels and none make such reprobates as those who once seemed to
   bid fair for the kingdom of Heaven! These go into filthy dreams, into
   sensuality--"they give themselves over to fornication and go after
   strange flesh," as he has put it.

   In fact, where can we set the bounds to which a man will go, when he
   crucifies the Lord that bought him and puts Him to an open shame? Oh,
   Beloved, as I think of the sin into which these apostates have gone, I
   cannot but feel that you must bless God with Jude, that there is One
   "who is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless
   before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy."

   II. I might continue in this strain, but perhaps I had better not. I
   would rather turn to THE BLESSINGS OF WHICH JUDE SPEAKS. He seems to
   ascribe in this doxology three blessings, at least, to the power of the
   Lord Jesus. The first is ability to keep you from falling and for this,
   I am sure, the highest praise is due when you consider for a moment the
   dangerous way. In some respects the path to Heaven is very safe. It is
   so as God made it. But in other respects there is no road so dangerous
   as the road to eternal life. It is beset with difficulties.

   In some of our mountain climbing we have gone along narrow pathways
   where there was but a step between us and death--for deep down beneath
   us was a gaping precipice--perhaps a mile in perpendicular descent.
   One's brain reels at the thought of it now and yet we passed along
   quite safely. The road to Heaven is much like that. One false step,
   (and how easy it is to take that, if Divine Grace is absent), and down
   we go!

   What a slippery path is that which some of us have to tread. You know
   that there are a million opportunities in a single week for your foot
   to slip and for your soul to be ruined. There are some spots, I
   believe, upon some of the more difficult Swiss mountains where no man
   ought to go at all, and where, if any must go, they should be only such
   as have become most accomplished mountaineers through years of
   practice--for one has to cling to the side of the rock--to hold on,
   perhaps, by bushes or stones that may be there, with nothing for the
   feet to rest upon except, perhaps, an inch of projecting crag!

   And so we go creeping on with our backs to the danger, for to look down
   upon it would be to make the brain reel and cause us to fall. And the
   result of falling, of course, would be the end of life--the body would
   be dashed into a thousand pieces. Such is truly the way to Heaven. You
   must all have passed some such difficult places, and, in looking back,
   I can only, myself, say, "Unto Him that has kept me from falling, when
   my feet had well near gone and my steps had almost slipped. Unto Him be
   glory forever and ever!"

   But next you have to think of the weakness of the person. Some men may
   travel roads which would not be safe for others and what are you, my
   brother pilgrim, but a little babe? It is unsafe to trust you along the
   pathway to Glory. In the best roads you are soon tripped up. Those
   feeble knees of yours can scarcely support your tottering weight. A
   straw might throw you and a pebble could wound you. Oh, if you shall be
   kept, how must you bless the patient power which watches over you day
   by day! Reflect upon your tendency to sin. The giddiness of that poor
   brain, the silliness of that deceitful heart. Think how apt you are to
   choose danger--how the tendency is to cast yourselves down--how you
   rather are inclined to fall than to stand, and I am sure you will sing
   more sweetly than you have ever done, "Glory be to Him who is able to
   keep me from falling."

   Then you have to notice further the many foes who try to push you down.
   The road is rough enough. The child is weak enough. But here and there
   is an enemy who is in ambush who comes out when we least expect him and
   labors to trip us up, or hurl us down a precipice. I suppose you never
   did see a man fall from a precipice. Some of you may have been fools
   enough to go and see a man walk on a rope, in which case, I believe,
   you have incurred the guilt of murder. Because if the man does not kill
   himself, you encourage him to put himself where he probably might do
   so. But if you have ever really seen a man fall over a precipice, your
   hair must surely have stood on end--your flesh creeping on your bones
   as you saw the poor human form falling off the edge--never to stand in
   mortal life again! Surely as you left the place where you stood and
   fled away from the edge of the precipice, you cried, "O bless Him that
   made me stand and kept my feet from falling!"

   How alarmed you would be if you were in such a position and had seen
   one fall and that same monster who had pushed him over should come to
   hurl you over, also! And especially if you felt that you were as weak
   as water and could not resist the gigantic demon! Now just such is your
   case! You cannot stand against Satan! A little maid made Peter deny his
   Master and a little maid may make the strongest among us tremble
   sometimes. Oh, if we are preserved in spite of such mighty enemies who
   are ever waiting to destroy us, we shall have great cause to sing
   praises "unto Him that is able to keep us from falling." Only Christ
   has the power to take us into Heaven.

   You may keep a man from starving, but you cannot take him into the
   king's palace and present him at court. Suppose that a man had been a
   rebel. You might hide him from the pursuers and aid in his escape but
   you could not take him into the presence of the king and cause him to
   live in the royal castle of the land. But you see that Christ preserves
   His people though they have offended God and daily provoke His justice.
   And He does more, for He presents them to the King of kings in the high
   court of Heaven itself! This it is which makes the other blessing so
   great. We are not anxious to always live in this world. We find
   ourselves in a strange land here and would be glad to fly away and be
   at rest. This is to us a wilderness state and we rejoice to know that
   Canaan lies beyond.

   Our heavenly Joshua can lead us into it! He can fight for us against
   Amalek and slay all our foes and preserve us from falling. But better
   still He can and He will take us into the Promised Land and give us to
   see the "better country, even the heavenly," and to there will He
   conduct all the host so that not one shall perish or be left behind!
   Christ gives preservation, but He adds glorification--and that is
   better still! Here then, my Brothers and Sisters, is a thought of
   incomparable sweetness! We are safe while in this world--

   "More happy, but not more secure are The glorified spirits in Heaven."
   And we, too, shall be, before long, as happy as they are because He
   will present us with them before the presence of His glory with
   exceeding joy!

   We cannot, however, enlarge on this point, though there is much, very
   much, that ought to be said. We proceed to notice the condition in
   which the saints are to be when presented--they are to be
   "faultless"--for our Lord never stops short of perfection in His work
   of love. That Savior who means to keep His people to the end will not
   present them at last just alive, all black and foul as when He helped
   them out of the miry places. He will not bring them in, as sometimes
   gallant men have to bring those whom they have rescued from drowning,
   with just the vital spark within them. No, our Savior will carry His
   people safe from falling through this life and He will present them,
   how?--faultless!

   Oh, that is a wondrous word, "faultless"! We are a long way off from it
   now. Faulty, yes. We are now faulty through and through--but Jesus
   Christ will never be content till we are faultless. And this He will
   make us in three ways--He will wash us till there is not a spot left,
   for the chief of sinners shall be as white and fair as God's purest
   angel. The eyes of justice will look and God will say, "No spot of sin
   remains in you."

   You may have been a drunkard, a thief, an adulterer and what not--but
   if Christ, in mercy, undertakes your case, He will wash you in His
   blood so thoroughly that you shall be faultless at last! You will be
   without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing. Now we are defiled and
   covered with sin as if we had "lay among the pots." We have reveled in
   unclean-ness till we are as if we had been "plunged in the ditch." Our
   own flesh must abhor us if we could but see how defiled we are by
   nature and by practice.

   Now all this shall be completely removed and we shall be whiter than
   snow! You remember that when the disciples looked at Jesus on the Mount
   of Transfiguration, they saw that His garments were white and
   glistening--whiter than any fuller could make them! And so shall we be
   hereafter--whiter and fairer than any earthly art can attain to. The
   sea of glass, clear as crystal, will not be whiter nor purer than we
   shall be when washed in the blood of the Lamb. But that is only one
   way.

   If a man had no faults it would still be necessary for him to have some
   virtues. A man cannot enter Heaven simply because transgression is put
   away. The Law must be kept! There must be a positive obedience to
   Divine precepts. Religion is no negation, an absence of things merely
   evil. It is the presence of the good, the true, the pure. But since
   even when we do our best we shall be unprofitable servants, we need
   something higher than we can ever produce by these, our feeble and
   sinful powers! Therefore the Lord our God imputes to us the perfect
   righteousness of His Son Christ Jesus, for--

   "Lest the shadow of a spot
   Should on my soul be found,
   He took the robe the Savior worked,
   And cast it all around."

   The righteousness of Jesus Christ will make the saint who wears it so
   fair that he will be positively faultless! Yes, perfect in the sight of
   God! There is a fullness in this which it delights my soul to dwell
   upon. A man may be faultless in my sight, but not in the sight of those
   who know him intimately. A Christian may be so holy as to escape the
   censure of all just men. But ministering spirits, who read the heart
   and deal with the inner man, can speak of evil which has not come to
   light before human eyes. And we know that God sees even more clearly
   than angelic spirits, for He charges them with folly.

   Now, God is to see no iniquity in us, no shortcoming. We shall be tried
   in His scales and set in the light of His Countenance and be pronounced
   "faultless." God's Law will not only have no charge against us, but it
   will be magnified in us and honored by us. We shall have imputed to us
   that righteousness which belongs to Him who has done all this for us
   that He might "present us faultless before the presence of His glory."

   Fourthly and best, perhaps, the Spirit of God will make new creatures
   of us. He has begun the work and He will finish it. He will make us so
   perfectly holy that we shall have no tendency to sin any more. The day
   will come when we shall feel that Adam in the garden was not more pure
   than we are. You shall have no taint of evil in you. Judgment, memory,
   will--every power and passion shall be emancipated from the thralldom
   of evil. You shall be holy even as God is holy and in His Presence you
   shall dwell forever!

   How altered we shall be! Look within and see if your experience is not
   like the Apostle Paul's who found a potent law in his members so that
   when he would do good, evil was present with him--and when he desired
   to escape some evil, he did at times the very thing he allowed not but
   would most heartily condemn! So is it with us--we would be holy, but we
   are like a ball that has a bias in it--we cannot go in a straight and
   direct line. We try to hit the mark but we are prone to start on one
   side like a deceitful bow. There is a black drop in our hearts which
   taints all the streams and none of them can be pure.

   But it will be all changed one day--we shall be re-made and all the
   evil gone, gone forever! How joyous must have been the entrance of
   Naaman, the Assyrian, into his house after he had washed in Jordan's
   stream and found his flesh restored to him as the flesh of a little
   child! I think I see him as the watchman on the tower has given notice
   of his approach in the distance. The whole household is at the gate to
   meet him and to see if he comes back in health. His wife, if eastern
   customs would not permit her going forth in public, would look from her
   easement to catch a glimpse of his face--to see if the dread spots were
   gone.

   How joyful the shout--"He is cured and clean!" But this is nothing
   compared with the rapture of that hour when the everlasting doors will
   be lifted up and we, made meet for the inheritance of the saints in
   light, shall enter into the joy of our Lord! Or take another
   illustration from Scripture and try and realize the happiness which
   reigned in the family of the maniac out of whom the legion of devils
   had departed. Perhaps he had been home before when under the evil
   influence of the foul fiends--how terrified they doubtless were with
   the mad frenzy of the poor unhappy wretch as he cut himself with stones
   and broke all bonds put on him in tenderness and love in order to
   restrain his self-imposed misery and wounds.

   And now, as he comes once more to his house, they see him approach and
   the old terror seizes them because they know not that he is a changed
   man, but suppose him still to be the demented being of days gone by.
   But he enters the door as calm and composed as if he had returned from
   a long journey and was only anxious to relate the incidents of the
   pilgrimage and greet loved friends once more! With no fierce frenzy
   rolling in his eyes, no loud discordant shrieks rending the air, all is
   the demeanor of a well-regulated, joyful, yet chastened mind! As all
   this is realized by his friends and they hear what great things the
   Lord has done for him! What joy must have been in that family circle! I
   should like to have seen it. I am sure it was a choice exhibition of
   real human bliss such as earth only witnesses now and then.

   It must have been a beam of purest radiance lighting up the scene, like
   the splendor which Saul of Tarsus saw on the road to Damascus as it lit
   up the day when he was made a new creature in Christ Jesus. Here, also,
   we can most truthfully say that the joy, though great, was not
   comparable to the joy which shall be ours when we are changed into new
   creatures--when we shall be clothed and in our right mind--no longer
   prone to wander among the black mountains of iniquity and no more
   tempted to abide among those dead in trespasses and sins. Then we shall
   be ever holy and always living unto God and made like He! Oh this is
   joy indeed! Not only will He keep us from falling, but He will present
   us faultless!

   My Brothers and Sisters, at the thought of this I think you must join
   with Jude and say, "Now unto Him that is able to do all this, be glory
   and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever." I cannot speak to
   you as I would wish upon such a theme as this--who could? But when we
   get to Heaven our song shall be more sweet, more loud, because we shall
   understand better the dangers from which we have escaped and how very
   much we owe to Him who has kept us and brought us safely through all
   the vicissitudes of life, unto the place He has prepared for us.
   Meanwhile, never let us be forgetful of that mighty goodness which
   holds us fast and will not let us go.

   III. Still I have not done with the text. I have already forestalled my
   next thought, but I think it requires a special notice. Observe, the
   Apostle adds, "To present us faultless before His presence, WITH
   EXCEEDING GREAT JOY." Who will have the joy? My Brothers and Sisters,
   you will have it! Have you ever mused upon the parable of the Prodigal
   Son? I know you have! No one can have diligently read the Bible without
   staying to think over, again and again, of that most tender and
   instructive of our Lord's parables.

   Now, I ask, Who was happy at that feast? Don't you think it was the
   prodigal? What was the character of those thoughts filling his heart
   and making it heave as if it would burst? How overjoyed he must have
   been! How utterly crushed down with his father's love and all the
   unexpected marks of kindness and affection! He had had his days of
   feasting and sinful merriment, but no songs could ever have been so
   sweet as those which rung round the old roof-tree to welcome him home!
   No viands had ever tasted so delicious as that fatted calf! And no
   voice of any companion or witching charmer at his guilty feasts had
   ever sounded such melodious notes in his ears as those words ofhis
   father, "Let us eat and be merry."

   So will it be with us when we have been restored to ourselves--when
   wearied of the world and hungering and thirsting after righteousness we
   shall have been led to the Father's house by the cords of love which
   the Spirit shall cast around us. When safely brought through all the
   weary pilgrimage from the far-off country, we shall tread the golden
   streets and be safe inside the pearly gates and have the past all gone
   forever among the things we never shall meet again. What rapture will
   be ours! This will be Heaven, indeed, when sin shall be gone, Satan
   shut out, temptation gone forever! You shall have a joy of which you
   cannot now conceive. Rivers of pleasure shall flow into your soul! You
   shall drink such draughts of bliss as your soul has never known this
   side the grave.

   Oh, be joyful now with a respite of the joy which is to be revealed!
   And afterwards you shall have the fullness of Divine bliss forever and
   ever! Who shall be happy? Why, the minister will be happy! What
   pleasure was there in the heart of the shepherd youth, David, the son
   of Jesse, when he had gone forth to do battle with the lion and bear in
   order to rescue the lamb out of their jaws when God had delivered him
   and made him successful in his attempt! How gladly he must have watched
   the little lamb run to the side of its dam and in the mutual pleasure
   of these poor dumb animals I am sure he found a joy.

   And so all the shepherds in Heaven--all who have been faithful pastors
   who have cared for and tended their flocks--shall find a bliss
   unspeakable in welcoming to Glory those darling ones preserved from the
   power of the devil, "who goes about as a roaring lion seeking whom he
   may devour." Yes, ministers will be sharers in this happiness! I think
   we shall have a special joy in bringing our sheaves with us. If it may
   please God to keep me from falling--if I just get inside the door of
   Heaven with some of the many thousands that God has given to me as my
   spiritual children--I will fall prostrate before His feet the greatest
   debtor to His mercy that ever lived and one that has more cause than
   any other of His creatures to thank Him and ascribe to Him glory and
   honor, dominion and power, forever and ever!

   Here I am, and the children whom You have given me! Unto You be praise!
   And what will be the joy of angels, too? How exceedingly great their
   bliss will be! If there is joy among the angels over one sinner that
   repents, what will there be over ten thousands times ten thousands, not
   of repenting, but of perfected sinners, cleansed from every stain, set
   free from every flaw? Oh, you cherubim and seraphim, how loud will be
   your music! How you will tune your harps anew! How shall every string
   wake up to the sweetest music in praise of God. "Let the sea roar and
   the fullness thereof" at the thought of the glorious joy at God's right
   hand!

   Who will have joy, I ask again? Why Christ will have the most joy of
   all! Angels and ministers and you, yourselves, will scarcely know such
   joy as He will have--all His sheep safely folded--every stone of the
   building placed in its proper position. All the blood-bought and
   blood-washed ones--all whom the Father gave Him--delivered out of the
   jaw of the lion! All whom He covenanted to redeem effectually
   saved--His counsel all fulfilled, His stipulations all carried out--the
   Covenant not only ratified, but fulfilled in all its jots and tittles!
   Verily, none will be so happy as the great Surety in that day!

   As the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall Christ rejoice over
   you. You know it is written that, "for the joy set before Him He
   endured the Cross, despising the shame." And also, "He shall see of the
   travail of His soul and shall be abundantly satisfied." Now this
   satisfaction and joy will be our Lord's when the whole Church is
   faultless and complete in the presence of His Glory--but not till then.
   In that hour, when all His jewels are reckoned up and none found
   missing, He shall rejoice anew in spirit and shall thank God with yet
   more of joy than He did when here on earth and thought of this day in
   prospect and by that thought nerved Himself for cruel suffering and a
   death of shame. Yes, Christ will be glad!

   Our Head will have His share of joy with all the members! And happily
   He will be able to bear more, as He most certainly deserves, and will
   have more. Who will have joy? Why, God Himself will have joy! It is no
   blasphemy to say that the joy of God on that occasion will be infinite.
   It is always infinite! But it will be then infinitely displayed before
   His creatures' gaze. Listen to these words--you cannot fathom them, but
   you may look at them. It is written, "The Lord your God will rejoice
   over you with joy. He will joy over you with singing" (Zeph. 3:17). As
   I have said on this platform before, I think that is the most wonderful
   text in the Bible in some respects--God Himself singing!

   I can imagine, when the world was made, the morning stars shouting for
   joy. But God did not sing. He said it was "very good," and that was
   all. There was no song. But oh, to think of it, that when all the
   chosen race shall meet around the Throne, the joy of the Eternal Father
   shall swell so high that God, who fills all in all, shall burst out
   into an infinite, godlike song! I will only put in this one more
   thought, that all this, Beloved, is about YOU. All this you have a
   share in, the least in the Church, the poorest in the family, the
   humblest Believer--this is all true of you--He will keep you from
   falling and present you spotless before His Presence with exceedingly
   great joy.

   Oh, cannot you join the song and sing with me, "To the only wise God
   and Savior be glory and honor, dominion and majesty forever. Amen"? For
   my part I feel like that good old saint who said that if she got to
   Heaven, Jesus Christ should never hear the last of it. Truly He never
   shall--

   "I'll praise my Savior with my breath;
   And when my voice is at last in death,
   Praise shall employ my nobler powers--
   My days of praise shall ne'er be past,
   While life and thought and being last,
   Or immortality endures."

   I want you to go away with a sense of your own weakness and yet a
   belief in your own safety. I want you to know that you cannot stand a
   minute--that you will be damned within another second unless Divine
   Grace keep you out of Hell. But I want you to feel that since you are
   in the hands of Christ you cannot perish--neither can any pluck you out
   of His hands! And, poor sinners, my heart' s desire is that you may be
   put into the hands of Christ tonight! That you may have done with
   trusting yourselves. You can ruin, but you cannot save yourselves.

   "Oh Israel, you have destroyed yourself, but in Me is your help found."
   Christ alone can save you! Oh look out of self to Christ! Trust
   yourselves in His hands! He is "able to keep you from falling." You
   cannot even stand upright yourselves and if He should set you upright
   you cannot keep so for a minute without His protecting care. If saints
   need to be kept, how much more need have you to seek the shelter of the
   Savior's wounded side? Flee there as the dove to the cleft of the rock!
   If holy men of God cry daily for pardon and profess to have no right of
   themselves to Heaven, how much more urgent is your case? You must
   perish if you die as you are! You can never make yourself faultless,
   but Christ can.

   He wants to do it--He has opened a fountain for sin and for
   uncleanness--wash and be clean! Again, I say, look to Jesus! Away with
   self and cling to Christ! Down with self-confidence and up with simple
   faith in Christ Jesus! I shall not let you go, dear Friends, without
   singing one verse which I think will express the feeling of each one of
   us--

   "Let me among Your saints be found Whenever the Archangel's trump shall
   sound, To see your smiling face. Then loudest of the crowd I'll sing,
   While Heaven's resounding mansions ring With shouts of Sovereign
   Grace."

                            Are You Prepared To Die?

   A SERMON PREACHED BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE
   NEWINGTON.

   "How will you do in the swelling of Jordan?" Jeremiah 12:5.

   CANAAN may be considered as a type of two states or conditions in the
   Christian's life. It was the land of rest to the children of Israel
   after a weary pilgrimage in the wilderness. Now it is written that "we
   who believe do enter into rest." A true Christian possessed of strong
   faith will not have a wilderness state on earth so much as a land
   flowing with milk and honey because his faith will give him the
   substance of things hoped for and be the evidence of things not seen.
   Many disciples live a life of depression, wretchedness, and discomfort
   which would be completely changed if they had faith in God and lived a
   higher life of devotedness and love.

   Canaan may be fairly considered as a type of that better state of
   Christianity which some enjoy. It is not altogether free from ills. The
   Canaanite dwells in the land and there are still wars and fights, but
   there is rest and there is the spirit of service developing itself in
   the cultivation of the promised land. But Canaan is generally used to
   shadow forth "the rest which remains for the people of God" beyond the
   skies. Heaven is thus frequently described as corresponding to the
   earthly inheritance of the Jews.

   It is our hope--the end of our pilgrimage. It contains our Jerusalem
   and the temple "not made with hands." When this is the view taken of
   the type, then Jordan is not unnaturally likened unto death. Its dark
   waters are made to picture forth to our minds the chill stream through
   which we wade in our dying hour. It is a beautiful emblem and we have
   all doubtless often sung Dr. Watt's hymn with much feeling--

   "There is land of pure delight,
   Where saints immortal reign.
   Infinite day excludes the night,
   And pleasures banish pain.
   There everlasting spring abides,
   And never-withering flowers.
   Death, like a narrow sea, divides
   This hea venly land from ours."

   Taking "the swelling of Jordan" to represent the precise time of death,
   the question really is what shall we do when we come to die? "How will
   you do in the swelling of Jordan?"

   I. We notice, in the first place, that this is an EXCEEDINGLY PRACTICAL
   QUESTION. "How will you do?" is the enquiry. There are some subjects
   which are more or less matters of pure faith and personal feeling. And
   though all Christian doctrines bear more or less directly upon the
   Christian life, yet they are not what is commonly meant by practical
   subjects. Our text, however, brings us face to face with a matter which
   is essentially a matter of doing and of acting-- it asks how we mean to
   conduct ourselves in the hour of death.

   We sometimes hear the remark made by those who object to doctrinal
   preaching that we are too speculative and utter our own opinions which
   feed men's fancies but do not regulate their life. Now we believe that
   every promise leads to a precept and every doctrine has its duty--so we
   will not admit the justice of the insinuation even if we did preach
   doctrine entirely to the exclusion of the Commandments--which we
   emphatically deny. But here we have, at any rate, a topic practical
   enough. I am only afraid it will be a little too much so for some! They
   will turn it into a sentiment and a feeling and not act upon it so as
   to put it into practice and exemplify its power in after days.

   Christians may differ with me on some points, but I am sure that here
   we are united in belief--we must die and ought not to die unprepared.
   There is a divergence of opinion as to what we ought to do at the
   commencement of our

   Christian life--I maintain that we ought to follow Christ and be
   immersed in water, "for thus it becomes us to fulfill all
   righteousness." Others oppose that as being unnecessary, inexpedient,
   or what not. We differ at the beginning of life, but we agree in the
   end--we must die. And we all want to die the death of the righteous and
   to have our last end like his.

   II. We notice, in the second place, that it is UNDOUBTEDLY A PERSONAL
   QUESTION. How will you do? It individualizes us and makes us, each one,
   to come face to face with a dying hour. Now we all need this and it
   will be well for each one of us to look for a minute into the grave. We
   are too apt to regard all men as mortal but ourselves. Somehow we can
   see frailty of life as well as all the other frailties which we possess
   in common much more clearly in other people than we can in ourselves.

   We are far too much blind to our own weakness and shall do well to ask
   ourselves, each of us, "My Soul, how will you do in the swelling of
   Jordan?" The ancient warrior who wept because before a hundred years
   were passed he knew his immense army would be gone and not a man remain
   behind to tell the tale, would have been wiser if he had wept also for
   himself and left his bloody wars alone and lived as a man who must one
   day die and find after death a day of judgment! Each one of you must
   die. If I were addressing an assembly of the sages of the world, I
   should say, "All your combined wisdom cannot lengthen the days of one
   of you even a single minute. You may reckon the distance of the stars
   and weigh worlds, but you cannot tell me when one of you will die, nor
   how many grains of sand are left behind in the hourglass of time which
   shows the exit of each spirit from the world."

   I say now to you, the wisest of you must die! And you know not but that
   you may die before long. So with the mightiest and the richest of men.
   Samson was mastered by a stronger than man and the wealthiest of men
   cannot bribe Death to delay his dart for a single hour. We all come
   into the world one by one and will go out of it alone, also. Loved ones
   come to the brink of the dark stream, but there they shake hands and
   say, "farewell," and we go on alone. The Prophet's companion and
   successor followed his master till the fiery chariot came to take his
   leader away. And when the messengers of God came they left the servant
   behind, vainly crying, "My father, my father! The chariot of Israel and
   the horsemen thereof."

   We had better, therefore, take the question up as individuals--seeing
   that it is one in which we shall be dealt with singly and be unable,
   then, to claim or use the help of an earthly friend. I put to the
   young, to the old--to the rich, to the poor--to each one of this vast
   assembly! I put it as if we were alone before our God--"How will you do
   in the swelling of Jordan?"

   III. As a third thought we call attention to the fact that it is one of
   the MOST SOLEMN questions. Death and life are stern and awful
   realities. To say that anything "is a matter of life and death" is to
   bring one of the most emphatic and solemn subjects under our notice.
   Now the question we are considering this morning is of this character
   and we must deal with it as it becomes us--as a subject involving the
   everlasting interest of souls. The question is of infinite importance
   to all, but there are some whose case is manifestly such that they need
   to gird up the loins of their minds and address themselves to its
   consideration with intense thought and care.

   Let me call attention to one or two cases--for while I wish to stir up
   all--I am bid to have special compassion on some, making a difference,
   so that I may pluck them as brands out of the fire. I have been curious
   enough to think that I should like to ask that question of a Jew, of
   one who rejects Christ as the Messiah. "How will you do in the swelling
   of Jordan?" According to the Law, and it is that under which every Jew
   is born, "Cursed is everyone that continues not in all things that are
   written in the book of the Law to do them."

   Now there never was and never will be any man who did, or could,
   "continue in all things written in the book of the Law to do them"! And
   consequently every man becomes accursed. And it must be a dreadful
   thing for a man to think of dying under the curse and ban of his own
   religious faith! And yet every Jew is so cursed by his own book of
   Law-- accursed forever! What comfort will that yield him when he comes
   to the swelling of Jordan? I have thought, too, that I should like to
   ask the atheist, the unbeliever, this question, "How will you do in the
   swelling of Jordan?"

   He tells me, perhaps, that he believes in annihilation--he will need
   comfort when he is lying upon that last weary bed. Will he get it out
   of that well? The dreary blank of total destruction, of ceasing to
   be--is there anything to help a spirit when it lies where it most wants
   consolation, tossing to and fro in pain and weakness? I think not. I
   should like also to put the question to a Roman Catholic--how will he
   do "in the swelling of Jordan?"

   Some time ago, you will remember, a Prince of the Catholic Church
   departed--where did he go? I am not versed in such matters and should
   not like to judge anybody's soul, but on the coffin of the Cardinal we
   find a request that we would pray for his soul--and there have been
   masses said for its repose. It is evident, therefore, that the
   Cardinal's soul went somewhere where it needs praying for and to some
   place where it is not in repose. Now if this is to be the lot for a
   Cardinal Archbishop, there is but a poor outlook for an ordinary
   professor of the same faith! If a prince in the church dies and does
   not go to Heaven as we have been hoping, not to eternal rest--but to a
   place where he needs our intercession and where he has no repose for
   his soul--why then it must be dreadful work to die with such a creed as
   that!

   I would sooner have beneath my head the most prickly thorn bush than
   have that for my dying pillow! Oh, we want something better than this!
   We desire a hope more rapturous, more Divine, more full of immortality
   than the certainty of going to a place where there is no repose and
   where our souls need the prayers of sinful men on earth! But I do not
   know that we have very much to do with any of these--they must "gang
   their am gait"--they must go their own way. And if they are found wrong
   at the last, we are sorry that it should be so. Our own business is
   certainly the first matter in hand. Therefore, forgetting them, let the
   question come to each of us, "How will you do in the swelling of
   Jordan?"

   IV. Remember, in the fourth place, that this question was put by way of
   REBUKE to the Prophet Jeremiah. He seems to have been a little afraid
   of the people among whom he dwelt. They had evidently persecuted him
   very much, mocking him and laughing him to scorn. But God tells him to
   make his face like flint and not to care for them, for, says He, "If
   you are afraid of them, how will you do in the swelling of Jordan?"

   This ought to be a rebuke to every Christian who is subject to the fear
   of man. I do not believe that any preacher will be long in his pulpit
   without having the temptation to be afraid of some man or another. And
   if he does not stand very firmly upon his integrity he will find some
   of the best of his friends getting the upper hand with him. And this
   will never do with God's minister. He must deal out God's Word
   impartially to rich or poor, to good or bad. And he must determine to
   have no master except his Master who is in Heaven--no bit nor bridle
   for his mouth except that of prudence and discretion--which God Himself
   shall put there.

   If we are afraid of a man that shall die and the son of man that is
   crushed before the moth, how fearful shall we be when we have to talk
   with the grim king of terrors! If we are afraid of puny man, how shall
   we be able to face it out before the dread ordeal of the Day of
   Judgment? Yet I know some Christians that are very much abashed by the
   world's opinion--by the opinion of their family circle--or of the
   workshop. Now what does it matter, after all? There is an old proverb,
   that "he is a great fool that is laughed out of his coat." And there
   was an improvement on it, that "he was a greater fool who was laughed
   out of his skin."

   And there is another, that "he is the greatest fool of all who is
   laughed out of his soul." He that will be content to be damned in order
   to be fashionable pays dearly, indeed, for what he gets. Oh, to dare to
   be singular, if to be singular is to be right! But if you are afraid of
   man, what will you do in the swelling of Jordan? The same rebuke might
   be applied to us when we get fretful under the little troubles of life.
   You have losses in business, vexations in the family--you all have
   crosses to carry--but my text comes to you and it says, "If you cannot
   bear this, how will you do in the swelling of Jordan? If your religion
   is not equal to the ordinary emergencies of common days, what will you
   do when you get to that extraordinary day which will be to you the most
   important day of your being?"

   Come Friends, be not bowed down with these things! Bear them cheerfully
   since there is much sterner work to do than any that you have met with
   in the battle of life. And the same reproof might come to us when we
   get petulant under pains of body. There are some of us who, as soon as
   we get a little sick, become so fretful that those who like us best are
   farthest from us! We can scarcely have a little depression of spirit
   but straightway we are ready to give up all for lost and like Jonah,
   say, "We do well to be angry even unto death." Now this ought not to
   be! We should quit ourselves like men and not be perturbed with these
   little rivulets--for if these sweep us away, what shall we do when
   Jordan is swollen to the brim and we have to pass through that?

   When one of the martyrs, whose name is the somewhat singular one of
   Pommily, was confined previous to his burning, his wife was also taken
   up upon the charge of heresy. She, good woman, had resolved to die with
   her husband and she appeared, as far as most people could judge, to be
   very firm in her faith. But the jailer's wife, though she had no
   religion, took a merciful view of the case as far as she could do so
   and thought, "I am afraid this woman will never stand the test. She
   will never burn with her husband--she has neither faith nor strength
   enough to endure the trial." Therefore, one day calling her out from
   her cell, she said to her, "Lass, run to the garden and fetch me the
   key that lies there."

   The poor woman ran willingly enough. She took the key up and it burned
   her fingers, for the jailer's wife had made it red hot. She came
   running back crying with pain. "Yes, Wench," said the jailer's wife,
   "if you cannot bear a little burn in your hand, how will you bear to be
   burned in your whole body?" And this, I am sorry to add, was the means
   of bringing her to recant the faith which she professed, but which
   never had been in her heart.

   I apply the story thus--If we cannot bear the little trifling pangs
   which come upon us in our ordinary circumstances which are, as it were,
   the burning of our hands, what shall we do when every pulse beats pain
   and every throb is an agony and the whole tenement begins to crumble
   about the spirit that is so soon to be disturbed? Come, let us pluck up
   courage! We have yet to fight the giant! Let us not be afraid of these
   dwarfs! Let the ordinary trials of every day be laughed to scorn! In
   the strength of Divine Grace, let us sing with our poet--

   "Weak as I am, yet through Your strength, I all things can perform."

   For if we cannot bear these, how will we do in the swelling of Jordan?
   This is what the text was originally meant to teach. We will now use it
   for a further purpose.

   V. The question may be put as A MATTER OF CAUTION. In this assembly
   there are some who have no hope, no faith in Christ. Now I think if
   they will look within at their own experience they will find that they
   are by no means completely at ease. The pleasures of this world are
   very sweet, but how soon they sour if they do not sicken the appetite!
   After the night of merriment there is often the morning of regret. "Who
   has woe? Who has redness of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine.
   They that go to seek mixed wine."

   It is an almost universal confession that the joys of earth promise
   more than they perform and that in looking back upon them the wisest
   must confess with Solomon, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." Now if
   these things seem to be vanity while you are in good bodily health, how
   will they look when you are in sickness? If vanity while you can enjoy
   them, what will they appear when you must say farewell to them all? If
   it were vanity to the rich man while he was clothed in purple and fine
   linen and fared sumptuously every day, what greater vanity it must have
   been when it was said, "This night your soul shall be required of you:
   then whose shall those things be which you have provided?"

   How will you do in Jordan when these joys shall vanish and there shall
   be a dreary blank before you? Moreover, you feel already that
   conscience pricks you. You cannot live without God and be perfectly at
   ease unless you are one of those few who are given up to judicial
   blindness and hardness of heart. You could not take an hour quietly to
   think about yourself and your state and yet go to your bed easily. You
   know right well that the only way some of you can keep your peace of
   mind at all is by going from one gay assembly to another and from one
   party of frolic to another, or else from business to business and from
   care to care.

   Your poor soul, like the infant which is to be cast into Moloch's arms,
   cries, and you do not hear its cries because you drown it with the
   noisy drums of this world's pleasures and cares. But still you are not
   at rest--there is a worm in your fair fruit--there are dregs at the
   bottom of your sweetest cups and you know it. Now, if even now you are
   not perfectly at peace--if in this land of peace wherein you have
   trusted you are getting weary of these things--then "how will you do in
   the swelling of Jordan?"

   Moreover, you sometimes have, if I am not mistaken, very strange
   apprehensions. I have known some of the most reckless sinners who have
   had fearful times when nobody could cheer them when a certain fearful
   looking of judgment has haunted them. The most superstitious people in
   the world are those who are the most profane. It is a strange thing
   that there is always that weak point about those who seem to be most
   hardened. But you that are not thus hardened--you know that you dare
   not look forward to death with any pleasure--you cannot! To go to the
   grave is never very joyous work with you. Yes, and if you were certain
   that there could be no more death, it would be the best news that you
   had ever heard! But to some of us it would be the worst that could ever
   come.

   Ah, well! If the very thought of death is bitter, what will the reality
   be? And if to gaze at it from a distance is too hard a thing for your
   mind, what will it be to pass under its yoke--to go through its dark
   valley, to feel its dart--to know that the poison is rankling in your
   veins? What will you do? "How will you do in the swelling of Jordan?"
   Well, I shall not describe what you will do, though I have seen it and
   you must have seen it, too. Sometimes a man dies at ease, like a sheep,
   because he has been dosed with the opium of self-confidence. At other
   times the man is awakened and sees the dreadful doom to which death is
   driving him and starts back and shrinks from the wrath to come and
   cries and shrieks-- and perhaps swears that he will not die! And yet
   die he must--dragged down to that place where he must lift up his eyes
   to see nothing that can give him hope--nothing that can take away the
   sharpness of his anguish.

   I leave this point. God make it a caution to many now present. Some of
   you men and women here may be nearer death than you dream of. I wish
   you would answer the question, "How will you do in the swelling of
   Jordan?"

   VI. But now I intend to use the question as EXCITING MEDITATION in the
   breasts of those who have given their hearts to Christ and who,
   consequently, are prepared to die whenever the summons may come. Well,
   what do we mean to do--how shall we behave ourselves when we come to
   die? I sat down to try and think this matter over, but I cannot, in the
   short time allotted to me, even give you a brief view of the thoughts
   that passed through my mind.

   I began thus, "How shall I do in the swelling of Jordan?" Well, as a
   Believer in Christ, perhaps I may never come there at all, for there
   are some that will be alive and remain at the coming of the Son of Man
   and these will never die For so says the Apostle--"Behold, I show you a
   mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a
   moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump."

   This thought we wish to keep ever before us. My real hope is the coming
   of the Lord Jesus Christ. I would far rather see the Master return than
   see the messenger, Death. I regulate my life as one who is looking for
   and hastening unto the coming of the Son of Man. I will not pay more
   attention to the servant than to the Lord of All. "Come, Lord Jesus!
   Yes, come quickly," is the prayer of our hearts continually. And as the
   bride of Christ, we ought to have our hearts filled with rapture at the
   thought of His return to claim us as His own. If He sends for us, "It
   is well." But best of all, if He comes Himself again the second time
   without sin unto salvation. A sweet truth, which we place first in our
   meditation. I may not sleep, but I must and shall be changed!

   Then I thought again, "How shall I do in the swelling of Jordan?" I may
   go through it in the twinkling of an eye. Remember that good man who
   some time ago was getting ready to preach as usual, but the sermon was
   never delivered on earth? I mean the President of the Wesleyan
   Conference--how speedily was he taken to his rest! And how happy it is
   just to close one's eyes on earth and open them in Heaven! Such, also
   was the death of one of God's aged servants, Mr. Alleine, who had
   battled well for the Truth of God. He was suddenly taken ill and was
   advised to retire to bed. "No," he said, "but I will die in my chair.
   And I am not afraid to die."

   He sat down and only had time to say, "My life is hid with Christ in
   God," and he closed his eyes with his own hands and fell asleep. When
   Ananias, a martyr, knelt to lay his white head upon the block, it was
   said to him as he closed his eyes to receive the stroke, "Shut your
   eyes a little, Old Man, and immediately you shall see the light of
   God." I could envy such a calm departing. Sudden death, sudden Glory!
   Taken away in Elijah's chariot of fire--with the horses driven at the
   speed of lightning so that the spirit scarcely knows that it has left
   the clay before it sees the brightness of the beatific vision! Well,
   that may take away some of the alarm of death--the thought that we may
   not be even a moment in the swelling of Jordan!

   Then again, I thought if I must pass through the swelling of Jordan,
   yet the real act of death takes no time. We hear of suffering on a
   dying bed. The suffering is all connected with life, it is not death.
   The actual thing called death, as far as we know, does not cost a
   pang--it is the life that is in us that makes us suffer--death gives
   one kind pin's prick and it is all over. Moreover, if I pass through
   the swelling of Jordan, I may do so without suffering any pain. A dying
   bed is sometimes very painful with certain diseases, and especially
   with strong men it is often hard for the body and soul to part. But it
   has been my happy lot to see some deaths so extremely pleasing that I
   could not help remarking that it were worth while living only for the
   sake of dying as some have died!

   We have seen consumption for instance--how gently it takes down the
   frame very often. How quietly the soul departs. And in old age and
   debility how easily the spirit seems to get away from the cage that was
   broken, which only needed one blow and the imprisoned bird flies
   straight away to its eternal resting place! Well, then, as I cannot
   tell in what physical state I may be when I come to die, I just tried
   to think again, how shall I do in the swelling of Jordan? I hope I
   shall do as others have done before me who have built on the same Rock
   and had the same promises to be their succor.

   They cried, "Victory!" So shall I, and after that die quietly and in
   peace. If the same transporting scene may not be mine, I will at least
   lay my head upon my Savior's bosom and breathe my life out gently
   there. You have a right, Christian, to expect that as other Christians
   die, so shall you. How will you die? Why, you will die as your sainted
   mother did! You will die as your father did. When the time came for the
   "silver cord to be loosed and the golden bowl to be broken, for the
   pitcher to be broken at the fountain and the wheel broken at the
   cistern," the pitcher was broken and the cord loosed and their spirits
   went to God who gave them. How will you die?

   Why, as I mused on this I took down my little book of "Promises," for I
   thought I shall certainly do as God says I shall. Well, how is that?
   "When you pass through the rivers I will be with you." And again,
   "Though I pass through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear
   no evil." And again, "He shall swallow up death in victory." And again,
   "He shall make all your bed in your sickness." And yet again, "Fear
   not, I am with you. Be not dismayed, I am your God. I will never leave
   you nor forsake you." You know what a many dying pillows God has made
   for His dear people in the hour of their departure! "How shall I do in
   the swelling of Jordan?" Why, manfully, patiently, if God shall keep
   His promise as we know He will!

   Now let me speak to you all again--I mean you that are in Christ. "How
   will you do in the swelling of Jordan?" Why, you will do as a man does
   who has had a long day's walk and he can see his home. You will clap
   your hands. You will sit down upon the next milestone with tears in
   your eyes and wipe the sweat from your face and say, "It is well, it is
   over. Oh how happy it is to see my own roof-tree and the place where my
   best friends, my kindred, dwell. I shall soon be at Home--at Home
   forever with the Lord."

   How will we do? Why we will do as a soldier does when the battle is
   fought! He takes off his armor, stretches himself out at length to
   rest. The battle is all over. He forgets his wounds and reckons up the
   glory of the victory and the reward which follows. So will we! We will
   begin to forget the wounds and the garments rolled in blood and we will
   think of the "crown of life that fades not away." How will we do in the
   swelling of Jordan? We will do as men do when they launch for a foreign
   country. They look back upon those they leave behind and wave their
   handkerchiefs as long as they can see them--but they are soon gone.

   And we will bid adieu to dear ones. They shall have the tears, but we
   shall have the joy--for we go to the islands of the blest, the land of
   the hereafter, the home of the sanctified--to dwell with God forever!
   Who will weep when he starts on such a voyage and launches on such a
   blessed sea? What will we do when we come into the swelling of Jordan?
   Why I think, dear Friends, we shall then begin to see through the veil
   and to enjoy the Paradise of the blessed which is ours forever! We will
   make that dying bed a throne and we will sit and reign there with
   Christ Jesus! We will think of that river Jordan as being one tributary
   of the river of Life which flows at the foot of the jasper Throne of
   the Most High!

   We will live in the land of Beulah on the edge of Jordan with our feet
   in the cold stream, singing of the better land. We will hear the songs
   of angels as celestial breezes bring them across the narrow stream. And
   sometimes we will have in our bosom some of the spices from the
   Mountains of Myrrh which Christ shall give us across the river. And
   when we come to die, what will we do in the swelling of Jordan? Why we
   will try and bear our dying testimony--

   "My joyful soul on Jordan's shore, Shall raise one Ebenezer more."

   Oh, that was a grand thing when Joshua said to the twelve men, "Take up
   twelve stones and set them down in the midst of Jordan where the
   priests' feet stood still. And take up twelve other stones and set them
   up on the other side of Jordan, where the children of Israel first trod
   the promised shore." You and I will do this--we will leave twelve
   stones in the midst of Jordan. They shall tell our friends and kindred
   here of the good words we said, the adieu we gave them and the joyful
   hopes which cheered us--the song we sang when death began to stay our
   throat. And then we will raise another Ebenezer in Heaven!

   There shall be twelve stones there that will tell the angels and the
   principalities of the love which cleft the Jordan and brought us
   through it as on dry land. This is how we will do in the swelling of
   Jordan! We are not looking forward to death with any fear, with any
   dread. When we get home tonight we shall begin to take off our garments
   one by one. We shall not shed a tear. Nor shall we when we come to
   die--

   "Since Jesus is mine, I will not fear undressing, But gladly put off
   these garments of clay. To die in the Lord is a comfort and blessing,

   Since Jesus to Glory through death led the way."

   This is how we shall do in the swelling of Jordan--take off our
   garments to put on the celestial robes. As the bridegroom longs for the
   marriage day, and as the bride waits until she is joined unto her
   husband in wedlock, even so our spirits wait for God. As the exile
   pants to be delivered and the galley slave to be separated from his
   oar, so we wait to be set free for Glory and immortality! As she that
   mourns her absent lord pines for his return. As the child longs to
   reach his father's house and to see his father's face, so do we!--

   "My heart is with Him on His Throne, And ill can brook delay, Each
   moment listening for His voice, 'Make haste and come away.'"

   I must finish, for time has gone. But I meant to have said a word or
   two by way of warning. I can only do so now briefly, abridging them and
   compressing the thoughts as tightly as I can. "How will you do in the
   swelling of Jordan?" may well be used by way of warning. I think, dear
   Friends, you ought to ask yourselves one question. Some of you never
   think of dying and yet you should. You say you may live long--you
   may--and you may not. If there were a great number of loaves upon this
   table and you were to eat one every day and if you were told that one
   of those loaves had poison in it, I think you would begin every one
   with great caution. And knowing that one of them would be your death,
   you would take each up with silent dread.

   Now you have so many days and in one of these days there is the poison
   of death. I do not know which one. It may be tomorrow. It may not be
   until many a day has gone. But I think you ought to handle all your
   days with holy jealousy. Is not that a fair parable? If it is, then let
   me ask you to think upon the question, "How will you do in the swelling
   of Jordan?" You grant that you will die and you may die soon. Is it not
   foolish to be living in this world without a thought of what you will
   do at last?

   A man goes into an inn and as soon as he sits down he begins to order
   his wine, his dinner, his bed. There is no delicacy in season which he
   forgets to request. There is no luxury which he denies himself. He
   stays at the inn for some time. By-and-by there comes the bill and he
   says, "Oh, I never thought of that--I never thought of that!" "Why,"
   says the landlord, "here is a man who is either a born fool or else a
   thief! What? Never thought of the reckoning--never thought of
   settling-day!" And yet this is how some of you live! You have this and
   that and the other thing in this world's inn, (for it is nothing but an
   inn), and you have soon to go your way and yet you have never thought
   of settling-day!

   "Well," says one, "I was casting up my accounts this morning." Yes, I
   remember a minister making this remark when he heard of one that cast
   up his accounts on Sunday. He said, "I hope that is not true, Sir."
   "Yes," he said, "I do cast up my accounts on Sunday." "Ah, well," he
   said, "the Day of Judgment will be spent in a similar manner--in
   casting up accounts and it will go ill with those people who found no
   other time in which to serve themselves except the time which was given
   them that they serve God."

   You have either been a dishonest man, or else you must be supremely
   foolish to be spending every day in this world's inn and yet to be
   ignoring the thought of the great day of account! But remember, though
   you forget it, God forgets not. Every day is adding to the score.
   Photographed in Heaven is every action that you perform. Your very
   thoughts are photographed upon the eternal mind. And in the day when
   the book shall be opened it will go ill with you. Perhaps you will say,
   as one did in the Book of Kings, "Well, I was busy here and there. I
   was looking after my family and my property. I was looking after
   politics. I was seeing after such-and-such an investment. And my soul
   is gone."

   Yes, but that would not bring it back again. And what shall it profit
   you, though you gain the whole world and lose your own soul? It is no
   business of mine what becomes of you, except this--I do desire to talk
   with you at all times, that if you perish it may not be laid at my
   door. What would you say to that soldier who should be told by his
   commanding officer to fight with the foe on the field of battle and the
   so-called soldier were to reply, "I don't know anything about battle or
   fighting. I never thought of the battlefield, I can do anything but
   fight"?

   The general would be sorely amazed. He would want to know what the
   soldier lived for, if it were not to fight and defend his country in
   the hour of his country's need. What do we live for if it is not to
   prepare for a hereafter life and for the day for which all days were
   made? What? Are we sent into this world and told that we are to
   "prepare to meet our God," and we do everything else but that one
   thing? This will not be wise. And when the Lord of the whole earth
   shall come out of His place to judge the sons of men, bitterly shall we
   rue our folly!

   Be wise now! Remember this and consider your latter end. What words
   shall I use to urge you to consider the subject and take my warning? Is
   Heaven a place you would like to enter? Is Hell a place you would like
   to avoid, or will you make your bed in it forever? Are you in love with
   eternal misery that you run to it so madly? Oh, stop! Turn! Turn! Why
   will you die? I do pray you stop and consider. Consideration does no
   man harm. Second thoughts here are for the best. Think and think and
   think again and oh, may God lead you, through thinking, to feel your
   danger and may you then accept that gracious remedy which is in Christ
   Jesus!

   For whoever believes in Him is not condemned! Whoever trusts in Christ
   is saved! Sin is forgiven, the soul is accepted, the spirit is blessed
   the moment it trusts the Savior. Before I close the subject I must
   guide your thoughts to what is the true preparation for death. Three
   things present themselves to my mind as being our duty in connection
   with the dying hour. First seek to be washed in the Red Sea of the dear
   Redeemer's blood. Come in contact with the death of Christ and by faith
   in it you will be prepared to meet your own. Without giving an opinion
   upon the merit of that system of medicine which professes to cure
   diseases by producing an effect upon the system akin to the original
   malady, or as they put it, "like curing like," we recommend it in
   spiritual things.

   Come into union with Christ's death and that will take away the evil
   and sting of your own. Be buried with Him in Baptism unto death and
   have part with Him in the reality symbolized in that blest ordinance
   and you will not dread Jordan's swellings if the full tide of the
   Redeemer's blood has rolled over you so that you are washed and clean.
   If guilt is on your conscience, it will be as a millstone round your
   neck and you will sink to endless woe! But if the love of Jesus is in
   your heart, it will buoy up your head and keep you safe so that
   although heart and flesh fail you, you will have God to be the strength
   of your heart and your portion forever!

   Again, learn of the Apostle Paul to "die daily." Practice the duty of
   self-denial and mortifying of the flesh till it shall become a habit
   with you and when you have to lay down the flesh and part with
   everything, you will be only continuing the course of life you have
   pursued all along. No wonder if dying should prove hard work if you are
   completely unused to it in thought and expectation! If Death comes to
   me as a stranger, I may be startled--but if I have prepared myself to
   receive him, he may come and knock at my door and I shall say, "I am
   ready to go with you, for I have been expecting you all my life."

   How beautiful this expression of the Apostle, "I am ready to be offered
   up and the time of my departure is at hand." He was waiting for death
   as for a friend, and when it came I am sure he was well pleased to go.
   He tells us he had "a desire to depart and to be with Christ which is
   far better." Even so may we learn to look at the time when we shall
   hear the summons, "Come up higher," as to a time to be longed for
   rather than dreaded. Learn to submit your will to God's will daily.
   Learn to endure hardness as a good soldier of the Cross so that when
   the last conflict comes it may find you able, by the Grace of God, to
   bear the brunt of the final contest with unflinching courage.

   And as the last preparation for the end of life, I should advise a
   continual course of active service and obedience to the commands of
   God. I have frequently thought that no happier place to die in could be
   found than one's post of duty. If I were a soldier I think I should
   like to die as Wolfe died--with victory shouting in my ear! Or as
   Nelson died in the midst of his greatest success. Preparation for death
   does not mean going alone into the chamber and retiring from the world,
   but active service--"doing the duty of the day in the day."

   The best preparation for sleep, the healthiest soporific, is hard work
   and one of the best things to prepare us for sleeping in Jesus is to
   live in Him an active life of going about doing good. The attitude in
   which I wish Death to find me is with light trimmed and loins
   girt--waiting and watching--at work, doing my allotted task and
   multiplying my talent for the Master's Glory. Idlers may not anticipate
   rest, but workers will not be unwilling to welcome the hour which shall
   hear the words, "It is finished."

   Keep your eye upon the recompense of the reward. Lay up treasures in
   Heaven and thus you will be ready to cross the stream and enter the
   beloved land where heart and treasure have gone beforehand to prepare
   the way. Washed in the blood of Christ! Accustomed to submit to
   whatever God wills and to find our pleasure in doing His will on earth
   as we hope to do it in Heaven! Joined to a life of holy service I am
   persuaded that we shall be prepared with one of old to say, "I have
   fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith."
   And with him, calmly and joyfully, to anticipate the crown which fades
   not away. God bring you to this point, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

   TO MY READERS--DEAR FRIENDS, Refreshed in body and mind I am on my way
   homeward to my pulpit and my work. I trust that my absence from labor,
   so profitable to my own health, may prove to be no loss to you from the
   stores which I have gathered in my traveling. It is no small strain
   upon a man's mental powers to preach to the same people and to publish
   the sermons for eleven years consecutively. In time the mind which
   continually labors ceases to be fresh and vigorous and craves for rest.
   The soil without fallow grows poor. Rest is true medicine.

   That rest, I bless God, I have been enabled to enjoy in the most
   agreeable and instructive manner and trust that it will enable me, by
   Divine assistance, to avoid the sameness and repetition which are sure
   signs of exhaustion of mind and poverty of thought. To be in the very
   best condition to be used of God is my heart's desire. I would be a bow
   well-strung. An arrow sharpened by the King. He who works for God
   should seek to do his work well and should strive to be fit for labor.
   To feed the saints and gather in Christ's blood-bought wanderers is my
   highest ambition resting or working--my eye is on this.

   The most indefatigable must sometimes submit to rest in order to avoid
   being laid aside altogether. But work is the happiest and best state
   for Believers. And I feel that it is so. Oh that we, like the spirits
   before the Throne, could serve God day and night without sin or
   ceasing! May I beg a continued interest in my readers' earnest prayers.
   And may I hope that if ever they receive a blessing in reading my
   discourses they will kindly introduce them to their friends and
   neighbors. Yours to serve in the Gospel, Bell Alp, Switzerland, June
   16th, 1865 C. H. SPURGEON.

                      The Church'S Love To Her Loving Lord

   A SERMON PREACHED BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE,
   NEWINGTON.

   "Tell me, O You whom my soul loves, where You feed, where You make Your
   flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turns aside by
   the flocks of Your companions?'

   Song of Solomon 1:7.

   We shall need to lift up our hearts to God and ask to be quickened in
   Divine Grace or the precious truths in our text will not prove to us
   "as honey out of the rock," nor the "least of fat things, of wine and
   marrow, of wine on the lees well refined." We cannot appreciate the
   spirituality of this book unless God's Spirit shall help us. Many read
   these words and only see a proof of the imaginative power of an eastern
   mind. Some read to scoff and blaspheme and others, even good people,
   neglect to read this book altogether, being unable to drink in its
   spirit because of their need of that higher life of communion with the
   Beloved which is here so beautifully laid open to our view.

   Now I am persuaded of better things of you, Beloved. I am sure that you
   believe that every Word of God is precious and most certainly we say of
   this Book, "it is more to be desired than gold, yes, than much fine
   gold, sweeter also than honey, or the droppings of the honeycomb." This
   book of the Canticles is most precious to us. It is the inner court of
   the temple of Truth. It seems to us to belong to the secret place of
   the tabernacle of the Most High. We see our Savior's face in almost
   every page of the Bible, but here we see His heart and feel His love to
   us. We shall hope this morning to speak of our own experience, as well
   as of the Church who is here speaking.

   You will perceive that she begins with a title, she expresses a desire,
   she enforces it with an argument--"Tell me, O You whom my soul loves,
   where You feed, where You make Your flock to rest at noon: for why
   should I be as one that turns aside by the flocks of Your companions?"

   I. We commence with the title--"O You whom my soul loves." It is well
   to be able to call the Lord Jesus Christ by this name without an "if,"
   or a "but." A very large proportion of Christian people can only say of
   Christ that they hope they love Him. They trust they love Him--but this
   is a very poor and shallow experience--to be content to stay here. It
   seems to me that no one ought to give any rest to his spirit till he
   feels quite sure about a matter of such vital importance. We are not
   content to have a hopeof the love of our parents, or of our spouse, or
   of our children! We feel we must be certain there.

   And we ought not to be satisfied with a hope that Christ loves us and
   with a bare trust that we love Him. The old saints did not generally
   speak with buts and ifs and hopes and trusts--they spoke positively and
   plainly. "I know whom I have believed," says Paul. "I know that my
   Redeemer lives," says Job. "He whom my soul loves," says Solomon, in
   the song as we have it here. Learn, dear Friends, to get that positive
   knowledge of your love to Jesus and be not satisfied till you can talk
   about your interest in Him as a reality which you have made infallibly
   sure by having received the witness of the Holy Spirit and His seal
   upon your soul by faith that you are born of God and belong to Christ.

   Speaking, then, of this title which rings the great bell of love to
   Jesus, let us notice first the cause and secondly the effect of that
   love. If we can look into the face of Him who once sweat great drops of
   blood and call Him, "O You whom my soul loves," it is interesting to
   consider what is the cause of our love. And here our reply is very
   quick. The efficient cause of our love is the Holy Spirit of God. We
   should never have had a spark of love to Jesus if it had not been
   bestowed upon us by the Divine Worker.

   Well said John, "Love is of God." Certainly it is so. Our love to
   Christ is one beam from Himself, the Sun. Certainly a man can no more
   naturally love Christ than a horse can fly. I grant you there is no
   physical disability, but there is a moral and spiritual disability
   which effectually disqualifies him from the high and lofty emotion of
   love to Jesus. Into that dead corpse the living spirit must be
   breathed--those who are dead in trespasses and sins cannot love Christ.
   That heart of stone must be transformed into a heart of flesh, for
   stones may be hurled at the Savior but they can never love Him.

   That lion must become a lamb, or it can never claim Christ as its
   Shepherd. That raven must be turned into a dove, or it will never fly
   to Christ as its ark. "Except a man is born again," we may say, he
   cannot see this precious sparkling jewel of the kingdom of God--love to
   Christ. Search yourselves then, Brethren--do you love Him or not? If
   you love Him, you have been born again! And if you do not love Him,
   then you are still in darkness and are not His--

   "Can you pronounce His charming name,
   His acts of kindness tell?
   And while you dwell upon the theme,
   No sweet emotion feel?'

   I think some of us would have to answer--

   "A very wretch, Lord, I should prove,
   Had I no love to You.
   Sooner than not my Savior love,
   Oh, may I cease to be!'

   This, then, is the efficient cause--the Holy Spirit. The
   rational'cause, the logical reason why we love Jesus lies in
   Himself--in His looks, in His present working and in His
   Person--besides many other little fountains, which all tend to swell
   the river--the growing, deepening river of our love to Him. Why do we
   love Jesus? We have the best of answers-- because He first loved us!
   Hearken you strangers who inquire why we should love the Savior so. We
   will give you such reasons that we will satisfy you and set your mouths
   watering to be partakers of the same reasons, that you may come to love
   Him, too!

   Why do we love Him? Because before this round earth was fashioned
   between the palms of the great Creator-- before He had painted the
   rainbow, or hung out the lights of the sun and moon--Christ's delights
   were with us. He foresaw us through the glass of His prescience. He
   knew what we should be--looked into the book in which all His "members
   were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there
   were none of them." And as He looked upon us, the glance was love. He
   delighted to sit upon the Throne of Glory and to remember His dear ones
   who were yet to be born! It was the great prospect which His mighty and
   infinite Spirit had--a joy that was set before Him--that He should see
   a multitude that no man could number who should be His beloved
   forever--

   "Loved of my Christ, for Him again,
   With love intense Ill burn.
   Chosen of You before time began,
   I choose You in return."

   Oh, could you know that Jesus had loved you from before all worlds, you
   must love Him! At least you will grant there cannot be a better reason
   for love than love. Love demands--no, it does not demand--it takes by
   almighty force, by irresistible energy that heart captive upon whom it
   thus sets itself! This Jesus loved us for no reason whatever in
   ourselves. We were black as the tents of Kedar. We had much deformity
   but no beauty and yet He loved us! And our deformity was of such a kind
   that it might meritoriously have made Him hate us. We kicked against
   Him and despised Him! Our language naturally was, "We will not have
   this Man to reign over us," and when we heard of His loving us, we
   sneered at it.

   He was despised and rejected of men. We hid, as it were, our faces from
   Him. He was despised and we esteemed Him not. We thought His love an
   empty tale, a paltry trifle and yet He loved us. No, we were His
   enemies! We slew Him! We confess with sorrow that we were the murderers
   of the Prince of Life and Glory. Our hands were stained with His gore
   and our garments dyed with His blood--and yet He saw all this and still
   loved us! Shall we not love Him? Surely our heart is harder than
   adamant because we do not love Him more! But it were Hell-hardened
   steel if it did not love at all.

   Our Savior so loved us that He stripped Himself of His robes of
   radiance. Listen, you children of God, it is the old story over again,
   but it is always new to you. He stripped Himself of His bright array.
   He laid aside His scepter and His crown and became an infant in
   Bethlehem's manger among the horned oxen. Thirty years of poverty and
   shame the King of Heaven spent among the sons of men and all out of
   love to us! Jesus the heavenly lover, panting to redeem His people, was
   content to abide here without a place to rest His head that He might
   rescue us!

   Do you see Him yonder in the garden in His agony? His soul is
   exceedingly sorrowful even unto death! His forehead, no, His head, His
   hair, His garments red with bloody sweat. Do you see Him giving His
   back to the smiters and His cheeks to them that pluck off His hair? See
   Him as He hides not His face from shame and spitting--dumb like a sheep
   before her shearers and like a lamb that is brought to the slaughter!
   He opened not His mouth but patiently bore it all on our behalf. See
   Him with the Cross upon His mangled shoulders, staggering through
   Jerusalem's streets, unwept, unpi-tied, except by poor feeble women!

   See Him, you that love Him, and love Him more as He stretches out His
   hands to the nails and gives His feet to the iron. See Him, as with
   power to deliver Himself He is made captive. Behold Him as they lift up
   the Cross with Him upon it and dash it down into its place and
   dislocate His bones. Hear that cry, "I am poured out like water: all My
   bones are out ofjoint. You have brought Me into the dust of death."
   Stand, if you can, and view that face so full of grief. Look till a
   sword shall go through your own heart as it went through His virgin
   mother's very soul. Oh, see Him as He thirsts and has that thirst
   mocked with vinegar!

   Hear Him as He prays and has that prayer parodied, "He cries for Elias,
   let Elias come and take Him down." See Him, as they who love Him come
   and kiss His feet and bathe them with their tears. Will you not love
   Him who did all that friend could do for friend? He who gave His life
   for us? Beloved, here are a thousand crimson cords that tie us to the
   Savior and I hope we feel their constraining power. It is His vast
   love, the old eternal bond, the love which redeemed, which suffered in
   our place, the love which pleaded our cause before the eternal
   Throne--it is this which we give as a sufficient reason why we should
   love the Savior, if necessary, even unto death!

   Moreover, we have another reason. I trust many here can say that they
   love the Savior because of His present dealings towards them. What has
   He not done for us this very day? Some of you came here this morning
   heavy and you went away rejoicing! Perhaps you have had answers to
   prayer this very week. You have passed through the furnace and not a
   smell of fire has passed upon you. You have had many sins this week,
   but you have felt the efficacy of His blood again and again. Some of us
   have known what it is during the past six days to have the ravishing
   delights of private communion with Him. He has made us glad! Our
   spirits have leaped for very joy, for He has turned again the captivity
   of our soul.

   You have drunk of Him as of "the brook by the way," and you have
   therefore lifted up your head. Beloved, if there were nothing else
   which Christ had done for my soul--that which I have tasted and handled
   of Him within the last few months would make me love Him forever--and I
   know that you can say the same! Nor is this all. We love the Savior
   because of the excellency of His Person. We are not blind to excellence
   anywhere, but still we can see no excellence like His--

   "Jesus You fairest, dearest one, What beauties You adorn
   Far brighter than the noonday sun, Or star that gilds the morn. Here
   let me fix my wandering eyes, And all Your glories trace;
   Till, in the world of endless joys, I rise to Your embrace.'

   When Tigranes and his wife were both taken prisoners by Cyrus, Cyrus
   turning to Tigranes said, "What will you give for the liberation of
   your wife?" And the King answered, "I love my wife so that I would
   cheerfully give up my life if she might be delivered from servitude."
   Whereupon Cyrus said that if there was such love as that between them
   they might both go free. So when they were away and many were talking
   about the beauty and generosity of Cyrus and especially about the
   beauty of his person, Tigranes, turning to his wife, asked her what she
   thought of Cyrus and she answered that she saw nothing anywhere but in
   the face of the man who had said that he would die if she might only be
   released from servitude.

   "The beauty of that man," she said, "makes me forget all others." And
   verily we would say the same of Jesus! We would not decry the angels,
   nor think ill of the saints--but the beauties of that Man who gave His
   life for us are so great that they have eclipsed all others--and our
   soul only wishes to see Him, and none other! As the stars hide their
   heads in the presence of the sun, so may your all be gone--your
   delights, your excellencies--when Christ Jesus, the chief Delight, the
   chief Excellency, makes His appearance. Dr. Watts says--

   "His worth, if all the nations knew, Surely the whole earth would love
   Him, too.'

   And so it seems to us. Could you see Him, you must love Him. It was
   said of Henry VIII that if all the portraits of tyrants and murderers
   and thieves were out of existence, they might all be painted from the
   one face of Henry VII. And turning that round another way, we will say
   that if all the excellencies, beauties and perfections of the human
   race were blotted out, they might all be painted again from the face of
   the Lord Jesus--

   "All over glorious is my Lord. He must be beloved and yet adored.'

   These are some of the reasons why our heart loves Jesus. Before I leave
   those reasons, I should like to put a few questions round among this
   great crowd. O Friends, would you not love Jesus if you knew something
   of this love as shed abroad in your hearts--something of this love as
   being yours Now, remember, there is a very great promise that Christ
   has made, and it is this--"He that comes to Me I will in no wise cast
   out." Now what does that refer to? Why to any "he" in all the world
   that comes to Christ! Whoever you may be, if you come to Jesus--and you
   know that means just trusting Him, leaning upon Him--if you come to
   Him, He will not cast you out. And when He has received you to His
   bosom, you will then know, (but you cannot know till then), how much He
   loves you! And then I think you will say with us, "Yes, His name is,
   'You whom my soul loves.' "

   I shall now for a short time speak on the effects of this love, as we
   have dwelt on the cause of it. When a man has true love to Christ, it
   is sure to lead him to dedication. There is a natural desire to give
   something to the person whom we love and true love to Jesus compels us
   to give ourselves to Him. One of the earliest acts of the Christian's
   life is to take ourselves and lay body, soul, and spirit upon the altar
   of consecration, saying, "Here I am. I give myself to You." When the
   pupils of Socrates had nearly all of them given him a present, there
   was one of the best scholars who was extremely poor and he said to
   Socrates, "I have none of these things which the others have presented
   to you. But, O Socrates, I give you myself." Whereupon Socrates said it
   was the best present he had had that day. "My Son, give me your
   heart"--this is what Jesus asks. If you love Him, you must give Him
   this.

   True love next shows itself in obedience. If I love Jesus, I shall do
   as He bids me. He is my Husband, my Lord--I call Him, "Master." "If you
   love Me," He says, "keep My commandments." This is His chosen proof of
   my love, and I am sure, if I love Him, I shall keep His commandments.
   And yet there are some who profess to love Christ who very seldom think
   of keeping any of His commandments. "This do in remembrance of Me," He
   says, and yet some of you never come to His Table. May I gently ask you
   how you make this disobedience consort with genuine affection for Him?
   "If you love Me, keep My commandments."--

   " Tis love that makes our willing feet In swift obedience move.'

   We can do anything for those we love and, if we love Jesus, no burden
   will be heavy, no difficulty will be great--we should rather wish to do
   more than He asks of us and only desire that He were a little more
   exacting that we might have a better opportunity of showing forth our
   affection.

   True love, again, is always considerate and afraid lest it should give
   offense. It walks very daintily. If I love Jesus, I shall watch my
   eyes, my heart, my tongue, my hands--being so fearful lest I should
   wake my Beloved--or make Him stir until He please. And I shall be sure
   not to take in those bad guests, those ill-favored guests of pride and
   sloth and love of the world. I shall tell them to be packing, for I
   have a dear One within who will not tarry long if He sees me giving
   glances to these wicked ones. My heart shall be wholly His. He shall
   sit at the head of the table. He shall have the best dishes there--no,
   I will send all others away that I may have Him all to myself and that
   He may have my whole heart-- all that I am and all that I have.

   Again, true love to Christ will make us very jealous of His honor. As
   Queen Eleanor went down upon her knees to suck the poison from her
   husband's wound, so we shall put our lips to the wound of Christ when
   He has been stabbed with the dagger of calumny, or inconsistency. We
   shall be willing sooner to take the poison ourselves and to be
   ourselves diseased and despised than that His name, His Cross should
   suffer ill! Oh, what matters it what becomes of us if the King reigns?
   I will go home to my bed and die in peace if the King sits on the
   Throne. Let me see King David once again in- stalled in Zion's sacred
   halls and my soul, in poverty and shame, shall still rejoice if the
   banished King Jesus shall once again come back and have His own and
   take His scepter, and wear His crown!

   Beloved, I trust we can say we would not mind if Christ would make a
   door mat of us, if He would wipe His Church's filthy sandals on us if
   we might but help to make her pure! We would hold the stirrup for Him
   to mount any day--yes-- and be His horsing-block that He might mount
   His glorious charger and ride forth conquering and to conquer. Say,
   what matters it what we are, or where we are, if the King has His own?
   If we love Christ, again, we shall be desiring to promote His cause and
   we shall be desiring to promote it ourselves. We shall wish to see the
   strength of the mighty turned at the gate that King Jesus may return
   triumphant!

   We shall not wish to sit still while our brethren go to war, but we
   shall want to take our portion in the fray that like soldiers that love
   their monarch, we may prove by our wounds and by our sufferings that
   our love is real. The Apostle says, "Let us not love in word only but
   in deed and in truth." Actions speak louder than words and we shall
   always be anxious to tell our love in deeds as well as by our lips. The
   true disciple asks continually, "Lord what will You have me to do?" He
   esteems it his highest honor to serve the Lord. "I would rather be a
   doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of
   wickedness."--

   "Theres not a lamb in all the flock, I would disdain to feed. Theres
   not a foe before whose face I fear Your cause to plead. Would not my
   ardent spirit vie With angels round Your Throne, To execute Your sacred
   will And make Your glory known?'

   Yes, indeed, we thus can sing and mean, I trust, every word! Yes, we
   will go forth into the whole world and preach the Gospel to every
   creature. We will tell of this love to all and labor to win for the
   Master's honor a multitude which no man can number out of every nation
   and kindred and tribe and tongue and people! I believe in an active
   love--a love which has hands to labor and feet to run--as well as a
   heart to feel, eyes to glance and ears to listen. A mother's love is of
   the purest and most intense sort in the world, and it is the most
   practical. It shows itself in deeds of untiring devotion both night and
   day. So also should it be with us--we should let our affections prompt
   us to life-long labor.

   The love of Christ should constrain us to live, and if necessary, die
   to serve Him. Heaven is the place of purest, holiest attachment to
   Christ. Then we shall understand most about His love to us and of all
   He has done to prove it and the consequence will be that His servants
   shall serve Him day and night in His holy temple. We are expecting a
   home in Glory not of idleness, but of continual activity. It is
   written, "His servants shall serve Him," and we are taught to pray now
   that we may do His will on earth as it is done in Heaven.

   Let us, therefore, each one, be busily engaged in the great harvest.
   The harvest is great and the laborers are few. There is room for all
   and each man's place is waiting to receive him. If we truly love our
   Lord we shall at once press to the front and begin the "work of faith
   and labor of love." Has not the Master been known to show His love to
   us in deeds? Look to Bethlehem, to Gabbatha, to Gethsemane, to
   Golgotha--yes, look to His whole life as He "went about doing
   good"--and see if all this will not stir you up to service! Listen to
   the life story of the Lord and you will hear a voice from each one of
   His deeds of love saying to you, "Go and do likewise."

   And, once again, if we love Jesus we shall be willing to suffer for
   Him. Pain will become light. We shall sing with Madame Guyon--

   "To me tis equal whether love ordain my life or death, Appoint me ease,
   or pain.'

   It is a high attainment to come to, but love can make us think
   ourselves of so small import that if Christ can serve Himself of us, we
   shall make no choice as to what, or where we may be. We can sing once
   more--

   "Would not my heart pour forth its blood In honor of Your name,
   And challenge the cold hand of death To dampen this immortal flame?'

   Our hearts are, I trust, so full of real devotion to Christ that we can
   give Him everything and endure all things for His sake. Cannot we say--

   "For Him I count as gain each loss, Disgrace for Him renown, Well may I
   glory in His Cross, While He prepares my crown' ? Darkness is light
   about us if we can serve Him there. The bitter is sweet if the cup is
   put to our lips in order that we may share in His sufferings and prove
   ourselves to be His followers. When Ignatius was led to his martyrdom,
   as he contemplated the nearness of his death and suffering, he said,
   "Now I begin to be a Christian." He felt that all that he had done and
   suffered before was not enough to entitle him to be called a follower
   of Christ--but now as the Master's bloody Baptism was before him, he
   realized the truth so dear to every right-minded Christian--that he was
   to be "like unto his Lord." Here we can all prove our love! We can
   suffer His will calmly if we are not able to do it publicly--

   "Weak as I am, yet through Your love, I all things can perform. And,
   smiling, triumph in Your name Amid the raging storm.'

   I pray God we may have such a love that thirsts after Jesus and cannot
   be satisfied without present communion with Him.

   II. This brings me to the thought which I shall only touch upon as the
   swallow skims the brook with his wings and then up and away, lest I
   weary you. The second point of consideration is the DESIRE OF THE
   CHURCH AFTER CHRIST JESUS OUR LORD--having called Him by His title, she
   now expresses her longing to be with Him. "Tell me, O You whom my soul
   loves, where You feed, where you make Your flock to rest at noon." The
   desire of a renewed soul is to find Christ and to be with Him.

   Stale meats left over from yesterday are very well when there is
   nothing else, but who does not like hot food fresh from the fire? And
   past communion with Christ is very well. "I remember You from the land
   of the Hermonites and the hill Mizar." But these are only stale meats
   and a loving soul wants fresh food every day from the table of Christ.
   And you that have once had the kisses of His mouth, though you remember
   the past kisses with delight, yet want daily fresh tokens of His love.
   He that drinks of this water will never thirst again, it is true,
   except for this water! And then he will so thirst for it that he will
   be like Samuel Rutherford who began to be out of heart with the
   buckets--he wanted to get right to the wellhead that he might lie down
   and drink--and then, if he could have his fill, he would drink the well
   quite dry.

   But there is no hope of that, or rather no fear of it--the well can
   never be empty, for it rises as we drink! A true loving soul, then,
   wants present communion with Christ. So the question is, "Tell me where
   You feed? Where do You get Your comfort from, O Jesus? I will go there.
   Where do Your thoughts go? To Your Cross? Do You look back to that?
   Then I will go there. Where You feed, there will I feed."

   Or does this mean actively, instead of being in the passive or the
   neuter? Where do You feed Your flock? In Your House? I will go there,
   if I may find You there. In private prayer? Then I will not be slack in
   that. In the Word? Then I will read it night and day. Tell me where You
   feed, for wherever You stand as the shepherd, there will I be, for I
   want You. I cannot be satisfied to be apart from You. My soul hungers
   and thirsts to be with You.

   She puts it again, "Where do You make Your flock to rest at noon," for
   there is only rest in one place--where You cause Your flock to rest at
   noon. That must be a God-given rest and only to be found in some one
   chosen place. Where is the shadow of that rock? It is very hot just now
   here in the middle of summer when the sun is pouring down his glorious
   rays like bright but sharp arrows upon us. And we that are condemned to
   live in this great wilderness of brown bricks and mortar often
   recollect those glades where the woods grow thick and where the waters
   leap from crag to crag down the hillside and where the birds are
   singing among the trees.

   We delight to think of those leafy bowers where the sun cannot dart his
   rays, where, on some mossy bank, we may stretch ourselves to rest or
   have our weary limbs in some limpid stream. And this is just what the
   spouse is after. She feels the heat of the world's sun and she longs to
   be away from its cares and troubles that have furrowed and made her
   face brown till she looked as if she had been a busy keeper of the
   vineyards. She wants to get away to hold quiet communion with her Lord,
   for He is the brook where the weary may lay their wearied limbs! He is
   that sheltered nook, that shadow of the great rock in the weary land
   where His people may lie down and be at peace--

   "Jesus, the very thought of You,
   With sweetness fills my breast.
   But sweeter far Your face to see
   And in Your Presence rest.
   For those who find You find a bliss,
   Nor tongue, nor pen can show
   The love of Jesus, what it is,
   None but His loved ones know.'

   Now do you not want this tonight? Does not your souls want Christ
   tonight? My Brothers, my Sisters, there is something wrong with us if
   we can do without Christ. If we love Him, we must want Him. Our hearts
   ever say--

   "Abide with me from morn till eve,
   For without You I cannot live!
   Abide with me when night is near,
   For without You I dare not die.'

   No, we cannot do without Christ. We must have Him. "Give me Christ, or
   else I die," is the cry of our souls. No wonder Mary Magdalene wept
   when she thought they had taken away her Lord and she knew not where
   they had laid Him! As the body suffers without food, so should we
   without Christ. As the fish perish out of water, so should we apart
   from Christ. I must quote another verse of a hymn, for really the sweet
   songsters of Israel have lavished all their best prose and very rightly
   so, to tell for us our love-tale concerning our Beloved. I am sure that
   our heart's inner voice can set to sweetest music the words--

   "Oh that I could forever sit
   With Mary at the Masters feet--
   Be this my happy choice
   My only care, delight and bliss,
   My joy, my Heaven on earth be this,
   To hear the Bridegrooms voice.'

   Yes! To be with Jesus is Heaven--anywhere on earth, or in the
   skies--all else is wilderness and desert. It is Paradise to be with
   Him. And Heaven without Christ would be no Heaven to me. My heart
   cannot rest away from Him. To have no Christ would be a punishment
   greater than I could bear! I should wander, like another Cain over the
   earth, a fugitive and a vagabond. Verily there would be no peace for my
   soul. I am sure that the true wife, if her husband is called to go upon
   a journey, longs ardently for his return. If he is gone to the wars,
   she dreads lest he should fall. How each letter comes perfumed to her
   when it tells of his love and constancy and how she watches for the day
   when she shall clasp him in her arms once more.

   Oh you know that when you were children, if you were sent to school,
   how you counted till the holidays came on. I had a little almanac and
   marked out every day the night before and so counted one day less till
   the time I should get home again and so may you--

   "May not a captive long his own dear land to see?
   May not the prisoner seek release from bondage to be free?' Of course
   he may and so may you, Beloved, pant and sigh as the hart pants for the
   water brooks--for the comfortable enjoyment of the Lord Jesus Christ's
   Presence.
   III. THE ARGUMENT USED BY THE CHURCH. Here is the desire. Now, to
   close, she backs that up with an argument. She says, "Why should I be
   as one that turns aside by the flocks of Your companions?" You have
   plenty of companions--why should I be turned aside? Why should I not be
   one? Let us talk it over. Why should I lose my Lord's Presence? But the
   devil tells me I am a great sinner. Ah, but it is all washed away and
   gone forever. That cannot separate me, for it does not exist. My sin is
   buried--
   "Plunged as in a shoreless sea--
   Lost as in immensity.'

   The devil tells me I am unworthy and that is a reason. But I was always
   unworthy and yet it was no reason why He should not love me at first,
   and therefore cannot be a reason why I should not have fellowship with
   Him now. Why should I be left out? Now I am going to speak for the
   poorest here--I do not know where he is. I want to speak for you that
   have got the least faith. You that think yourselves the smallest in all
   Israel. You are Mephibosheths that are lame in your feet and yet sit at
   the king's table. You are poor despised Mordecais that sit at the
   king's gate--yet cannot get inside the palace.

   I have this to say to you--Why should you be left there? Just try and
   reason. Why should I, Jesus, be left out in the cold, when the night
   comes on? No, there is a cot for the little one, as well as a bed for
   his bigger brother. Why should I be turned aside? I am equally bought
   with a price. I cost Him, in order to save me, as much as the noblest
   of the saints-- He bought them with blood--He could not buy me with
   less. I must have been loved as much, or else, seeing that I am of so
   little worth, I should not have been redeemed at all! If there is any
   difference, perhaps I am loved somewhat better! Is there not greater,
   better love shown in the choice of me than of some who are more worthy
   than I am?

   Why, then, should I be left out? 1 know if I have a child that is
   deformed, I love it all the more--it seems as if I had a more tender
   care for it. Then why should my heavenly Father be less kind to me than
   I should be to my offspring? Why should I be turned aside? He chose
   me--He cannot change His mind! Why, then, should He cast me off? He
   knew what I was when He chose me--He cannot, therefore, find out any
   fresh reason for turning me aside. He foresaw I should misbehave myself
   and yet He selected me. Well, then, there cannot be a reason why I
   should be left to fall away.

   Again, I ask, Why should I turn aside? I am a member of His body, of
   His flesh and of His bones--and though I am less than the least of all
   His saints, yet He has said, "I will never leave you nor forsake you."
   Why should I turn aside? I have a promise all to myself. Has He not
   said, "I will not quench the smoking flax, nor break the bruised reed"?
   Has He not said, "The Lord takes pleasure in them that fear Him, in
   them that hope in His mercy"? If I cannot do more, I can do that! I do
   hope in His mercy. Then why should I be turned aside? If any should
   think of doing so, it should not be I, for I want to be near Him! I am
   such a poor plant that I ought to be kept in the sun--I shall never do
   in the shade.

   My big brother, perhaps, may manage for a little time without comfort,
   but I cannot, for I am one of the Ready-to-Halts. I recollect how the
   shepherds of Mount Clear said, "Come in, Mr. Little-Faith! Come in, Mr.
   Feeble-Mind! Come in, Mr. Ready-to-Halt! Come in, Mary!" But they did
   not say, "Come in, Father Faithful. Come in, Matthew. Come in,
   Valiant-for-Truth." No, they said these might do as they liked. They
   were quite sure to take their own part--but they looked first to the
   most feeble! Then why should I be turned aside? I am the feeblest and
   want His Person most. I may use my very feebleness and proneness to
   fall as the reason why I should come to Him! Why should I be turned
   aside?

   I may fall into sin. My heart may grow cold without His glorious
   Presence--and then, what if I should perish! Why, here let me think. If
   I am the meanest lamb in His flock I cannot perish without doing the
   God of Heaven damage. Let me say it again with reverence. If I, the
   least of His children, perish, I shall do His Son dishonor, for what
   will the arch-fiend say? "Aha," says he, "You Surety of the Covenant,
   You could keep the strong, but You could not keep the weak--I have this
   lamb here in the pit whom You could not preserve! Here is one of Your
   crown jewels," he says, "and though he is none of the brightest, though
   he is not the most sparkling ruby in Your coronet, yet he is one of
   Your jewels and I have him here in Hell! You have no perfect regalia--I
   have a part of it here."

   Shall that ever be, after Christ has said, "They shall never perish,
   neither shall any pluck them out of My hand"? Shall this be, when the
   strong arm of God is engaged for my succor and He has said to me, "The
   Eternal God is your refuge. And underneath are the everlasting arms"?
   Jesus, turn me not aside, lest by my fall I grieve Your Spirit and lest
   by my fall I bring disgrace upon Your name!

   Why should I turn aside? There is no reason why I should. Come my Soul,
   there are a thousand reasons why you should not! Jesus beckons you to
   come. You wounded Saints, you that have slipped to your falling--you
   that are grieved, sorrowing and distressed--come to His Cross! Come to
   His Throne again! Backsliders, if you have been such, return! Return!
   Return! A husband's heart has no door to keep out his spouse and Jesus'
   heart has no power to keep out His people!

   Return! Return! There is no divorce sued out against you for the Lord,
   the God of Jacob says He hates putting away. Return! Return! Let us get
   to our chambers, let us seek renewed fellowship. And, oh, you that have
   never had it and have never seen Christ, may you thirst after Him
   tonight and if you do, remember the text I gave you, "Him that comes to
   Me I will in no wise cast out." Whoever you may be, if you will come to
   Jesus, He will not cast you out--

   "Come and welcome, Sinner, come."

   God bring you for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                          The Dove'S Return To The Ark

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JULY 2, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE
   METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But the dove found no rest for the soles of her feet and she returned
   unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole
   earth. Then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her in unto
   him into the ark." Genesis 8:9.

   THE sending forth of the raven and of the dove have furnished ready
   materials for numerous allegories with which Divines in different ages
   have sometimes edified and more frequently amused their hearers. We
   cannot afford time to mention many of them, but one of the host may
   serve as a specimen. Certain expositors have fancied that the mission
   of the raven prefigured the sending forth of the Law, which was black
   and terrible and which came not back to man bearing any token of
   comfort, or sign of hope. And that afterwards the Lord sent forth the
   Gospel, foreshadowed by the dove, which by-and-by came back to sinful
   man, bearing the olive branch of peace.

   Thus they illustrated the great Truth of God that there is no peace in
   the terms of the Law, for that raven can only croak hoarsely and
   fiercely. But there is peace in the ground of the Gospel, for the dove
   bears the olive branch in her mouth. Such far-fetched allegories as
   these, at the time when they were contrived and carried out, may have
   had their value and have been instructive to an undiscerning age. It is
   not, however, to be regretted that the Church of today has far less
   taste for such childish things.

   We are quite as willing as any men to see allegories where they are
   really clear, for we remember the words of Paul concerning Hagar and
   Sarah, "which things are an allegory," but we are not ready to follow
   the quaint and strange inventions of spiritualists whether ancient or
   modern. The clue must be evident or we had rather not enter the
   labyrinth. There is one adaptation of the incident before us which
   seems so naturally to suggest itself that I can not help using it this
   morning. The dove may well picture the Believer's soul. That soul
   sometimes flies abroad to and fro and takes a survey of all things--but
   it finds no rest for the soles of its feet anywhere except in Christ
   Jesus. And, therefore, however long in flight, it is sure, eventually,
   to return to its own proper resting place.

   The child of God can never be content out of his God--he who has once
   had Christ in him, the hope of Glory, can never be satisfied to rest or
   glory except in the Lord Jesus. Let us, this morning, carry out that
   one thought and look at it in the various lights which this picture of
   the dove may throw upon it.

   I. First, LET US LOOK AT THE DOVE SETTING OUT UPON HER VOYAGE OF
   DISCOVERY. She has been perfectly safe in the ark. Other fowls have
   perished--cattle and creeping things have all been destroyed by the
   flood-- but this dove, with other favored ones, has been happily
   secured. She has wanted for nothing--for the God who put her into the
   ark has taken care of her there and that righteous man who was made the
   means of her rescue has constantly provided her with her daily food.

   She has nestled in the ark and been happy and comfortable there and yet
   she is about to stretch her wings and fly away from the boat of safety.
   Why does she act thus? Well may we ask this question of ourselves--we
   have been saved in Christ Jesus, many of us--saved when the floods of
   sin covered the rest of our kinsfolk--saved when our doubts and fears
   threatened eternal ruin to us! We have been provided for in Christ
   Jesus and housed in His salvation. He has been no wilderness to us--we
   have found enduring rest and seasonable provision in Him. How is it,
   then, that we can stretch our wings to fly, or even open our eyes to
   look abroad?

   My Soul, is there not enough in Christ? Why will you seek elsewhere?
   Why leave the Fountain for the broken cisterns? Will a man leave the
   fertile fields for a barren rock, or forsake the running waters for
   pestilential pools? Remember the mischief that Dinah gained unto
   herself when she left her father's house to go to the tents of Shechem.
   Think how the prodigal fared when he left his father's house. Why do
   you not tarry at home with your Husband and liege Lord?

   Why do you go abroad where all is empty and void and waste? Yet we must
   all confess that these hearts of ours are apt to bear us away from
   Christ and these minds of ours are prone to forget Him and to look
   abroad after some other love.

   But why did the dove fly away? I answer first--a very simple answer to
   give, you will say--because she had wings. A creature with wings feels
   within itself a natural instinct to fly and, having been in the ark so
   long where she had little space for flight, I daresay her liberty at
   first was very sweet to her. What are these pinions for--why are they
   covered with silver and the feathers there with yellow gold, if I may
   not clip through yonder cloud and cleave these earth-mists and see what
   there is to be seen?

   And, therefore, because she has wings she flies. And so it is with us.
   Our soul has many thoughts and many powers which make the spirit
   restless. If we were without imagination we might be content with the
   few plain truths which we have so well known and proved. But having an
   imagination we are often dazzled by it and we want to know whether
   certain things which look like solid verities really are. If we had no
   reason, but could abide entirely in a state of pure and simple faith,
   we might not be exposed to much of the restlessness which now afflicts
   us.

   But reason will draw conclusions, ask questions, suggest problems,
   raise enquiries and vex us with difficulties. Therefore, because our
   souls are moved by so vast a variety of thoughts and possess so many
   powers which are all restless and active, it is readily to be
   understood that while we are here in our imperfect state our spirits
   should be tempted to excursions of research and voyages of discovery,
   as though we sought after some other object of love besides the One who
   still is dearer to us than all the world besides.

   Possibly there was another reason. This dove was once lodged in a
   dovecote. When children we saw men throwing up carrier pigeons into the
   air laden with missives and we foolishly wondered how the dove knew the
   way to go with the letter, dreaming as we did that it flew with it
   wherever the person chose to direct the envelope. We soon learned the
   secret. The dove bears the letter to her own dovecote--she will go
   nowhere else with it--and it is not in the wit of man to make the dove
   fly in any other direction than towards its own home. The dove is
   thrown up into the air. She mounts aloft, whirls round and round and
   round, looking with eager eyes. At last she sees the place where she
   has been known to rest and where her little ones have been reared and
   she darts straight to the spot.

   Before the ark was built, no doubt, this bird frequented much a chosen
   spot where it had built its nest and reared its young ones and its
   heart went towards it. Though it had been in the ark so long, it had
   not forgotten the past. And therefore no sooner has it liberty than it
   seeks to fly in the direction of its own dovecote, although that cote
   had been swept away forever.

   Ah, and you and I, before we knew the Savior, we had a rest. Before we
   had experienced the sweetness of His love we found joy in sin. We built
   our nest and we thought in our heart that we should never be moved. We
   were satisfied once, after a fashion, with the vanities of this present
   world. We had our loves, our joys, our pleasures, our delights. And
   that carnal old nature within us is not dead! When it gets its liberty
   it is sure to look out for its old haunts. Have you not, even when
   singing God's praise, remembered a snatch of an old, perhaps lascivious
   song? Have not you frequently, when in the service of God, had brought
   to your recollection a dark scene of sin in which you had a share? And
   though you have loathed it with the new nature, yet has not the old
   nature tended towards it?

   And has not that base heart within--which will not die until flesh
   becomes worms' meat--whispered to you to go back to the fleshpots of
   Egypt and once more to partake of the garlic and leeks and onions which
   were so sweet in the house of bondage? Yes, the dovecote still has its
   attraction. The best of men have still within them the seeds of those
   sins which make the worst of men so vile. The old serpent still creeps
   along the heart which has become a garden of the Lord. Our gold is
   mixed with dross. Our sky bears many a cloud and the clearest river of
   humanity still has mire at the bottom.

   I marvel not that the dove flew away from the ark when she remembered
   her dovecote. And I do not wonder that at seasons the old remembrances
   get the upper hand with our spirit and we forget the Lord we love and
   have a hankering after sin. Yet it would not be fair to forget that
   this dove was sent out by Noah--so that whatever may have been the
   particular motives which ruled the creature, there was a higher motive
   which ruled Noah who sent her out.

   Even so there are times when the Lord permits His people to endure
   temptation. What does this passage mean concerning the Savior--"After
   He was baptized, He was led of the Spirit into the wilderness to be
   tempted of the devil"? What? Led of the Spirit? Where will the Spirit
   lead Him? Will not the Spirit lead Him to His Father's temple that He
   may join in its hallowed exercises? Will He not lead Him to the
   mountain where He may proclaim glad tidings to the peo- ple? No. The
   Spirit led Him into the wilderness "to be tempted of the devil." We are
   taught to pray, "Lead us not into temptation." And very stupid people
   have tried to alter the petition into, "Leave us not in temptation."

   The Savior never said that. It would be a very proper prayer, but it is
   not what He said. His words are, "Lead us not into temptation." It
   appears, then, that sometimes God may allow His people to be led into
   temptation, or otherwise we need not say, "Lead us not into
   temptation." Such temptation produces excellent results in being
   overruled by Divine Grace for the lasting benefit of the Lord's people.
   The dove would love the ark far better than before, after taking its
   dreary flight above the watery waste. She would nestle more peacefully
   than ever in Noah's hands after having seen and known how impossible it
   was to find rest for the soles of her feet anywhere else!

   Thus the Lord permits His people to gad abroad in their thoughts and to
   go flying about in their minds that their after repose may be sweeter
   and more enduring. He takes away from them the light of His Countenance
   and familiar fellowship with Himself that the darkness may make them
   prize the sun. They fly from vanity to vanity learning the emptiness of
   all and then they cling to their own real bliss--their God and Father
   in Christ Jesus! And throughout life they have to bless God for that
   dark and bitter experience which yielded so good and comfortable a
   fruit that it compelled them to know that there was none upon earth for
   them but Christ and none even in Heaven to fill their souls but their
   Lord Jesus.

   So when I see the Christian taking wing in his thought away from the
   ark, I will be grieved to see him in the temptation, but I will pray
   the Lord to overrule it that he may come back again and say, "Return
   unto your rest, O my Soul, for the Lord has dealt bountifully with
   you." Beloved, it is a bitter but a precious lesson to learn, that all
   is nothing out of Christ and that Jesus alone can give us rest. May you
   all learn it thoroughly and learn it soon.

   II. Now MARK THE DOVE AS SHE FINDS NO REST. She has plumed her wings
   and she hurries in her search after a home. The mountain tops, I think,
   according to the preceding verses were just visible, but this was all.
   She flies over them and between them, as they rise like islands in the
   midst of that vast shoreless sea. At last she tires--even the dove
   cannot fly forever. She needs to rest. Where shall she end her flight?
   The raven yonder is comfortable enough gorging himself upon the carcass
   of a huge beast which was floating by. The dove, however, cannot rest
   there--her nature loathes putridity and she flies away from the reeking
   mass.

   Yonder is a tree--one of the mighty monarchs of the forest has been
   broken off in the great tempest which drowned the world and is now
   floating high with branches lifted up like the masts of a vessel. She
   tries to light upon it but it is covered with thick mire and filth. The
   wet and slime suit her not and she takes to her wings again. Further
   off another object attracts her and she speeds to it as well as her
   weary wings can carry her. But there is nothing there for her to rest
   upon.

   She turns east, north, south, but her wings grow weary for she can find
   no place where to rest the soles of her feet. As we observe her
   flapping her wings so languidly, I think we have a picture of a
   Christian in pursuit of an earthly object on which he would desire to
   set his heart. Forgetting that here we have no continuing city, the
   pilgrims of God at times wander in the wilderness hoping to find a
   settled habitation there. But their desolate hearts are soon faint
   within them, for there is no rest for their feet on earth. The Savior
   very beautifully said, "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy
   laden and I will give you rest."

   What kind of rest did the Savior mean to give? I take it that He meant
   rest to all the powers of manhood. The intellect seeks after rest and
   by nature seeks it apart from the Lord Jesus Christ. Men of fine
   education, men of great mental powers are apt, even when converted, to
   look upon the simplicities of the Cross of Christ--I may not say with
   dises-teem--but still with an eye too little reverent and loving. They
   are snared in the net in which the Grecians were taken-- they have a
   hankering to mix philosophy with Revelation. The temptation is with a
   man of refined thought and high education to go away from the simple
   Truth of Christ Crucified and to invent a more complicated, as the term
   is, a more intellectual doctrine.

   This it was which led the early Christian Church into Gnosticism and
   bewitched them with all sorts of heresies. This is the root of Neology
   and the other fine things which in days gone by were so fashionable in
   Germany and are now so ensnaring to certain classes of Divines.
   Brethren, I care not who you are nor what your education may be--if you
   are the Lord's people you will find no rest in the teachings of
   philosophy--or philosophizing divinity. You may receive this dogma of
   one great thinker, or that of another profound reasoner--but what the
   chaff is to the wheat--that will these be to the sure Word of God! All
   that reason, when best guided, can find out, is but the ABCs of the
   Truth of God and even that lacks sureness and certainty--while in
   Christ Jesus there is treasured up all the fullness of wisdom and
   knowledge!

   All attempts on the part of Christians to be content with systems such
   as Unitarian and Broad Church thinkers would approve of must fail! True
   heirs of Heaven must come back to the grandly simple reality which
   makes the plow-boy's eyes flash with joy and gladdens the pious man's
   heart--"Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am
   chief." Christ satisfies the most elevated intellect when He is
   believingly received. But apart from Him the mind of the regenerate
   discovers no rest.

   The heart, too, wants satisfying. Every one of us needs an object to
   love. I suppose there can hardly live on earth a man so monstrously
   selfish that he can be perfectly wrapped up in himself and care for no
   one. Some of the grossest villains who have ever defiled the name of
   manhood have had one point in which they could be touched. Their hearts
   have gone out after one dear object--it may be a little child, long
   dead--and yet the recollection of that little one sleeping beneath the
   turf has been a link to goodness.

   Many a hardened man has remembered his mother and her name has touched
   his heart. We must love something, or someone. Man was not made to live
   alone and therefore no man lives unto himself. Our heart must flow like
   a river, or it corrupts like a stagnant pool. Some have great hearts
   and they require a great object on which to spend their love. They love
   fondly and firmly--too fondly and too firmly for earthly love. These
   are they who suffer from broken hearts. They have so much love that
   when they set it upon an unworthy object they reap a proportionate
   degree of misery and disappointment.

   Now let me say solemnly that no heart of a child of God will ever be
   satisfied with any object or person short of the Lord Jesus Christ.
   There is room for wife and children, there is room for friend and
   acquaintance and all the more room in one's heart because Christ is
   there--but neither wife, nor children nor friends, nor kinsfolk can
   ever fill the Believer's heart. He must have Christ Jesus--there is no
   rest for him elsewhere. Do I address any Believer who has been making
   an idol? Have you set up any god in your heart? Have you loved any
   creature so as to forget your Savior? Be it child, or husband, or
   friend, take heed of the sin of idolatry!

   Ah, you cannot, you shall not find rest for the soles of your feet in
   the creature, however fair that creature may seem. God will break your
   idol before your eyes, or if He suffers that idol to stand, it shall
   remain to plague and curse you, for thus says the Lord, "Cursed is he
   that trusts in man and makes flesh his arm." "Cease you from man, whose
   breath is in his nostrils, for wherein is he to be accounted?" Give
   your hearts to the Lord Jesus and He will never disappoint you. Lean on
   Him with all your weight of affection, for He will never fail you. Come
   here, all you fond and doting, you lovers, and love with all the lavish
   wealth and fervent heat of your spirits! Kindle your hearts until, like
   Nebuchadnezzar's furnace, they glow seven times hotter--here is a fuel
   with which you can maintain the flame forever!

   You whose love is like the sea, too deep to fathom, come to the Savior
   and give Him all and He shall not waste a drop, for He deserves all you
   can give and He will give you back a love which, compared with yours,
   shall be as the ocean when compared with the dewdrop that twinkles on
   the bough. So there is rest for the heart in Christ Jesus, but nowhere
   else.

   Man has also judgment. And judgment, when exercised upon things right
   or wrong, is called conscience--and the conscience is a very difficult
   thing to quiet when once disturbed. Conscience is like a magnetic
   needle which if once turned aside from its pole will never cease
   trembling. You can never make it still until it is permitted to return
   to its proper place--

   "In vain the trembling conscience seeks,
   Some solid ground to rest upon.
   With strong desire the spirit faints,
   Till we apply to Christ alone."

   We shall never be able to find lasting peace for conscience till we
   cast ourselves upon Christ Jesus!

   The child of God may sometimes so forget himself as to endeavor to base
   his hopes upon his experiences, his feelings, his joys, or his
   repentances. He may try to assure himself that all is well between God
   and his own soul because of his graces or his good works. Now,
   Christian, you know, or you ought to know by past experience, that you
   will never enjoy lasting peace here. You must come to Christ as you did
   at first with nothing of your own and take Him to be your All in All.
   And if you do not do this your feet shall know no rest, for you shall
   fly wearily on till you shall drop with despair.

   Christ Jesus in the preciousness of His besprinkled blood! Christ Jesus
   in the glory of His snow-white righteousness! Christ Jesus in the
   prevalence of His intercession! Christ Jesus in the power of His arm
   and the love of His heart must be the sole and solitary dependence of
   every heir of Heaven! And if you try to mix anything else with Christ,
   then your conscience shall accuse and Satan shall find an echo in your
   heart when he rails at you--and what will you do then?

   Let me say, dear Friends, that for the entire man--we cannot stop this
   morning to take all the different powers with which man is endowed--but
   taking the whole together there is nothing that can satisfy the entire
   man but the Lord's love and the Lord's own Self. Many saints have tried
   to anchor in other roadsteads, but all have failed. I believe Solomon
   was a saint. I know he was a sinner--I believe he was the biggest fool
   that ever lived. But I believe that he was also the wisest of men. He
   was, in fact, a mass of contradictions.

   Now Solomon was permitted to make experiments for us all and to do for
   us what we must not dare to do for ourselves. Here is his testimony in
   his own words--"I said of laughter, It is mad. And of mirth, What does
   it? I sought in my heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting my
   heart with wisdom. And to lay hold on folly till I might see what was
   that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the Heaven
   all the days of their life. I made me great works. I built houses. I
   planted vineyards--I made gardens and orchards and I planted trees in
   them of all kind of fruits. I made me pools of water, to water the wood
   that brings forth trees. I got me servants and maidens and had servants
   born in my house.

   "Also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that
   were in Jerusalem before me. I gathered me also silver and gold and the
   peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got men singers and
   women singers and the delights of the sons of men, as musical
   instruments and that of all sorts. So I was great and increased more
   than all that were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with
   me. And whatever my eyes desired I kept not from them. I withheld not
   my heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced in all my labor--and this
   was my portion of all my labor. Then I looked on all the works that my
   hands had worked and on the labor that I had labored to do--and,
   behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no profit
   under the sun." "Vanity of vanity, all is vanity."

   What? The whole of it vanity? Is there nothing in all that wealth,
   Solomon? What? Nothing in that wide dominion of yours reaching from the
   river even to the sea? Nothing in Palmyra's glorious seat? Nothing in
   the house of the forest of Lebanon? Do you see nothing from Dan to
   Beersheba when you have made brass to be like pebbles and gold and
   silver to be but as common dust of the land? In those sweet sounds that
   lull you to your rest, in all the music and dancing that delight you,
   is there nothing?

   "Nothing," he says, "but weariness of spirit." This is his verdict when
   he has tried it all. To get hold of Christ, to have His love and to
   taste of union with Him--this, dear Brethren--this is everything! You
   need not try any other form of life in order to see whether it is
   better than the Christian's. Let me assure you if you roam the world
   round and search from Britain to Japan you will see no sights like a
   sight of the Savior's face! And if you could have all the comforts of
   life, yet if you lost your Savior you would be wretched! But if you get
   Him, then should you rot in a dungeon you would find it a paradise!
   Should you live in obscurity, or die with famine, you would yet be
   satisfied with favor and full of the goodness of the Lord!

   III. Let us spend a moment in considering WHY THE DOVE COULD FIND NO
   REST FOR THE SOLES OF HER FEET. Was there a want of will in the dove?
   Was she one of those discontented birds that will not rest anywhere?
   Nothing of the kind! She seems to have searched after rest, for
   otherwise it need not be recorded that she found none. There are
   certain people in this world who never will rest and they certainly do
   not deserve it. They always grumble. No matter what you do, or what you
   do not do, they grumble forevermore.

   They grumble at the sun, and call him, as Thompson once did, "a rosy
   drunkard." They murmur at the moon, her light is too pale and sickly
   and variable. They murmur at death--it is a dreadful thing to lose
   one's friends. They murmur at life--everybody seems to die and be
   happy, they say, except themselves--they are condemned to live on. You
   never can please them. All things are either too hot or too cold, too
   young or too old, too rough or too smooth, too high or too low. They
   have made up their minds that there is nothing on earth that will ever
   satisfy them. They have set up an ultra standard of what they want and
   the world does not yield it.

   No grass is green enough for them. No milk that is ever given by cows
   is fit for them to drink. No wine that was ever pressed from grapes is
   rich enough for their taste. Upon all created things they use the only
   organ which seems to be of use to them, that is, their nose--and that
   they turn up! Such people as these will tell you that there is nothing
   on earth--nothing on earth. They have indigestion, their liver is out
   of order--and consequently there is nothing on earth--everything here
   below is mean and despicable.

   Now when people talk like that you just measure their talk by the men
   and make small account of their utterances. These men are not talking
   from their judgment--they are merely talking under the influence of an
   absurd, half-mad feeling! But such is not the case with the Christian.
   I know a considerable number of Christians who are of a cheerful
   disposition and who would even, as worldlings, have been satisfied with
   very little. They are a kind of men, (I trust you have some of them for
   your friends), who are not often put out. They, on the other hand,
   always look at the bright side of everything and if there should be a
   something which is a little amiss, they take it as a variety and only
   say, "Well, this is a change," and so they make pleasure where others
   would find pain.

   And yet these very people, when they are converted, will tell you that
   they are not satisfied out of Christ! Now their verdict is worth
   considering. The dove had a will to find rest for the soles of her feet
   but she could not. It is not from want of will that I am compelled to
   say I cannot find anything beneath these stars, nor within the compass
   of the skies that can satisfy my soul's desires. I must get my God and
   have Him to fill my large expectations or I shall not be content. I
   mention these things because people are apt to suppose that Christians
   are all a set of melancholy dyspeptics who put up with religion because
   there is nothing else that helps to make them to be so happily
   miserable and therefore they take to it as congenial with their
   melancholy disposition! But it is not so. We are a cheerful, genial
   race and yet for all that we are not resting the soles of our feet
   anywhere in earthly things.

   Again, the reason why the dove could find no rest was not because she
   had no eyes to see. I know not how far a dove's eyes can discern, but
   it must be a very vast distance--perfectly incredible I should think.
   We see the dove sometimes mount aloft--we can see nothing and yet she
   perceives her dovecote and darts towards it. Now the Christian does not
   say there is no joy on earth for him except in his Lord because he has
   no power to see things pleasing and delightful. If there is melody in
   music, the Christian knows it, likes it, rejoices in it. If there is
   sweetness his palate is as good as another man's. If there is anything
   to be found in wealth, or what the world calls pleasure, he can see it
   all--he is not blind!

   I know many Christians who are as quick in apprehension, as refined in
   taste, and as ready to appreciate anything that is pleasurable as other
   men--and yet these are men who are not fanatics! They are not shut up
   to a narrow range of things, but their vision can take in the whole
   circle of sublunary delights. These are men who have not only seen but
   even tasted, yet bear their witness that like the dove they can find no
   rest for the soles of their feet.

   Moreover, the reason why the dove found no rest was not because she had
   no wings to reach it. Her wings were strong and swift. She could fly as
   well as the raven--perhaps she could, in the long run, outstrip him. So
   the Christian has power to enter into the enjoyments of the world if he
   likes. It is not because his youth has departed and he has become old
   and shriveled and therefore the delights of the flesh have ceased to be
   temptations to him. No! Of course there are some in that condition, who
   when converted can almost be taunted by sinners with the remark that
   they have tried the world's pleasures and when they could not enjoy
   them they then turned away from them.

   But some of us are young and strong and full of blood and our bones are
   full of marrow. And if we willed it we could be ringleaders in all
   sorts of pleasure and plunge head first into the stream of sensual
   delight. We lack not courage and we lack not force and yet for all
   this--we say it solemnly and the God that searches all hearts knows we
   only say what we feel forced to say--that we can find no rest for the
   soles of our feet in earthly pleasures. We have tried. We have wished
   to rest. We have even wanted to be satisfied with the world--but the
   void within can never be filled out of the mines of earth. We
   cannot--God has made it all empty to us.

   Now what was the reason, then? It was not want of will. It was not want
   of sight. Nor was it want of wings--what was it? The reason lay in
   this--she was a dove! If she had been a raven she would have found
   plenty of rest for the soles of her feet. It was her nature that made
   her restless. And the reason why the Christian cannot find satisfaction
   in worldly things is because there is a new nature within him that
   cannot rest. "Up! Up! Up!" cries the new heart! "What have you to do
   here?" "Come, strike your tents," cries the new creature. "You have no
   continuing city here--how is it that you try to make one in this barren
   wilderness? Away with you! What are you doing?"

   If I could transform myself to an unregenerate man, the world might
   content me. But if I am regenerate, it matters not into what society I
   may be thrown away, I never can, I never shall, I must not, I dare not
   hope for contentment--for to the regenerate, Christ alone is
   satisfaction--they cannot find it anywhere else. You see, then, that
   this is a great test--this will try you, dear Friends, and divide you.

   If any of you are saying, "Oh, I am satisfied enough. I do not want
   this Christ the man talks about--give me this and give me that and I
   shall be quite content." I say, "Very likely--so was the raven content
   with carrion. But and if you are a child of God, you may seek
   contentment elsewhere, but you shall be compelled, perhaps by sore and
   bitter trials, to turn away from all earthly things and fly back again
   to your ark."

   IV. Being disappointed, WHAT DID THE DOVE DO? When she found there was
   no contentment elsewhere, what then? She flew back to the ark. Josephus
   tells us that the dove came back to Noah with her wings and feet all
   wet and muddy. I think it is very likely, but I do not think it any the
   more likely because Josephus says so. Some of you have grown wet and
   muddy. You have been trying to find rest in the world, Christian, and
   you have got mired with it. Trying to rest those feet where they could
   not rest you have collected filth.

   What then? Shall I advise you to bathe in the flood? Shall I advise you
   to cleanse those wings till they are bright as they once were? No, I do
   not. I cannot give you any such advice. I can only say to you, "Do what
   the dove did." She mounted again--she caught sight of the ark and knew
   the place of safety. I want you once again to get a sight of Christ.
   Peter had gone far away, as the dove had done--he had denied his Master
   with oaths and curses--and what brought him back? Why, it was the Lord
   getting a sight of Peter and Peter getting a sight of the Lord! "The
   Lord turned and looked upon Peter and he went out and wept bitterly."

   Was it not all done as soon as the Lord's eyes and Peter's eyes came
   into contact? If you are enabled by the Holy Spirit to remember that
   there was a Savior who loved you so that Heaven could not hold Him.
   That He had to come to earth and enter into your degradation, and bear
   your sin, and suffer for your sake, you will be getting right at once,
   however far off you are! If you look to Jesus, there is life for you in
   a look at the Crucified One.

   Then the dove, after looking, was not content with that--she began to
   speed with all her might back to the ark. So, when you have a faint
   view of your Savior and you are once more consciously saved, then fly
   back to Him! I do not read that the dove made a tour round about, or
   that she thought she would try something else. No, she took just the
   straight-est line she could, the nearest way between herself and her
   loved abode and went right straight away to Noah. Fear may have made
   her wings heavy, but it did not stop them! Mire and mud may have made
   the journey more laborious, but it did not turn her aside!

   Come you mired ones! Come you fainting ones, doves as you are! Though
   you think yourself to be black as the raven with the mire of sin--back,
   back to the Savior! Every moment you wait does but increase your
   misery! Your attempts to plume yourself and make yourself fit for Him
   are all vanity. Come to Him just as you are! "Return you backsliding
   Israel." He does not say, " Return you repenting Israel," (there is
   such an invitation, doubtless), but, "you backsliding one, as a
   backslider with all your backslidings about you. Return, return,
   return!"

   V. I want you now to turn your eyes for a moment to THE VERY BEAUTIFUL
   SCENE, so it seems to me to be, at the end of her return journey. Noah
   has been looking out for his dove all day long. Here she comes! How
   heavily she flies! She will drop--she will never reach the ark. Here
   she comes and Noah is ready to receive her. She looks bespotted with
   mire and dirt, but Noah waits for her. She has just strength to get on
   to the edge of the ark--she can hardly hold on there and is ready to
   drop when Noah puts forth his hand and pulls her in unto him.

   Mark that--"pulled her in unto him." It seems to me to imply that she
   did not fly right in herself, but was too fearful, or too weary to get
   right in. She got as far as she could and then he put forth his hand
   and pulled her in unto him. Did you ever feel that blessed gracious
   pull, when your heart has been desiring to get near to Christ? Oh, it
   has been such tugging, such toiling in prayer--you could only say, "I
   would but cannot pray. My heart is heavy as lead and my soul as hard as
   adamant and dead as iron. I cannot stir myself and get near to the
   Savior. Oh that I could! Oh that I had the wings of a dove, for then
   would I flee away and be at rest."

   All of a sudden it comes, that gracious pull! Your heart begins to be
   on fire! Before you are aware your soul seems to be like the chariots
   of Aminadab! Now it is all well with you! Now can you sing sweetly to
   your Beloved who has done great things for you and you are glad. All
   this was, you perceive, to the wandering dove, to the miry dove
   speckled with filth. Just as she was, she is pulled into the ark. So
   you, with all that sin of yours and those wanderings will be received.
   "Only return"--those are two gracious words in the Bible--"only
   return"--so it is put. What? Nothing else? No, only return.

   She had no olive branch in her mouth this time. Nothing at all but just
   herself and her wanderings. But it is, "only return," and she does
   return and Noah pulls her in. Lord, pull me in! My thirsty spirit
   faints to reach You! My soul cries out for Your Presence but cannot
   reach You! I see You, Lord! Pull me in! When like Esther I faint in
   Your Presence and cannot tell You what I would, stretch out Your silver
   scepter--read my heart and grant my desire and show Yourself to me! Oh,
   open my eyes to see You and know You!

   Thus much concerning the dove and its likeness to our own hearts. Now I
   close with these three things--First, this becomes first of all a test
   to you. We can divide the house into two parts by asking the question,
   "Are you satisfied out of Christ?" Are you satisfied and content with
   anything short of a conscious knowledge of your union and interest in
   Christ Jesus? If so, you have no reason to believe that you are a
   converted man. If this world satisfies you I have no fault to find, no
   reason to be angry with you. Who finds fault with horses for being
   satisfied with hay and oats? It is their natural food.

   Some persons are very indignant with others because they will go to
   theatres and gay assemblies. They only take what their nature craves
   after. The raven is now feeding on his carrion. I draw a distinction
   forevermore between that which men without Divine Grace may do and that
   which gracious men may do. The graceless man stands somewhat on the
   level of the beast that perishes. Well, let the swine have their husks!
   Let the swine, I say, have their provender. You will never make them
   any better by denying them their husks! You may excite their angry
   passions against you, that is all--let them have their husks.

   But you, on the other hand, who are a Christian, are a different being.
   You are lifted into another state. You have another nature. Now, could
   you enjoy those things? If you really could find satisfaction in them,
   you are a hypocrite. If your soul really could stretch herself at rest
   and find the bed long enough and the coverlet broad enough to cover you
   in the chambers of sin, then you are a hypocrite and one of these days
   down to the pit your soul must go! On the other hand, if you feel sure
   and certain that if you could indulge in sin without a punishment, it
   would still be a punishment of itself. And if you feel you could have
   the whole world and never be parted from it, it would be quite enough
   misery not to be parted from it--for your God--your God is what your
   soul craves after, then be of good courage! You are a child of God!

   With all your sins and imperfections, take this to your comfort--if
   your soul has no rest in sin, you are not as the sinner is. If you are
   still crying after and craving after something better, Christ has not
   forgotten you for you have not quite forgotten Him. Here is a test,
   then. And then, secondly, we must use our text as an encouragement.
   Here we have an encouragement to backsliders to return like the dove.
   She did not find the ark shut against her--we do not even find there
   was any delay. Noah pulled her in at once. To the sinner here is
   encouragement, too. If you come back to the ark, you shall not be
   excluded. If any man shall be shut out of Heaven, he shuts the door
   himself. He who is damned signs his own death warrant. Our verse is
   true--

   "None are excluded from now
   But those who do themselves exclude."

   If you come--sinner, drunkard, blasphemer, liar, thief--whoever you may
   be, it is written, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out."
   "But here is one," I think I hear someone say, "here is one of such a
   sort as never came before! Blacker than night. More full of sin than
   the egg is full of meat! Now, now there is one that will be shut out."
   I say make way for him, make way for him! Stand back you common
   sinners, make a way for him! Now we will see whether Christ is true or
   not! Brethren, what will be the result? Why we know that in Christ
   there is love and truth and faithfulness--and that what He says He
   means and that His promise He will perform.

   When that black sinner comes, the Lord looks upon him with an eye of
   unutterable love and His first word is, "I have blotted out your
   iniquity as a cloud and like a thick cloud your transgression." "I have
   loved you with an everlasting love," and His next act is to plunge that
   sinner in the fountain filled with blood and suddenly he comes out
   whiter than snow, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing! He is
   able to cleanse from all iniquity and to deliver from all
   unrighteousness and to make the foulest and vilest bright as the sun at
   noonday! This is encouragement--God help you to take it! May the Holy
   Spirit bring you to Christ today.

   And then, lastly, we use our text, I think, as a loud cry for
   gratitude. Does Christ receive us when we have found Him and is there
   none on earth like He? Is He the best of all the good, the fairest of
   all the lovely? Oh then, let us praise Him.! Down with your idols, up
   with the Lord Jesus! Now let the standard of all pomp and pride be
   trampled under foot, and let the Cross of Jesus, which the world frowns
   and scoffs at, be lifted up! Oh for a high throne for the Savior! Let
   Him be lifted up forever and let my soul sit at His feet and kiss His
   feet and wash them with my tears.

   Oh how precious is Christ! How can it be that I have thought so little
   of Him? How is it I can go abroad for anything else when He is so full,
   so rich, so satisfying? Christian, make a covenant with your heart and
   ask the Lord to ratify it-- that you will never depart from Him! Bid
   Him set you as a signet upon His finger and as a bracelet upon His arm.
   Ask Him to bind you about Him as the bride decks herself with ornaments
   and as the bridegroom puts on his jewelry. I would live in Christ's
   heart--in the clefts of that Rock my soul would abide!

   The sparrow has made a house and the swallow a nest for herself where
   she may lay her young, even Your altars, O Lord of Hosts, my King and
   my God! And so, too, would I make my nest, my home in You and never
   from You may the soul of Your turtle dove go forth again! May I nestle
   close to Jesus who has pulled me back into the ark after my
   backsliding. May the Holy Spirit so preserve us for His name's sake.
   Amen.

                               Who Are The Elect?

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JULY 9, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE
   METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him, for this is he." 1 Samuel 16:12.

   SAMUEL was sent to Bethlehem to discover the object of God's election.
   This would have been a very difficult task if the God who sent him had
   not accompanied him and spoken with the sure voice of Inspiration
   within him so soon as the chosen object stood before him. Brethren, it
   is neither your task nor mine to guess who are God's elect apart from
   marks and evidences. What was done in the councils of eternity before
   the world was made is hidden in the mind of God and we must not
   curiously intrude where the door is closed by the hand of Wisdom.

   Yet in the preaching of the Word there is a discovery made of God's
   secret election. We preach the Gospel to every creature under Heaven.
   We deliver God's threats and promises to every sinner and we cry, "Look
   unto Jesus and be you saved, all the ends of the earth." That Gospel
   is, of itself, through God the Holy Spirit, the discerner of the chosen
   ones of God when they feel its quickening power and are raised from
   among the spiritually dead. The Gospel is a fan which, while it drives
   away the chaff, leaves the wheat upon the floor. The Gospel is like a
   refiner's fire and like the fuller's soap removing all that is
   extraneous and worthless, revealing the precious and the pure.

   We ministers have no other way by which to discern the saints of God
   and to separate the precious from the vile but by faithfully preaching
   the Truth of God as it is in Jesus and observing its effects. As for
   ourselves, we may discover our own calling and election and make them
   sure. Paul said of the Thessalonians that he knew their election of
   God. We may discover the election of other men to a very high degree of
   probability by their conduct and conversation, and be certified of our
   own election, even to infallibility, by the witness of the Spirit
   within that we are born of God.

   If our heart is renewed by the Spirit. If we are made new creatures in
   Christ Jesus. If we are reconciled unto God and redeemed from dead
   works we may know that our names were written in the Lamb's Book of
   Life from before the foundation of the world. This morning I am about
   to speak upon the way in which we may discover the elect, making the
   case of David, in some degree, our guiding star.

   I. I would have you mark at the outset, THE SURPRISE of all, when they
   found that David, the least in his father's house, was the object of
   the Lord's choice as king over Israel! Observe that his brothers had no
   idea that David would be selected. Such a thought had never entered
   their minds. If the question had been asked of them, "Who among you
   will ever attain to the kingdom?" they would have selected any of the
   other seven, but they would certainly have passed by their brother,
   David.

   He seems to have been thoroughly despised by his brothers. Eliab
   addresses him in a tone of scorn when he comes to the valley of
   Elah--"Because of your pride and the naughtiness of your heart you are
   come to see the battle." This mode of speech was, no doubt, such as he
   usually employed towards the young man. I suppose that David had been
   one by himself. The sports of the seven were often such that he could
   not engage in them. He was no companion for them. If they at any time
   perpetrated any unjust or unrighteous deed--if, as probably a band of
   seven young men in the hey-day of youth were likely to do--they were
   bold in courses of sinful mirth--David would follow the example of
   Joseph and act as a reprover in their midst and consequently he fell
   under their contempt.

   He was with his flock on the mountain side when they were making merry
   with their drinking. His book and his harp were his solace.
   Contemplation was his great delight and his God his best company--while
   his brothers found no pleasure in Divine things. He, like our Lord,
   could say, "For Your sake I have borne reproach. Shame has covered my
   face. I am become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my
   mother's children" (Psa. 69:7, 8). Like Joseph, he was "the dreamer" of
   the family in the esteem of the rest. They thought him moon-struck when
   he considered the heavens and called him mad when he meditated both day
   and night on God's Law.

   Now, beloved Friends to whom I address myself, you may be one of those
   whom God has looked upon with an eye of love from before the foundation
   of the world and yet, in the family to which you belong you may be
   overlooked and forgotten. Your own brethren have formed a very low
   opinion of your abilities and they have a perfect contempt for the
   singularity of your character. You are as a speckled bird among your
   own kinsfolk--you cannot enjoy what they enjoy-- your loves and your
   longings run in a different channel from theirs. Suffer not their
   contempt to break your heart!

   Remember David once stood in your position and there was yet another in
   the earlier days upon the crown of whose head the blessing of the
   eternal hills descended though he was separated from his brethren. And
   so may Heaven's enriching smile yet rest on you for the Lord sees not
   as man sees! The rejected of men are often the beloved of the Lord. It
   is more painful to notice that David's father should have had no idea
   of David's excellence. A father has naturally more love to his child
   than a brother to his brother and frequently the youngest child is the
   darling.

   But David does not seem to have been the tender one of his father.
   Jesse calls him the least and if I understand the word which he uses in
   the original, there is something more implied than his being the
   youngest. He was the least in the estimation of the ill-judging parent.
   It is strange that he should have been left out when the rest were
   summoned to the feast. I cannot acquit Jesse of fault in having omitted
   to call his son, when that feast was a special religious service. At a
   sacrifice all should be present. When the Prophet comes none should be
   away and yet it was not thought worthwhile to call David, although one
   would think a servant might have kept the sheep and so the whole family
   might have met on so hallowed an occasion.

   Yet no son was left in the field but David. All the others were
   assembled. It sometimes happens, (but O how wrongly!), that one in the
   family is overlooked, even by his parent in his hopes and prayers. The
   father seems to think, "God may be pleased to convert William. He may
   call Mary. I trust in His Providence we shall see John grow up to be a
   credit to us. But as for Richard or Sarah, I do not know what will ever
   become of them." How often will parents have to confess that they have
   misjudged and that the one upon whom they have set the black mark has
   been, after all, the joy and comfort of their lives and has given them
   more satisfaction than all the rest put together!

   Are you such an one, young man? Are you painfully conscious that you
   have a narrow share in your parents' hearts? Be not downcast,
   distressed, or broken-hearted about this. You fare as David did before
   you and if he, the favored servant of God, the man after God's own
   heart, could put up with his position, be not you too proud to abide in
   it! Even if your father and your mother forsake you--if the Lord takes
   you up--He will be better to you than the best of parents! It is clear,
   also, that Samuel, God's servant, had at first no idea of David's
   election. The brethren advanced one by one and Samuel, using his human
   judgment, was ready to select any other rather than David.

   The minister of God, if he is truly called and sent, has a yearning in
   his soul to bring out God's chosen from their hidden state. His eyes
   are quick to discern the first tokens of Divine Grace in a renewed
   soul. But sometimes the Christian minister is deceived. He consults
   with flesh and blood and selects Eliab, the one who is a fine person,
   whose noble countenance bespeaks something above the ordinary level,
   whose whole frame is so admirably fashioned that he is good to look
   upon. How true is it that the Lord takes not pleasure in the legs of a
   man. The gifts of personal appearance often become snares instead of
   blessings--"beauty is deceitful and favor is vain."

   The Lord had not chosen Eliab. Then rank will come before the minister,
   and if he sees a person of high estate cheerfully listening to the
   Gospel, he is very ready to think, "Surely the Lord has chosen him."
   But how often these are but birds of passage in our congregation who
   never tarry long enough to build a nest in the sanctuary. Mere
   curiosity brings them and a new curiosity carries them elsewhere.
   Surely the Lord has not often chosen these Abinadabs.

   Again, others are so well educated that when the Word is preached they
   appreciate the style in which it is delivered and the remarks which
   they make concerning it are so sensible and so judicious that the
   preacher is apt to say, "Surely the Lord has chosen these!" And yet how
   often the educated are too proud to believe the simplicities of Christ
   and the intellectual turn on their heels because the Gospel is scarcely
   refined enough for their taste.

   At other times we feel sure that we have now pitched upon the right
   man, for we are charmed with our hearer's natural amiability of
   disposition and are cheered by his tenderness and susceptibility of
   mind to religious impressions. And yet we are disappointed. Many lovely
   blossoms never become fruit and hopeful saplings prove not to be plants
   of the Lord's right-hand planting and therefore are plucked up. At
   times, too, we hear such admirable conversation about re- ligion that
   we conclude, "Now we have found out the chosen of the Lord." We have
   sat in company and heard young men use devout expressions which implied
   no ordinary depth of Scriptural knowledge.

   We have heard those persons pray and have admired their great gift in
   prayer. They have addressed religious assemblies and spoken with a high
   degree of fluency and our heart said, "Surely the Lord has chosen
   these!" And yet, my Brethren in the ministry will tell you that often
   out of the many hopefuls who have passed before them they have found
   many to be heart-breakers, and few who gave them any real satisfaction
   as to their conversion to God.

   Meanwhile, the very ones whom we overlooked, the least ones in the
   assembly, have been the Davids upon whom God's blessing has fallen. Oh,
   some of you have listened to our word these ten years and more, and you
   have been impressed again and again--and yet you are unconverted! We
   often thought you must be the chosen of God when we marked your tears
   and your apparent feeling, but up till now you are without any evidence
   of election. On the other hand there has dropped into this place a
   drunkard and there has strayed into these aisles a harlot and the
   mighty Grace of God has converted them and they are rejoicing now in
   the full forgiveness of their sins while you are yet "in the gall of
   bitterness and in the bond of iniquity"!

   How true is that word, "the publicans and harlots enter into the
   kingdom of Heaven before you." How matchless is the Sovereignty of God!
   "His ways are past finding out." The very poorest, the most illiterate,
   the mean and most obscure, the fools, the babes, the things
   despised--yes--"the things that are not" does He choose, to bring to
   nothing the things that are, that no flesh should glory in His
   Presence. It strikes me that there was one person more astonished when
   David was anointed than even his brothers, or his father, or the
   Prophet--and that was David!

   He was a wonder unto many, but chiefly to himself. He had communed with
   God alone beneath the spreading trees. He had sung the praises of
   Jehovah in the wilderness where he had led his flocks, and by the
   waterside he had tuned his harp and made the rocks echo with the sweet
   music of his grateful soul. But he never dreamed of being a king! If a
   Prophet had said to him, "The Lord will take you from following the
   sheep to be ruler over His people Israel, and He will be with you
   wherever you go and cut off all your enemies out of your sight and make
   you a name like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth,"
   he would have cried, "What am I, O Lord God? And what is my house, that
   you have brought me up to now? Is this the manner of men, O Lord God?"

   So, dear Friend, you may be truly a child of God, but you may, as yet,
   have no clear view of the high and noble calling to which God has
   ordained you. Your trembling faith has laid its hand upon the head of
   Jesus and you trust you are forgiven--but as yet you do not know the
   grandeur and dignity to which faith exalts every heir of Heaven. Now,
   let me whisper in your ear words concerning your present greatness and
   the glory which is yet to be revealed in you. "Beloved, now are we the
   sons of God. And it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know
   that when He shall appear we shall be like He, for we shall see Him as
   He is."

   You are justified by faith and you have peace with God and do you not
   know that, "Whom He justifies, them He also glorifies"? You shall be
   surely glorified! Do you know the reason for this? It is because you
   are "elect according to the foreknowledge of God, through
   sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the Truth." Yes, poor
   Trembler, the thoughts of God were exercised concerning you before the
   stars began to dart their rays through the thick darkness!
   Jehovah-Jesus wrote your name upon His heart and engraved it on the
   palms of His hands before the skies were stretched abroad! Be of good
   courage, there is a kingdom for you!

   The sure mercies of David have ordained you to overcome and to sit down
   upon Jesus' Throne, even as He has overcome and is set down with His
   Father upon His Throne. Be glad, therefore, for it is the Father's good
   pleasure to give you the kingdom. I think I see you all surprised and
   you say, "How can it be? I! Chosen of God! My many sins, my great
   infirmities, my doubts, my barrenness in God's service--the coldness of
   my heart--all these make me go mourning. Can it be that yet He has
   ordained me to a kingdom?"

   It is even so. Let your faith grasp the truth and go your way
   rejoicing. Remember, dear Friend, that it matters not what your
   occupation may be, you may yet have the privilege of the kingdom. David
   was but a shepherd and yet he was raised to the throne and so shall
   each Believer be. You may be obscure and unknown--in your father's
   house the very least--and yet you may share a filial part in the Divine
   heart. You may be among those who never would be mentioned except as
   mere units of the general census--without parts, without position. You
   may almost think yourself to have less than the one talent--you may
   conceive yourself to be a worm and no man--and like David you may say,
   "I was as a beast before You." And yet think of this--that the
   marvelous election of God can stoop from the highest Throne of Glory to
   lift the beggar from the dunghill and set him among princes!

   II. We shall now turn our thoughts to THE TOKEN of election, the secret
   mark which the Lord sets in due time upon the chosen. In due time every
   chosen person receives the seal of Divine Grace. That stamp is a new
   heart and a right spirit! Let all men understand that a new heart is
   the private seal of the Divine One, the broad arrow of the King of
   Kings! Men look upon the outward appearance as the mark of favor, but
   God looks at the heart as the token of His choice.

   We are not to suppose David was chosen to salvation because of the
   natural goodness of his heart, for he tells us, himself, that he was
   "born in sin and shapen in iniquity." Although we are willing to grant
   that when God had renewed his heart as the result of His Sovereign
   Grace, a goodness of heart constituted a qualification for the kingdom
   just as Grace is a fitness for Glory--but the righteousness of heart
   was itself the gift of Sovereign Grace and was the effect--not the
   cause of the primary and eternal election which fixed on David. We do
   not intend to discuss the reason of God's election--let us not be
   misunderstood--of that we know nothing!

   We believe that God chooses wisely, but He chooses from reasons not
   known to men, probably reasons which could not be understood by us. All
   we know is, "Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight." We
   are now speaking of the way by which God seals His elect and
   distinguishes His chosen ones after His Grace has operated upon them.
   They are distinguished by having a heart that differs from other men.
   May we be able thus to discover whether we are among them or not? What
   kind of heart had David? We may find it out by his Psalms. We cannot
   tell when some of the Psalms were written, but if any of them were
   written in his youth, the twenty-third was certainly one.

   That beautiful pastoral poem opens a window into the heart of David.
   Let us look through it and we shall soon perceive that he possessed a
   believing heart. How sweet is the sentence, "The Lord is my Shepherd, I
   shall not want." Happy David! He had summed up all his wants and
   cares--he knew that he wanted pardon for sin and Divine Grace to
   preserve him from evil. He desired wisdom to guide him in the perilous
   paths of youth, strength to aid him in the conflicts which were before
   him--but instead of looking to himself or to friends, he turns away
   from all created good to God--and by faith he says, "The Lord is my
   Shepherd, I shall not want."

   Here is a grand mark of Divine election! Dear friend, do you rest in
   God for everything? Has your heart given up all confidence in itself?
   "He that trusts in his own heart is a fool." Has your heart given up
   all trust in your fellow? "Cursed is he that trusts in man, and makes
   flesh his arm." Have you seen the emptiness of your own works and
   willings and beings and wishings and have you taken the Lord as He
   reveals Himself in the pages of Scripture--Father, Son and Spirit--to
   be your All in All? If you do so trust, you need not fear your
   election, for when God looks into your heart He sees in your faith the
   symbol and sign of His Sovereign Grace! Never was there a simple faith
   in Himself where there had not been His hand at work and His heart
   ordaining to eternal life!

   We note, as we read the Psalm, that David's heart was also a meditative
   heart. Mark the words, "He makes me to lie down in green pastures: He
   leads me beside the still waters." He elsewhere writes--"My meditation
   of Him shall be sweet." The whole book of Psalms, which is David's life
   written out in poetic characters, proves that he was much given to
   meditation on heavenly subjects. Alone there on the mountains, down by
   the rippling brooks--wherever he had to conduct the flocks--there he
   set up an altar to his God and made an oratory for himself. Much sweet
   communion was carried on between David and his God which Eliab knew
   nothing of and into which Abinadab could not enter.

   Read the one hundred and nineteenth Psalm and you will see that he won
   for himself all the blessings which by Inspiration he sang of in the
   first Psalm. He meditated upon the Law of his God both day and night.
   Dear Friend, is that your case? When your thoughts get free, do they
   fly away as the dove does to its dovecote--right away to God? Can you
   say with David that His Words are sweet to your taste? Is the very name
   of God dear to you? Do you delight yourself in Him? Do you meditate
   much upon the Person of Jesus Christ? Remember that by your thoughts
   you may judge your state and if your heart does not meditate on God's
   statutes, you certainly miss one of the signs of Divine election--for
   elect souls are brought out in due time to find a delight in the ways
   and Words of God.

   Go on with the Psalm and I think you will be struck with the humble
   heart which David had, for all the way through he does not praise
   himself. "He leads me beside the still waters, He restores my soul."
   See, he has no crown for his own head! The crown is all for the Mighty
   One who is his Shepherd. His soul was in his pen when he wrote, "Not
   unto us, not unto us, but unto Your name be all the glory." David was
   none of your strutting peacocks who cannot be content unless all eyes
   are upon them--he sang God's praises as the nightingale will sing in
   the dark when no human ear is listening and no eye is admiring.

   He was content to bloom unseen, knowing that the sweetness of a renewed
   heart is never wasted on the desert air. He was satisfied with God
   alone as his Auditor and he coveted not the high opinion of man. Before
   his God how high he rose and yet how low he bowed! How deeply did he
   feel his indebtedness to Him who gave him all, and how zealously did he
   ascribe his salvation and glory and strength unto Him who had been from
   the first to the last his Helper. He would have enjoyed the verse in
   which Asaph alludes to his low estate, "He chose David also His servant
   and took him from the sheepfolds: from following the ewes great with
   young He brought him to feed Jacob, His people, and Israel His
   inheritance."

   for a heart free from all pride! We should altogether fail in
   describing David if we were to omit other qualifications. His was a
   holy heart. Observe in the same Psalm, "He leads me in the paths of
   righteousness for His name's sake." David delighted not in iniquity.
   The men of Belial he put far from him. "A liar shall not tarry in my
   sight," he said. He loved the people of God. He styles them, "The
   excellent of the earth in whom is all my delight." Holiness which
   becomes God's House was very delightful to David's soul. He loved the
   Commandments of God because of their holiness. "Your Word is very pure,
   therefore Your servant loves it" (Psa. 119:140).

   1 grant you that he did once fall into grievous sin, but that was an
   exception to a gracious rule. His rule was holiness. The best of men
   are men at the best and therefore they may slip. But oh, how bitterly
   David mourned to his dying day the evil into which he fell! "He was a
   man after God's own heart and his way was ordered according to
   holiness." Note what a brave heart beat in his breast! Where will you
   find a braver man than David? "Your servant slew both the lion and the
   bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them."

   It is this David who, while the cringing host of Israel flies from
   combat, enters the battle with the boasting Philistine and brings
   deliverance unto Israel! Hear you the stripling's valorous voice--"You
   come against me with sword and with a spear and with a shield. But I
   come to you in the name of the Lord of Hosts, the God of the armies of
   Israel, whom you have defied." How bold was David in most cases!

   There were times when he, like the children of Ephraim, turned his back
   in the day of battle. Take, for instance, when he played the fool
   before Achish. But in other cases his soul was set against the Lord's
   enemies and though an host encamped against him, his heart did not
   fear--though war was waged against him, in this was he confident--for
   he wore the breastplate of dauntless courage. The Psalm right bravely
   puts it, "Yes, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
   I will fear no evil; for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff they
   comfort me." Let me remind you that he had a very contented and
   grateful heart.

   I do not know a better picture of David in his early days than that
   which Bunyan gives us of the shepherd who was singing in the Valley of
   Humiliation--

   "He that is down needs fear no fall
   I am content with what I have,
   He that is low, no pride;
   Little be it or much;
   He that is humble ever shall.
   And Lord, contentment still I crave,
   Have God to be his guide.
   Because you sa ve such."

   Here is David's version of the very same sentiment, "You prepare a
   table before me in the presence of my enemies: You anoint my head with
   oil; my cup runs over." He had all his heart could wish. I do trust,
   dear Friends, we can, some of us, humbly claim that we possess such a
   heart as this and oh, that my tongue may be able to say without deceit,
   "Yes, Lord, my soul is satisfied with what You ordain. Whatever Your
   will is, it shall be my will."

   You should further observe the constancy of David's heart. He says,
   "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and
   I will dwell in the House of the Lord forever." He was not one of the
   Pliables, who set out and turn back again at the first slough into
   which they tumble. He was no Demas, ready to forsake his profession to
   win this present evil world. All the days of his life he abode close to
   the way of the Lord and remained as a servant in God's House. By such
   marks may we know our election.

   I would God that those who are so positive of their election would
   condescend, sometimes, to try themselves by Scriptural marks and
   evidences. We are told, by certain Divines, that we should never doubt
   our safety. Beloved, we should never doubt God. But I am inclined to
   think that no man who exercises a holy watchfulness over himself and a
   holy earnestness to be found accepted at the last, can be at all times
   without doubts as to his own interest in Christ! I am persuaded that
   the hymn--

   " 'Tis a point I long to know, Oft it causes anxious thought" is the
   experience of every child of God, more or less, and that there are
   seasons when that is the best hymn which a man can sing.

   It is seldom that I doubt my interest in Christ Jesus, but it is very
   often that I ask myself, "Is this confidence well-grounded?" And if I
   were afraid to question myself, if I were afraid to go back to the
   foundation and search myself thor-oughly--if I always went on blindly
   confident and never examined myself whether I were in the faith--I
   think that would be an omen of being given up to a strong delusion to
   believe a lie! I have labored in your presence to preach up the
   privilege of strong faith. I have urged you to strive after full
   assurance of faith--but never let these lips say a word or a syllable
   against that holy carefulness which makes a broad distinction between
   presumption and assurance!

   Depend upon it--privilege preached always without precept will breed a
   fullness and lethargy in God's people! What we want at certain seasons
   is not a promise, but a telling, burning word of self-examination--the
   flavor of which we may not like--but which shall work in our souls
   spiritual good of a more lasting sort than sweet comforts would bring
   to us. Examine yourselves, dear Friends, then, by this.

   I do not ask you whether your hearts are perfect--they are not! I do
   not ask you whether your hearts never go astray, for they are prone to
   wander. But I do ask you--Is your heart resting upon Jesus Christ? Is
   it a believing heart? Does your heart meditate upon Divine things? Does
   it find its best solace there? Is your heart a humble heart? Are you
   constrained to ascribe all to Sovereign Grace? Is your heart a holy
   heart? Do you desire holiness? Do you find your pleasure in it? Is your
   heart bold for God? Does your heart ascribe praises to God? Is it a
   grateful heart? And is it a heart that is wholly fixed upon God,
   desiring never to go astray?

   If it is, then you have marks of election. Search for these and add to
   all your searching this prayer, "Search me, O God and know my heart:
   try me and know my ways. And see if there is any wicked way in me and
   lead me in the way everlasting." Let me beseech you to pray God to pull
   your comforts into pieces if they are false comforts. I have conjured
   my God on bended knee full often to let me know the worst of my case.
   And if I am deluded, deceived, or deceiving, I do pray Him to tear the
   bandage from my eyes and take away every balm from my wounded heart
   except the balm of Gilead and never to let me rest till I am soundly
   grounded and bottomed on Christ Jesus and nowhere else but there!

   Do make sure work in this case. If you must have "buts," and "ifs," and
   "perhaps"--have them about your estates and your property, but not
   about your souls. May the Holy Spirit help you to be often using the
   crucible to see whether your profession is true gold or not.

   III. The third point is a very interesting one. It is MANIFESTATION, or
   the way in which the elect of God are made apparent to ourselves and
   others. We cannot see the hearts of our fellow men and therefore the
   heart can never be to us the way of distinguishing the elect of
   God--except so far as it is seen in acts and words.

   Now the first sign by which this election was made known to David
   himself, and to a few others who probably did not know much about it,
   was by his being anointed. Samuel took a horn of oil and poured it on
   David. I do not think Jesse knew the full meaning of it. I feel sure
   that the seven brothers did not, for if they had, someone or other
   would have told Saul. Master Trapp says seven can only keep a secret
   when six of them know nothing about it. I am inclined to think that
   though they saw him anointed with oil they could not bring themselves
   to think that such a despised one as David was really anointed for the
   kingdom.

   They saw the symbol, but probably did not understand the inward grace.
   But David did. David knew that he was now to be a king and though he
   never stretched out a hand or lifted a finger to get that throne for
   himself--though he often spared his enemy, Saul, when killing him might
   have brought him suddenly to the crown--yet he knew that he should one
   day reign over Israel. Beloved, there is a season when God anoints His
   people. They have believed, but there may elapse a little time between
   the believing and the conscious anointing.

   But suddenly, when the Lord has illuminated their hearts to know and
   understand Divine things clearly, the Spirit of God comes with a
   sealing power upon them and from that day forward they rejoice to know
   that they have the indwelling of the Spirit and that they are set apart
   for God! I pray that some of you who have been lately converted may get
   your sealing from this day forward. If you shall receive it, you will
   be different men and women from what you were. Already saved by Grace,
   you will then begin to feel that force and power and vigor which
   renders the man of faith the master of the world!

   If you are anointed you will feel the royal blood within your veins! As
   yet you do not know your kingship, but if the Spirit of God shall
   descend upon you in plenteous measure, you will know your dignity and
   you will act like kings, reigning over inbred sins and seeking, as much
   as lies in you, to exercise the royal priesthood which the Master has
   conferred upon you. This inward sealing may be recognized among the
   saints--a few may be able to see in you the sealing-- do not expect
   that many will, for it is only to yourself that it becomes the
   infallible witness that you are ONE OF God's elect.

   The manifestation, however, went on in another way. After the anointing
   it appears that David became a man distinguished for the valor of his
   deeds. Saul's servant in recommending him says of him, that he was "a
   mighty valiant man and a man of war." Your election will be discovered
   by this--you will do what others cannot do. An elect soul, when the
   Spirit of God is upon him, can answer that question, "What do you do
   more than others?" Not proudly, but still calmly he can say--"There are
   many things which others do not and cannot do, which are easy to me
   through Christ who strengthens me." You will be able now, dear Friends,
   to break through the toils of custom--to wrestle with the lion of
   worldliness, to exhibit patience under suffering--to forgive your worst
   enemy without difficulty, to serve God in deeds of faith!

   You will be able, in His strength, to be content to see your good name
   trod in the ditch if you may exalt Christ. Through the Holy Spirit you
   will do and dare where others are sluggishly cowards! You will dash
   forward to the conflict expecting the victory because God is with
   you--or you will be willing to suffer because the Lord has strengthened
   you to bear all things for His sake! Your election will be best known
   to your fellow men by your deeds of valor. It appears, too, that David
   was very prudent. The same witness-bearer said he was, "a man prudent
   in matters." Such will you be, when, as the elect of God the Spirit of
   Wisdom rests upon you.

   You will not be in a hurry--you have nothing to gain! You will not be
   alarmed--you have nothing to lose! You have God and therefore you have
   all things! You cannot lose your God and therefore you can lose
   nothing. And being in no hurry you will have time to judge and weigh
   matters. "He that believes shall not make haste." Life will be with you
   no confused scramble. You will not be blundering out of one error, into
   another because you will take your matters before God in prayer. You
   will consult the oracle and your heart will be guided of the Lord. You
   will, if you live near to God, know when you come to a point of
   difficulty which way to turn. You will hear a voice which says, "This
   is the way, walk in it."

   You will know, when you come to a difficulty where human wisdom is
   utterly worthless, how to fall flat on your face and wait until the
   strong arm comes to deliver you. You will be taught in the things of
   God and bold to teach others also and so, daily your election will be
   made known to your fellow men. Mark well that one of the ways by which
   your election will become clear and sure to all God's people will be
   this--if you are anointed king as David was before you, you will come
   into conflict with Saul! It cannot be possible that the chosen of God
   shall forever live in peace with the heirs of Hell.

   He who put an enmity between the Seed of the woman and the seed of the
   serpent takes care that that old enmity shall never die. The two first
   men of woman born were enemies of one another for this reason and until
   Christ shall come that same enmity will exist. Saul may like you for a
   little time if you can play well upon an instrument and drive away his
   melancholy. But when Saul finds you out and discovers you to be the
   anointed king, he will hurl his javelin at you! The world is very
   satisfied with some ministers and with some Christians because they
   very much resemble itself--but as soon as the world finds out, "this is
   a man separate from us, of a different nature and of a different
   country"--it cannot but hate the man! It MUST do so!

   Do you expect the world's good word? Then go your way and flatter it
   and bow to it and cringe and be its servant and you shall have your
   reward in everlasting contempt! But are you willing to take your lot
   outside the camp with Jesus and to be recognized as being not of this
   world because He has chosen you out of the world? Then expect to
   receive hard measures! Expect to be misconstrued and misrepresented and
   to be despised! Your reward shall be when He comes and that reward
   shall outweigh all that you endure here below.

   I think David was never more clearly manifested to be God's elect than
   at the last when he was an outlaw. He never seems such a grand man as
   when he is among the tracks of the wild goats of Engedi. Never so great
   as when he is passing through the wilderness while Saul is hunting him,
   or standing at midnight over the sleeping form of his enemy and saying,
   "I will not touch him, for he is the Lord's Anointed." We do not read
   of many faults and slips and errors then! The outlawed David is most
   certainly manifested to all Israel to be the chosen of God because the
   chosen of man cannot abide him.

   The happiest and best days, I believe, with the people of God are when
   they are most outlawed by men! When they are put out of the synagogue
   and when he that would kill them thinks that he did God a service. The
   brightest days for Christian piety were the days of martyrdom and
   persecution. Scotland has many saints, but she never has had such rich
   saints as those who lived in covenanting times! England has had many
   rich Divines who have taught the Word, but the Puritanical age was the
   golden age of England's Christian literature! Depend upon it--you will
   find in your own life you may have many days of Heaven upon earth--but
   the place of persecution and rejection will be the spot where Jesus
   Christ manifests Himself most to you.

   Are you resolved not to be conformed to this world? Are you willing to
   bear with Christ the brunt of the battle and like the living fish to
   swim against the stream? Are you ready to stand out like the other holy
   children in the days of Nebuchadnezzar and to say, like the Apostles in
   the days of the high priests, "Whether it is right to serve God or men,
   you judge"? Have you cast off the fear of man? Have you taken up the
   Cross to wear as your best and greatest ornament and treasure? If so,
   you are giving the very best evidence of having been chosen out of the
   world because you are not of the world.

   Remember, to conclude, that after all conflicts were over, David was
   crowned. All Israel and all Judah sent to fetch David and they made him
   king! Amidst the blast of the horns and the homage and songs and joy of
   the people, David, the elected one, was publicly recognized. The crown
   was put upon his head. The imperial mantle graces his person! He signed
   the decrees and his word was law from Dan to Beersheba. The day comes
   when the like shall be true of the mean and the most despised of God's
   chosen! "Truly," said the Apostle, "it does not yet appear"--we cannot
   see it, only faith can discern it, but it shall appear--it comes! The
   appearing draws near! Our head shall yet wear the crown for we shall
   reign with Christ Jesus!

   I think even this earth which has despised us, shall yet know us as
   kings when we shall reign with Him. We shall yet put on the imperial
   purple. From the river, even to the ends of the earth, the saints shall
   possess the kingdom. And when Jesus comes to judge the people, we shall
   judge angels, sitting as assessors with Him, giving our verdict and
   adding our "Amens" to all His sentences. No, even in Heaven itself,
   angels shall be our servitors. They shall be ministering spirits to the
   heirs of salvation and we shall sit upon thrones. Oh, Christian, you
   know not the pomp which shall yet surround you! You have had some
   glimmering thought of the Savior's Glory and the Savior's dignity, but
   have you not forgotten that all this is yours?

   Remember, we shall be like He when we shall see Him as He is. "Father,
   I will that they whom You have given Me be with Me where I am." The
   same place for you as for the Savior! And you shall behold His Glory
   and you shall be partakers of it! Why, then, should you fear? Why
   should you be downcast and dismayed by reason of the trials on the way?
   Come! Pluck up courage! An hour with your God will make up for it all.
   One glimpse of Him and what will persecution seem? You have been called
   ugly names. Ill words have been pelted at you--but what will they be
   when you shall hear Him say, "Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit
   the kingdom prepared for you from before the foundation of the world" ?

   There! The world's thunder is gone like a whisper amidst the more
   glorious roll of angelic acclamations and the hiss of enmity is all
   forgotten amidst the kiss of love which the Savior gives to all His
   faithful ones. Cheered by the reward, I pray you press forward! Greater
   riches than all the treasures of Egypt shall you have who can renounce
   all for Christ's sake! "Be you faithful unto death and He will give you
   a crown of life." God grant that we may all be found numbered among the
   elect of Divine Grace and none of us be cast away and His shall be the
   praise forever and ever. Amen.

                                    Zealots

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JULY 16, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE
   METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   Simon called the Zealot." Luke 6:15.

   SIMON called the Zealot has apparently two surnames in Scripture but
   they mean the same thing. He is called Simon the Canaanite in
   Hebrew--not because he was an inhabitant of Cana or a Canaanite, but
   that word, when interpreted, means precisely the same as the Greek
   word, Zelotes. He was called Simon the Zealot. I suppose that he had
   this name before his conversion. It is thought by some that he was a
   member of that very fierce and fanatical political sect of the Jews
   called the Zealots, by whose means the siege of Jerusalem was rendered
   so much more bloody than it would have been.

   But this does not seem very probable, for the sect of the Zealots had
   scarcely arisen in the time of the Savior. And therefore we are
   inclined to think with Hackett in his exposition of the Acts, that he
   was so called because of his zealous attachment to his religion as a
   Jew. There were some in the different classes of Jewish society who
   were so excessively full of zeal as to gain the name of zealot. But it
   strikes me that he must have been a zealot after conversion, too, for
   within that sacred circle which surrounded our Lord, every word was
   truth and the Master would not have allowed any of His disciples to
   have worn a surname which was not expressive or truthful.

   He was Simon the Zealot while in the darkness and blindness of his mind
   he knew not the Messiah. He surely could not have been less Simon the
   Zealot when, gifted with the Holy Spirit, he went forth to cast out
   devils, heal the sick and to proclaim that the kingdom of Heaven was at
   hand. I should be glad if many among us would earn the same title by so
   living that men would call us zealots, or even "fanatics," for this is
   so sleepy an age concerning religious things, that to be called
   fanatic, nowadays, is one of the highest honors a man can have
   conferred upon him! May we so act and live that we might truthfully
   wear the title of Christian zealots.

   We shall occupy your time, this morning first of all by some like
   description of the unconverted zealot and then, secondly, by some few
   remarks upon the Christian zealot.

   I. LET US PORTRAY THE UNCONVERTED ZEALOT. Zeal frequently expends
   itself on other things than religion. You will find many zealots not
   religious in any sense of the word. We have seen lately a few political
   zealots. The one important matter of their lives is the defense of the
   Whig or the Tory interest. It appears as if they would sacrifice their
   business, no, in their furor they think everything a trifle so long as
   they can but vindicate some favorite opinion. Such was Saul, the king
   of Israel. He was such a zealot for Israel and for Judah that in his
   zeal he slew the Gibeonites.

   He was politically a zealot. He thought that the Gibeonites, being in
   the land, ate the bread which belonged to the sons of Israel and
   occupied the cities which belonged to the tribe of Benjamin. Therefore,
   violating all covenants and solemn oaths--and bringing upon the nation
   a great judgment--he slew the Gibeonites. Many are scientific zealots.
   They will sacrifice health in sitting over mixtures of deleterious
   drugs to examine chemical combinations. Or they will pass through
   feverish countries among savage men to discover the source of a river,
   or measure the height of a mountain.

   We can readily find business zealots--their shop windows scarcely need
   shutters, for business is never over. Sunday itself is not enclosed for
   worship. They steal that day for keeping their books. They make haste
   to be rich and they are not innocent. They plunge into this speculation
   and the other. They often bring their bodies to sickness and their
   minds to madness in their zeal for riches. You do not find that the
   world cries out against zeal in business and in science and in
   politics!

   No, men can admire it there, but the moment you bring it into the court
   of the Lord's House, then straightway they hold up their hands with
   astonishment, or open their mouths with blasphemy! Men cannot endure
   that we should make eternal things real and spend our strength for
   them. They would have us reserve our energies for the matters in which
   they take so deep an interest. Brethren, we would not condemn the use
   of zeal in the common affairs of life, for zeal is essential to
   success. We only wish that Christians would copy worldly men and be
   half as earnest and half as ambitions to maintain and increase the
   kingdom of their Lord and Master as some men are after petty trifles or
   selfish aggrandizements.

   Understand, then, that a man may be a zealot and yet there may not be a
   trace of religion in him for his zeal may run in quite a different
   channel. The unconverted zealot, should his zeal expend itself upon
   religion, is generally exceedingly boastful. Look at Jehu, as he bids
   Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, ride with him in his chariot
   vain-gloriously exclaiming, "Come with me and see my zeal for the
   Lord." He cannot kill the worshippers of Baal without someone standing
   by to admire how he devotes himself entirely to Jehovah. Unconverted
   men, when full of zeal, are almost all Jehus. They must have some
   admiring eyes. The clap of approbation is essential to the life and
   vigor of their earnestness.

   Not so the true Christian! He is as zealous for his Master when he
   stands alone or in the midst of derision as in the time when religion
   is honorable. Let us take care to ever avoid all boastfulness! Let us
   serve our Master as Jehu did and better than he, but let us never say,
   "Come, see my zeal for the Lord."

   As you travel over the mountains and become thirsty you look for the
   cooling stream. But the traveler who has often passed the hills never
   stoops to drink of the little streamlets which run uncovered down the
   mountain side--he knows that their exposure to the heat of the sun has
   warmed the water and taken away its grateful freshness and coolness! He
   looks for the trickling rill which gushes fresh from the rock or
   bubbles up as a spring, or has found its way under the moss and great
   stones all hidden from the light. He loves to satisfy himself there!

   It is thus with our gifts and graces. If we expose them to public view
   they lose their acceptability with the Most High God. But if we keep
   ourselves as much as possible from all ostentation and seek to serve
   God humbly and quietly, Jehovah Himself finds delight in the gracious
   works of His own beloved people. May the Lord keep us, then, from being
   boastful zealots! The unconverted zealot is generally an ignorant
   zealot. "I bear them witness," says Paul, "that they have a zeal for
   God, but not according to knowledge."

   The Pharisees were very fanatical. They were ignorant of God's
   righteousness and they went about to establish their own. They had not
   learned the feebleness of the principle of the Law, and therefore they
   struggled on and on to attain eternal life by it. They did not know the
   force and strength of the great principle of Divine Grace working
   through faith and therefore they neglected it--and with all their
   struggling they came short of the kingdom of Heaven. Let us beware of
   an ignorant zeal. How much there is of it nowadays. Probably there is
   more zeal to be found among the professors of false doctrine than among
   the followers of the Truth!

   How they will garnish their churches as of old the Pharisees garnished
   their sepulchers! How diligently will they bedeck their altars and load
   them with ornaments and millinery! To what an extent of effort do they
   go! What asceticism will they practice! What infamy, what abuse are
   they not willing to endure in defending the cause of their idols and
   bringing back again the old superstitions of Rome! If those who are
   orthodox had as much zeal as the Papist and the Puseyite, it would be
   well for England. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, shun an ignorant zeal! And
   at the same time labor to blend zeal with your knowledge lest your
   knowledge, lacking force, should cease to be operative in the land!

   Let it be forever remembered that if we are ever so zealous in a wrong
   faith, that zeal does not make the false true nor make us right in its
   prosecution. I may drink poison, devoutly believing it will do me good,
   but it will poison me, no matter what I believe! And so I may believe a
   lie ever so earnestly, but it will be a lie nevertheless and the poison
   of the lie will work my soul's ruin just as surely as if I had not been
   so fervent in its belief.

   Do not believe in the idea that every man who is sincere in his
   religion will be right at last. Not so. If a man is sincere and travels
   due North he will not reach a town in the South--and if he spurs his
   horse ever so much towards the East, he will not arrive at his
   destination, if that destination is a city in the West. Seek to be
   right. Get an understanding of the Truth as God has revealed
   it--otherwise all your zeal will be but wildfire which will do mischief
   rather than good. The zeal of unconverted men is generally partial. It
   may be a zeal for something good, but not for everything that is good.

   How zealous the Pharisee was for frequent ablutions--he would not eat
   bread, if ever so hungry--till he had washed his hands. How excessively
   zealous he was to tithe the mint--it did not come to three farthings in
   a year--and the anise and the cummin--all these little matters must be
   attended to! I think I see the man looking earnestly while he strains
   at the gnat! How he shudders lest by any means that horrid and
   monstrous insect should get into his wine! If it should possibly go
   down his throat, what pollution he would incur!

   But mark the hypocrite as he turns his head the other way and he
   swallows a camel in the twinkling of an eye! While he can pay his mint
   and his anise and his cummin in full tithe, he can at the same time
   devour a widow's house and cry out against the Lord of Life and Glory
   and plot and plan against the Savior till he has dragged Him to the
   Cross! This is the unconverted zealot! Zealous he is for sect and party
   when the whole that the sect may hold is not of more value than the
   gnat and yet great fundamental doctrinal Truths of God are forgotten,
   as though they were of no value whatever. Brethren, may we be earnest
   men of God, but I pray that we may be zealous for all the Truth of God!

   We must count no Truth of God to be despicable, but take the whole Word
   of God as far as the Spirit of God shall reveal it unto us and stand up
   for it in its entirety and completeness--and not be willing that the
   very least of Christ's Commandments should be neglected or despised.
   The zealot, again, while unconverted, is generally, (if it is in his
   power), a persecutor. "Concerning zeal, persecuting the Church." Paul
   verily thought that he was doing God a service when he drove men and
   women to prison and to death. And I doubt not there are many in this
   age most sincere zealots, who, if they would not quite delight in the
   sweet sacrifices of Smithfield, would, at any rate, like to pass a few
   repressive laws to put down "those wicked Dissenters" and ordain one or
   two salutary penalties by which "those quarrelsome Baptists" might have
   their tongues clipped a little shorter--that they might not speak out
   quite so plainly concerning the infamies of the State Church!

   Doubtless there is a tendency with us all to wish to impose our own
   opinions upon others by all available means. The exaggeration of
   anxiety for our fellow men would lead us to adopt wrong means to make
   them of a right opinion! We forget that men's consciences and judgments
   are never touched by such rude or vulgar means as threats or penalties.
   We should always feel that consciences and hearts are under the
   jurisdiction of the Most High and in no sense whatever are they to be
   brought under the jurisdiction of Pope or potentate, or of any of us,
   no matter how orthodox we may conceive ourselves to be. Strive
   earnestly for your faith, but strive lawfully. Contend zealously for
   the Truth, but let the only fire you use be love and the only sword the
   sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.

   But zealots without Grace are generally persecutors. Without Divine
   Grace zealots are very bitter towards their professed Brethren. We read
   in the Epistle of the Apostle James of some who were full of strife and
   envy and were yet members of the Church. From such zeal may the Lord of
   Hosts deliver us! Our Brethren in the fellowship with us are not to be
   convinced of their errors by being knocked on the head, but by having
   the candle held to their eyes. If we can teach them the Truth as it is
   in Jesus, it shall be well. But as for carnal contention and
   persecution--let it be far from us.

   This picture of the zealot without Christ is not complete unless we
   remark that often his aims are sinister. We read of some in the Epistle
   to the Corinthians who did zealously affect the Corinthians, but not
   well, for they slandered the Apostle Paul. They denied his Apostleship.
   They said that his bodily presence was weak and his speech was
   contemptible. And yet they appeared very zealous, indeed--far more
   zealous than Paul--because they wanted to alienate the mind of the
   Corinthian Church from the Apostle and get themselves to be made
   masters in God's heritage. Let us beware of a zeal for lifting up
   ourselves.

   Brethren, if we preach Christ with a view to get ourselves honored by
   it we prostitute the sacred things of God and are guilty of that very
   sin which was accursed in Belshazzar, when he took the golden cups of
   the sanctuary to drink in them to his own delight. Zeal must be pure.
   It may be fire, but it must be fire from off the altar or else if we
   minister with any other fire, like Nadab and Abihu, we may be slain
   before the Lord. O that we would search our heart so as to be quite
   sure that we have no aim in all the world but Christ--"God forbid that
   I should glory save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ."

   You may shoot well, you brave archers, but if you aim at the wrong
   target you will not win the prize. If you aim at anything but your
   Lord's honor you shall never hear it said, "Well done, good and
   faithful servant." To close this very sorry account of the unconverted
   zealot--he is generally but temporary in his zeal. If the zeal is good,
   it dies out before long. The Apostle Paul says, "It is good to be
   zealously affected always in a good thing." Some of you are mightily
   zealous at a Prayer Meeting and grow intensely warm-hearted after a
   season of revival--you are consecrated to God most marvelously for a
   month or two! You live consistently for a few weeks--you are diligent
   in the use of the means of Grace for a short time.

   And then--well, you have had enough of it, I suppose, and you think
   enough to be as good as a feast and so you would have done with
   heavenly things--the wind blows from another quarter and therefore,
   like the weathercock, you are turned by it in another way. Some of you
   would go to Heaven, but you get plucked by the sleeve Hell-wards and
   cannot bear a hard pull--and so you turn away from Christ. One would
   think when you are sick that you were ripe for Heaven, but when you get
   well, ah, how different! "When he was sick," says an old legend, "the
   devil a monk would be," but when he got well you know how he gave up
   his fine intentions.

   There are many now of the same sort. For a time they threaten to take
   the kingdom by storm! They censoriously rebuke the coldness of others.
   They vow to conquer Hell and enter Heaven, pushing the world before
   them and dragging the Church after them! But in a short time where are
   they? They have relapsed into their former lethargy, or perhaps they
   have taken their zeal with them into the camp of the adversary. Such is
   the unconverted zealot.

   Suffer two or three more words before we leave him. There is much about
   him to imitate. Unconverted as he is, mischievous as his zeal may
   be--if we could pluck that sword out of his hand--of how great a use
   might it be to us! If sinners are zealous in their sins, should not
   saints be zealous for their God? If the things of time can stir the
   human passions, should not the realities of eternity have a greater and
   more tremendously moving force? If these men will spend and be spent,
   and stretch every nerve and run the race merely for the crown of
   politics or of ambition, where are we? What idlers, what laggards we
   are that we pursue the things of God with but half a heart!--

   "Dear Lord and shall we always live At this poor dying rate?"

   Bear this other word, also, namely that we ought to look upon these
   zealots with hopefulness. When a man serves Baal thoroughly, it is a
   great pity and a thing to be deplored. But I think he is a man worth
   catching and to be sought after. We know a sort of people who will
   never make much at anything. They are not very forward in sin. The
   devil himself cannot respect them much, they are such poor servants to
   him. If they ever become Christians, into the rear rank they must go.
   They need to be pressed forward and receive from the strength of the
   Church, for they can never impart power to it.

   But when you get a man who is vigorous in the cause of Satan and when
   Sovereign Grace brings him down--what a trophy he becomes of its power
   and how gloriously he contends for the Gospel of Christ! Look at Saul
   of Tarsus! No man more zealous against the Gospel than he, and he is
   second to none when he becomes a preacher of the Word! Look at John
   Bunyan on the village green--never second, always the leader! Whether
   it was the game of cat on Sunday, or ringing the Church bells, or
   blasphemy--he was a prince in the devil's camp! And when he became a
   Christian there was none like John Bunyan in thundering out the Law, or
   preaching--fearless of pains and penalties--the Gospel of our Lord
   Jesus Christ.

   Master Bunyan says in his "Grace Abounding" that he was very hopeful
   for England because the young men of his age were so very bad, since if
   God would convert them, they would make such good Christians by-and-by.
   And I feel a little of his mind--when I see a man come in here who is
   known to be a down-right sinner, I hope he may make an upright saint.
   Some have come in here who have been ringleaders and have exceeded
   others in their sin, but instead of saying, "Their case is hopeless," I
   have thought--now let us pray with might and main that Sovereign Grace
   may overcome his sin--who knows what he may be able to accomplish for
   the Church if he is converted?

   II. Now for a more pleasing picture, namely, THE TRUE CHRISTIAN
   ZEALOT--how his zeal manifests itself, how it is kept up, and what is
   to be said in commendation of it. The Christian zealot--how his zeal
   manifests itself! First, it manifests itself in his private dealings
   with God. The unconverted zealot is a hypocrite--he does not come to
   God in private. He may use a form of private prayer, but he has no true
   communion with God alone. The unconverted zealot has a religion on the
   surface, but there is no Divine Grace within.

   How different is it with the Christian! That is a remarkable passage in
   the Revelation where zeal is coupled with repentance. "Be zealous,
   therefore, and repent." I may take this as an indication that when a
   true Christian is zealous he is zealous in repentance--his tears come
   welling up from his heart! Sin is not a little distasteful, but is
   exceedingly disgusting to him. His faith, too, is not merely a
   trembling recognition of the Truth of God, but it is a firm grasp of
   everlasting verities. The Christian zealot, when he is alone with God,
   throws his whole heart into his service. Whatever may be the Grace
   which is in exercise, he seeks to have it thoroughly and actively at
   work.

   If his heart is given to God, it is a heart full of holy fire, like a
   sacred censer. If he devotes himself in private to any hallowed deed of
   fellowship or communion with God, his heart wanders not--or if it
   wanders, he contends with it until he has bound it with cords--even
   with cords to the horns of the altar! Brothers and Sisters, I wish you
   and I were more zealous! Alas, I have to complain of myself that when I
   try to pray, full often I cannot. When I would do good in the closet,
   evil is present with me. I wish I had power to walk with God as Enoch
   did, but the cares of the Church, let alone the vanities of life, will
   creep in and the soul comes out of the closet unrefreshed, very much
   because it has had no zeal in its closet exercises.

   The true Christian zealot seeks, above all things, to make his private
   religion intensely energetic, knowing that it is the vital point of
   godliness. The Christian zealot may be recognized very manifestly by
   his prayers. Hear his utterances in the Prayer Meeting. It is no
   repetition of a set of sacred phrases, no going over the metaphors
   which have become time-worn and tedious--he prays like a man who means
   it--he comes up to Heaven's gate, grasps the knocker and knocks and
   knocks and knocks again, waiting until the door is opened! He gets hold
   of the gates of Heaven and labors to shake them to and fro as though he
   would pull them up--bolts and bars and all, as Samson did the gates of
   Gaza--rather than not prevail with God.

   These men, like Elijah, have power to shut up Heaven or to open its
   gates. Oh, that we had more of such in our midst! We have a few who, as
   soon as they stand up to pray, fire our hearts by their
   earnestness--may they be multiplied! The like is true, of course, of
   the private prayers of the Christian as well as of his public ones. Oh,
   Brothers and Sisters, we need more resolve when we go before God that
   we will have the blessing! We need more determination that we are
   asking what is according to His mind and we will take no denial, but
   will say to the angel, "I will not let You go except You bless me."
   Christians, seek to be zealots in prayer--pouring out your hearts like
   water before the Lord and crying out with sighs and tears till, like
   your Master, you have been heard in that which you have petitioned.

   But the zealot does not stop here. The Christian zealot is manifested
   in his jealousy for God's honor. The word jealous in its sound and
   sense is akin to the word zealous. Hear how Elijah uses it. He says, "I
   have been very jealous for the Lord God of Hosts." He saw Baal
   worshipped everywhere throughout Israel and his heart was ready to
   break. So the stern old man said, "Let me die--I am no better than my
   fathers." How sternly he slew Baal's priests! What a spectacle was that
   when, after having mocked them because no fire came on their sacrifice,
   he stretched out his hands and cried, "Let it be known who is God"! And
   when the flame had come and his own sacrifice had been consumed, he
   said with a rough voice, "Take the Prophets of Baal. Let not one of
   them escape."

   Here was zeal for the Lord of Hosts springing from an awful
   overwhelming jealousy for God's honor and a hatred of the idols which
   usurped His Throne. See the same in Moses. With holy jealousy he dashes
   the tablets of stone upon the ground, takes the golden calf, grinds it
   to powder and makes a rebellious people drink of the bitter draught.
   Look at Phineas, again, when he saw the people committing adultery as a
   part of the unclean rites with which they worshipped the gods of Moab!
   He seized a javelin and ran them through--and so it is said the zeal of
   Phineas made an atonement before the Lord.

   We want something of that kind--a zeal for God which will smite all
   error with a ruthless hand! The iconoclastic zeal which will break to
   pieces images of silver and of gold, however prettily they may be cast
   or engraved--which will tear down the toys of Popery and tread the
   whole in the mire as things worse than worthless because they come in
   the way of the Lord God of Hosts. Away with the softness which will not
   let some of my brethren denounce an error lest they should violate
   charity! The velvet in their mouths prevents their dealing with
   Antichrist as it ought to be dealt with. The day is come in which the
   Romish and Anglican Antichrists are to have no tender words used
   towards them!

   It must be war to the knife for God and for His Truth against the lie
   which in modern times has impudence enough to show its face again--I
   mean the lie that the sacrament can save--that Baptism can regenerate,
   or that the Lord's Supper is a channel of salvation! Up with Divine
   Grace and down with Sacramentarianism! Up with the Truths of God
   forever and down with falsehood! A man is no zealot and cannot be
   called Zelotes unless he has a holy jealousy for the honor of Christ
   and His crown and His Truth!

   Nor is this all. True zeal will show itself in the abundance of a man's
   labors and gifts. Paul commends the zeal of the Corinthians because
   they were always ready to minister to his necessities. He says,
   "Concerning the ministering of the saints, you have no need that I
   speak unto you." Zeal labors for Christ. My Brethren, if you want a
   picture of zeal, take the Apostle. How he compasses sea and land!
   Storms cannot stop him! Mountains cannot impede his progress! He is
   beaten with rods, he is stoned--he is cast into prison--but the
   invincible hero of the Cross presses on in the holy war until he is
   taken up to receive a crown of glory! We do little or nothing, the most
   of us--we fritter away our time. O that we could live while we live!

   But our existence--that is all we can call it--our existence, what a
   poor thing it is! We run like shallow streams-- we have not force
   enough to turn the mill of industry and have not depth enough to bear
   the vessel of progress! We have not flood enough to cheer the mends of
   poverty. We are dry too often in the summer's drought and we are frozen
   in the winter's cold. O that we might become broad and deep like the
   mighty stream that bears a navy and gladdens a nation! O that we may
   become inexhaustible and permanent rivers of usefulness through the
   abundant springs from where our supply comes--even the Spirit of the
   living God!

   The Christian zealot may be known by the anguish which his soul feels
   when his labors for Christ are not success-ful--the tears that channel
   his cheeks when sinners are not saved! Do not tell me of zeal that only
   moves the tongue, or the foot, or the hand! We must have a zeal which
   moves the whole heart! We cannot advance so far as the Savior's bloody
   sweat--but to something like it the Christian ought to attain when he
   sees the tremendous clouds of sin and the tempest of God's gathering
   wrath! How can I see souls damned, without emotion? How can I hear
   Christ's name blasphemed, without a shudder? How can I think of the
   multitudes who prefer ruin to salvation, without a pang?

   Believe me, Brothers and Sisters, if you never have sleepless hours, if
   you never have weeping eyes, if your hearts never swell as if they
   would burst, you need not anticipate that you will be called zealous!
   You do not know the beginning of true zeal, for the foundation of
   Christian zeal lies in the heart. The heart must be heavy with grief
   and yet must beat high with holy ardor! The heart must be vehement in
   desire, panting continually for God's Glory, or else we shall never
   attain to anything like the zeal which God would have us know.

   And to close this point of how zeal manifests itself, let me say that
   it is always seen, where it is genuine, in a vehement love and
   attachment to the Person of the Savior. This is why we have not more
   zeal--because often the Christ preached is not a personal Christ. Have
   not I frequently said in this pulpit that nothing can make a man
   zealous like attachment to a person? When Napoleon's soldiers won so
   many victories, and especially in the earlier part of his career, when
   against such deadly odds they earned such splendid triumphs, what was
   the reason?

   The "little corporal" was there, and whenever it came to a desperate
   rush he was the first to cross the bridge or charge the enemy, always
   exposing himself to danger. And their attachment to his person and
   their love and admiration of his valor made them follow at his heels,
   swift to victory! Have not we heard of those who threw themselves in
   the way of the cannon ball to save his life? There could not have been
   such triumphs if there had not been a man who knew how to govern men by
   attaching them to himself.

   And oh, the Person of the Savior! What attachment can there be equal to
   that which binds a Christian to his Lord? What person can there ever be
   out of whose lips come such golden chains to bind all hearts? When we
   see Him our hearts glow with sacred fervor! When we think of Him our
   soul is all on fire! What can we not do in His Presence? What will we
   not suffer when He cheers us? There are no impossibilities--no, even
   difficulties have ceased to be when Jesus Christ shall come and our
   hearts are full of love to Him! It is a constant and unfailing sign of
   a true zealot that his attachment to his Master's Person is deep and
   fervent and he cannot forget Him who redeemed him by blood.

   This brings us now, in the next place, to think awhile of how this zeal
   is maintained and kept up. To keep up a good fire of zeal we must have
   much fuel. The fire will partake of the quality of the fuel so that it
   must be good firing to make holy zeal. If I understand aright, zeal is
   the fruit of the Holy Spirit and genuine zeal draws its life and vital
   force from the continued operations of the Holy Spirit in the soul.
   Next to this, zeal feeds upon truths like these--it is stirred by the
   ruin of sinners. The very sight of sinners makes a right-hearted man
   zealous for their conversion.

   Ride mile after mile through our streets. Turn down the narrower
   streets, enter the courts, go down the alleys--do not be disgusted with
   those tumbling houses--go in and go upstairs! See how many there are in
   one room. Mark what poverty, what squalor, what filth! Go into certain
   quarters and see what ignorance, what crime! I think the city
   missionary has constantly before him enough to keep his zeal at fever
   heat and if we, ourselves, went more often into some of the lowest dens
   of this huge city we should go back to our closets, crying, "Gracious
   God! I have not thought of these people as I ought to do, for instead
   of being up and doing with all my might, I have been trifling and
   wasting my time."

   Well, but what is London? This nation of London--what is it? It is only
   a drop in the bucket compared with the millions that are still in
   darkness. Let any man think upon Hindustan. Let him reflect, if he
   will, upon China. Let him take any one country and consider that there
   is not a missionary to a million in many of those places and that the
   missionaries who are there might, many of them, as well have been at
   home--for they are missionaries who Christianize people by baptizing
   them and know little about the Spirit's work upon the soul!

   What is said about many of the converts made by mere ritual preaching
   and by baptismal ceremonies? Why it is well known that in some parts of
   heathendom the worst scoundrels are the nominal Christians--the reason
   being because they were not made Christians by being converted--but by
   being baptized and so an indelible dishonor is put upon Christ by
   carrying on missionary operations on the principle of baptizing people
   who are not Christians and labeling them the people of Christ while in
   their hearts they are more deceitful than the heathen themselves! We
   must think only of the need there is for a sound, honest preaching of
   the Gospel--the preaching of the doctrines which really do change the
   soul-- and the coming down of the Holy Spirit to deal personally with
   individuals.

   All wholesale conversion of tribes and nations by calling them
   Christians when they are merely civilized is an evil and an
   abomination! The needs of the age are enough, if a man has any sense of
   what eternal realities are, to make us zealous--zealous to the highest
   pitch. And next, Christian zeal feeds itself upon a sense of
   gratitude--

   "Loved of my God, for Him again, With love intense I burn, Chosen of
   Him before time began, I choose Him in return."

   Look to the hole of the pit from where you were dug and you will see
   abundant reason why you should spend and be spent for God! Zeal for God
   feeds itself upon the thought of the eternal future. It looks with
   tearful eyes down to the flames of Hell and it cannot slumber--it looks
   up with anxious gaze to the glories of Heaven and it cannot but bestir
   itself. Zeal for God thinks of death and hears the hoofs of the white
   horse with the skeleton rider close behind. Zeal for God feels that all
   it can do is little compared with what is needed, and that time is
   short compared with the work to be done--and therefore it devotes all
   that it has to the cause of its Lord.

   Above all, zeal for God feeds itself on love to Christ. Lady
   Powerscourt says somewhere, "If we want to be thoroughly hot with zeal,
   we must go near to the furnace of the Savior's love." Get to know how
   Christ loved you and you cannot but love Him! Do but know how He was
   spit upon and despised and how He bled and died for us and we cannot
   but feel that we can do and bear all things for His name's sake. Above
   all, Christian zeal must be sustained by a vigorous inner life. If we
   let our inner life dwindle, if it begins to be dwarfish--if our heart
   beats slowly before God--we shall not know zeal! But if all is strong
   and vigorous within, then we cannot but feel a loving anxiety to see
   the kingdom of Christ come and His will done on earth, even as it is in
   Heaven.

   I have to close by commending zeal. Let my words be few, but let them
   be weighty here. In commending zeal, let me say I think it should
   commend itself to every Christian man and woman without a word of mine.
   But if you must have it, remember that God Himself is zealous. We read
   that when Christ comes as the Wonderful, the Counselor, the Mighty God,
   the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace, then the government is to
   be upon His shoulders and of His kingdom there is to be no end. But
   Scripture adds, "The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this."

   God has been zealous in judgment. Ezekiel tells us that God was zealous
   when He came forth to destroy His foes, but oh, how zealous He is in
   Divine Grace! It is a wonderful thing that we should use such language,
   but the Scripture is our warrant! When God puts His hands to the work
   of saving the elect He is filled with zeal! There is no slumber, no
   lack of diligence with God in the work of conversion and saving! For
   Zion's sake He never rests! Nor will He rest till Christ shall see of
   the travail of His soul and shall be satisfied. God is earnest, God is
   zealous! Children of God, be imitators of Him!

   Christ was zealous. We read of Him that the zeal of God's House had
   eaten Him up and when He took the scourge of small cords and purged the
   temple, John tells us that it was written of Him, "The zeal of Your
   House has eaten Me up." A Prophet tells us that He was clothed with
   zeal as with a cloak. He had not zeal over a part of Him, but was
   clothed with it as with some great cloak covering Him from head to
   foot. Christ was all zeal. "Do you not know that I must be about My
   Father's business?" is one of His utterances, while yet a Child. And
   from the very first to the last it was His meat and His drink to do His
   Father's will.

   At what a rate He drove! How swift the chariot wheels of duty went with
   Him till the axles grew hot with speed! Brethren, you have Christ for
   an example. Does not this suffice you? Surely I can only descend in
   argument, but not ascend--see the holy angels who are to be your
   blessed companions--are they not flames of fire? Are they not called
   ser- aphs because they fly like flames upon their Master's errands? Be
   not slow where angels are like flashes of lightning if we would see any
   success come to the Church--and I know that is dear to us! If we would
   see souls converted--and I know it is the object of our daily prayers!
   If we would hear the cry that "the kingdoms of this world have become
   the kingdoms of our Lord and His Christ"--and I know that this is our
   passionate desire!

   If you would see crowns put upon the head of the Savior and His Throne
   lifted high--and I know this is your great ambition! If you would see
   Jehovah, your Father, glorified even to the ends of the earth--then be
   filled with zeal! Under God, the way of the world's conversion must be
   by the zeal of the Church. Simon the Zealot must lead the van. The rest
   may follow in their places--knowledge, patience, courage, prudence,
   every grace shall do exploits--but this shall be first, this shall bear
   the standard high! Zeal for God, zeal for His Truth--this shall be in
   the van, and may you stand side by side with the most zealous in the
   day of conflict, that you may be there in the hour of victory.

   I cannot, this morning, address you as I would desire, for I cannot
   feel my own zeal to be what I would have it be. O for the zeal of
   Wesley and Whitfield! The zeal of men who were always preaching or
   praying, men who seemed as if they knew no weariness, or shook it off
   as dust from off their feet! Oh, to have the zeal of apostolic times
   again, when the very least among you should be ready to be martyrs for
   Christ if need be! And when all of you should testify of Him, wherever
   you were called to go. Oh for more zeal in the household, that you
   might seek more anxiously the conversion of your children! More zeal in
   the workshop, that you might communicate to your fellow workmen the
   spirit which actuates and moves you!

   Oh for more zeal in the Church and Church Meetings and Prayer Meetings,
   that everything might be done with spirit! Above all, oh, for more zeal
   in the pulpit! Holy fire come down! We have the wood, we have the
   altar, we have the sacrifice-- but we need the fire! Have you not
   remarked, Brothers and Sisters, how much a man may do who is clothed
   with zeal? Some of our Brethren in the ministry to whom we have
   listened have stirred our passions, have made our blood boil after a
   sacred fashion and yet their talents have been very few and we felt
   while they were speaking that they made better use of one talent than
   some have made of ten.

   Believe me, it is not the extent of your knowledge, though that is
   useful. It is not the extent of your talent or tact, though these have
   their place. It is your zeal--your ZEAL that shall perform God's work!
   May I entreat you, as members of this Church, not to let your zeal die
   out. What Prayer Meetings we have had! Shall we ever forget Park
   Street--those Prayer Meetings when I felt compelled to let you go
   without a word from my lips because the Spirit of God was so awfully
   present that we felt bowed to the dust--and any language of mine would
   have been a mere impertinence?

   What zeal you have had! Some of you have sought for the conversion of
   souls. When I look upon some of you I know you are spiritual mothers
   and fathers in Israel--not to ones or twos, but scores! Shall your zeal
   relax? We have, by God's Grace, lived to see many of our enemies
   clothed with shame. We have preached the Word till that Word begins to
   tell and make the solid rocks of error shake. Will you draw back? Will
   you lose your force? Will you slacken in prayer? Will you refuse to
   receive the blessing which awaits you? Will you take your heads from
   the crown when it is ready to descend? I pray you do not so! Let us be
   banded together as one man! Let us contend earnestly for the faith once
   delivered to the saints! Let us pray with fervor! Let us live in
   holiness! Let us preach constantly and preach with fire! And let us so
   live that we may impress our age and leave our footprints on the sands
   of time.

   As for some of you who never were zealous--who are the fathers of no
   spiritual children. As for some of you--whose religion gets into a very
   narrow compass and is good for very little when it gets there--I pray
   you bestir yourselves. If your religion is a lie, do not profess it! If
   it is a farce, do not enslave yourselves to it!

   But if there is anything in religion, it is worth everything! It cannot
   sit second at the table--it must have the first place. The Christian
   man is to be, first of all, a Christian man! Next to that a tradesman
   or what you will--but first of all a Christian man. The first thing
   with the Believer is his Lord. Christ will be nowhere if He is not
   first and chief and that religion is vain and void which does not fill
   the soul and take up the throne of the heart.

   May God allow us, then, to wear the character, if not the name of Simon
   the Zealot, and then we will wait at His footstool and serve Him after
   such sort as He shall help us to do and His shall be all the praise.
   But, ah, we must be converted first! So let the sinner remember that
   his first business is with this text--"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
   and you shall be saved"--that is, trust Jesus, for it is written, "He
   that believes and is baptized shall be saved. He that believes not
   shall be damned." God grant you Divine Grace to trust Christ and then
   to be zealous for Him. Amen.

                    The Gospel'S Power In A Christian'S Life

   A SERMON PREACHED BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE,
   NEWINGTON.

   "Only let your conversation be as it becomes the Gospel of Christ"
   Philippians 1:27.

   THE word "conversation" does not merely mean our talk, one with
   another, but the whole course of our life and behavior in the world.
   The Greek word signifies the actions and the privileges of citizenship
   and we are to let our whole citizenship--our actions as citizens of the
   new Jerusalem--be such as becomes the Gospel of Christ. Observe, dear
   Friends, the difference between the exhortations of the legalists and
   those of the Gospel. He who would have you perfect in the flesh exhorts
   you to workthat you may be saved, that you may accomplish a meritorious
   righteousness of your own and so may be accepted before God.

   But he who teaches the doctrines of Divine Grace urges you to holiness
   for quite another reason. He teaches you are saved because you believe
   in the Lord Jesus Christ and he speaks to as many as are saved in Jesus
   and asks them to make their actions conformable to their position. He
   only seeks what he may reasonably expect to receive--"Let your
   conversation be such as becomes the Gospel of Christ. You have been
   saved by it, you profess to glory in it, you desire to extend it. Let,
   then, your conversation be such as becomes it."

   The one, you perceive, bids you to workthat you may enter Heaven by
   your working. The other exhorts you to labor because Heaven is yours as
   the gift of Divine Grace and he would have you act as one who is made
   meet to be a partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light. Some
   persons cannot hear an exhortation without at once crying out that we
   are legal. Such persons will always find this Tabernacle the wrong
   place for them to feed in. We are delighted to preach good high
   doctrine and to insist upon it that salvation is of Grace alone! But we
   are equally delighted to preach good high practice and to insist upon
   it, that that grace which does not make a man better than his neighbors
   is a grace which will never take him to Heaven, nor render him
   acceptable before God!

   I have already remarked that the exhortation is given in a form which
   is highly reasonable. The followers of any other religion, as a rule,
   are conformed to their religion. No nation has ever yet risen above the
   character of its so-called gods. Look at the disciples of Venus--were
   they not sunk deep in licentiousness? Look at the worshippers of
   Bacchus-- let their Bacchanalian rebels tell how they entered into the
   character of their deity. The worshippers to this day of the goddess
   Kale--the goddess of thieves and murderers--the Thugs--enter most
   heartily into the spirit of the idol that they worship.

   We do not marvel at the crimes of the ancients when we recollect the
   gods whom they adored--Moloch, who delighted in the blood of little
   children. Jupiter, Mercury and the like, whose actions stored in the
   classical dictionary are enough to pollute the minds of youth. We
   marvel not that licentiousness abounded, for "like gods, like people."
   "A people are never better than their religion," it has often been
   said--but in most cases they are rather worse. It is strictly in
   accordance with nature that a man's religion should season his
   conversation. Paul puts it, therefore, to you who profess to be saved
   by Jesus Christ, "Let your conversation be as it becomes the Gospel of
   Christ."

   To get at this we must meditate for two or three minutes upon what the
   Gospel is, then take up the points in which our conversation ought to
   be like to the Gospel. And finally, utter a few earnest words to press
   upon professors of religion here the stern necessity of letting their
   conversation be such as becomes the Gospel of Christ.

   I. "THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST!" WHAT IS IT? We look at the last two words,
   "of Christ." Indeed, if you understand Christ you understand the
   Gospel. Christ is the Author of it. He, in the council chamber of
   eternity proposed to become the Surety for poor fallen man! He, in the
   fullness of time, worked out eternal redemption for as many as His
   Father had given Him. He is the Author of it as its Architect and as
   its Builder. We see in Christ Jesus the Alpha and the

   Omega of the Gospel. He has provided, in the treasury of Grace, all
   that is necessary to make the Gospel the Gospel of our salvation.

   And as He is the Author of it, so He is the matter of it. It is
   impossible to preach the Gospel without preaching the Person, the work,
   the offices, the Character of Christ. If Christ is preached, the Gospel
   is promulgated and if Christ is put in the background, then there is no
   Gospel declared. "God forbid that I should know anything among you,"
   said the Apostle, "save Jesus Christ and Him crucified." And so saying,
   he was carrying out his commission to preach the Gospel both to Jews
   and to Gentiles. The sum total, the essential, the marrow--what the old
   Puritans would have called the quintessence of the Gospel--is Christ
   Jesus! So that when we have done preaching the Gospel we may say, "Now
   of the things which we have spoken He is the sum," and we may point to
   Him in the manger, to Him on the Cross, to Him risen, to Him coming in
   the second advent, to Him reigning as Prince of the kings of the
   earth--yes, point to Him everywhere--as the sum total of the Gospel.

   It is also called "the Gospel of Christ," because it is He who will be
   the Finisher of it. He will put the finishing stroke to the work as He
   laid the foundation stone. The Believer does not begin in Christ and
   then seek perfection in himself. No, as we run the heavenly race we are
   still looking to Jesus! As His hand first tore away the sin which does
   so easily beset us and helped us to run the race with patience, so that
   same hand shall hold out the olive branch of victory, shall weave it
   into a chaplet of Glory and put it about our brow. It is the Gospel of
   Jesus Christ--His property. It glorifies His Person. It is sweet with
   the savor of His name. It bears throughout the mark of His artistic
   fingers. If the heavens are the work of God's fingers and the moon and
   the stars are by His ordinance, so we may say of the whole plan of
   salvation--the whole of it, great Jesus, is Your workmanship and by
   Your ordinance it stands fast!

   It is "the Gospel of Jesus Christ," and though hundreds of times this
   has been explained, it will not be amiss to go over it again. It is the
   "good-spell," the "good news" of Jesus Christ and it is "good news"
   emphatically, because it clears away sin--the worst evil on earth.
   Better still, it sweeps away death and Hell! Christ came into the world
   to take sin upon His shoulders and to carry it away, hurling it into
   the red sea of His atoning blood. Christ, the Scapegoat, took the sin
   of His people upon His own head and bore it all away into the
   wilderness of forgetfulness, where, if it is searched for, it shall be
   found no more forever.

   This is "good news," for it tells that the cancer at the vitals of
   humanity has been cured! That the leprosy which rose even to the very
   brow of manhood has been taken away! Christ has filled a better stream
   than the river Jordan and now says to the sons of men, "Go, wash and be
   clean." Besides removing the worst of ills, the Gospel is "good news"
   because it brings the best of blessings. What does it do but give life
   to the dead? It opens dumb lips, unstops deaf ears and unseals blind
   eyes! Does it not make earth the abode of peace? Has it not shut the
   doors of Hell upon Believers and opened the gates of Heaven to all who
   have learned to trust in Jesus' name? "Good news?" Why that word "good"
   has got a double meaning when it is applied to the Gospel of Jesus
   Christ!

   Well were angels employed to go and tell it and happy are the men who
   spend and are spent in the proclamation of such glad tidings of great
   joy. "God is reconciled!" "Peace on earth!" "Glory to God in the
   highest!" "Goodwill towards men!" God is glorified in salvation,
   sinners are delivered from the wrath to come and Hell does not receive
   the multitudes of men, but Heaven is filled with the countless host
   redeemed by blood! It is "good news," too, because it is a thing that
   could not have been invented by the human intellect. It was news to
   angels!--They have not ceased to wonder at it yet! They still stand
   looking upon the Mercy Seat, desiring to know more of it. It will be
   news in eternity! We shall--

   "Sing with rapture and surprise, His loving kindness in the skies." The
   "good news," put simply into a few words, is just this--"that God was
   in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their
   trespasses unto them." "God so loved the world, that He gave His only
   begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have
   everlasting life." "This is a faithful saying and worthy of all
   acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners." So
   much, then, for what the Gospel is.

   II. Now I am not going to speak to those who do not welcome the
   Gospel--I will speak to them another time. I pray God helps them to
   believe it, but today I have especially to speak to Believers. The text
   says we are to LET OUR CONVERSATION BE SUCH AS BECOMES THE GOSPEL. What
   sort of conversation, then, shall we have? In the first place the
   Gospel is very simple. It is unadorned--no meretricious ornaments to
   clog the pile. It is simple--"not with enticing words of man's wisdom."
   It is grandly sublime in its simplicity. Let the Christian be such. It
   does not become the Christian minister to be arrayed in blue and
   scarlet and fine linen and vestments and robes--these belong to
   Antichrist and are described in the book of the Revelation as the sure
   marks of the whore of Babylon.

   It does not become the Christian man or the Christian woman to be
   guilty of spending hours in the adornment of his or her person. Our
   adornment should be "the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit." There
   should be about our manner, our speech, our dress, our whole behavior
   that simplicity which is the very soul of beauty. Those who labor to
   make themselves admirable in appearance, by gaudy ornaments, miss the
   road. Beauty is its own adornment and, "she is most adorned when
   unadorned the most."

   The Christian man ought always to be simple in all respects. I think
   wherever you find him, you ought not to need a key to him. He should
   not be like certain books that you cannot make out without having
   somebody tell you the hard words. He should be a transparent man like
   Nathaniel--"an Israelite, indeed, in whom there is no guile." The man
   who catches the spirit of his Master is, like Christ, a child-man, a
   man-child. You know they called Him, "that holy Child, Jesus." So let
   us be, remembering that, "Except we are converted and become as little
   children," who are eminently simple and child-like, "we cannot enter
   into the kingdom of Heaven."

   In the next place, if our conversation is such as becomes the Gospel,
   we shall remember that the Gospel is preeminently true. There is
   nothing in the Gospel which is false--no admixture, nothing put in as
   an "argumentum ad ho-minem" to catch the popular ear. It tells the
   Truth--the naked Truth--and if men dislike it, the Gospel cannot help
   it. It is gold without dross. It is pure water without admixture. Now
   such should the Christian be. He should make his conversation true. The
   saints are men of honor, but sometimes, Brethren, I think that many of
   us talk too much to speak nothing but the Truth of God.

   I do not know how people could bring out broadsheets every morning with
   so much news if it were all true! I suppose there must be a little
   padding to fill it up and some of that is very poor stuff. And people
   that keep on talking, talking, talking, cannot grind all meal--surely
   it must be, some of it--rather coarse bran. And in the conversation of
   a good many professing Christians, how munch there is that is scandal,
   if not slander, uttered against other Christians? How much
   uncharitableness, if not willful falsehood, is spoken by some
   professors? Too often a rebuke is taken up heedlessly and repeated
   without any care being taken to ascertain whether it is true or not.

   The Christian's lips should speak truth when falsehood drops from the
   lips of all other men. A Christian man should never need to take an
   oath because his word is as good as an oath--his, "yes," should be,
   "yes." And his, "no, no." It is for him to so live and speak that he
   shall be in good repute in all society--if not for the etiquette of his
   manners, certainly for the truthfulness of his utterances! Show me a
   man that is habitually or frequently a liar and you show me a man who
   will have his portion in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone!

   I do not care to what denomination of Christians he may belong, if a
   man speaks the thing that is not, I am sure he is none of Christ's. And
   it is very sad to know that there are some in all fellowships who have
   this great and grievous fault--that you cannot trust them in what they
   say. God deliver us from that! Let our conversation be such as becomes
   the Gospel of Christ and then it will be invariably truthful! Or, if
   there is error in it, it will always be through misadventure and never
   on purpose or from carelessness.

   In the next place, the Gospel of Jesus Christ is a very fearless
   Gospel. It is the very reverse of that pretty thing called "modern
   charity." The last created devil is "modern charity." "Modern charity"
   goes cap in hand round to us all, and it says, "You are all right,
   every one of you! Do not quarrel any longer! Sectarianism is a horrid
   thing--down with it! Down with it!" And so it tries to induce all sorts
   of persons to withhold a part of what they believe--to silence the
   testimony of all Christians upon points wherein they differ. I believe
   that that thing called Sectarianism nowadays is none other than true
   honesty.

   Be a Sectarian, my Brother--be profoundly a Sectarian! I mean, by that,
   hold everything which you see to be in God's Word with a tighter grasp
   and do not give up even the little pieces of Truth. At the same time,
   let that Sectarianism which makes you hate another man because he does
   not agree with you--let that be far from you! But never consent to that
   unholy league and covenant which seems to be rife throughout our
   country which would put a padlock on the mouth of every man and send us
   all about as if we were dumb--which says to me, "You must not speak
   against the errors of such-and-such a Church." And to another, "You
   must not reply." We cannot but speak! If we did not, the stones in the
   street might cry out against us!

   That kind of charity is unknown to the Gospel. Now hear the Word of
   God! "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved. He that believes
   not"--what?--"shall get to Heaven some other way?" NO!--"shall be
   damned"! That is the Gospel. You perceive how boldly it launches out
   its censure? It does not pretend, "you may reject Me and go by another
   road and at last get safely to your journey's end!" No, no, no!--You
   "shall be damned," it says! Do you not perceive how Christ puts it?
   Some teachers come into the world and say to all, "Yes, Gentlemen, by
   your leave, you are all right. I have a point or two that you have not
   taught, just make room for me--I will not turn you out. I can stand in
   the same temple as yourself."

   But hear what Christ says--"All that ever came before Me were thieves
   and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them." Hear what His servant
   Paul says, "Though we, or an angel from Heaven, preach any other Gospel
   unto you than that which we have preached unto you,"--what then?--"Let
   him be excused for his mistake?" No! But, "Let him be accursed"! Now
   this is strong language, but mark you, this is just how the Christian
   ought to live! As the Gospel is very fearless in what it has to say, so
   let the Christian always be. It strikes me that a "living" which
   becomes the Gospel of Christ is always a bold and fearless kind of
   living!

   Some people go crawling through the world as if they asked some great
   man's permission to live. They do not know their own minds. They take
   their words out of their mouths and look at them and ask a friend or
   two's opinion. "What do you think of these words?" And when these
   friends censure them they put them in again and will not say them. Like
   jellyfish, they have no backbone. Now God has made men upright and it
   is a noble thing for a man to stand erect on his own feet. And it is a
   nobler thing, still, for a man to say that in Christ Jesus he has
   received that freedom which is freedom, indeed, and therefore he will
   not be the slave of any man.

   "O God," says David, "I am Your servant, for You have loosed my bonds."
   Happy is he whose bonds are loosed! Let your eyes be like that of an
   eagle, yes, let them be brighter still! Let them never be dimmed by the
   eyes of any other man. Let your heart be like that of the lion,
   fearless! Say of yourself--

   "Careless, myself a dying man, Of dying men's esteem,"

   I must live as in the sight of God, as I believe I should live, and
   then let man say his best or say his worst--it shall be no more than
   the chirping of a grasshopper when the sun goes down. "Who are you that
   you should be afraid of a man that shall die, or the son of man that is
   but a worm?" Make yourselves like men! Be strong! Fear not! For only so
   will your conversation be such as becomes the Gospel of Christ.

   But again, the Gospel of Christ is very gentle. Hear it speak! "Come
   unto Me all you that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you
   rest." Here is its spirit in its Founder--"He will not quench the
   smoking flax. A bruised reed He will not break." Moreover, bad temper,
   snapping off of people's heads, making men offenders for a word--all
   this is quite contrary to the Gospel. There are some people who seem to
   have been nursed upon vinegar and whose entire attitude far better
   suits Sinai than Zion. You might think that they had always come to the
   mount that might not be touched, which burns with fire, for they seem,
   themselves, to burn with fire. I may say to them that the best of them
   is sharper than a thorn hedge.

   Now, dear Friends, let it never be so with us. Be firm, be bold, be
   fearless--but be cautious! If you have a lion's heart, have a lady's
   hand. Let there be such a gentleness about your carriage that the
   little children may not be afraid to come to you and the publican and
   harlot may not be driven away by your hostility, but invited to
   goodness by the gentleness of your words and acts. Again, the Gospel of
   Christ is very loving. It is the speech of the God of Love to a lost
   and fallen race. It tells us, "God so loved the world, that He gave His
   only begotten Son, that whoever believes on Him should not perish, but
   have everlasting life."

   It proclaims in every Word the Divine Grace of Him "who loved us and
   gave Himself for us." "Greater love has no man than this, that a man
   lay down his life for his friends." This same mind which was in Christ
   Jesus should dwell richly in us. His last command to His disciples was,
   "Love one another." He that loves is born of God, while without this
   Grace, whatever we may think of ourselves, or others may think of us,
   we are really, in God's sight, nothing better than sounding brass and
   tinkling cymbals. Is not this an age in which we shall do well to
   direct our attention to the flower of

   Paradise? The atmosphere of the Church should foster this heavenly
   plant to the highest perfection. The world ought to point to us and
   say, "See how these Christians love one another? Not in word only, but
   in deed and in truth!"

   I care not for that love which calls me a dearly beloved Brother and
   then if I happen to differ in sentiment and practice, treats me as a
   schismatic, denies me the rights of the brotherhood, and if I do not
   choose to subscribe to an arbitrarily imposed contribution to its
   funds, seizes my goods and sells them in the name of the law, order and
   Church of Christ! From all such shall our good Lord deliver us! But oh,
   for more real hearty union and love to all the saints--for more of that
   realization of the fact that we are one in Christ Jesus.

   At the same time pray for more love to allmen. We ought to love all our
   hearers, and the Gospel is to be preached by us to every creature. I
   hate sin everywhere, but I love and wish to love yet more and more
   every day the souls of the worst and vilest of men. Yes, the Gospel
   speaks of love and I must breathe it forth, too, in every act and deed.
   If our Lord was Love Incarnate, and we are His disciples, "let all take
   knowledge of us that we have been with Jesus and learned of Him."

   The Gospel of Christ, again, is the Gospel of mercy and if any man
   would act as becomes the Gospel, he must be a man of mercy. Do I see
   him? He is praying. He has been to the sacramental table and he has
   been drinking the wine which betokens the Savior's blood--what a good
   man he is! See him on Monday--he has got his hands on his Brother's
   throat, with--"Pay me what you owe!" Is that such as becomes the Gospel
   of Christ? There he sits--he will give his subscription to a charity,
   but he will grind down the needle-woman! He will get fat on her blood
   and bones! He will take a grasp, if he can, of the poor and sell them
   and devour them as though they were bread and yet, at the same time,
   "for a pretense he will make long prayers."

   Is this such as becomes the Gospel of Christ? I think not. The Gospel
   of Christ is mercy, generosity, liberality. It receives the beggar and
   hears his cry! It picks up even the vile and undeserving and scatters
   lavish blessings upon them and it fills the bosom of the naked and of
   the hungry with good things. Let your conversation be such as becomes
   the Gospel of Christ! You miserly and stingy people have not a
   conversation such as becomes the Gospel of Christ! There might be
   plenty of money for God's treasury, for God's Church and for God's poor
   if there were not some who seem to live only to amass and to hoard!

   Their life is diametrically opposed to the whole current and spirit of
   the Gospel of Christ Jesus. Forgive all who offend you! Help all, as
   far as you are able to do it, live a life of unselfishness! Be
   prepared, as much as lies in you, to do good unto all men and
   especially to the household of faith! And so shall your conversation be
   such as becomes the Gospel of Christ. I must not, however, omit to say
   that the Gospel of Christ is holy. You cannot find it excusing sin. It
   pardons it, but not without an Atonement so dreadful that sin never
   seems so exceedingly sinful as in the act of mercy which puts it away.

   "Holy! Holy! Holy!" is the cry of the Gospel--and such is the cry of
   cherubim and seraphim. Now, if our conversation is to be like the
   Gospel, we must be holy, too. There are some things which the Christian
   must not even name, much less indulge in. The grosser vices are to him
   things to be hidden behind the curtain and totally unknown. The
   amusements and pleasures of the world, so far as they may be innocent,
   are his, as they are other men's. But wherein they become sinful or
   doubtful, he discards them with disgust, for he has secret sources
   ofjoy and needs not, therefore, to go and drink of that muddy river of
   which thirsty worldlings are so fond. He seeks to be holy, as Christ is
   holy. And there is no conversation which becomes the Gospel of Christ
   except that.

   III. Dear Friends, I might thus continue, for the subject is a very
   wide one. But I stop because, unhappily for me, though perhaps happily
   for your patience, my time has gone. Having just indicated what the
   Christian life ought to be, I must, in a few words, plead with you that
   by the power of God's Holy Spirit you will seek to make your lives
   such. I could mention many reasons--I will only give you one or two.

   The first is, if you do not live like this, you will make your fellow
   members who are innocent of your sin, suffer. This ought to be a very
   convincing motive. If a Christian man could dishonor himself and bear
   the blame alone, why he might put up with it, but you cannot! I say,
   Sir, if you are seen intoxicated, or if you are known to fall into some
   sin of the flesh, you will make the life of every poor girl in the
   Church harder than it is. And every poor young man who has to put up
   with persecution will feel that you have put a sting into the arrows of
   the wicked which could not otherwise have been there. You sin against
   the congregation of God's people!

   I know there are some of you here that have to suffer a good deal for
   Christ's sake. The jeer rings in your ears from morning to night and
   you learn to put up with it manfully. But it is very hard when they can
   say to you, "Look at So-and-So--he is a Church member! Look at what he
   did--you are alla parcel of hypocrites!" Now, my dear Friends, you know
   that is not true! You know that there are many in our churches of whom
   the world is not worthy--the excellent, the devout, the Christ-like. Do
   not sin, then, for their sakes, lest you make them to be grieved and
   sorely vexed.

   Again, do you not see how you make your Lord to suffer, for they do not
   lay your sins at your door merely, but they say that springs from your
   religion. If they would impute the folly to the fool I might not care!
   But they impute it to the wisdom which must have made that fool wise if
   he could have learned. They will lay it to my door--that does not
   matter much--I have long lost my character! But I cannot bear it should
   be laid at Christ's door--at the door of the Gospel.

   When I said just now that I had lost my character, I meant just
   this--that the world loathes me and I would not have it do otherwise!
   So let it, I say--there is no love lost between us. If the world hates
   Christ's minister, he can only say he desires that he may never inherit
   the curse of those who love the world, "in whom the love of the Father
   is not." Yet it has ever been the lot of the true Christian minister to
   be the butt of slander and, nevertheless, to glory in the Cross with
   all its shame.

   But I know, dear Friends, you would not, any of you, wish that I should
   bear the reproach of your sins and yet I have to do it very often--not
   very often for many, but for some. There are those, of whom I might
   tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the Cross of
   Christ. And some others whom we would pluck out of the fire, hating the
   garment spotted with the flesh--they bring sad dishonor upon us, upon
   the ministry--upon the Gospel and upon Christ Himself. You do not want
   to do that! At least, I hope you do not. Then let your conversation be
   such as becomes the Gospel of Christ!

   And then, remember, dear Friends, unless your conversation is such, you
   will pull down all the witness that you have ever borne for Christ. How
   can your Sunday school children believe what you tell them when they
   see your actions contradict your teaching? How can your own children at
   home believe in your religion when they see the godlessness of your
   life? The men at the factory will not believe in your going to Prayer
   Meeting when they see you walking inconsistently among them. Oh, the
   great thing the Church needs is more holiness! The worst enemies of the
   Church are not the infidels--really, one does not know who the infidels
   are nowadays--they are so small a fry and so few of them, that one
   would have to hunt to find them out!

   No, the worst enemies of the Church are the hypocrites, the formalists,
   the mere professors, the inconsistent walkers. You, if there are any
   such here--you pull down the walls of Jerusalem, you open the gates to
   her foes and, as much as lies in you, you serve the devil! May God
   forgive you! May Christ forgive you! May you be washed from this
   atrocious sin! May you be brought humbly to the foot of the Cross to
   accept mercy, which, until now, you have rejected! It is shocking to
   think how persons dare to remain members of Christian churches and even
   to enter the pulpit when they are conscious that their private life is
   foul! Oh, how can they do it?

   How is it that their hearts have grown so hard? What? Has the devil
   bewitched them? Has he turned them away from being men and made them as
   devilish as himself that they should dare to pray in public and to sit
   at the sacramental table and to administer ordinances while their hands
   are foul and their hearts unclean, and their lives are full of sin? I
   charge you, if there are any of you whose lives are not consistent,
   give up your profession, or else make your lives what they should be!

   May the eternal Spirit, who still winnows His Church, blow away the
   chaff and heave only the good golden wheat upon the floor! And if you
   know yourselves to be living in any sin, may God help you to mourn over
   it, to loathe it, to go to Christ about it tonight--to take hold of
   Him, to wash His feet with your tears, to repent unfeignedly--and then
   to begin anew in His strength a life which shall be such as becomes the
   Gospel. I think I hear some ungodly person here saying, "Well I do not
   make any profession, I am all right."

   Now, listen, dear Friend, listen! I have got a word for you. A man is
   brought up before the magistrates and he says, "Well, I never made any
   profession of being an honest man." "Oh," says the magistrate, "there
   is six months for you then." You see, he is a villain outright! And you
   that say "Oh, I never made any profession," why, by putting yourselves
   on that ground, you place yourselves among the condemned ones! But some
   people make a boast of it. "I never made a profession." Never made a
   profession of doing your duty to your Maker? Never made a profession of
   being obedient to the God in whose hands your breath is? Never made a
   profession of being obedient to the Gospel?

   Why, it will be very short work with you, when you come to be tried at
   last. There will need to be no witnesses, for you never made a
   profession--you never pretended to be right. What would you think of a
   man who said, "Well, I never made a profession of speaking the truth."
   "Well," says another, "I never made a profession of being chaste." Why,
   you would say, "Let us get out of this fellow's company, because
   evidently nothing but evil can come from him for he is not good enough
   even to make a profession!"

   Now I put that strongly that you may remember it! Will you go home and
   just meditate on this--"I never made a profession of being saved. I
   never made a profession of repenting of my sins and therefore I am
   every day making a profession of being God's enemy--of being
   impenitent, of being unbelieving! And when the devil comes to look for
   his own he will know me, for I make a profession of being one of his by
   not making a profession ofbeing one of Christ's" ?

   The fact is, I pray God to bring us all here first, to be Christ's, and
   then to make a profession of it. Oh that your heart might be washed in
   Jesus' blood and then, having given it to Christ, give it to Christ's
   people! The Lord bless these words of mine for Jesus' sake. Amen.

 Confession Of Sin Illustrated by the Cases of Dr. Pritchard and Constance Kent

   A Sermon

   (No. 641)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, July 23rd, 1865, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I
   said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou
   forgavest the iniquity of my sin."--Psalm 32:5.

   DAVID'S grief for sin was long and terrible. Its effects were visible
   upon his outward frame; "his bones waxed old;" "his moisture was turned
   into the drought of summer." No remedy could he find, until he made a
   full confession before the throne of the heavenly grace. He tells us,
   that for a time he kept silence, and then his heart became more and
   more filled with grief: like some mountain tarn whose outlet is blocked
   up, his soul was swollen with torrents of sorrow. He dreaded to
   confront his sin. He fashioned excuses; he endeavoured to divert his
   thoughts, by giving his mind to the cares of his kingdom or the
   pleasures of his court, but it was all to no purpose; the rankling
   arrow made the wound bleed anew, and made the gash more wide and deep
   every day. Like a festering sore his anguish gathered and increased,
   and as he would not use the lancet of confession, his spirits became
   more and more full of torment, and there was no rest in his bones
   because of sin. At last it came to this, that he must return unto his
   God in humble penitence, or he must die outright; so he hastened to the
   mercy-seat, and there unrolled the volume of his iniquities before the
   eye of the all-seeing One, acknowledging all the evil of his ways in
   language such as you read in the fifty-first and other penitential
   Psalms. Having done this, a work so simple and yet so difficult to
   pride, he received at once the token of divine forgiveness; the bones
   which had been broken were made to rejoice, and he came forth from his
   closet to sing the blessedness of the man whose transgression is
   forgiven, and whose sin is covered.

   See, dear friends, the value of a truthful grace-wrought confession of
   sin; it is to be prized above all price, for he that confesseth his sin
   and forsaketh it, shall find mercy. Now, it is a well known fact, that
   when God is pleased to bestow upon men any choice gift, Satan, who is
   the god of counterfeits, is sure very soon to produce a base imitation,
   true in appearance, but worthless in reality: his object is deception,
   and full often he succeeds. How many there are who have made a
   worthless confession, and yet are relying upon it as though it were a
   work of grace; they have come before God as a matter of form, and have
   said, "Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable sinners;" and having so
   done, imagine that they have received the divine absolution, when alas!
   alas! it is easy to be deceived, and difficult to cultivate within
   one's heart that genuine repentance, which is the work of God the Holy
   Ghost.

   May God grant us his gracious assistance while we describe two widely
   different sorts of confession which have been very vividly brought
   before us during the past week; and then we will have a few words upon
   the exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy which is vested in God,
   who gives forgiveness to those whose confession is sincere.

   I. Let me set before you TWO SORTS OF CONFESSION.

   At this present moment, unhappily, two persons are lying under sentence
   of death, for murders of the most atrocious character. Without wishing
   to say a single word with regard to the state of soul of either of
   these persons--for into that it is no business of mine to pry--it seems
   to me that the published reports of their cases, may very properly
   furnish us with types of two sorts of persons. It is remarkable that
   two such cases as those of Dr. Pritchard and Constance Kent should be
   before the public eye at the same moment and that the points of
   contrast in their confession should be so exceedingly clear. I cannot
   but hope and pray that we may gather some few lessons of warning from
   crimes which have no doubt exercised a great influence for evil upon
   the masses of our country.

   The confession which has been made by Dr. PRITCHARD, maybe taken as a
   specimen of those which are full often made by impenitent sinners,
   which can never be regarded as acceptable before the throne of the Most
   High. Here is a man who is accused of the atrocious crime of murdering
   his wife and his mother-in-law, and when he answers to the indictment,
   we are not astonished to hear him plead, "Not Guilty!" I am far from
   being severe upon him for so pleading, but viewing him as a type, I
   would remind you that thousands of those who call themselves "miserable
   sinners" in our public services, if they were called to plead before
   the bar of God, would have the effrontery to say "Not Guilty." They
   might not use the words, very probably they would use terms having the
   opposite meaning, but their heart-plea would be, "not guilty." If they
   had the law of God explained to them and they were questioned upon each
   commandment, "Have you broken this? Have you broken that?" though ready
   enough to confess in the gross that they have sinned, when it came to
   details they would be for denying all. We have heard of a woman who
   readily allowed that she was a sinner "O yes, sir, we are all sinners.
   Just so, sir." But when the visitor sat down and opened the book, and
   pointing to the commandment, said, "Have you ever had any other God
   save the Lord?" She did not know that she ever had. "Had she ever taken
   God's name in vain?" "O dear no, sir, I never did anything so wicked."
   Each precept was explained, and she very positively claimed that she
   had not broken it. She had not violated the Sabbath; she had not killed
   anybody; she had not committed adultery; she had not borne false
   witness, or coveted anything; she was altogether, in detail, innocent,
   though in the gross she was quite willing to say as other people, "Oh,
   yes! I am a sinner, of course, sir, we are all sinners!" which, being
   interpreted, means, "I am ready to say anything you like to put into my
   mouth, but I do not believe a syllable of it." The inward speech of the
   unconverted man is, "I am not guilty." Ask the unhumbled transgressor,
   "Art thou worthy of God's wrath?" and his proud heart replies, "I am
   not." "Art thou worthy to be cast away for ever from God's presence on
   account of sin?" and the unbroken, uncontrite soul replies. "I am not.
   I am no thief, nor adulterer, nor extortioner; I have not sinned as yon
   publican has done. I thank God that I am not as other men are." Man
   pleads Not Guilty, and yet all the while within his heart, so proud and
   boastful, there may readily be discerned abundant evidence of abounding
   sin. The leprosy is white upon his unclean brow, and yet the man claims
   to be sound and whole. If there were no other evidence against us, the
   very pride which boasts of innocence would be sufficient to convict us
   of sin, and will be so when we are taught right reason by the Holy
   Spirit.

   The guilty man whose case we are now looking upon as an illustration,
   endeavoured, as a means of defense for himself, to involve another in
   the dreadful guilt and punishment of his atrocious sin. There were very
   distinct signs that he would have been perfectly satisfied if the woman
   who had ministered to his sinful pleasures had been accused and
   condemned of the crime of which he alone was guilty. Certainly this is
   the case with the great mass of those who are compelled to acknowledge
   their sins. Our first parent could not deny that he had taken of the
   forbidden fruit, but he laid the blame upon Eve: "The woman whom thou
   gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree and I did eat." Ah Adam!
   where is thy manliness, where thy love to thy spouse, that thou
   wouldest involve in the ruin her who was bone of thy bone so as to
   escape thyself? And she! she will not take the blame for a moment, but
   it is the serpent; she casts all the sin on him. In this first case of
   sin, the attempt was less atrocious than in that of the prisoner before
   us, because there was real guilt both in the woman and in the serpent,
   while it does not appear that the servant girl in Pritchard's family
   had any share in the poisoning. However, the human heart is such, that
   if we could really throw all the shame and blame of sin upon another
   who was perfectly innocent, there would be a strong temptation to do so
   if we might by such means be considered innocent. Nay, let me show that
   Adam virtually did that, for he said "The woman whom thou gavest me,"
   thus virtually laying the blame of his rebellious deed upon God
   himself. And God, what hand had he in Adam's eating of the fruit of the
   accursed tree? It was an act of Adam's free will, he did as he pleased
   concerning it, and the most holy God could in no sense be made partaker
   of his transgression. Yet, think of it! He would sooner that the great
   God, who is hymned of angels as the thrice Holy One, should bear the
   fault of his iniquity than he would bear it himself. Such are we
   naturally. We may bend the knee and say we are miserable sinners, but
   unless the grace of God has taught us to make true confession we are
   always for shifting the burden to some other shoulder, and making it
   out that after all, though nominally miserable sinners, we are not so
   bad as a great many other people, and have a deal saddled upon us which
   really is no fault of ours, but belongs to providence, to fate, to our
   fellow men, to the devil, to the weather, and I know not what besides.

   The convicted criminal who stands before us in our picture made no
   confession whatever until the case was proved and sentence pronounced.
   The case was clear enough, but he did his best to make it difficult;
   had he been completely free from the crime, his bearing and tone could
   have been scarcely more confident when asserting his innocence. I admit
   that it was very natural that he should not aid to convict himself, it
   is because it is so natural that the man serves so admirably as a
   representative of human nature when it makes its impenitent
   confessions. When it could not avail the wretch to withhold the truth,
   when facts were brought out so clear, when the jury had decided, when
   the judge had pronounced sentence, then, and not till then, he yielded
   to tears and entreaties, and proffered a confession, such as it was. So
   is it ever with unregenerate humanity; though cognizant of sin, we only
   acknowledge before the Lord that which is too glaring to be denied. Sin
   may be held up before the eyes of the man who is guilty of it, and
   often he will disown his own offspring, or assert that it is not what
   God's Word declares it to be. Holy Scripture accuses us of a thousand
   sins which we practically claim to be innocent of, for we flatter
   ourselves that the Bible puts too harsh a construction upon our
   actions, and that we are not what it declares us to be. When our
   fellow-men concur in censuring our fault we are compelled to blush, but
   of what value is a repentance which owes its existence to the
   overwhelming testimony of our fellow offenders against us. This
   force-work is far removed from the free and ready acknowledgments of a
   man whose heart is touched by divine grace and melted by the love of
   Jesus. When men are upon their dying beds, when the ghosts of their
   iniquities haunt them, when the red hand of guilt draws the curtain,
   when they can almost hear the sentence of the last judgment, then they
   will make a confession, but may we not fear that it is of little value,
   since it is wrung and extorted from them by fear of hell and horror of
   the wrath to come. True repentance wrought in us by the Holy Ghost
   drops as freely as honey droppeth from the comb, but merely natural
   confessions are like the worst of the wine squeezed by main force from
   the dregs. O dear friends, God deliver you from ungracious confessions
   of sin, and enable you sincerely to repent at the foot of Jesus' cross!

   When the confession came, in the case before us, it was very partial.
   He had killed one, but he professed himself guiltless of the other's
   death. Villain as he was, on his own shewing, he could go the length of
   owning half his crime, but then he started back and acted the liar. No,
   she died by accident, and he, to avoid being charged unjustly--innocent
   creature as he was--had put the poison in the bottle afterwards. He had
   the wickedness to feign a wonder that his tale was not believed, and
   likened those who doubted him to those who would not believe the Lord
   of glory. Now, the confessions of unregenerate men are precisely of
   this sort. They will go the length of owning, if they have been
   drinking, or if they have broken the laws of the state, "yes, we have
   offended here," but the great mass of sins against God are not
   confessed, nor allowed to be sins at all. Men will often lay a stress
   upon sins of which they are not conspicuously guilty, and omit those
   which are the most glaring. What unrenewed man thinks it a sin to
   forget God, to forsake the Creator's fountain of living waters for the
   cisterns of the creature, or to live without God in the world? And yet,
   these are the most crying of all iniquities. To rob God of his glory,
   to despise his Son, to disbelieve the gospel, to live for self, to be
   self-righteous--all these are heinous evils, but what carnal man owns
   to them as such? Covetousness! again, who ever confesses that?
   Thousands are guilty of it, but few will own it even in private before
   the Lord. No confession will be acceptable before God, unless you are
   willing to make a clean breast of the whole of your evil ways, words
   and thoughts, before the searcher of hearts. I do not wonder if you
   should fail to tell to others your offenses; it were not meet you
   should do so except wherein you have offended them and may make
   retribution by the confession; but before God you must open all, you
   must roll away the stone from the mouth of that sepulcher, even though
   your iniquity, like Lazarus, should stink. There must be no mincing the
   matter, things must be called by their right names; you must be willing
   to feel the horrible sinfulness of sin, and as far as you can, you must
   descend to the very bottom of its terrible guiltiness, and acknowledge
   its blackness, its heinousness, its devilry, its abomination. No
   confession will be acceptable before God, if you knowingly and wilfully
   gloss over any sin; if you make any exception, or are partial with
   respect to any form of iniquity. That confession which hides some sins
   and only confesses certain others stops one leak in the soul and opens
   another.

   Nor ought it to be forgotten, that when the criminal had confessed his
   sin, yet still in the last confession--which we may suppose to have
   been true, there are words of extenuation, and nothing to indicate any
   deep and suitable sensibility of his great enormity. He hints at
   reasons why he was scarcely accountable--a sort of madness and the
   influence of strong drink must be execrated for the crime, and not the
   man himself. O God, thou knowest how often in our natural confessions,
   before thy grace met with us, we made wretched and mean excuses for
   ourselves! We said that a strong temptation overcame us; it was an
   unguarded moment; it was our constitution and our besetting sins; it
   was our friend who led us astray; it was God's providence which tried
   us; it was anything rather than ourselves--we were to blame, no doubt,
   but still there were extenuating circumstances. Beloved friends! a man
   can never make a true confession till he feels that sin is his own sin,
   and is willing to confess it as such; he must cease to apologize any
   longer, and must just stand forth before the Lord, and cry, "I have
   sinned, willfully and infamously, and here, standing in thy presence, I
   acknowledge it: but if a word of apology could save my soul, I dare not
   utter it, for I should again be guilty of a lie." May this teach us to
   seek out rather the aggravations of our sin than fancied extenuations
   of it. Try to see the worst of thy case, sinner, more than to gloss it
   or gild it over and make it seem better than it is.

   All this, remember, was committed by this miserable murderer, who is so
   soon to appear before his God, not through ignorance, but in spite of a
   clear consciousness of the wrong of his deed. Had he been some person
   of a low mental organization, or of neglected intellect, there might be
   some plea. If, for instance, he had never been able to read, and had
   received his only education amid thieves and vagabonds, there might
   have been some excuse, and we might have said, "It is the sin of the
   community which fails to provide moral and religions instruction for
   the people;" but here is a man who knows better, who, I suppose, had
   listened to thousands of sermons, had a knowledge of the Bible, had
   pretended to pray, was well taught as to the matter of right and wrong,
   and yet still, in defiance of all this, he sins, and to make the matter
   worse, shows no signs of softening of heart, no tenderness, no melting,
   nothing of deep regret, and shame, and contrition, and humbleness of
   heart, but is, apparently (I say no more) as obdurate in confessing his
   guilt as when he was denying it. Ah! but there are too many who make
   confession, having no broken hearts, no streaming eyes, no flowing
   tears, no humbled spirits. Know ye this, that ten thousand confessions,
   if they are made by hardened hearts, if they do not spring from really
   contrite spirits shall be only additions to your guilt as they are
   mockeries before the Most High. Let these suffice as remarks upon
   unacceptable confession. Oh Lord, let thy Holy Spirit give to the
   guilty one, of whom we have been speaking, and to us all that broken
   and contrite heart, which thou wilt accept through Jesus Christ!

   The second case must now come before us, and here again I do not desire
   to speak anything about the state of heart of CONSTANCE KENT, I only
   speak of her outward act, and only of that as a symbol of true
   confession. Here is one avowedly guilty of a most atrocious murder, a
   very great and terrible crime; but when she appears in court she is
   brought there upon her own confession; her life was in no danger from
   the witness of other people. She surrendered herself voluntarily, and
   when she stood before the judge, she pleaded guilty. No doubt her
   anxious friends had suggested to her the desirableness of pleading "Not
   guilty," hoping to save her life by failure in the evidence, or plea of
   insanity, or some other legal method of saving criminals from the
   gallows. Mark, however, how distinctly she says "Guilty;" and though
   the question is repeated and space is given her to retract, her reply
   is still the one self-condemning word "GUILTY!" Even so before the
   Lord, whenever we come to confess we must approach him with this cry,
   Guilty, Guilty! "Lord, I cannot say anything else. If hell be my
   eternal portion for it, I dare say no other. The stones in the streets
   would cry out against me if I denied my guilt. When my memory shows me
   the record of my days, its truthful witness is that I have broken thy
   law; and when my conscience looks at the way in which I have
   transgressed, it cannot say anything but this, Thou hast wilfully
   broken God's law and thou deservest his wrath.'" Now sinner, thou shalt
   never be at peace with God until thou art willing unreservedly to plead
   "Guilty." That self-righteous spirit of thine must be cast out as
   though it were the very devil, for it is next akin to the devil, and is
   quite as mischievous, and thou must be brought down humbly to lie at
   the foot of Jehovah's throne and confess that thou dost richly deserve
   his wrath, for thou hast defied his righteous law and sinned against
   him with a high hand. You must plead "Guilty," or remain guilty for
   ever. You shall never find pardon through Jesus Christ till you are
   willing, truly and really, to own yourself a sinner.

   Constance Kent was anxious to free all others from the blame of her
   sin. Her counsel says, in open court, "Solemnly, in the presence of
   Almighty God, as a person who values her own soul, she wishes me to say
   that the guilt is her own alone; and that her father and others, who
   have so long suffered most unjust and cruel suspicions, are wholly and
   absolutely innocent." This is well spoken. I know nothing of this young
   woman's heart, but using her as an illustration rather than an example,
   we are safe in saying that it is a very blessed sign of true repentance
   when the sinner cries out with David, "I acknowledge my transgressions:
   and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned,
   and done this evil in thy sight." There will be in a gracious penitent
   no attempt to lay the blame upon the tempter, or upon providence; no
   dwelling upon circumstances, the suddenness of the temptation, or the
   hastiness of one's temper. "Oh God," says the sinner, " I have sinned
   myself; I have nothing in the world that is so truly my own as my own
   sin. For this my sin, I alone am accountable, and I feel it, and I
   cannot, I dare not impeach any one else with being guilty of my sin. I
   must stand in my own person before thee, O God, even if that involves
   my eternal ruin." It will never do for you to lay the blame on your
   mothers and fathers because they did not teach you better, upon the
   minister for not being earnest enough, or upon your master for telling
   you to do wrong. It is true that we may be partakers of your sins in a
   measure, but if you be sincerely penitent, the guilt which will strike
   you will not be another man's guilt, nor another man's share in your
   sin, but your own guilt. A sinner has not been brought truly before the
   Lord in humble contrition, unless his cry is "Lord! I have sinned, I
   have sinned so as to be guilty myself, in my own person. Have mercy
   upon me!"

   The unhappy young woman now condemned to die needed no witness to come
   forward to prove her guilt and ensure her conviction. No one saw the
   deed; it was done so secretly that the most expert detectives were not
   able to find a satisfactory clue to the mystery. There may be
   collateral evidence to support her confession; it may, or it may not be
   true that her conviction would now have been certain had her confession
   been retracted; but she did not need that, for without any voice of man
   to witness she witnessed against herself. It will never suffice for us
   merely to confess to the Lord what other people have seen, and to feel
   guilty because we know that the case is reported in the neighborhood.
   Many people who have fallen into sin, have felt very penitent because
   they knew they should damage their names, or lose their situations; but
   to have your private sin brought before you by conscience, and
   voluntarily without any pressure but the burden of sin itself and the
   work of the Holy Spirit, to come before God and say, "Lord, thou
   knowest in this matter I have offended, and though none saw me except
   thine eye and mine; yet thine eye might well flash with anger at me,
   while mine shall be wet with many a tear of penitence on account of
   it:" that is what you need, Sinner, thou must come before God now and
   let out thine heart without any external pressure. Spontaneously must
   thy soul flow out, poured out like water before the Lord, or thou must
   not hope that he will give thee pardon.

   She confessed all. It was a solemn moment when the judge said, "I must
   repeat to you, that you are charged with having wilfully,
   intentionally, and with malice killed and murdered your brother. Are
   you guilty or not guilty?" Yes, she was guilty, just as the judge had
   put it. She did not object to those words which made the case come out
   so black. The willfulness?--yes, she acknowledged that. The intention,
   the malice?--yes, all that. The killing, the murdering--was it just
   murder?--was it nothing less? No, nothing else. Not a word of
   extenuation. She acknowledges all, just as the judge puts it. She is
   guilty in very deed of the whole charge. Sinner, will you confess sin
   as God puts it? Many will confess sin after their own fashion, but will
   you confess it as God puts it? Are you brought to see sin as God sees
   it? as far as mortal eye could bear that dreadful sight, and do you
   confess now just what God lays to your door, that you have been his
   enemy, a traitor, full of evil, covered with iniquity? Will you confess
   that you have crucified his dear Son, and have in all ways deserved his
   hottest wrath and displeasure--will you plead guilty to that? If not,
   you shall have no pardon; but if you will do this, he is merciful and
   just to forgive you your sins through Jesus the great atoning
   sacrifice.

   She had not, nor had her counsel for her, a single word to say by way
   of apology; in fact, at her request, one supposed excuse was utterly
   discarded: "She wishes me to say that she was not driven to this act,
   as has been asserted, by unkind treatment at home, as she met with
   nothing there but tender and forbearing hove." Her counsel might have
   said she was very young--it was hoped that her youth might plead for
   her. Being young, she might be readily led astray by an evil
   passion--might not that excuse her? It was long ago, and her confession
   was her own; she had brought herself there into that dock--might not
   this be a reason for mercy? Nothing of the kind. The judge might think
   so if he pleased, but there was nothing said for her about that, nor
   did she desire that it should be suggested. She might secretly hope,
   but her confession was so thorough, that there was not a single word to
   sully its clear stream. So, sinner, if you come before God, you must
   not say, "Lord, I am to be excused because of my position--I was in
   poverty, and I was tempted to steal; or, I had been in bad company, and
   so I learned to blaspheme; or, I had a hard master, and so I was driven
   to sin to find some pleasure there." No; if you are really penitent,
   you will find no reason whatever why you should have sinned, except the
   evil of your own heart, and that you will plead as an aggravation, not
   as an excuse. "Guilty! guilty! guilty! am I, O God, before thy face; I
   offer no excuse, no extenuation. Thou must deal with me upon pure
   mercy, if thou dost save me, for justice can only award me my
   well-deserved doom."

   Notice that when she was asked whether she had anything to say why
   sentence of death should not be passed upon her, there was still a
   solemn silence. Was there no reason to be given why the dreadful
   sentence of being hanged by the neck until dead, should not be passed
   upon a young and weeping girl? She did not so much as hint at one. I
   remember well the time when I thought there was no reason why the
   flames of hell should not consume me, and why the crushing weight of
   God's wrath should not roll over me for ever and for ever. Methinks
   every sinner who has really come to Christ, has been made to feel that
   however angry God may be with sin, he is not one whit too angry. Until
   we know the power of divine grace, we read in the Bible concerning
   eternal punishment, and we think it is too heavy and too hard, and we
   are apt to kick against it, and find out some heretic or other who
   teaches us another doctrine; but when the soul is really quickened by
   divine grace, and made to feel the weight of sin, it thinks the
   bottomless pit none too deep, and the punishment of hell none too
   severe for sin such as it has committed. This is not the emotion of a
   mind rendered morbid by sickness, but these are the genuine workings of
   God the Holy Ghost in the soul, bringing the man to stand guilty before
   the Lord, with his mouth closed, not able to say a word against the
   sentence of divine justice. May God bring such there who have never
   been there yet!

   In the confession, as we read the story, there was much tenderness. I
   do not wonder that the judge exhibited deep emotion, who could help it?
   Remember, I am not pretending to know her heart, I am only judging the
   externals; as far as the externals went there seemed to be a great
   brokenness of spirit. She appeared really to know what guilt meant, and
   to stand there with this resolve upon her soul, that though she could
   not make any atonement for her crime, she would acknowledge it
   honestly, and accordingly she confessed it as one who felt within her
   own soul the terrible weight of her guilt. This is the manner in which
   we must stand before God if we would find mercy. It is all very well
   for us to use fine language, but words alone are worthless. Those words
   which come fresh from your lips, dictated by your own heart, because
   the Holy Ghost is there, will suffice if the heart be in them. It is to
   the contrite that the promise is given. Look to Jesus for contrition,
   for without it there is no pardon.

   II. Thus we have tried, as far as we could, to bring out the
   distinctions which pertain to confessions, and now let us have a word
   or two upon THE EXERCISE OF THE PREROGATIVE OF MERCY ON GOD'S PART.

   "Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin." In every case where there is a
   genuine, gracious confession, mercy is freely given. There is a notion
   abroad, that confession deserves mercy. We read in the papers such
   remarks as these, "expiating sin by confession," or, "made such
   atonement as he could by confessing his sin." Confession makes no
   atonement in any shape whatever. There is no one single word in that
   law which I read to you this morning, in the twentieth of Exodus, about
   the possibility of taking away sin by mere confession. Justice has but
   one rule, and that is, sin must be punished. If the sinner violates
   law, law in the case of man may remit the penalty, but in the case of
   God never. The attributes of God are not like the qualities of man,
   they never come into collision with one another, nor do they abridge
   the sphere of each other. The justice of God is as awful and
   all-reaching as if he had not a grain of mercy, while the mercy of God
   is as unrestrained and Almighty as if he were utterly unjust. The
   reason why sin can be forgiven in the case of a penitent sinner is,
   because for that sinner Jesus Christ has borne the full weight of all
   the wrath which his sin deserves. The fire-cloud of Jehovah's wrath was
   waiting for the sinner--the sinner must receive the whole of its dread
   discharge; but for every sinner that repenteth and believeth in him
   Christ stood beneath that terrible cloud, and all the lightning was
   discharged on him. He suffered as incarnate God, all the chastisement
   which was due to his people. The grief of our Saviour we can never
   tell: the woes of Gethsemane and Gabbatha and Golgotha are not to be
   expressed, but they were accepted by God in the stead of all the
   suffering and grief which the law most righteously claimed on every
   law-breaker. And now, through what Christ Jesus has done, the eternal
   mercy of God comes streaming forth in perfect consistency with justice.
   Mercy provided the great substitute, and now mercy with loving heart
   calls upon sinners repenting and believing, and assures them that all
   sin is put away through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Let every sinner
   know, then, that although his repentance does not deserve mercy, the
   God of love has been pleased to promise free pardon to all those who
   believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, because Christ deserves it. Pardon is
   given to penitent sinners as a matter of justice, as well as mercy,
   because of the throes, and grief, and agonies of the Divine Redeemer.

   How consistent it is with the nature of things that penitent sinners,
   and penitent sinners only should obtain mercy through Jesus Christ!
   When you read the story of the man who made no confession till it was
   forced out of him, although you can respond to his wish, "Fellow
   creatures, pray for me," you cannot feel much sympathy, if any, with
   him. His conduct seems to harden one's heart against him, not merely
   because of his guilt, but because of the lie of his confession, But,
   when you read the other story, although it contains no request to pray,
   you find you do not want one for your heart cries at once, "Father
   forgive her;" and you think within yourself, "If the prerogative of
   mercy can be exercised in this case, let it be." If it were put to a
   show of hands of all our country whether the law should be executed on
   Constance Kent, I think we should all say "Let the penitent sinner
   live." Great was her offense, and no excuse is to be offered for her,
   as she offers none for herself. It was a great and dreadful crime,
   which must be a blight upon her all her days, yet, let her be spared
   for she has confessed most fully--not on the ground of justice, but on
   the ground that this seems to be a case in which, if the prerogative of
   mercy is to be sovereignly exercised at all, it should now have free
   scope. Methinks when the eternal God sees a poor sinner standing before
   himself, and hears him cry, "I am guilty, Lord! I am guilty through and
   through! I alone am guilty! I have broken thy law! If thou smite me
   thou art just! My heart is broken because I have sinned. I cannot be
   more wretched than I now am, for sin is my plague and my misery; and
   while I confess it I do not think that my confession has any merit in
   it. Save me for Jesus' sake!" "Why, methinks," the mighty God says, "I
   have brought that soul, through my grace, into a state in which it is
   ready to receive the precious gift of justification and pardon through
   the blood of my dear Son."

   See how one grace gives a fitness for another. The sinner is brought to
   Jesus, his heart is broken, and then it is ready to be bound up. The
   penitent sinner has paid honour to the prerogative of the law-giver. He
   has, as far as he could do so, dethroned the law-giver by his sin, but
   now by his confession he restores him to his throne. Such a sinner
   knows the bitterness of sin, and knowing its bitterness, he will hate
   it for the future. If he be pardoned, he will not go back as the dog to
   his vomit, or the sow that is washed to her wallowing in the mire. This
   pardoned sinner will not take to himself the credit of having been
   pardon by his confessions, he will not go abroad and talk lightly of
   his sin, he will be sure to speak much of the leniency of the Law-giver
   and the power of Jesus' precious blood; he will admire evermore, even
   in eternity, the mighty grace which pardoned such as he is. On the
   other hand, if man were forgiven, and no true penitence wrought in him,
   what would be the result? Why, it would be turning wolves loose upon
   society. Methinks if God gave forgiveness to men without working a work
   of grace in them by which they are brought to repentance, it would be
   offering a premium for sin, it would be breaking down the floodgates
   which restrain vice, it would be destroying all the excellent fruits
   which free grace is intended to produce. What! is the man to be
   pardoned for all the past and to remain without repentance for his evil
   ways? Then will he make the future just as the past has been; nay, he
   will sin with a higher hand and with a stronger arm, because he sees
   with what impunity he may rebel. What! shall a proud, unhumbled sinner
   rejoice in the forgiving love of the Father? Then will he arrogantly
   boast that there was not much evil in his sin after all; he will be no
   singer to the praise of sovereign grace, but rather, with the boastful
   lips of the legalist he will render unto himself praise for the
   dexterous manner in which he has escaped from the condemnation due to
   sin. God will give pardon to those only to whom he gives repentance,
   for it were unsafe to give it elsewhere. God bring us down and lay us
   in the dust, for then, and then only, are we prepared to hear him say,
   "Thy sins, which are many, are forgiven thee."

   I take it for granted that there are some here who will say, "I wish I
   could repent. I know that it would not merit eternal life. I understand
   that faith--faith in Jesus Christ is the way by which I must be saved,
   but I would be humbled on account of sin." My dear friend, your desire
   to be humble may perhaps he an indication that you are already in that
   condition; but, if you are lamenting your hardness of heart, I will
   suggest two or three things. Remember your past sins. I do not want you
   to write out a list of them all, there is not paper enough in this
   world for that, but let some of them start out before your memory, and
   if they do not make you blush, they might to do so. Next think over all
   the aggravations of those sins. Recollect the training you had as a
   child. You were blessed with godly parents. Remember the providential
   warnings you received. Think of the light and knowledge against which
   you have offended; that tenderness of conscience against which you
   kicked. Then I beg you to consider against what a God you have
   offended, so great, so good, so kind, who has never done you a
   displeasure, but has been all generosity and kindness to you till this
   day. Your offenses have been insults against the King of heaven. Your
   transgressions have been undermining, as far as they could, the throne
   of the eternal majesty. Look at sin in the light of God, to be humbled.
   And if this will not do it, let me pray that God the Holy Spirit may
   take you to the foot of the cross. Remember, that in order that sin
   might be put away, it was necessary that God should be veiled in human
   flesh. No one else could bear the load of sin but God, and he only
   could bear it by becoming man. See the suffering of the Saviour when
   "despised and rejected." Mark the spitting, the shame, the smiting.
   Watch his wounds;

   "Count the purple drops, and say,

   'Thus must sin be wash'd away.'"

   And surely, if God the Holy Ghost bless it, such a meditation will make
   thee see the blackness and vileness of sin. John Bradford said, that
   when he was in prayer, he never liked to rise from his knees till he
   began to feel something of brokenness of heart. Get thee up to thy
   chamber, then, poor sinner, if thou wouldst have a broken and contrite
   spirit, and come not out until thou hast it. Remember, that thou wilt
   never feel so broken in heart as when thou canst see Jesus bearing all
   thy sins. Faith and repentance are born together, and aid the health of
   each other.

   "Law and terrors do but harden,

   All the while they work alone;

   But a sense of blood-bought pardon,

   Will dissolve a heart of stone."

   Go as you are to Christ, and ask him to give that tenderness of heart
   which shall be to you the indication that pardon has come; for pardon
   cannot and will not come unattended by a melting of soul and a hatred
   of sin. Wrestle with the Lord! say, "I will not let thee go except thou
   bless me." Get a fast hold upon the Saviour by a vigorous faith in his
   great atonement. Oh! may his Spirit enable thee to do this! Say in thy
   soul, " Here I will abide, at the horns of the altar; if I perish I
   will perish at the foot of the cross. From my hope in Jesus I will not
   depart; but I will look up still and say, Saviour, thy heart was broken
   for me, break my heart! Thou wast wounded, wound me! Thy blood was
   freely poured forth, for me, Lord let me pour forth my tears that I
   should have nailed thee to the tree. O Lord, dissolve my soul; melt it
   in tenderness, and thou shalt be for ever praised for making thine
   enemy thy friend."

   May God bless you, and make you truly repent, if you have not repented;
   and, if you have, may he enable you to continue in it all your days,
   for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

                                Withholding Corn

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JULY 30, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE
   METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He that withholds corn, the people shall curse him but blessing shall
   be upon the head of him that sells it."

   Proverbs 11:26.

   IF I dared, I would always preach upon the comfortable promises and
   gracious doctrines of God's Word. I find it most delightful and easy
   work to expatiate upon those themes of Revelation which abound in
   sweetness and are full of savor and preciousness to the child of God. I
   said, "If I dared," and you will ask me why I dare not? The answer is
   because I have a solemn conviction on my mind that if I would be clear
   of the blood of all men I must strive to make my range of ministry as
   wide as the range of Revelation and I must not shun to declare the
   whole counsel of God. I feel bound to go not where my wishes would lead
   me, but where Holy Scripture has made a track for my feet.

   There are certain texts in the Scriptures which are very seldom
   preached upon because it is thought that there is little Gospel in them
   and that the people, when they go home, will say to one another, "Well,
   I wasn't fed this morning." Those who aim at pleasing men may well be
   shy of such subjects. But I hold that since God, in His wisdom has
   placed these passages in the Bible, He intends His servants, the
   preachers of the Word, to expound them.

   We are, it strikes me, not to preach from selections of Scripture only,
   but from the whole of the Sacred Volume, for "All Scripture is given by
   inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
   correction, for instruction in righteousness--that the man of God may
   be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works." I freely confess
   that I do not know why I have selected this text this morning except
   that it haunted and hunted me until I could not forbear to preach upon
   it.

   It seemed to force itself upon me and to bore its way into my soul like
   a rifle shot. I thought it over and over and could not make much of it
   until I yielded up myself to it, saying within myself, "If the Lord has
   anything to say to the people out of my mouth, here it is--let Him use
   it." If there should be any persons among our country friends, or our
   corn-dealing townsmen who this morning feel at all touched by the text,
   I cannot help it. Here is my Master's message to them and I can only
   deliver it with the best intentions, hoping that those to whom it comes
   home may be profited by it.

   It will, however, soon be clear to you that the verse before us has,
   besides its first meaning, a weight of very important spiritual
   teaching in it to which we shall all do well to take heed. The text, as
   it stands, has to do, as you clearly see, with owners of corn and
   dealers in it.

   In Solomon's days there were very frequent famines. Communication
   between one nation and another was so extremely difficult that the
   transportation of wheat in any large quantities was not attempted.
   Therefore, if a failure in the crops occurred in one district, the
   scarcity in that neighborhood was not compensated by abundance in
   another and terrible famines prevailed. Certain persons in those days
   not only stored up all the corn which grew in their own fields, but
   purchased as much as they could of others, so as to raise the market
   above its natural level. This, under the circumstances, was a very high
   affront put upon God--for instead of bearing their part in His
   judgments, these men enriched themselves by the poverty of their
   starving neighbors.

   There have been such people ever since Solomon's day and although the
   present system of free trade has nearly put an end to that kind of
   thing, there are doubtless some who would again withhold their corn,
   even at famine prices, if they could rise the price still higher. How
   does Scripture deal with this peculiar form of greed in trade? I cannot
   but admire the wonderful reserve of Holy Scripture, for as Mr. Arnot
   well observes, "in this brief maxim no arbitrary rule is laid down to
   the possessor of corn that he must sell at a certain period and at a
   certain price--and yet the hungry are not left without a protecting
   law.

   "The protection of the weak is entrusted not to small police
   regulations, but to great self-acting providential arrangements. The
   double fact is recorded in terms of peculiar distinctness that he who
   in times of scarcity keeps up his corn in order to enrich himself is
   loathed by the people, and he who sells it freely is loved. This is
   all. There is no further legislation on the subject."

   Our narrow wisdom might have wished for some definite law upon the
   subject--something like a sliding scale--but the great Ruler of Heaven
   and earth falls into no such error. Laws which interfere between buyer
   and seller, master and workman by any form of law, are blunders and
   nuisances. Parliaments and princes have hung on to the antiquated
   absurdity of regulating prices, but the Holy Spirit does nothing of the
   kind. All the attempts of men to control the price of bread and wheat
   is sheer folly, as the history of France may well prove. The market
   goes best when it is left alone and so, in our text, there is no law
   enacted and no penalty threatened except that which the nature of
   things makes inevitable.

   God knows political economy, whether men do or not, and leaving the
   coarse machinery of police regulations He puts the offender under a
   form of self-acting legislature which is far more efficient. The text
   seems to say, "Well, if you have no love to your neighbor and choose to
   keep your wheat, I make no law to break open your granary or pull down
   your ricks, but you will most certainly gain the hatred, contempt and
   curse of the people among whom you dwell." You see, dear Friends, that
   the man may do as he pleases about selling or not, but he cannot escape
   from the curse of the people if he chooses to lock up his grain.

   And on the other hand if he will sell at a proper price, or, as another
   translation reads it, break his bread, that is to say, give it to the
   starving if they cannot buy it, he will receive blessings not only from
   the people but from Heaven itself. Brethren, it is a matter of fact
   that any man of any observation must have seen--that there is no
   transaction which ever brings such ill-will upon a man, such general
   condemnation, especially from the poor--as withholding the corn. Common
   consent condemns the hoarder and human nature revolts at his offense.
   Ask anyone you choose to meet, except he is himself deep in the same
   mire, and he will join you in crying out against it.

   Of course there are many ways of defending the deed, but there is no
   way of escaping the fact that the people curse the doer of it in their
   hearts. "Well," says one, "it is my own corn, I may do as I like with
   it." Just so, nobody said you could not. Nobody disputed your
   rights--only you are warned that in hoarding it you are sure to get the
   people's curse. You cannot alter that. It will follow and hang about
   your heels, and as far as the fact is known it will make men curl the
   lip at you and sneer if they are your equals--while the working men,
   deep in their hearts--will abhor you. No matter how kind you may be to
   the poor in other matters, nor how you may have given your money in
   other ways--your holding the corn will be a scorn among your enemies
   and an offense to your best friends.

   It is not always an ill sign when the voice of the people is against a
   man, but in this case Scripture endorses it and he who dares to run the
   risk is none too wise. "Ah," says another, "I do not see the wrong of
   withholding. There are laws of supply and demand and the preacher does
   not understand political economy." The preacher, however, thinks he
   does understand it and even if he does not a child can comprehend the
   text before him and with what we have to deal just now. Solomon here
   tells you that if you like to carry out political economy in the
   withholding way, you will get cursed for it, and depend upon it, YOU
   WILL!

   Facts are stubborn things and this is one that withholding corn earns
   me the curse of the people and that is what no Christian man would wish
   to bear. "But what business is that of the preacher's?" He answers that
   he thanks God that he has no share in it whatever, but he is set in his
   place to rebuke what God rebukes and he is doing no more than
   expounding God's own Word upon the matter. Whether you hear or forbear,
   there is the Truth of God and may the Lord bless it to you.

   "Well, we ought not to hear such things on Sundays." What? Not read our
   Bibles on Sundays--not explain the meaning of a text on Sundays? You
   would not have heard me on a Monday, some of you, and therefore you
   have it today! Do not be angry with the text, but look at it and read
   it--and then afterwards choose as you will. "He that withholds corn,"
   God says, "the people shall curse him." And if you wish to have
   ill-will and the bad word of thousands of poor cottagers and all others
   who have human sympathies, then withhold your corn. Thank God, the
   worst monopolizer cannot do much mischief nowadays, for, by the
   gracious Providence of God which has burst the fetters of commerce we
   are not likely to feel any very great shortage of bread in this
   country.

   Should our own crops fail, the harvests of other lands supply the
   masses with their food. The crime is growing scarcer and scarcer. But,
   if any cases still survive and men choose to follow so ruinous a
   course, they will get cursed for it in mutterings deep, if silent, and
   in sneers as bitter as they are well-deserved. By your leave I shall
   now take a step above my text, using it as a ladder to mount to a yet
   higher Truth of God. If it brings a curse upon a man to withhold the
   bread which perishes, what a weight of curse will light upon that man
   who withholds the bread of Eternal Life!

   If the people shall curse the man who keeps back the bread which merely
   sustains the body, what shall be the withering denunciations which
   shall overwhelm the soul of him who deals deceitfully with the bread of
   Eternal Life? That seems to me to be a fair deduction from the text and
   at that Truth we will aim this morning.

   First, I shall attempt to show the ways in which the Bread of Life may
   be withheld from the people and the curse which will follow. Secondly,
   I shall try to depict the blessedness of the man who "breaks it," as
   another translation has it, to the people. And, then, thirdly we shall
   conclude by opening our own granaries and breaking some of this bread
   among the assembled multitude.

   I. First, he that withholds the Bread of Life will surely get the
   people's curse upon him. How CAN THIS BE DONE?

   1. It may be readily accomplished by locking up the Word of God in an
   unknown language, or by delivering and preaching it in such a style
   that the people shall not comprehend it. The Romish Church for many
   years kept the sacred Scriptures in an unknown tongue and resisted all
   attempts to translate the Book of God into the vulgar language of the
   people. What a curse Rome has had resting on her head! To those who
   know the enormity of this wickedness in holding back the Word of Life,
   it is scarcely possible to think of Rome without invoking judgment upon
   her.

   What myriads of souls went down to the pit perishing through lack of
   knowledge during what were called the Dark Ages! What fearful
   imprecations they must be uttering even now upon Popes and Cardinals
   and priests who had the key of the kingdom, but would neither enter
   themselves nor suffer others to enter there! They had the light but
   they concealed it in a dark lantern and the nations were compelled to
   sit in the darkness of profound ignorance and superstition because they
   would not give them the light. Surely the people shall curse such
   forever!

   But are these the only offenders? Is not their crime prolonged by those
   ministers who aim at delivering themselves in an oratorical style, with
   flowers of rhetoric far too fine to be reached by the common people? We
   have heard of some and we fear we know some who would rather round a
   period than win a soul! To them it is the first and the last object to
   deliver refined thoughts in elegant and elaborate language and, having
   so done, having soared aloft on the spread-eagle's wing far out of
   sight, they are content to have dazzled the many and displayed
   themselves. Truly such men withhold the corn!

   What can the poor countrymen and servants, who are sitting in the
   aisles, make out of their eloquence? What can the workers who come in
   to hear something that may do them good, make out of their outlandish
   big talk? The terms of theology, the phrases of art, the definitions of
   philosophy, the jargon of science are all unknown tongues to the young
   godly farmer or praying shopkeepers. "Alas!" he says, "this does not
   come to me--I cannot understand it." Possibly, in their ignorance, some
   people think the high-flyers very learned men--but in reality they are
   far from it--for plainness of speech is a better sign of learning than
   high-sounding words and soaring sentences.

   Oh, dear Friends, when we preach the Gospel plainly I am sure we have
   our reward! When preaching in some village chapel or from a wagon in a
   field, it is no small delight to watch the faces of the men in smock
   frocks and the women in their print gowns, as they catch or feel the
   force of an inspired Truth of God! Plain speech wins their blessing.
   But to stand and talk right over the people's heads--what is it but
   having the corn and keeping it from those who want it? Simplicity is
   the authorized style of true Gospel ministry. "Having this ministry,"
   says the Apostle, "we use great plainness of speech."

   The common people heard the Master gladly--which they would not have
   done if He had spoken in high-flown language. Whitfield, the Prince of
   Preachers, was mainly so because of the market language which he used.
   Let all of us who have the Bread of Life try to be very plain. You who
   write tracts, or preach in the streets--or you that teach children--
   break the large slices of Truth into small pieces and crack the shells
   of the hard nuts. Take away the crust for the babes and pick out the
   stones from the fruit. Beware, lest in seeking an excess of refinement
   you withhold the corn and win the people's curses!

   2. But secondly, we may fall into this sin by keeping back the most
   important and vital Truths of Revelation and giving a prominence to
   other things which are but secondary. My Brethren, if I were to stand
   in this pulpit and for the next few months address you upon moral
   precepts, the excellence of virtue, or the faultiness of vice--if you
   could come out of this place and say, time after time, "We hear nothing
   about Jesus Christ! We do not know whether there is a Holy

   Spirit." If I were gifted with ever so much ability and if these were
   my themes, however earnestly I pressed them, I should be guilty of
   withholding the corn, the true food of souls.

   Morality brings no food to hungry souls although it is a good thing in
   its place. Dissuasives from vice are not the Bread of Heaven, though
   well enough in their way. We need to have the great Doctrines of Grace
   brought forward, for the Word of God is the sword of the Spirit and it
   is by preaching the Truth as it is in Jesus that souls are won to Him.
   I grieve to think how indistinct some preachers are upon the Doctrines
   of Grace--they dare not say, "election," or if they do they tremble
   directly and guard their words with shields so huge that the poor Truth
   is crushed beneath them!

   As to final perseverance, effectual calling, particular redemption, or
   any of those grand Truths of God where the fatness and savor and marrow
   of the Gospel is to be found--you may listen to some of them from the
   beginning of January to the end of December without hearing a word!
   This will not do--this is taking away the backbone from the spiritual
   man--it is tearing away the vitals of the Gospel! It is giving to the
   people husks for wheat and straw and chaff, instead of corn! Above all,
   that ministry is an abomination which puts Jesus Christ in the
   background.

   My Brothers, we must not only hear something about Jesus Christ, but
   our preaching must be mainly about Him. He must be its head and
   feet--no, let me say, in some sense--He must be all that the preacher
   has to preach. Christ Crucified must be the general summary of his
   ministry. And he must he able to say, when he retires from it and is
   called up higher, "I have preached Christ. Of the things which I have
   spoken, this is the sum--I have preached my Master and what my Master
   gave me."

   my Brethren, what a guilty ministry is that in which the blood has no
   place--the ministry which denies or undervalues the atoning sacrifice
   of the great Redeemer! God have mercy upon us that we have not preached
   this fundamental truth so earnestly as we ought to have done! But by
   His Grace we can still plead before Him and say we have truly desired
   to do it--

   "Ever since by faith I saw the stream His flowing wounds supply,
   Redeeming lo ve has been my theme, And shall be till I dee."

   What is the use of any ministry of which that is not true? It is
   withholding corn and in eternity the lost will curse their destroyer.

   But we must not talk about ministers of whom there are not many
   here--we will come down to you. Many of you are Sunday school
   teachers--now you can sin in this way in the very same sense. Suppose
   as a Sunday school teacher you are content with making the little ones
   read through the lesson, satisfied with filling up the hour or the
   hour-and-a-half and feeling you have done a good deal in making the
   little fellows sit still and so on. Ah, my Brother and Sister, it is
   very solemn work. You have undertaken to teach these young immortals
   and if you are satisfied with just making them go through the routine,
   take heed, lest when they grow up they come to curse you!

   1 am afraid that many Sunday school addresses have no Gospel in them! I
   do not see why the same Gospel should not be preached to children as to
   grown-up people. I think it should. To stand up in a Sunday school and
   say, "Now, be good boys and girls and God will love you," is telling
   lies! I know the teachers of our school feel the importance of
   delivering the Truth of God as it is in Jesus to their children and you
   therefore tell them, "You are lost and ruined and your salvation is in
   Jesus Christ--look to Him and live!"

   The teacher whose general teaching is not full of Christ will be called
   to a sad account in the day when Christ shall come. Dear Teachers of
   the school, whatever you do not know, do know your Lord--and whatever
   you cannot get into the youngsters' heads, do make it a matter of
   prayer that you may get a knowledge of Christ and His atoning blood
   into their young hearts by the Holy Spirit. The same is also true of
   those of our beloved friends who conduct Bible classes, or who in any
   way teach the people.

   I do not know that I have any necessity to say this to the most of you
   here, but still I will say it for the good of oth-ers--you must not, my
   Brethren, get away from your great theme. It is of no use to go to the
   people empty-handed. We must take them bread--we only mock them by
   offering them stones--if we talk to them about the histories and
   precepts of Scripture and forget the Cross. Let our teaching be full of
   Grace and Truth--let us deliver our souls every doctrine as we find it
   in Scripture and let us be determined that if men perish it shall not
   be for want of knowing the way of salvation.

   3. We may withhold the Bread of Life, dear Friends, by a want of loving
   in our labor. The mere telling out the plan of salvation is of no great
   service. God may bless it, but He does not often do so. That which God
   blesses to the saving of sinners is Truth attended by the earnestness
   of the speaker--the loving anguish of a heart which stirs the
   preacher's soul. What shall I say here? For if I speak, I do but
   condemn myself. Think of the preaching of Baxter. He preached for many
   years but he said he never went into his pulpit without his knees
   knocking together! And Martin Luther said the same.

   Truly it is enough to make any man tremble when he feels that he is
   God's mouth to immortal souls. "If they perish and you warn them not,
   their blood will I require at your hands." Surely this ought to give a
   melting heart and streaming eyes to God's ministers! But, I say, I
   remember reading of Baxter's ministry--oh what pleading before was in
   it! The man seemed as if he never would go out of the pulpit till his
   hearers had received the Truth! He wept and sighed and sobbed unless
   they came to Jesus Christ.

   You know how he followed them to their houses, watched them through the
   streets of Kidderminster, and would give them no rest till they thought
   about eternal things and he was privileged thus to break the Bread of
   Life to many thousands, although his body was as full of physical pain
   as his heart was of holy anxiety! O for something of Mr. Baxter's
   spirit to make us love the souls of men as he did! We are guilty of
   withholding corn unless we preach with a sympathizing, loving, tender,
   affectionate, earnest, anxious soul!

   Brothers and Sisters, you are, most of you, doing something for Jesus
   Christ. Let me, therefore, put this very plainly to you. If you get
   through your work for God as a mere matter of form--however true may be
   that which you have to say and however carefully you may deliver
   it--yet still if the Truth you deliver is not delivered with holy
   anxiety, with earnestness, with fervor, with love, with affection, and
   above all, if it is not attended with prayer-- take heed lest in some
   day to come you get the curse of those from whom you withheld the
   bread!

   How would you like, Sunday school Teachers, to see a lad in your class
   grow up and go into sin? How would you like to meet him some day on a
   sick bed when his vices had at last brought him to his end? How would
   you like that he should look into your face and say, "Ah, Teacher, you
   were never earnest with me--you told me the Truth, but you told it to
   me so coldly that I did not believe it! If I had seen one tear in your
   eyes, I think there would have been one in mine. If I thought you felt
   what you were saying, I sometimes think I should have felt it, too.

   "But you merely kept me still and told me it all as if it were no great
   matter. And so I doubted the whole and from doubt went on to unbelief
   and ran into sin--and here I am. O that you had wept over me as
   such-and-such a teacher did with my brother! How different is my
   brother from what I am! He was in another class and his teacher took
   him before God in prayer--prayed with him as well as for him--told him
   the Truth of God! But he did more--he labored to drive it home as with
   a great hammer, while he pleaded with him to lay hold on Eternal Life.
   Teacher, would to God that you had been more earnest with me."

   Beloved, seek to rid yourselves of any future regrets in this matter!
   It is no small satisfaction when you hear the death-bell toll, to say,
   "Well, I did all I could for that soul and whether it is in Heaven or
   Hell, my conscience is clear." You cannot save, but still, God, who
   works by means, may make you the instrument of conveying salvation to
   sinners-- or, on the other hand, you may be made instruments of
   unrighteousness through whom Satan may harden these children's hearts,
   even to their everlasting ruin.

   I use the example of a Sunday school teacher, but I intend the remarks
   for every worker. O let us work for God with our whole hearts! God make
   us more awfully in earnest! Life is earnest, death is earnest, Heaven
   is earnest, Hell is earnest, Christ is earnest, God is earnest--let us
   be clad with zeal, as with a cloak--and go forth to serve the Lord with
   all our soul and strength as His Holy Spirit shall enable us.

   4. Fourthly, we may be found guilty of withholding corn by refusing to
   labor zealously for the spread of the kingdom of Christ and the
   conversion of sinners. I am afraid that the churches of the past were
   not altogether without a curse because of their deficiency in the
   matter of missions and home evangelization. During the pastorate of my
   venerated predecessor, Dr. Gill, this Church, instead of increasing,
   gradually decreased. And although the age in which he lived was honored
   with many great and excellent men, yet the state of our own
   denomination and the Presbyterian body and the Independent body in
   England was most lamentable.

   Many of the churches were gradually sliding into Unitarianism and the
   simple Gospel of Jesus Christ was scarcely preached, or, where
   preached, it was without any power whatever--and I take it that the
   reason was very much that the churches were content to be edified
   themselves, but had no hearts of compassion for the perishing
   multitudes around and abroad.

   But mark this--from the day when Fuller, Carey, Sutcliffe and others,
   got together to send out missionaries to India, the sun began to dawn
   of a gracious revival which is not over yet! Bad as the state of the
   churches now is, yet it is marvelously an improvement upon anything
   before the age of missions. Though not as zealous as we ought to be,
   the zeal of Christendom is one hundred times greater than it was then.
   And, as for what is done for winning souls, Brethren, the churches now
   are like a garden of the Lord compared with what they were then.

   I believe that the neglect of sending the Word to the heathen brought a
   blight and a curse upon the churches which is now happily removed. Yet
   even today we find professors who are always doubting. They never get
   beyond--

   " 'Tis a point I long to know."

   There they stick and never know whether they are saved or not. Full
   assurance is to be a tempting morsel which they have not yet tasted.
   Their eyes do not sparkle with heavenly delight. They know not what it
   is to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Their raptures
   are very few, their joys very shallow. I will tell you why. In almost
   every case these people do nothing for souls. They withhold the corn
   and therefore they get this curse in their souls that they shall not
   enjoy their own religion because they do not want to lead other people
   into it!

   If you put your hands into your pockets and say, "Well, glory be to
   God. I trust I am one of the elect and whatever becomes of the rest of
   mankind really is not my concern. Every man for himself, I say"--that
   is such an unchristian spirit, so antagonistic to the whole life of
   Jesus Christ--that if you get sorely whipped in Providence, I can only
   hope you may be blessed by it! But I would not pray that the rod may be
   removed until you are scourged into a better temper. Give me the
   Christian who says, "I bless God I am saved! Now what can I do for
   others?"

   The first thing in the morning he prays, "God help me to say a word to
   some soul this day." During the day, wherever he may be, he is watching
   his opportunity and will do good if he can. He is concerned about his
   children--it sometimes breaks his heart to think that they are not
   saved. If he happens to have an ungodly wife, it is his daily burden,
   "Oh God, save my wife!" When he goes to a place of worship he does not
   expect the minister to make sermons always on purpose for him, but he
   says, "I shall sit here and pray God to bless the Word," and if he
   looks round the Chapel and sees one that he loves, he prays for him,
   "God send the Word home to him."

   When service is over, a man of this kind will waylay the unconverted
   and try to get a personal word with them, and see if he cannot discover
   some beginnings of Divine Grace in their souls. This is how earnest
   Christians live. And let me tell you, as a rule, though they have the
   griefs of other men's souls to carry, they do not have much grief about
   their own. As a rule their Master favors them with the light of His
   Countenance. They are watering others and they are watered themselves,
   also. May this be your work and mine!

   But some of you say nothing for Christ at all. You are too timid, you
   say. And others of you are too indifferent, too thoughtless about
   others. Oh, the opportunities many of you have lost! Oh, the many who
   have died to whom you might have spoken, but you did not! Oh, the
   people that are now in the darkness of ignorance who get no light from
   you! You have light, but you keep it. They are dying and you have the
   healing medicine but you will not tell them of it! May God deliver you
   from the curse of those who thus withhold the corn!

   We will only mention one more form of this evil. Some may be said to be
   guilty of withholding the corn because while they themselves do not
   speak for Christ, they do not help those who can. No Christian man
   ought to go to bed with an easy conscience if he has thousands of
   pounds which he does not need which are unused for God. There must be
   many Christians in this rich country who have not consecrated their
   substance to the Lord. When a man can say, "I have money which I really
   do not need, and my children do not require it," and this is money
   absolutely needed for God's cause, ought he to keep it from the Lord
   Jesus?

   Must you confess that so many missionaries might be sent out tomorrow
   if you just wrote a check and handed it over to the proper
   Society--then why not do it? A destitute neighborhood needs a place of
   worship and if I can build it if I would, how am I to answer for it to
   my Lord? I cannot understand how a man can love God when he only lives
   to heap up riches! I can with great difficulty imagine such a case, but
   I fear that such cannot be real piety. It seems to me that if I have
   any religion in my soul, it will make me not only say with Dr. Watts--

   " Were the whole realm of Nature mine,
   That were a present far too small!
   Love so amazing, so Divine
   Demands my soul, my life, may all,"

   but I think it would make me carry it out.

   I will not propose to you that you should act indiscreetly in giving so
   as to beggar your families, or deprive yourselves of what is necessary!
   You know I am not so foolish. But I am speaking to many Christians who
   have not only enough to spare, but who will continue to accumulate and
   accumulate and accumulate and I cannot think that they can feel that
   they are doing right in the sight of God. O God! This great city needs
   preachers, needs the Gospel--thousands need even bread to keep them
   from starving--and yet many of Your professing people are heaping their
   coffers higher and higher!

   Why surely, if I do this, I am heaping up wrath against the Day of
   Wrath, and I shall find it come into my bosom hot and fierce from the
   God of Sabaoth to whom my gold and my silver will cry out against me!
   Let us not be guilty of this, but each in our own station, as far as we
   can, let us be aiding others to preach the Word if we cannot preach it
   ourselves. Dozens of young men are desirous to enter our College and
   you can help them to go forth to preach, if you cannot preach yourself.

   II. I am pleased to turn to the other subject for a minute or two. I am
   to speak upon THE BLESSEDNESS WHICH

   THOSE POSSESS WHO BREAK THE BREAD OF LIFE. To describe it is altogether
   beyond my power, you must know and taste, and feel it, Beloved. There
   are many blessings in doing good to others. God is a good Paymaster--He
   pays His servants while at work as well as when they have done it. And
   one of His payments is this--an easy conscience. If you have spoken
   faithfully to only one person, when you go to bed at night you feel
   happy in thinking, "I have this day discharged my conscience of that
   man's blood."

   You do not know how delightful a Sunday evening is to some of us when
   God has helped us to be faithful! How sweet to feel, "I have made many
   blunders, shown many infirmities of the flesh and so on, but I have
   preached the Gospel and preached it with my whole heart to the best of
   my ability." One feels' a burden taken off one's back and there is a
   joy and satisfaction unknown to those who sit at home doing nothing.
   You in your class at the Sunday school--I know you feel, when Sunday is
   over, though it is a very hard day's work for some of you after the six
   days' toil in the week, you feel--"I thank God I did not spend that
   afternoon in lolling about at home, but I did speak a word for Jesus."
   You will find such a peace of mind that you would not give it up for
   all the world.

   Then there is a great comfort in doing something for Jesus. Look into
   His face--what would you not do for Him? When first converted did you
   not think you could do ten thousand things for Jesus? The moment your
   burden was off your back and your sins forgiven, how you felt you could
   follow Him through floods and flames! Have you lived up to your
   resolutions, Brethren? Have you kept up to your own ideas of Christian
   duties? I do not suppose any of us can say that we have. Still, what
   little we have done has been an unspeakable delight when we have felt
   that we have been crowning His head and strewing palm branches in His
   path.

   O what a happiness to place jewels in His crown and give Him to see of
   the travail of His soul! Beloved, there is a very great reward in
   watching the first buds of conviction in a young soul! To say of that
   girl in the class, "She seems so tender of heart, I do hope that there
   is the Lord's work there." To go home and pray over that boy who said
   something in the afternoon to make you think he must know something
   more than he seemed to know! Oh, the joy of hope! But as for the joy of
   success--it is unspeakable! I recollect the first soul that God ever
   gave me--she is in Heaven now--but I remember when my good deacon said
   to me, "God has set His seal on your ministry in this place, Sir."

   Oh, if anybody had said to me, "Somebody has left you twenty thousand
   pounds," I should not have given a snap of my fingers for it compared
   with that joy which I felt when I was told that God had set His seal on
   my ministry! "Who is it?" I asked. "Why, it is a poor laboring man's
   wife! She went home broken-hearted by the sermon two or three Sundays
   ago and she has been in great trouble of soul. But she has found peace
   and she says she would like to speak to you." I felt like the boy who
   has earned his first guinea! Like a diver who has been down to the
   depths of the sea and brought up a rare pearl--I prize each one whom
   God has given me--but I prize that woman most!

   Since then my God has given me many thousands of souls who profess to
   have found the Savior by hearing or reading words which have come from
   my lips. Well, this joy, overwhelming as it is, is a hungry sort of
   joy--you want more of it--for the more you have of spiritual children,
   the more your soul desires to see them multiplied. Let me tell you that
   to be a soul-winner is the happiest thing in this world and with every
   soul you bring to Jesus Christ you seem to get a new Heaven here upon
   earth! But what will be the joy of soul-winning when we get up above!
   What happiness to the Christian minister to be saluted on his entrance
   into Heaven by many spiritual children!

   They will call him, "Father," for though they are not married nor given
   in marriage, though natural relations are all over, yet spiritual
   relations last forever. Oh, how sweet is that sentence, "Enter you into
   the joy of your Lord." Do you know what the joy of Christ is over a
   saved sinner? You cannot guess it! You would need to know the griefs He
   suffered to save that sinner. O the joys He must feel when He sees that
   sinner saved as the result of His griefs--this is the very joy which
   you and I are to possess in Heaven--"Enter you into the joy of your
   Lord."

   Yes, when He mounts the Throne, you shall mount with Him! When the
   Heaven rings with, "Well done, well done," you shall partake in the
   reward! You have toiled with Him! You have suffered with Him! You shall
   now reign with Him! You have sown with Him--you shall reap with Him!
   You were despised with Him--you shall now be honored with Him! Your
   face was covered with sweat like His, and your soul was grieved for the
   sins of men as His soul was--now shall your face be bright with
   Heaven's splendor as is His Countenance! And now shall your soul be
   filled with beatific joys even as His soul is! He that breaks bread,
   blessings shall be upon his head.

   III. Now I have to open the GRANARY for a minute. Hungry Sinners
   wanting a Savior, we cannot withhold the bread from you! You may never
   come to hear the Gospel again. We, therefore, will open the granary
   very wide. Christ Jesus, the Son of God, became Man to save men, and
   inasmuch as God's wrath was due to sin, Christ took the sin of all who
   have ever believed, or ever shall believe on Him and, taking all their
   sins, He was punished in their place, so that God can now justly
   forgive sin because Christ was punished in the place of sinners and
   suffered Divine Wrath for them.

   Now this is the way of salvation--that you trust this Son of God with
   your soul. And, if you do so, then know that your sins are now forgiven
   you and that you are saved! Concerning this salvation, hear just these
   few words. It is a satisfying salvation. Here is all that you can want.
   Your conscience shall be at ease forever if you believe in Jesus--your
   biggest sins shall no longer trouble you! Your blackest iniquities
   shall no longer haunt you. Believing in Jesus, every sin you have of
   thought, and word, and deed shall be cast into the depths of the sea
   and never shall be mentioned against you any more forever.

   It is an all-sufficient salvation, too. However great your sins,
   Christ's blood can take them all away. However deep your needs, Christ
   can supply them. You can not be so big a sinner as He is a Savior. You
   may be the worst sinner out of Hell, but you are not too great for Him
   to remove--He can carry elephantine sinners upon His shoulders and bear
   gigantic mountains of guilt upon His head into the wilderness of
   forgetfulness. He has enough for you, however deep your necessity. It
   is, moreover, a complete salvation. Sovereign Mercy does not stand on
   the mountain and cry to you, "Climb up here and I will save you!"
   Eternal Mercy comes down the valley to you just where you are and meets
   your case just as it is--and never leaves you till it has made you meet
   to be a partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light!

   Christ does not want you to pay one talent out of the hundred and
   promise to pay for you the ninety-nine. He will discharge all your
   debts of sin! All that you need to take you up to Heaven is provided in
   Jesus. This is a present salvation--a salvation which, if it comes to
   you, will save you NOW! You shall be a child of God this very hour and
   before that clock shall strike again you shall rejoice in the peace
   which the Spirit of God gives you, if you believe on Him.

   It is an available salvation, freely presented to you in Christ Jesus.
   Remember the text of two or three Sundays ago-- "Whoever will, let him
   take of the water of life freely." Jesus casts out none that come to
   Him. Oh that you may be led to come this morning!

   Thus have I tried to avoid the sin of withholding corn. And if any in
   this House of Prayer have been guilty of it, I pray you avoid the curse
   of the people and seek the blessing of the Most High God by this day
   endeavoring to scatter everywhere the Bread of Life! Go and work for
   God wherever you have an opportunity and help us in our prayers and
   efforts to send forth more laborers into the harvest, for the harvest
   truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few. Amen.

                               No Tears In Heaven

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, AUGUST 6, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes." Revelation 7:17.

   IT is an ill thing to be always mourning, sighing and complaining
   concerning the present. However dark it may be, we may surely recall
   some fond remembrances of the past. There were days of brightness,
   there were seasons of refreshing from the Presence of the Lord. Be not
   slow to confess, O believing Soul, that the Lord has been your help!
   And though now your burden is very heavy, you will find an addition to
   your strength in the thought of seasons long since past when the Lord
   lightened your load and made your heart leap for joy.

   Yet more delightful will it be to expect the future. The night is dark,
   but the morning comes. Over the hills of darkness the day breaks. It
   may be that the road is rough but its end is almost in view. You have
   been clambering up the steep heights of Pisgah and from its brow you
   may view your glorious heritage. True, the tomb is before you, but your
   Lord has snatched the sting from death, and the victory from the grave.
   Do not, O burdened Spirit, confine yourself to the narrow miseries of
   the present hour, but let your eyes gaze with fondness upon the
   enjoyment of the past and view with equal ardor the infinite blessings
   of old eternity when you were not, but when God set you apart for
   Himself and wrote your name in His Book of Life!

   Let your glance flash forward to the future eternity, the mercies which
   shall be yours even here on earth and the glories which are stored up
   for you beyond the skies. I shall be well rewarded this morning if I
   shall minister comfort to one heavy spirit by leading it to remember
   the Glory which is yet to be revealed.

   Coming to our text, we shall observe, in the first place, that as God
   is to wipe away tears from the faces of the glorified, we may well
   infer that their eyes will be filled with tears till then. And in the
   second place, it is worthy of reflection that as God never changes,
   even now He is engaged in drying tears from His children's eyes. And
   then, coming right into the heart of the text we shall dwell upon the
   great Truth of God, that in Heaven Divine Love removes all tears from
   the glorified. And so we shall close by making some inquiry as to
   whether or not we belong to that happy company.

   I. Our first subject of meditation is the inference that TEARS ARE TO
   FILL THE EYES OF BELIEVERS UNTIL THEY ENTER THE PROMISED REST. There
   would be no need to wipe them away if there were none. They come to the
   very gates of Heaven weeping and accompanied by their two comrades,
   Sorrow and Sighing. The tears are dried and Sorrow and Sighing flee
   away. The weeping willow grows not by the river of the Water of Life,
   but it is plentiful enough below. Nor shall we lose it till we change
   it for the palm branch of victory. Sorrow's dewdrop will never cease to
   fall until it is transformed into the pearl of everlasting bliss--

   "The path of sorrow and that path alone, Leads to the place where
   sorrow is unknown."

   Religion brings deliverance from the curse, but not exemption from
   trial. The ancients were accustomed to use bottles in which to catch
   the tears of mourners. I think I see three bottles filled with the
   tears of Believers. The first is a common bottle, the ordinary
   lachrymatory containing griefs incidental to all men, for Believers
   suffer even as the rest of the race. Physical pain by no means spares
   the servants of God. Their nerves, blood vessels, limbs and inward
   organs are as susceptible to disease as those of unregenerate men. Some
   of the choicest saints have lain longest on beds of sickness and those
   who are dearest to the heart of God have felt the heaviest blows of the
   chastening rod.

   There are pains which, despite the efforts of patience, compel the
   tears to wet the cheeks. The human frame is capable of a fearful degree
   of agony and few there are who have not at some time or other watered
   their couch with tears because of the acuteness of their pains. Coupled
   with this are the losses and crosses of daily life. What Christian
   among you trades without occasional difficulties and serious losses?
   Have any of you a lot so easy that you have nothing to deplore? Are
   there no crosses at home? Are there no troubles abroad?

   Can you travel from the first of January to the last of December
   without feeling the weariness of the way? Have you no blighted field,
   no bad debt, no slandered name, no harsh word, no sick child, no
   suffering wife to bring before the Lord in weeping prayer? You must be
   an inhabitant of another planet if you have had no griefs, for man is
   born to trouble as the sparks fly upwards! No ship can navigate the
   Atlantic of earth without meeting with storms--it is only upon the
   Pacific of Heaven that all is calm forevermore.

   Believers must, through much tribulation, inherit the kingdom of
   Heaven. "Trials must and will befall." Death contributes to our woes.
   The heirs of immortality are often summoned to gather around the tomb.
   Who has not lost a friend? If Jesus wept, expect not that we shall be
   without the tears of bereavement. The well-beloved Lazarus died and so
   will our choicest friends. Parents will go before us. Infants will be
   snatched from us. Brothers and sisters will fall before the scythe of
   Death. Impartial foe of all, you spare neither virtue nor vice,
   holiness nor sin--with equal foot you tread on the cherished loves of
   all!

   The Christian also knows disappointments as bitter and as keen as other
   men. Judas betrays Christ. Ahithophel is a traitor to David. We have
   had our Ahithophels and we may yet meet with our Judas. We have trusted
   in friends and we have found their friendships fail. We have leaned
   upon what seemed a staff and it has pierced us like a spear. You
   cannot, dear Friends, traverse the wilderness of this world without
   discovering that thorns and thistles grow plenteously in it and that,
   step as you may, your feet must sometimes feel their power to wound.
   The sea of life is salt to all men. Clouds hover over every landscape.
   We may forget to laugh but we shall always know how to weep. As the
   saturated fleece must drip, so must the human race, cursed by the Fall,
   weep out its frequent griefs.

   I see before me a second bottle, it is black and foul for it contains
   tears distilled by the force of the fires of sin. This bottle holds
   more than the first and is far more regularly filled. Sin is more
   frequently the mother of sorrow than all the other ills of life put
   together. Dear Brothers and Sisters, I am convinced that we endure more
   sorrow from our sins than from God's darkest Providences. Mark our
   rebellions want of resignation! When a trouble comes it is not the
   trial which makes us groan so much as our rebellion against it. It is
   true the ox goad is thrust into us, but we kick against it and then it
   hurts us far more. Like men with naked feet, we kick against the
   pricks. We head our vessel against the stream of God's will and then
   murmur because the waves beat violently upon us!

   An unsubdued will is like a maniac's hand which tears himself. The
   chastisements which come directly from our heavenly Father are never so
   hard to bear as the fretting and fuming of our unhumbled self-will. As
   the bird dashes against the wires of its cage and breaks its own wing,
   even so do we! If we would take the cross as our gracious Father gives
   it, it would not gall our shoulders--but since we revolt from it and
   loathe the burden--our shoulders grow raw and sore and the load becomes
   intolerable. More submission, and we should have fewer tears.

   There are the tears, too, of wounded, injured pride--and how hot and
   scalding they are! When a man has been ambitious and has failed, how he
   will weep instead of standing corrected, or gathering up his courage
   for a wiser venture! When a friend has spoken slightingly of us, or an
   enemy has accused us, how we have had to put our fingers to our hot
   eyelids to keep the tears from streaming out--and have felt all the
   while as full of wretchedness as we well could be. Ah, these are cruel
   and wicked tears! God wipe them away from our eyes now! Certainly He
   must do it before we shall be able to enter Heaven!

   How numerous, too, are the tears of unbelief! We manufacture troubles
   for ourselves by anticipating future ills which may never come, or
   which, if they do come, may be like the clouds--all "big with mercy,"
   and "breaking with blessings on our head." We get to supposing what we
   should do if such-and-such a thing occurred, which thing God has
   determined never shall occur. We imagine ourselves in positions where
   Providence never intends to place us, and so we feel a thousand trials
   in fearing one.

   That bottle, I say, ought never to carry within it a tear from a
   Believer's eyes and yet it has had whole floods poured into it! Oh, the
   wickedness of mistrust of God and the bitterness with which that
   distrust is made to curse itself! Unbelief makes a rod for its own
   back. Distrust of God is its own punishment. It brings such want of
   rest, such care, such tribulation of spirit into the mind that he who
   loves himself and loves pleasure had better seek to walk by faith and
   not by sight. Nor must I forget the scalding drops of anger against our
   fellow men, and of petulance and irritation because we cannot have our
   way with them. These are black and horrid tears--as noisome as the
   vaults of Tophet. May we be saved from such unholy tears.

   Sometimes, too, there are streams which arise from depressed
   spirits--spirits desponding because we have neglected the means of
   Divine Grace and the God of Grace. The consolations of God are small
   with us because we have been seldom in secret prayer--we have lived at
   a distance from the Most High and we have fallen into a melancholy
   state of mind. I thank God that there shall never come another tear
   from our eyes into that bottle when eternal love shall take us up to
   dwell with Jesus in His kingdom!

   We would never overlook the third bottle which is the true crystal
   lachrymatory into which holy tears may drop, tears like the "lachrymae
   Christi," the tears of Jesus so precious in the sight of God. Even
   these shall cease to flow in Heaven! Tears of repentance, like
   glistening dewdrops fresh from the skies, are stored in this bottle.
   They are not of the earth--they come from Heaven--and yet we cannot
   carry them there with us. Good Rowland Hill used to say repentance was
   such a sweet companion that the only regret he could have in going to
   Heaven was in leaving repentance behind him. He could not shed the
   tears of repentance there.

   Oh, to weep for sin! It is so sweet a sorrow that I would wish to be a
   constant weeper! Like a dripping well, my soul would always drop with
   grief that I have offended my loving, tender, gracious God! Tears for
   Christ's injured honor and slightedness glisten in the crystal of our
   third bottle. When we hear Jesus' name blasphemed among men, or see His
   cause driven back in the day of battle, who will not weep? Who can
   restrain his lamentations? Such tears are diamonds in Christ's esteem!
   Blessed are the eyes which are mines of such royal treasure! If I
   cannot win crowns I will at least give tears. If I cannot make men love
   my Master, yet will I weep in secret places for the dishonor which they
   do Him.

   These are holy drops, but they are all unknown in Heaven. Tears of
   sympathy are much esteemed by our Lord-- when we "weep with those that
   weep" we do well. These are never to be restrained this side the
   Jordan. Let them flow! The more of them the better for our spiritual
   health. Truly, when I think of the griefs of men, and above all, when I
   have communion with my Savior in His suffering, I want to cry with
   George Herbert--

   "Come all you floods, you clouds, you rains, Dwell in my eyes! My grief
   has need
   Of all the watery things that nature can produce! Let every vein suck
   up a river to supply my eyes, My weary, weeping eyes, too dry for me,
   Unless they get new conduits, fresh supplies, And with my state agree."

   It were well to go to the very uttermost of weeping if it were always
   of such a noble kind as fellowship with Jesus brings. Let us never
   cease from weeping over sinners as Jesus did over Jerusalem. Let us
   endeavor to snatch the firebrand from the flame and weep when we cannot
   accomplish our purpose. These three receptacles of tears will always be
   more or less filled by us as long as we are here.

   But in Heaven the first bottle will not be needed, for the wells of
   earth's grief will all be dried up and we shall drink from living
   fountains of water unsalted by a tear. As for the second, we shall have
   no depravity in our hearts and so the black fountain will no longer
   yield its nauseous stream. And as for the third, there shall be no
   place among celestial occupations for weeping even of the most holy
   kind. Till then we must expect to share in human griefs and instead of
   praying against them, let us ask that they may be sanctified to us.

   I mean, of course, those of the former sort. Let us pray that
   tribulation may work patience and patience experience and experience
   the hope which makes us not ashamed. Let us pray that as the sharp edge
   of the engraving tool is used upon us it may only remove our filth and
   fashion us into images of our Lord and Master. Let us pray that the
   fire may consume nothing but the dross and that the floods may wash
   away nothing but defilement. May we have to thank God that though
   before we were afflicted we went astray, yet now, by His Grace, we have
   kept His Word. And so shall we see it to be a blessed thing, a divinely
   wise thing, that we should tread the path of sorrow and reach the gates
   of Heaven with the tear drops glistening in our eyes.

   II. Secondly, EVEN HERE IF WE WOULD HAVE OUR TEARS WIPED AWAY WE CANNOT
   DO BETTER THAN RETURN TO OUR GOD. He is the great tear wiper. Observe,
   Brethren, that God can remove every vestige of grief from the hearts of
   His people by granting them complete resignation to His will. Our
   selfhood is the root of our sorrow. If self were perfectly conquered it
   would be insignificant to us whether love ordained our pain or ease
   appointed us wealth or poverty. If our will were completely God's will,
   then pain itself would be attended with pleasure and sorrow would yield
   us joy for Christ's sake.

   As one fire puts out another, so the master passion of love to God and
   complete absorption in His sacred will quenches the fire of human grief
   and sorrow. Hearty resignation puts so much honey in the cup of gall
   that the wormwood is forgotten. As Death is swallowed up in victory, so
   is Tribulation swallowed up in complacency and delight in God. He can
   also take away our tears by constraining our minds to dwell with
   delight upon the end which all our trials are working to produce. He
   can show us that they are working together for good and as men of
   understanding, when we see that we shall be essentially enriched by our
   losses, we shall be content with them!

   When we see that the medicine is curing us of mortal sickness and that
   our sharpest pains are only saving us from pains far more terrible,
   then shall we kiss the rod and sing in the midst of tribulation, "Sweet
   affliction! Sweet affliction!" And rightly so, since it yields such
   peaceable fruits of righteousness. Moreover, He can take every tear
   from our eyes in the time of trial by shedding abroad the love of Jesus
   Christ in our hearts more plentifully. He can make it clear to us that
   Christ is afflicted in our affliction. He can indulge us with a
   delightful sense of the Divine virtue which dwells in His sympathy and
   make us rejoice to be co-sufferers with the Angel of the Covenant.

   The Savior can make our hearts leap for joy by reassuring us that we
   are written on the palms of His hands and that we shall be with Him
   where He is. Sick beds become thrones and hovels ripen into palaces
   when Jesus is made sure to our souls. My Brethren, the love of Christ,
   like a great flood, rolls over the most rugged rocks of afflictions--so
   high above them that we may float in perfect peace where others are a
   total wreck! The rage of the storm is all hushed when Christ is in the
   vessel. The waters saw You, O Christ! The waters saw You and were
   silent at the Presence of their King!

   The Lord can also take away all present sorrow and grief from us by
   providentially removing its cause. Providence is full of sweet
   surprises and unexpected turns. When the sea has ebbed its uttermost,
   it turns again and covers all the sand. When we think the dungeon is
   fast and that the bolt is rusted in, He can make the door fly open in a
   moment! When the river rolls deep and black before us He can divide it
   with a word, or bridge it with His hands. How often have you found it
   so in the past? As a pilgrim to Canaan you have passed through the Red
   Sea in which you once feared you would be drowned.

   The bitter wells of Marah were made sweet by God's Presence! You fought
   the Amalekite. You went through the terrible wilderness. You passed by
   the place of the fiery serpents and you have yet been kept alive and so
   shall you be! As the clear shining comes after rain, so shall peace
   succeed your trials. As fly the black clouds before the compelling
   power of the wind, so will the eternal God make your griefs to fly
   before the energy of His Grace. The smoking furnace of trouble shall be
   followed by the bright lamp of consolation.

   Still, the surest method of getting rid of present tears is communion
   and fellowship with God. When I can creep under the wing of my dear God
   and nestle close to His bosom, let the world say what it will and let
   the devil roar as he pleases and let my sins accuse and threaten as
   they may--I am safe, content, happy, peaceful, rejoicing--

   "Let earth against my soul engage,
   And hellish darts be hurled.
   Now I can smile at Satan's rage,
   And face a frowning world."

   To say, "My Father, God." To put myself right into His hands and feel
   that I am safe there. To look up to Him though it is with tears in my
   eyes and feel that He loves me--and then to put my head right into His
   bosom as the prodigal did and sob my griefs out there into my Father's
   heart--oh, this is the death of grief and the life of all consolation!

   Is not Jehovah called the God of All Comfort? You will find Him so,
   Beloved. He has been "our help in ages past." He is "our hope for years
   to come." If He had not been my help, then my soul would have perished
   utterly in the day of its weariness and its heaviness, Oh, I bear
   testimony for Him this day that you cannot go to Him and pour out your
   heart before Him without finding a delightful solace!

   When your friends cannot wipe away the tears--when you yourself with
   your strongest reasoning and your boldest efforts cannot constrain
   yourself to resignation--when your heart beats high and seems as if it
   would burst with grief-- then pour out your hearts before Him! God is a
   refuge for us! He is our castle and high tower, our refuge and defense.
   Only go to Him and you shall find that even here on earth God shall
   wipe away all tears from your eyes!

   III. Now we shall have to turn our thoughts to what is the real
   teaching of the text, namely THE REMOVAL OF ALL TEARS FROM THE BLESSED
   ONES ABOVE. There are many reasons why glorified spirits cannot weep.
   These are well known to you, but let us just hint at them. All outward
   causes of grief are gone. They will never hear the toll of the death
   knell in Heaven. The mattock and the shroud are unknown things there.
   The horrid thought of death never flits across an immortal spirit. They
   are never parted. The great meeting has taken place to part no more.

   Up yonder they have no losses and crosses in business. "They serve God
   day and night in His Temple." They know no broken friendships there.
   They have no ruined hearts, no blighted prospects. They know even as
   they are known, and they love even as they are loved. No pain can ever
   fall on them--as yet they have no bodies! But when their bodies shall
   be raised from the grave they shall be spiritualized so that they shall
   not be capable of grief. The tear glands shall be plucked away.
   Although much may be there that is human, at least the tear glands
   shall be gone--they shall have no need of that organ.

   Their bodies shall be unsusceptible to grief. They shall rejoice
   forever! Poverty, famine, distress, nakedness, peril, persecution,
   slander--all these shall have ceased. "The sun shall not light on them,
   nor any heat." "They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more,"
   and therefore well may their tears cease to flow. Again, all inward
   evils will have been removed by the perfect sanctification worked in
   them by the Holy Spirit. No evil heart. No unbelief in departing from
   the living God shall vex them in Paradise! No suggestions of the arch
   enemy shall be met and assisted by the uprisings of iniquity within.
   They shall never be led to think harshly of God, for their hearts shall
   be all love--sin shall have no sweetness to them for they shall be
   perfectly purified from all depraved desires.

   There shall be no lusts of the eyes, no lusts of the flesh, no pride of
   life to be snares to their feet. Sin is shut out and they are shut in.
   They are forever blessed because they are without fault before the
   Throne of God! What a Heaven must it be to be without spot, or wrinkle,
   or any such thing! Well may they cease to mourn who have ceased to sin!
   All fear of change also has been forever shut out. They know that they
   are eternally secure. Saints on earth are fearful of falling. Some
   Believers even dream of falling away. They think God will forsake them
   and that men will persecute and take them.

   No such fears can vex the blessed ones who view their Father's face.
   Countless cycles may revolve, but eternity shall not be exhausted. And
   while eternity endures, their immortality and blessedness shall
   co-exist with it. They dwell within a city which shall never be
   stormed! They bask in a sun which shall never set! They swim in a
   flood-tide which shall never ebb! They drink of a river which shall
   never dry up! They pluck fruit from a tree which shall never be
   withered! Their blessedness knows not the thought, which would act like
   a canker at its heart, that it might, perhaps, pass away and cease to
   be!

   They cannot, therefore, weep because they are infallibly secure and
   certainly assured of their eternal blessedness. Why should they weep
   when every desire is gratified? They cannot wish for anything which
   they shall not have. Eyes and ears, heart and hands, judgment,
   imagination, hope, desire, will--every faculty shall be satisfied! All
   that their vast powers can wish, they shall continually enjoy! Though,
   "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard the things which God has prepared for
   them that love Him," yet we know enough, by the Revelation of the
   Spirit, to understand that they are supremely blessed! The joy of
   Christ, which is an infinite fullness of delight, is in them. They
   bathe themselves in the bottomless, shoreless sea of infinite
   beatitude!

   Still, dear Friends, this does not quite account for the fact that all
   tears are wiped from their eyes. I like better the text which tells us
   that God shall do it and I want you to think with me of fountains of
   tears which exist even in Heaven, so that the celestial ones must
   inevitably weep if God did not by a perpetual miracle take away their
   tears. It strikes me, that if God Himself did not interfere by a
   perpetual outflow of abundant consolations, the glorified have very
   deep cause for weeping. You will say, "How is this?" Why, in the first
   place, if it were not for this, what regrets they must have for their
   past sins. The more holy a man is, the more he hates sin. It is a token
   of growth in sanctification, not that repentance becomes less acute but
   that it becomes more and more deep.

   Surely, dear Friends, when we shall be made perfectly holy, we shall
   have a greater hatred of sin! If on earth we could be perfectly holy,
   why, I think we should do little else than mourn to think that so foul
   and black and venomous a thing as sin had ever stained us! We should
   weep bitterly that we had ever offended such a good, gracious, tender,
   abundantly loving God. Why, the sight of Christ, "the Lamb in the midst
   of the Throne," would make us remember the sins from which He purged
   us. The sight of our heavenly Father's perfection would be blinding to
   us if it were not that by some sacred means, which we know not, God
   wipes away all these tears from our eyes.

   And though we cannot but regret that we have sinned, yet perhaps we
   will know that sin has been made to glorify God by the overcoming power
   of almighty Grace--that sin has been made to be a black foil--a sort of
   setting for the sparkling jewel of eternal, Sovereign Grace! And it may
   be that for this reason we shed no tears over our past lives. They
   sing, "Unto Him that has loved us, and washed us from our sins in His
   blood." But they sing that heavenly song without a tear in their eyes.
   I cannot understand how this may be, for I know I could not do so as I
   now am--let this be the best reason that God has wiped away the tears
   from their eyes.

   Again, do you not think, Beloved, that the thought of the vast expense
   of shame and woe which the Savior lavished for our redemption must, in
   the natural order of things, be a constant source of grief? We sing
   sometimes that hymn which reminds us of the angelic song before the
   Throne and in one of its verses the poet says--

   "But when to Calvary they turn,
   Silent their harps abide.
   Suspended songs a moment mourn
   The God that loved and died."

   Now that is natural and poetical, but it is not true! You know very
   well that there are no suspended songs in Heaven and that there is no
   mourning even over Christ "that loved and died."

   It seems to me that if I were thoroughly spiritualized and in such a
   holy state as those are in Heaven, I could not look at the Lamb without
   tears in my eyes. How could I think of those five Wounds--that bloody
   sweat in Gethsemane? That cruel crowning with thorns in Gabbatha--that
   mockery and shame at Golgotha--how could I think of it without tears?
   How could I feel that He loved me and gave Himself for me without
   bursting into a passion of holy affection and sorrow? Tears seem to be
   the natural expression of such hallowed joy and grief--

   "Love and grief my heart dividing,
   With my tears His feet I'll bathe."

   I must think it would be so in Heaven if it were not that by a glorious
   method, I know not how, God shall wipe away even those tears from our
   eyes! Does it not need the interference of God to accomplish this
   wonder? Is there not another cause for grief, namely, wasted
   opportunities? Beloved, when we once ascend to Heaven there will be no
   more feeding of Christ's hungry people. There will be no giving of
   drink to the thirsty. No visiting His sick ones, or His imprisoned
   ones. No clothing of the naked. There will be no instructing the
   ignorant. No holding forth the Word of God among "a crooked and
   perverse generation."

   It has been often and truly said if there could be regrets in Heaven,
   those regrets would be that we have wasted so many opportunities of
   honoring Christ on earth--opportunities which will then be gone
   forever. Now in Heaven their hearts are not steeled and hardened so
   that they can look back upon sins of omission without sorrow. I believe
   there will be the most tender form of conscience there--for perfect
   purity would not be consistent with any degree of hardness of heart. If
   they are sensitive and tender in heart, it is inevitable that they
   should look back with regret upon the failures of the life
   below--unless some more mighty emotion should overwhelm that of
   contrition.

   I can say, Beloved, if God would take me to Heaven this morning, if He
   did not come in and by a special act of His Omnipotence dry up that
   fountain of tears, I should almost forget the glories of Paradise in
   the midst of my own shame! Shame that I have not preached more
   earnestly and have not prayed more fervently and labored more
   abundantly for Christ. That text, to which we heard a reference from a
   dear Brother during the week, where Paul says, "I call God to witness
   that for the space of three years I ceased not night and day with
   tears, to warn every one of you," is a text that we cannot, any of us,
   read without blushes and tears.

   And in Heaven, I think if I saw the Apostle Paul, I must burst out in
   weeping if it were not for this text, which says that, "God shall wipe
   away all tears"--and these among them. Who but the Almighty God could
   do this! Perhaps, again, another source of tears may suggest itself to
   you--namely, regrets in Heaven for our mistakes and misrepresentations
   and unkindnesses towards other Christian Brethren. How surprised we
   shall be to meet in Heaven some whom we did not love on earth! We would
   not commune with them at the Lord's Table. We would not own that they
   were Christians at all!

   We looked at them suspiciously if we saw them in the street. We were
   jealous of all their operations. We suspected their zeal as being
   nothing better than rant and we looked upon their best exertions as
   having sinister motives at the bottom. We said many hard things and
   felt a great many more than we said. When we shall see these unknown
   and unrecognized Brethren in Heaven, will not their presence naturally
   remind us of our offenses against Christian love and spiritual unity? I
   cannot suppose a perfect man looking at another perfect man, without
   regretting that he ever ill-treated him-- it seems to me to be the
   trait of a gentleman, a Christian and of a perfectly sanctified man
   above all others, that he should regret having misunderstood and
   misconstrued and misrepresented one who was as dear to Christ as
   himself.

   I am sure, as I go round among the saints in Heaven, I cannot (in the
   natural order of things) help feeling, "I did not assist you as I ought
   to have done. I did not sympathize with you as I ought to have done. I
   spoke a hard word to you. I was estranged from you." And I think you
   would all have to feel the same--inevitably you must if it were not
   that by some heavenly means, I know not how--the eternal God shall so
   overshadow Believers with the abundant bliss of His own self that even
   that cause of tears shall be wiped away!

   Has it never struck you, dear Friends, that if you go to Heaven and see
   your dear children left behind unconverted, it would naturally be a
   cause of sorrow? When my mother told me that if I perished she would
   have to say, "Amen," to my condemnation, I knew it was true. And it
   sounded very terrible and had a good effect on my mind. But at the same
   time I could not help thinking, "Well, you will be very different from
   what you are now," and I did not think she would be improved. I
   thought, "Well, I love to think of your weeping over me far better than
   to think of you as a perfect being, with a tearless eye, looking on the
   damnation of your own child."

   It really is a very terrible spectacle, the thought of a perfect being
   looking down upon Hell, for instance, as Abraham did and yet feeling no
   sorrow. For you will recollect that in the tones in which Abraham
   addressed the rich man, there is nothing of pity. There is not a single
   syllable which betokens any sympathy with him in his dreadful woes. And
   one does not quite comprehend that perfect beings, God-like beings,
   beings full of love and everything that constitutes the Glory of God's
   complete Nature, should yet be unable to weep, even over Hell itself!
   They cannot weep over their own children lost and ruined! Now, how is
   this? If you can tell me, I shall be glad--for I cannot tell you.

   I do not believe that there will be one atom less tenderness, that
   there will be one fraction less of amiability and love and sympathy--I
   believe there will be more--but that they will be in some way so
   refined and purified that while compassion for suffering is there,
   detestation of sin shall be there to balance it and a state of complete
   equilibrium shall be attained. Perfect acquiescence in the Divine will
   is probably the secret of it. But it is not my business to guess--I do
   not know what handkerchief the Lord will use. But I know that He will
   wipe all tears away from their faces and these tears among them.

   Yet, once again, it seems to me that spirits before the Throne, taking,
   as they must do, a deep interest in everything which concerns the honor
   of the Lord Jesus Christ, must feel deeply grieved when they see the
   cause of Truth imperiled and the kingdom of Christ, for a time, put
   back. Think of Luther, or Wickliffe, or John Knox as they see the
   advances of Popery just now. Take John Knox first, if you will. Think
   of him looking down and seeing cathedrals rising in Scotland, dedicated
   to the service of the Pope and Satan. Oh, how the stern old man, even
   in Glory, I think, would begin to shake himself! And the old lion would
   lash his sides once more and half wish that he could come down and pull
   the nests to pieces that the rooks might fly away.

   Think of Wickliffe looking down on this country where the Gospel has
   been preached so many years and seeing monks in the Church of England
   and seeing spring up in our national establishment everywhere, not
   disguised Popery as it was ten years ago, but stark naked Popery,
   downright Popery that unblushingly talks about the "Catholic Church,"
   and is not even Anglican any longer! What would Wickliffe say? Why, I
   think as he leans over the battlements of Heaven, unless Wickliffe is
   mightily altered and I cannot suppose he is (except for the better and
   that would make him more tender-hearted and more zealous for God
   still), he must weep to think that England has gone back so far and
   that on the dial of Ahaz the sun has beat a retreat.

   I do not know how it is they do not weep in Heaven, but they do not.
   The souls under the altar cry, "How long? How long? How long?" There
   comes up a mighty intercession from those who were slaughtered in the
   days gone by for Christ--their prayer rises, "How long? How long? How
   long?" And God, as yet, does not avenge His own elect though they cry
   day and night unto Him. Yet that delay does not cost them a single
   tear. They feel so sure that the victory will come! They anticipate so
   much the more splendid triumph because of its delay and therefore they
   do both patiently hope and quietly wait to see the salvation of God!
   They know that without us they cannot be made perfect and so they wait
   till we are taken up, that the whole company may be completed and that
   then the soul may be dressed in its body and they may be perfected in
   their bliss--they wait but they do not weep. They wait and they cry,
   but in their cry no sorrow has a place.

   Now I do not understand this. It seems to me that the more I long for
   the coming of Christ, the more I long to see His kingdom extended--the
   more I shall weep when things go wrong--when I see Christ blasphemed,
   His Cross trampled in the mire and the devil's kingdom established! But
   the reason is all in this, "God shall wipe away all tears from their
   eyes." I thought I would just indicate to you why it says that God does
   it. It strikes me that these causes of tears could not be removed by an
   angel--could not be taken away by any form of spiritual enjoyment apart
   from the direct interposition of Almighty God.

   Think of all these things and wonder over them and you will recall many
   other springs of grief which must have flowed freely if Omnipotence had
   not dried them up completely. Then ask how it is that the saints do not
   weep and do not cry, and you cannot get any other answer than this--God
   has done it in a way unknown to us--forever taking away from them the
   power to weep.

   IV. And now, Beloved, SHALL WE BE AMONG THIS HAPPY COMPANY? Here is the
   question and the context enables us to answer it. "They have washed
   their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb." There is
   their character. "Therefore are they before the Throne of God." The
   blood is a sacred argument for their being there, the precious blood.
   Observe, "they washed their robes." It was not merely their feet, their
   worst parts--but they washed their robes, their best parts. A man's
   robes are his most honored attire. He puts them on and he does not mind
   our seeing his robes. There may be filthiness beneath, but the robes
   are generally the cleanest of all. But you see they washed even them.

   Now it is the mark of a Christian that he not only goes to Christ to
   wash away his black sins, but to wash his duties, too. I would not pray
   a prayer unwashed with Jesus' blood. I would not like a hymn I have
   sung to go up to Heaven except it had first been bathed in blood. If I
   would desire to be clothed with zeal as with a cloak, yet I must wash
   the cloak in blood. Though I would be sanctified by the Holy Spirit and
   wear imparted righteousness as a raiment of needlework, yet I must wash
   even that in blood.

   What do you say, dear Friends? Have you washed in blood? The meaning of
   it is, have you trusted in the atoning sacrifice? "Without shedding of
   blood there is no remission of sin." Have you taken Christ to be your
   All in All? Are you now depending on Him? If so, out of deep distress
   you shall yet ascend, leaning on your Beloved, to the Throne of God and
   to the bliss which awaits His chosen. But if not, "there is none other
   name," there is no other way. Your damnation will be as just as it will
   be sure.

   Christ is "the Way." But if you will not tread it you shall not reach
   the end. Christ is "the Truth," but if you will not believe Him, you
   shall not rejoice. Christ is "the Life," but if you will not receive
   Him you shall abide among the dead and be cast out among the corrupt.
   From such a doom may the Lord deliver us and give us a simple
   confidence in the Divine work of the Redeemer and to Him shall be the
   praise eternally. Amen.

                                God'S Witnesses

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, AUGUST 13, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "You are My witnesses, says the Lord, and My Servant, whom I have
   chosen."

   Isaiah 43:10.

   You, most of you, know that I am incessantly engaged every hour in the
   week either in preaching the Gospel or in endeavoring to discharge the
   multifarious duties connected with this immense Church. Now I always
   look upon my Saturdays as being consecrated, as far as possible, to
   meditation and study, that I may find something to set before you on
   the Lord's Day. But, unfortunately for me, I was served with a subpoena
   to attend the courts at Croydon and was compelled to spend the whole of
   yesterday sitting in a hot and crowded court.

   There is a vast difference between the Throne of Grace and the bench of
   justice, and between communion with Heaven and converse with lawyers
   and witnesses! I tried to think, while sitting there, but I found the
   business so distracting that I went home with a headache and thought I
   should scarcely be able to preach to the assembled crowds on the
   morrow. It struck me, however, that if I could not preach about
   anything else, I must just try to get something out of the occupation
   of yesterday.

   Perhaps we may glean some profitable ears of corn among such unlikely
   stubble. Let me draw your attention to the text and compel my
   occupation of yesterday to yield a few illustrations to set forth its
   meaning. As the text stands, in its connection, we have before us a
   great assembly. All the nations of the earth are summoned to bring
   forth their rival gods, and the question to be decided is this--which
   one of them is the living and true God? The mode of test is this most
   admirable one--which out of these gods has foretold the future? Among
   all these votaries of various idols, which of them can claim that their
   deity possesses the gift of foresight?

   Let all the venerated blocks of wood and stone bring forward their
   witnesses! They can tell of Sibylline oracles, of strange mysterious
   mutterings which contained doubtful declarations hidden under ambiguous
   terms. The Lord demands that there shall be presented before this court
   plain prophecies, distinct declarations of events which could not have
   been foreseen by human discernment. In this respect, the gods of the
   heathen failed. But when Jehovah summoned His people Israel and put
   them into the witness box, and said to them, "You are My witnesses,"
   they were able distinctly to prove that all the great events of their
   national history had been foretold by their God and that each had
   occurred precisely as foretold.

   Not one of His prophecies had failed! Not one word had dropped to the
   ground. Surely the Jew might, with great satisfaction, recur to that
   ancient prophecy which is recorded in the fifteenth chapter of the Book
   of Genesis. We read in the twelfth verse of that chapter that "when the
   sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram. And, lo, an horror of
   great darkness fell upon him. And He said unto Abram, know of a surety
   that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and
   shall serve them. And they shall afflict them four hundred years. And
   also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward
   shall they come out with great substance. And you shall go to your
   fathers in peace. You shall be buried in a good old age. But in the
   fourth generation they shall come here again: for the iniquity of the
   Amorites is not yet full."

   Every descendant of the Patriarch could point to this as a Revelation
   given to his great ancestor at a time when such events seemed
   improbable and yet it was literally fulfilled. The people went down
   into Egypt. They stayed there till the four hundred years of this
   prophecy had been fulfilled. At that very hour they came out of Egypt.
   With a strong hand and with an outstretched arm did God bring them out!
   He judged Egypt with many plagues and with a terrible overthrow in the
   Red Sea--but Israel came out with great substance, for we find that
   they had jewels of silver and jewels of gold. After forty years they
   found the sin of the original inhabitants of Canaan was full and that
   the set time was come for their slaughter and destruction.

   All this was fulfilled verbatim and in the eighteenth and following
   verses there is a continuation of the prophecy-- and this, too, was
   literally accomplished. "Unto your seed have I given this land, from
   the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: the
   Kenites and the Kenizzites and the Kadmonites and the Hittites and the
   Perizzites and the Rephaims and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the
   Girgashites and the Jebusites." And all the inhabitants of the land
   were to be destroyed and Canaan was to be the possession of the
   descendants of the solitary man who, as a stranger and a pilgrim with
   his God, trod its acres without owning a foot of the soil!

   This early prophecy was so exactly accomplished that to Israel it was
   conclusive proof that Jehovah was truly the Lord. Moreover, the Jews
   could say that in every national event they had always been forewarned.
   Was David appointed that his seed should rule over Israel? Jacob long
   before had seen the scepter in the tribe of Judah. Was the kingdom to
   be divided at the latter end of the reign of Solomon? Ahijah rends the
   garment of Jeroboam and foretells that he shall take ten pieces to make
   another kingdom for himself.

   Was the race of Jeroboam to be put away? Remember the terrible words,
   "There shall not be left so much as a dog of the house of Jeroboam, son
   of Nebat." Were they to be molested for their sins by the neighboring
   nations? God always sent to them a warning Prophet to bid them repent,
   lest suddenly they should feel the smarting rod. Now, what the Jew
   could say in Isaiah's day, we can say yet more fully! My Brethren, it
   is our happiness to live in an age when expeditions to eastern lands
   are proving every letter of prophecy!

   Go to Nineveh and mark her heap and her solitary river flowing silently
   to the sea. Did it ever seem likely that Tigris and Euphrates, where
   the Chaldeans made their boast in their ships, upon whose banks stood
   the two greatest cities of antiquity, should become the haunt of
   dragons and owls? Go to Nineveh and learn what God can do and how He
   can foresee the desolation of His foes. Cast your eyes to the beach of
   Tyre where the fisherman spreads his net and there is not a ship to be
   seen--but where once the commerce of half the world floated in its
   glory! Tread the silent and deserted halls of Petra and shiver as you
   read the words--"The pride of your heart has deceived you, you that
   dwell in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high. That says in
   his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground? Though you exalt
   yourself as the eagle and though you set your nest among the stars,
   there will I bring you down, says the LORD."

   Where is Moab? What ails you, O Ammon? Where are those boastful
   monarchs which said, "We are rulers forever: we shall sit upon our
   thrones and know no sorrow"? Jehovah has spoken and has done it--He is
   God--He only is the God of the whole earth!

   This is the scene presented before us in the text--the whole assembled
   nations and the Jewish people brought together to prove that in their
   Sacred Books they had distinct notification of future events--proving
   that God is God-- since no heathen idols have been able, after this
   sort, to foresee or to foretell. We will depart from the precise
   meaning of the text and take it in a very truthful sense, though not in
   the one originally intended. Believers in Christ Jesus, you take the
   place of Israel of old and you are, every one of you, God's witnesses
   this day!

   A great controversy is going on between God and the world. The world
   puts its witnesses forward to speak in its name. And you, the chosen
   ones of the Most High, are ordained to this office to be testifiers and
   witness-bearers for your God and for His Truth. "You are My witnesses,
   says the Lord, and My Servant, whom I have chosen."

   I. We will advance at once to our subject by mentioning some of THE
   QUESTIONS UPON WHICH CHRISTIANS ARE CALLED TO GIVE EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF
   THEIR GOD. These questions are the most weighty which can be discussed.
   One of the first is this--is there such a thing nowadays as a distinct
   interposition of God on behalf of man in answer to believing prayer?
   The world ridicules the idea. The horse laugh is heard the moment you
   talk about the efficacy of prayer and faith.

   "Why," some say, "the wind that drives the pirate on the rock will also
   cause the shipwreck of a vessel laden with ministers of the Gospel.
   Providence is alike severe in its severities and alike bountiful in its
   bounties. The rain falls upon the field of the wicked as well as upon
   the field of the righteous! God has gone away from earth and left it to
   manage it-self--has wound it up like a clock and set it going and now
   He does not interfere, but lets each wheel act upon the other wheel and
   the whole machinery go on without any interposition from His hand."
   That is the world's theory.

   Now, in opposition to this, we hold that, albeit the same event happens
   to the righteous and the wicked, yet still in those very events there
   are distinct differences in God's dealings. But that is not precisely
   the question. The question is whether or not God does answer prayer and
   come in to the assistance and deliverance of those who have faith in
   Him. We declare that He does do so. I think, dear Friends, if I were to
   call some of you into the witness box, you would give very clear and
   distinct proofs of this.

   Suppose I call Mr. George Muller, of Bristol? He would say, "Look at
   those three orphan houses, containing no less than one thousand one
   hundred and fifty orphan children who are entirely supported by funds
   sent to me in answer to prayer. Look," says he, "at this fact--that
   when the water was dried up in Bristol and the water works were not
   able to serve sufficient water to the people--I, with my more than a
   thousand children dependent upon me, never asked any man for a drop of
   water. But I went on my knees before God and a farmer who was neither
   directly nor indirectly asked by me, called at my door the next hour
   and offered to bring us water! And when he ceased because his supplies
   were dried up, instead of telling anybody, I went to my God and told
   Him all about it and another friend offered to let me fetch water from
   his brook."

   He will point you to his report in connection with the orphan houses
   these many years, and say to you, "Here it is-- I solemnly assert that
   I never told any man one of my needs but went straight away to call
   unto my God--and while I have been calling, He has answered me! And
   while I have yet been speaking, He has sent the reply." And George
   Muller is no solitary specimen! We can, each of us, tell of like events
   in our own history. Indeed, it were hard for me to find in my life a
   case in which I have asked and not received. I should find it difficult
   to discover a season in which I have cried unto God and not received
   deliverance during the whole run and tenor of my life.

   I admit it to be shorter than that of some of you, but yet that short
   life suffices for me to say that in hundreds of instances I have had as
   distinct answers to prayer as if God had thrust His right hand through
   the blue sky and given right into my lap the bounty which I had sought
   of Him. Now we are not insane! We are not so wonderfully
   enthusiastic--we wish we were a little more so! Many of us are as
   soldiers' souls, as common sense acting men as any that are to be
   found! There are Brethren here who exhibit a shrewdness in business
   which would screen them from being called fools by worldlings
   themselves, and yet our unanimous witness as Christians is this--we
   have sought God and He has heard us--and though we have been brought
   very low, if we have been enabled to cry out to God, even from the very
   depths He has delivered us in our hour of need!

   Upon this point the Christian should take care that he bears very clear
   testimony, for he certainly may do it without any difficulty. There is
   a question, also, as to the ultimate results of present affliction. The
   world holds, as a theory, that if there is a God, He is very often
   exceedingly unkind. That He is severe to the best of men and that some
   men are the victims of a cruel fate. That they are greatly to be pitied
   because they have to suffer much without compensating profit.

   Now, the Christian holds, first of all, that the woes of sinners are
   punishments and are very different from the chastening sorrows of
   Believers. Of these last he believes that all things work together for
   good to them that love God, to them that are called according to His
   purpose. He believes, as a matter of faith, that he gains by his
   losses! That he gets health by his sicknesses! And that he makes
   progress towards Heaven by that which threatens to drive him back.
   This, I say, is the doctrine with which he begins!

   Now what is your testimony, Brother Christian, with regard to this as a
   matter of experience? How have you found it? I must speak for myself
   and say, "Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now have I kept
   Your Word." "It is good for me that I have been afflicted." All of you
   who have sounded the deeps of soul-trouble and have enjoyed the
   Presence of Jesus can distinctly testify the same! You have found that
   affliction works the comfortable fruits of righteousness, though now,
   for a season, it is anything but joyous. You have, some of you, passed
   through very severe difficulties and trials--I have been the
   sympathizing witness of the griefs of some of you--but I have heard you
   say and say it confidently--not in moments of religious excitement, but
   in times of sober quiet--that you would not have had it otherwise for
   all the world!

   I have heard you say and I know you are ready to repeat it in any
   company and in any place, that if you could have altered your past
   life, especially as to its trials and its difficulties, you would not
   now in looking back upon it have had it altered for a thousand worlds.
   Oh no, the rough was a right way. The tempest purged the pestilential
   air. The earthquake shook down houses of evil. The fire consumed heaps
   of wood, hay and stubble. In this thing may I beg you always clearly
   and distinctly to state the truth as witnesses for your God.

   A third point very much in dispute is as to the joyfulness of a true
   Believer's life. The world's theory is that we are a very miserable set
   of people who take to religion from the necessity of a naturally
   melancholy disposition. "The gloomy tenets of Calvin," as they are
   generally called. "The horrid dogmas of Calvin," are supposed to
   possess congenial charms for minds gloomy and morose. Now what is your
   testimony, Christian, especially you Christians who have learned to see
   in "the horrid dogmas of Calvin" the Gospel of Jesus Christ?

   Well, we can say if we are melancholy, joyous people must be very
   joyful, indeed. We sometimes think we have run up as high on the gamut
   of joy as any human hearts can go and if we are melancholy, what a deal
   of joy there must be in the world! What happy people other people must
   be if we are melancholy! I know that many of God's saints can say that
   when they can lay hold upon the great doctrines of Sovereign Grace they
   are as happy as the day is long in midsummer-- with all their trials
   they can rejoice in the Lord and again and again rejoice!

   I saw a Baptist minister this week who was "passing rich on forty
   pounds a year" owing no man anything. I told him I hoped he would not
   die with the secret, for I should like to learn the art of keeping
   house on forty pounds a year. But he said to me, when I smiled at his
   salary, "You see before you the happiest man out of Heaven." And I know
   I did, too, for his face showed that he meant what he said. The
   happiest man out of Heaven--a poor Baptist minister on forty pounds a
   year!

   Yes and there are some here who can declare though they are nothing but
   poor work girls, and have to stitch, stitch, stitch far into the night
   to get their living, yet when they think that Christ is their own
   Beloved, they are the happiest girls out of Heaven! Some of you have
   not much to spare when the rent is paid and food is bought, yet with
   all that you want no man's pity for you are rich to all the intents of
   bliss! When Mr. Hone, who wrote the "Everyday Book," was traveling
   through Wales--he was an infidel--he stopped at a cottage to ask for a
   drink of water. A little girl said, "Oh yes, Sir, I have no doubt
   mother will give you some milk. Come in."

   He went in and sat down. The little girl was reading her Bible. Mr.
   Hone said, "Well, my little girl, you are getting your task?" "No, Sir,
   I am not," she replied, "I am reading the Bible." "Yes," said he, "you
   are getting your task out of the Bible?" "Oh, no," she replied, "it is
   no task to read the Bible, I love the Bible." "And why do you love the
   Bible?" said he. Her simple, childlike answer was, "I thought everybody
   loved the Bible." She thought full sure it was the greatest treat in
   all the world and fancied that everybody else was delighted to read
   God's Word! Mr. Hone was so touched with the sincerity of that
   expression that he read the Bible himself, and instead of being an
   opponent to the things of God, came to be a friend of Divine Truth!

   Let us, in the same way, show to the people of the world who think our
   religion to be slavery, that it is a delight and a joy--that it is no
   more a burden to us to pray than it is for fish to swim. That it is no
   more bondage for us to serve God than for a bird to fly. True godliness
   is our natural element now that we have a new nature given us by the
   Spirit of God. On that matter be you witnesses for God!

   Another point in dispute refers to the moral tendencies of Christianity
   and especially of that form of Christianity which it is our delight to
   preach. There is a growing belief, nowadays, that the preaching of the
   doctrines of Free Grace has a tendency to make men think little of sin.
   And that especially the free invitations of the Gospel to the very
   vilest of sinners and the declaration that who believes in Jesus shall
   be saved, has a tendency to make men indulge in the worst of crimes. I
   read a paper the other day in which a public writer had the impudence
   to lay the crimes of Southey and Pritchard and such men at the door of
   our holy religion.

   I called the writer a villain and he deserves no better name. He must
   be a villain to dare to lay at the door of Christ's holy Gospel the
   infamy of murder! He says that while we continue to preach that God
   forgives sin so easily, men will sin more and more. Now our testimony
   is, and we speak positively here, that there can be nothing which
   exerts so sanctifying an influence upon the heart of man as the
   doctrine of the love of God in Christ Jesus. And if you seek proofs,
   look around. If it were right for you to speak, my Brothers and
   Sisters, there are certain happy ones among us who could testify this
   day, "We are living manifestations that the Grace of God can turn the
   drunkard into a sober man and make the harlot a Christian woman--and
   bring up the depraved and the profane to seek after purity and
   holiness."

   Why, we are each of us, in our degree, witnesses to that! When do you
   hate sin most? Why, at the foot of the Cross! And when do you love
   holiness best? Is it not when you feel that God has blotted out your
   sins like a cloud? No truth can so subdue the human mind as the majesty
   of infinite love. It is just that which makes a man hate himself for
   having offended against so tender and gracious a God. Prove by the
   integrity and uprightness of your characters that the Gospel has had a
   mighty power on you to make you honest, benevolent, devout, loving your
   neighbor and your God!

   Again, it has been whispered--no, it has been boasted by certain very
   profound philosophers--that the Christian religion has reached its
   prime. And though it had an influence upon the world at one time, it is
   now going down and we want something a little more juvenile and
   vigorous, with a fresher vigor in its veins to stir the world and
   produce noble deeds. I have been told many times that the simple
   preaching of the Doctrines of Grace has no effect now upon the thinking
   portion of the community. The gentlemen who say this being, themselves,
   the thinking portion of the community in their own estimation--for you
   must understand that in order to be one of the "thinking portion of the
   community," it is necessary not to think in a straight line but to
   think in a kind of circumbendibus--to think in a style in which nobody
   else can understand!

   It is necessary that you think till you get at the bottom of things and
   stir the mud so that you cannot find your own way and nobody else can
   see where you are. That is considered to be thinking nowadays--whereas
   it strikes me that the best form of thinking is that which submits
   itself to God's thoughts and is willing to sit at the feet of Jesus.
   Now is the time, however, for true Believers to vindicate the manliness
   and force of their faith. It is not true that Christianity has lost its
   force and its power! And we must make this clear as noonday. You are
   God's witnesses, my Brethren! You are put in the box and I pray if in
   the past or present you have not proven this, do it in the future.

   The Gospel can now nourish heroes as it did of old--it could furnish
   martyrs tomorrow if martyrs were required to garnish Smithfield's
   stakes! It produces now self-denying missionaries! It educates men and
   women by the thousands who can bear the sneer and the jeer and who
   would be prepared to lie in a prison till the moss grew on their
   eyelids sooner than give up Christ! Our belief is that Christ has the
   dew of His youth and that the Gospel is as adapted to the boasted
   enlightenment of the nineteenth century as to the darkness of the first
   ages.

   But you are God's witnesses and you must prove it, and I must ask every
   one of you to prove it by the holy zeal, the conspicuous enthusiasm,
   the sacred fire and fervor that shall blaze and flash in your lives.
   For truth and for Christ let us teach this world that we retain the old
   power among us! Let us ask the Holy Spirit to enable us to live such
   forceful vigorous lives that men shall know once more what we can do.
   Indeed, I am not boastful in venturing to say that there are still a
   host of facts to prove that the Gospel has not lost its power over the
   minds of men. We can point to spots in Glasgow, London, Edinburgh--in
   the most crowded of our cities where once there were dens of infamy and
   haunts of vice. And there, by the enterprising benevolence and holy
   perseverance of single, solitary men, the desert has been made to
   blossom as the rose!

   But enough of this! Go, each man! Witness in his own person! Once
   again--it is our daily business to be witnesses for God on another
   question--as to whether or not faith in the blood of Jesus Christ
   really can give calm and peace to the mind. Our hallowed peace must be
   proof of that. The last testimony we shall probably bear will answer
   the question, whether Christ can help a man to die well or not--whether
   religion will bear the test of that last solemn article-- whether we
   shall be enabled to go through the river either triumphantly shouting,
   or quietly accepting our end.

   Well, Beloved, we will prove that when the time comes! And how many
   there have been among us, whose names we venerate, who have died
   rejoicing in the love of Jesus! There are those above whom we mention
   with a joyous sorrow, when we recollect how well to the last they
   testified of the faithfulness of Christ and His power to bless when all
   other blessings fail us. You see, then, that there are many questions
   in dispute and that the Christian's business is to be God's witness,
   speaking the Truth for God upon these matters.

   II. Time flies and therefore I must take you on to the second point,
   which is to give SOME SUGGESTIONS AS TO THE MODE OF WITNESSING. Let me
   say, as a first suggestion, that you must witness--you must witness if
   you are a Christian. You may try to shirk it if you will, but you must
   witness, for you are subpoenaed--that is to say, you will suffer for it
   if you do not. Some Christians think they will sneak comfortably into
   Heaven without bearing witness for Christ. I fear they will be
   mistaken--and this I know--every Christian who does not come out
   distinctly and boldly for his Master will lose all choice enjoyments.

   He may have enough religion to make him wretched, but he shall have
   none of the joy and peace, the exhilaration and delight which a greater
   boldness and faithfulness would have given him. The bravest Christians
   are the happiest Christians. Those who serve God most have the most
   enjoyment--and those Nicodemites who come to Christ by night, generally
   find it night.

   Christian, do not shun witnessing for Christ. After the disgraceful
   defeat of the Romans at the battle of Allia, Rome was sacked and it
   seemed as if at any moment the Gauls might take the capitol. Among the
   garrison was a young man of the Fabian family, and on a certain day the
   anniversary of a sacrifice returned--when his family had always offered
   sacrifice upon the Quirinal Hill. This hill was in the possession of
   the Gauls. But when the morning dawned the young man took the sacred
   utensils of his god, went down from the capitol, passed through the
   Gallic sentries--through the main body, up the hill--offered sacrifice
   and came back unharmed. It was always told as a wonder among Roman
   legends.

   I think this is just what the Christian should do when there is
   something to be done for Christ--though he is a solitary man in the
   midst of a thousand opponents--let him, at the precise moment when duty
   calls, fearless of all danger, go straight to the appointed spot! Let
   him do his duty and remember that consequences belong to God and not to
   us. I pray God that after this style we may witness for Christ.

   In the next place, every witness is required to speak the Truth of God,
   the whole Truth and nothing but the Truth. Christian, as a witness for
   God, do this. Speak the Truth, and let your life be true as well as
   your words. Live so that you need not be afraid to have the shutters
   taken down--that men may look right through your actions. You are not
   true if you have any sinister motive or anything to conceal. Speak in
   your life the Truth of God and let it be the whole Truth, too. Proclaim
   for God all the Truth as it is in Jesus and let your life proclaim the
   whole teaching of Truth. Let it be nothing but the Truth.

   I am afraid many Christians tell a great deal which is not true--their
   life is contrary to their words. And though they speak the Truth of God
   with their lips, they speak falsehoods with their hands. Suppose, for
   instance, I draw a miserable face and I say, "God's people are a
   blessed people." Nobody believes me because my face tells a falsehood
   while my mouth utters a truth! And if I say, "Yes, religion has a
   sanctifying influence upon its professors and possessors," and put my
   hand into my neighbor's pocket in any sort of way, who will believe my
   testimony? I may have spoken the truth, but I am also speaking
   something that is not the truth and I am thus rendering my witness of
   very small effect.

   When the witness is before the court, his direct evidence is always the
   best. If a man can only say, "I heard somebody say," the judge will
   frequently stop him and say, "We do not want hearsay evidence. What did
   you see?" Many professing Christians only give witness of what they
   have read in books. They have no vital, experimental acquaintance with
   the things of God. Now remember, dear Friends, that second-hand
   Christianity is one of the worst things in the world. We do not like it
   as we see it in the Church of England--we do not believe in that
   sponsorial salvation in which one man promises for another that he
   shall keep all God's holy commandments to be anything better than a
   lying pretense.

   The same is true of any form of religion which you may happen to
   have--which you borrow from your mother, or take from your father--or
   gather from good books. True religion is more than what we can teach or
   learn. It is something that must be known and felt. And your witness
   for God is not worth the words in which you utter it, unless it comes
   from your own experience of its truth. A witness must take care not to
   damage his own case. How many professed witnesses for God make very
   telling witnesses the other way? They damage their case by either
   retaining a part of the truth, or else by flatly contradicting, as we
   have said before, in their lives what they have professed!

   Do not let it be so! As a witness for God be careful that every action
   speaks for His Glory--yes, and that every thought and word and deed
   shall be such witnessing as you shall wish to have borne in the day
   when the great Judge shall call you to account. Every witness must
   expect to be cross-examined. "He that is first in his own cause," says
   Solomon, "seems just. But his neighbor comes and searches him." You
   know how a counsel takes a man and turns him inside out-- and though he
   was one color before--he looks quite another directly afterwards.

   Now you, as God's witnesses, will be cross-examined. Watch, therefore!
   Watch carefully. Temptation will be put in your way--the devil will
   cross-examine you. You say you love God--he will set carnal joys before
   you and see whether you cannot be decoyed from your love to God. You
   said you trusted in your heavenly Father--Providence will cross-examine
   you. A trial will dash upon you. How is it now? Can you trust Him? You
   said religion was a joyous thing. A crushing misfortune will befall
   you. How is it now? Can you now rejoice when the fig tree does not
   blossom and the flocks are cut off and the cattle are dead? Can you now
   rejoice in God as before?

   By this species of examination true men will be made manifest and the
   deceiver will be detected. What cross-examinations did the martyrs go
   through? What fiery questions had they to answer? What cutting
   cross-examinations were the sword, the rack, the spear, the prison, the
   banishment? And yet you know how faithfully they witnessed, still
   standing fast to the Truth of God even to the end! What a noble sight
   is Martin Luther when under trial! His friends said to him, "Luther,
   you will never think of going to Worms, will you? Why the cardinal will
   burn you as they did John Huss." "Ah," he said, "but if they were to
   make a fire so big that it would reach from Wurttemberg to Worms and
   should flame up to Heaven, in the Lord's name I would go through it to
   declare the Truth of God before the council. I would enter between the
   jaws of Behemoth! I would break his teeth and would confess Jesus
   Christ."

   Thus Luther was proved to be the true man of God and his witness for
   God moved the world in his own time and is moving it now. May we all be
   able to stand the test of such cross-examinations!

   III. Did you observe in the text, dear Friends, that THERE IS ANOTHER
   WITNESS BESIDE YOU? "You are My witnesses, and My Servant whom I have
   chosen." Who is that? Why the Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ! If you
   want an exposition of who this servant is, turn to the Philippians and
   read these words--"Who took upon Himself the form of a servant and was
   made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man, He
   became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross."

   Witnesses for God are never alone! When they seem alone there is still
   One with them whom Nebuchadnezzar saw in the fiery furnace with the
   three holy children--"The fourth is like unto the Son of God." "Fear
   not," Christ may well say to all His faithful witnesses, "I am with
   you, the faithful and true Witness." Let us remark, concerning Christ's
   life, that He witnessed the Truth of God, the whole Truth and nothing
   but the Truth. If you want to have a witness to every attribute of God,
   only read the four Evangelists and there you have it!

   Beloved, would you see God's Truth? Observe how Jesus Christ, in all
   His actions--with a sacred simplicity, with a transparent
   sincerity--writes His heart out in His every act! Here you have no
   sophistry, no Jesuitical reservation--He lives out His life--His own
   heart and the heart of God! What testimony you have to God's holiness
   in the life of Christ! In Him was no sin. "The Prince of this world
   comes and has nothing in Me." Read that Divine Book, "The Life of
   Christ," through and through and through--you shall find nothing to be
   put at the end by way of addendum, much less anything by way of errata.
   It is all there and there is nothing there but what ought to be!

   What witness-bearing, too, there is in the life of Christ to Divine
   Justice. See Him sweating great drops of blood! Mark His face marred
   with a multitude of sorrows! See His brow crowned with thorns, decked
   with ruby drops of His own blood! Read in His hands and in His feet the
   terrible writing of Divine vengeance! Look into His side and see there
   the sacred mystery of God's hatred for sin--a hatred so deep that He
   spared not His own Son, but delivered Him because of sin! Never could
   there be a clearer Witness than the bleeding Jesus, of God's hatred to
   sin! Above all, read Christ's witness to God's love. "Herein is love,
   not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the
   Propitiation for our sins."

   In every action of the life of Jesus--from the time when He lay in
   Bethlehem's manger to the moment when a cloud received Him out of their
   sight--it is all LOVE! Elijah brings fire from Heaven to
   destroy--Christ sends it in Pentecost to bless. He opens His mouth at
   the first with--"Blessed, blessed, blessed"--for so He multiplied that
   word on the Mount where He preached His first sermon. And He closed His
   earthly sojourn by blessing His people. His paths dropped fatness. No
   imagination can picture love more deep and pure than that which is
   reflected in the life of Jesus Christ!

   I cannot, however, detain you this morning to show that the entire
   circumference of Divine excellence is contained in the life of
   Christ--that every pearl of Deity is in the Crown which we call Jesus.
   There is not time to show that He contains in Himself a full
   declaration of all that the Father is, so that His words are true--"He
   that has seen Me has seen the Father." Brothers and Sisters, you are to
   be witnesses for Christ and Christ is to be a Witness with you. If you
   want to know how to discharge your duty, look at Him--He is always
   witnessing. By the well of Samaria and the Temple of Jerusalem. By the
   lake of Gennesaret, or on the mountain's brow. He is witnessing night
   and day! His mighty prayers are as vocal to God as His daily services.

   He witnesses under all circumstances! Scribes and Pharisees cannot shut
   His mouth! That fox, Herod, cannot frighten or alarm Him! Even before
   Pilate He witnesses a good confession--He witnesses so clearly and
   distinctly that there is no mistaking Him. The common people heard Him
   gladly, for among other reasons, that no dark, unintelligible jargon
   concealed His meaning. Beloved, make your lives clear! Be as the brook
   where you may see every stone at the bottom--not as the muddy creek of
   which you only see the surface--but clear and transparent, so that your
   heart's love to God and man may be distinctly visible to all.

   You need not tell men that you love them--make them feel that you love
   them. You need not say, "I am true"--be true. Boast not of integrity,
   but be upright. So shall your testimony be such that men cannot help
   seeing it. Let me beg of you to never, for fear of feeble man, hold
   back your witness. Never put the finger of shame after this style to
   your lips. Those lips have been warmed with a coal from off the Divine
   altar--let them speak like Heaven-touched lips! "In the morning sow
   your seed and in the evening withhold not your hand." Watch not the
   clouds! Consult not the wind! In season and out of season still witness
   for the Lord!

   And if it shall ever come to pass that for Christ's sake and the Gospel
   you shall have to be like Napthali--a people that hazarded their lives
   unto the death in the high places of the field--then blush not, but
   rejoice in the honor this conferred upon you--that you are counted
   worthy to suffer loss for Christ's sake! For then your suffering shall
   be a pulpit for you! Your losses and persecutions shall make you a
   platform from which the more vigorously and with greater power you
   shall proclaim your witness for Christ Jesus!

   Gird up your loins, my Brethren, and go out from this assembly asking,
   "Am I God's witness? Then, Lord, open my lips that I may speak with
   decision and power and give me Grace that my witness-bearing shall be
   such that I shall not be ashamed when the reporting angel shall read
   the whole of it before assembled worlds." The Holy Spirit is needed for
   this--may He dwell in us and make our bodies His temple and so make
   each of us witness for Christ!

   Remember, this sermon has nothing to do with many of you. You cannot
   witness for Christ, for you do not know Him. You cannot witness for Him
   till you have trusted Him. O you who are out of Christ, let my witness
   to you this morning be this--that except you seek Him you must perish!
   But that if you seek Him He will be found of you! May the Lord grant
   you Grace to find Him now and His shall be the glory. Amen.

                         The Blind Man'S Earnest Cries

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, AUGUST 20, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out
   and say, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy upon me! And many charged him
   that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Son
   of David, have mercy on me." Mark 10:47,48.

   WHEREVER Jesus Christ is found, His presence is marvelously mighty. The
   disciples, when Christ was absent, were like sheep without a
   shepherd--they were foiled in argument and even defeated in attempted
   miracles--but as soon as our Savior made His appearance among them,
   they returned to their strength. When a valiant general suddenly
   hastens to the rescue of his routed troops, the sound of his horse
   hoofs reassures the trembling, and the sound of his voice transforms
   each coward into a hero. May the glorious Captain of our salvation show
   Himself in the midst of our churches and there will be a joyous shout
   along our ranks!

   You will have no need to exchange ministers, or to wish for a better
   class of Christians--the same officers and the same soldiers will
   suffice to win splendid victories! If Jesus is present, the men will be
   so changed that you will scarcely know them. They shall be filled with
   power from on high and do great exploits in His name and by His
   strength. Nor does the Divine energy of His Presence confine itself to
   those who are already disciples of the Savior! Strangers, neighbors,
   wayfarers and even blind beggars feel the effect of His nearness! This
   sightless beggar hears the good news that Jesus of Nazareth passes by
   and straightway he begins to pray!

   My Brethren, there shall be no lack of praying hearts where there is a
   present Savior. If there are no conversions in the congregation, it
   must be because Christ is not dwelling there by His Spirit. You have
   grieved Him and He is gone-- you have forgotten Him and He has left you
   so that you may come to know your own weakness and learn to glorify His
   power in the future. If the Lord shall graciously return to His Church,
   cries of penitents will be frequent and the songs of those who have
   found peace by faith in Him shall go up to Heaven in blessed chorus!
   Oh, that the Lord Jesus would appear among the churches of this, our
   age!

   We have much to mourn over. Infidelity audaciously seats itself in the
   chief seats of the synagogue. Romanism secretly eats out the very
   vitals of our national religion. Broad and liberal views act as a moth
   upon Gospel doctrine. Inconsistency of life dishonors the profession of
   practical godliness. O Lord, how long, how long! If the Lord Jesus
   shall graciously work by His Spirit among us, we shall soon have our
   languishing churches revived! Errors will fly as the bats and owls
   betake themselves to their hiding places when the sun arises! And every
   sweet flower of Christian Grace shall yield its blessed perfume under
   the genial influences of His celestial rays.

   I thank God we have had Jesus here. We have often been able to say,
   "The Son of David passes by." He is here still. Believing hearts who
   recognize His Presence and lament when He is absent tell us that they
   often find Him sweetly manifested to them here in the preaching of the
   Word, in the breaking of bread, and in the fellowship of prayer. He is
   here now! But oh, we want to recognize His Presence more fully! We want
   to see the Divine influences, like streams from Lebanon, refreshing all
   our garden! We desire to see Jesus working more effectually in making
   poor sinners feel their need of Him and drawing them to Himself.

   Providence at all times co-works with Divine Grace in the salvation of
   the chosen people. You have an instance of it here. It was Providence
   which brought the blind man where Grace brought Jesus Christ. The Lord
   might have been passing by, but if this blind man had not happened to
   live at Jericho--or if at that particular moment he had not been
   pursuing his avocation of begging just on the particular road along
   which the Savior marched--he would never have heard that Jesus passed
   by! Consequently he would never have cried out to Him and never have
   obtained the necessary cure!

   Providence brings sinners under the hearing of the Word and moves the
   preacher to select topics suitable to their minds. Providence prepares
   them, as the plow prepares the soil. And Grace guides the minister's
   mind to act as the hand which throws the wheat broadcast over the
   field. I am thankful for many of you that you are here this morning,
   for I know that "Jesus passes by." And though it may be that you are
   still without the heavenly light, it is a circumstance for which you
   ought to thank God that many have here received sight from the Lord
   Jesus.

   It may be a singular Providence which induced you to come here at
   all--I pray it may prove to be the white horse on which Christ rides
   forth--conquering and to conquer--that He may win a victory in your
   souls now. Permit me, however, to remind you that such a circumstance
   involves responsibility. Jesus passes by--the blind man sits by the
   way-side--if he does not cry, his blindness will, therefore, continue.
   And there will be an addition to all its gloom in the thought that he
   did not use the one means within his reach, namely, that of crying to
   the physician for healing!

   Remember your responsibility, anxious Sinner, and ask God to give you,
   now, Divine Grace to improve the flying hour and may His Spirit lead
   you to imitate the example of the blind man and cry, "Jesus, Son of
   David, have mercy on me!"

   I. Coming directly to the case before us, let us observe THE BLIND
   MAN'S EARNESTNESS AS A CONTRAST with the behavior of many hearers of
   the Word. It was a very short sermon that was preached to him. He heard
   that Jesus of Nazareth passed by. He heard nothing more. I do not know
   that he understood doctrine--that he knew precisely what Jesus Christ
   came into the world for. He could not have explained the system of
   theology. He had never had a clear and distinct statement of Divine
   Grace laid down before him. All he had heard was that "Jesus of
   Nazareth passes by."

   But that short sermon led him to prayer. Beloved, what a contrast
   between him and some of you! You have been sermonized until you must
   well near be sermon-weary! You have heard the Truth of God till
   probably, in theory, there are none better instructed than you are. You
   know the precious doctrines of Truth so far as the killing letter is
   concerned, but you have never yet been led to pray! Or, if the prayer
   has come, it has never been that earnest, Heaven-piercing cry which
   will not be refused--"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"

   It has not been the passionate prayer of your spirit. How many there
   are who listen to me so often that I fear I shall never be God's
   instrument of salvation to them! It is so easy for you to get used to
   one voice till that which once was shrill as the note of a clarion,
   becomes like the buzzing of a bee in your ears--you get tired of
   it--you sleep under it as a miller sleeps while his mill is going
   because it makes no sound to which he is not accustomed. My figures and
   illustrations you have heard. My tones of pleading you well know. My
   words of exhortation you can probably repeat by heart. And some of you
   are no more affected by twelve years of earnest effort than a piece of
   marble might be affected by twelve years of pouring oil along its hard
   unmelting surface!

   It is a melancholy reflection that instead of praying over sermons,
   many amuse themselves with them--that which costs us many a prayer and
   many a tear is of no further worth to them than giving an opportunity
   for exhibiting their critical abilities. I have not to complain of any
   hard criticisms from you--you kindly approve of my poorest endeavors
   and accept my feeblest words. I almost wish that some of you did not!
   Oh, that you would but kick against the Truth of God! Then I might have
   some hope for you! But alas for that indifference which makes you
   receive it all as a matter of course, and praise the style, and say you
   are thankful that the preacher is bold and honest with you! And thus
   the whole thing ends in your having complimented me without having
   sought my Master's favor.

   Oh, my Hearer, we have something else to seek beside your good words!
   If you would hate us, we could not regret it if you would but love your
   own souls! But if you love us and listen to our voice with respect, and
   nevertheless choose the downward path and go on to your own
   destruction, how can the preacher be content? Shall he go to his bed
   and remember that hundreds of you will dwell in everlasting burnings
   and can never have a portion among the glorified spirits in Heaven? Can
   he go to his bed and say, "It does not matter, they are pleased with me
   and I am unto them as one that makes a sweet sound upon a goodly
   instrument"?

   Oh, I would God that instead of this you were brought like this poor
   blind man to go from hearing to praying! From your pews to your
   closets! From listening to me to communing with God and seeking mercy
   at His hands! You will say that you cannot fairly be classed in this
   category, for under the preaching of the Word you have been led
   occasionally to pray. Yes, and I do remember well when I myself was led
   to pray by hearing the Word. But what of it? The prayers of Sunday were
   forgotten in the sins of Monday and the anxieties of Sunday were
   dissipated in the pleasures of the week.

   It is so with some of you! You pray when a sermon has been especially
   earnest--when the arrows of God wound you, you weep and you promise
   amendment and a thousand fine things--you even dream of flying to
   Christ and taking hold upon the horns of the blood-sprinkled altar! But
   yet it is not done! You have made enough resolutions to pave the road
   to Hell! You have piled up enough of your own professions to condemn
   you to an everlasting insolvency for bills dishonored and for debts
   unpaid! Oh, would God you had done with resolving and
   re-resolving--with these transient and temporary feelings!

   And oh, that these things would go right through your heart, leaving
   such wounds as none but Christ is able to heal! Oh, for the effectual
   work of God the Holy Spirit! What is the value of the cloud of the
   morning which flies before the gale, or the smoke of the chimney which
   is gone with the first puff? For eternity you need something more
   lasting than the morning dew! Something more substantial than chimney
   smoke! O may the Divine Spirit build you with His own right hand upon
   that good foundation--faith in the Lord Jesus Christ! The blind beggar,
   with but one sermon and that exceedingly brief, never leaves off
   praying till Christ grants him his desire--may God give you also to
   pray in earnest-- lest you be sent to Hell in earnest!

   This poor man began to cry for himself, "Jesus, Son of David, have
   mercy on me!" And we cannot bring men to hear for themselves. They will
   say, "I hope that sermon which was so appropriate to my friend will
   have a beneficial effect on him." You will think of those in the
   opposite gallery--your hearts will remember some sitting down below.
   Oh, mind yourselves! Yourselves! Yourselves! Another man's salvation
   is, of course, desirable--but what will it be to you that he should be
   in Abraham's bosom if you are with the rich man in the flames? Your own
   soul is that which you have to look to first. Self-preservation is a
   law of nature--be not disobedient to it! May Grace put such force into
   it, that from this day you will say, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy
   on me!"

   I confess to you that I could not read this passage without feeling the
   deepest and most humiliating feeling--to think that the mere report
   should have been so blessed to that man--and that year after year we
   should have given forth a much more full report of Christ Jesus and yet
   have to say of many of you, "Who has believed our report and to whom is
   the arm of the Lord revealed?" I would God I could lay this more to my
   heart and that you laid it more to your hearts, for, after all, it is
   more your concern than mine whether you are saved or not.

   The preacher is responsible for the faithfulness of his preaching, but
   hearers also are responsible for the earnestness of their hearing! May
   God grant that your responsibility may not prove to be a millstone
   about your necks to sink you to the nethermost Hell!

   II. Passing onwards we notice this man's intense DESIRE AS AN ABSORBING
   PASSION. There are many excuses which men make for themselves why they
   should not seek their soul's salvation just now. A very common one is,
   "I am a very poor man. Religion is for the gentle folks, for people
   that have time to spare--it is of no use to a working man." This person
   was a beggar. His position in life was far less honorable than yours!
   But, though a beggar, he desired that his eyes might be opened. And you
   who are superior in your position to him--you ought not to make the
   lowness of your estate an excuse for not seeking the salvation of your
   souls.

   Where did that lie first come from--the lie that the religion of Christ
   is not for the poor? Is it because so many of our sanctuaries are
   gorgeous in architecture? Is it because it is usual on Sunday and very
   properly so, for people to put on their best clothes? And does the
   working man think that therefore he would not be welcome because he
   happens to be out of work, or has not a good suit of black to put on?
   Then, by all means, let us break down this prejudice and show to the
   working man that he is welcome here!

   I have often noticed you give a seat to a navigator or to a laborer in
   a smock frock when you have left very respectable people to stand in
   the aisles and I do not blame you for it--well-dressed people may be
   less fatigued than those who have been toiling all week. I admire the
   choice you make because I hope it will go to prove that the working man
   is not a speckled bird among us. Why it is all nonsense because we see
   a congregation well and respectably dressed to think that they must all
   necessarily belong to the upper classes!

   A certain preacher said to me the other day, "You preach to the rich, I
   preach to the poor." Now this was from want of knowing better. We have,
   I am happy to say, some rich among us, whose princely gifts enable us
   to do much for the Lord's work. But still our great multitude is made
   up of the genuine working class. They are not a canting, whining lot
   who will go about begging of everybody and therefore dress shabbily.
   No, they are sober, saving people, and therefore, for the most part,
   lift themselves out of the ditch of absolute poverty into manly
   independence.

   The religion of Christ not for the poor man? Why, above all men, these
   are those that want it! And while the religion of Christ appeals to all
   ranks, if there is ever a preference given, it is the boast of the
   Gospel of Christ, that "the poor have the Gospel preached to them." Now
   do I have the ear of any man who has talked in that way and said, "It
   is all very well for gentlemen and so on"? Well, do not go and say that
   again, because you know it is not true! You know it is not true!

   We can give you thousands of instances where the religion of Jesus
   Christ blesses the cottage as much as ever it could bless the palace,
   and is found quite as useful to the laborer who has to toil from
   morning to night as to, "My Lady," who has next to nothing to do if she
   does not do something in the cause of Jesus Christ. Now get rid of that
   excuse! Well, but this beggar might have said, "I must stick to my
   business." His business was begging and though Jesus Christ might be
   passing by, he might very reasonably have said, "I really have no time
   to attend to this gentleman, whoever he may be. His preaching may be
   all very well and good, but I must beg right on, for when I get home
   there is little enough in my hat and I really cannot afford the time to
   attend to this gentleman."

   That is what many people say--"Really, our business occupies all our
   time. We have to be always at it! Early in the morning, almost before
   the sun is risen and late at night till we are much too tired to read a
   book or to pray." Ah, but you see, this man forgot his begging to find
   his eyesight. And you might well forget your trading to find your
   soul's sight! If it were worthwhile to neglect his begging to have his
   eyes opened, it were worthwhile, even if it were necessary, to neglect
   your business if you might but find Christ! Though, mark you, I do not
   believe that any man need neglect his lawful calling on account of
   religion. Bartimaeus might have said, "I cannot attend to Jesus Christ
   now, for it is the height of the season."

   You see a beggar's season always is when plenty of people are about and
   as Jesus had brought a crowd with Him, the beggar might very justly
   have said, "Why, if I do not beg now, it is of no use begging at any
   other time! I have a call of Providence to stick to my begging just
   now. I must attend to getting my eyes opened, if they can be opened, at
   some future time. Just now I must make hay while the sun shines." This
   is your style of talking. "See! I am so very busy just now. Providence
   has put a good thing in my way and I must stick to it. I cannot be
   supposed to go out week nights to hear sermons and I cannot spare time
   for prayer. I want every moment that I can possibly get to make money,
   for now is my time. When I get old and can get a house in the country,
   I may then rest and attend to Divine things."

   Ah, you simpleton! Here is a man who flings away the golden opportunity
   of gleaning money of the multitudes to seek his sight! And yet you are
   such a simpleton that you will not leave your gains to think of your
   eternal state! He might have made yet other excuses if he would. For
   instance, he might have said, "Well, suppose I do get my eyes opened.
   Then I shall not be so well-fitted for my trade as I now am." For a
   blind beggar gets twice as much as a man who can see. And it is rather
   a qualification to a beggar to have no eyes.

   Some of you feel, "If I had my soul saved, I could not trade as I now
   do. I know I should have to shut up that gin palace. I could not be the
   nurse of drunkenness and yet call myself a Christian." "I could not
   stand at that bar," said a young woman to me who had been serving at
   one of the gin palaces, "the Lord had met with me. I did serve a few
   nights, but I could not stand it. I could not serve glasses of gin and
   then go to the communion table--that would never do." There are some
   who are afraid to think about religion because it will disqualify them
   for their business--and a blessed disqualification, too! May the Lord
   disqualify thousands for the accursed work!

   But oh, if this man could well give up his poor trade of beggary to
   pray for his eyes, you may well give up your wicked trade if your souls
   may but enter Heaven! If you should lose all the world, you have lost
   next to nothing if you have gained eternity! I am amazed this man did
   not make the well-known excuse, "I do not know whether I am
   predestinated to have my eyes opened--because if I am to have my eyes
   opened, they will be opened. And if I am not to have my eyes opened,
   they will not be opened. So I shall sit still here and hold my hat and
   beg. That is the main chance! I shall hold my hat and stick to my
   trade!"

   I think that every man who uses this last excuse knows within himself
   that he is talking nonsense! I cannot believe in a rational man
   standing upright and saying, "If I am to be saved, I shall be saved and
   therefore I shall not pray." I believe that man is a sneak! He is
   trying to make himself believe what he knows is not true. He knows very
   well that he does not say that kind of thing in business--"If I am to
   make twenty pounds, I shall make twenty pounds and so I shall not take
   down the shutters tomorrow. If I am to have a harvest, I shall have a
   harvest and so I shall not plow this year."

   He never does anything of the kind ordinarily, and yet he pretends he
   is such an idiot that he must throw away his soul because of the
   doctrine of predestination! Brethren, if a man means to hang himself,
   he can always find a piece of rope. And if a man means to damn himself,
   he can always find an excuse. And this excuse about predestination is
   one to which those run who are greater fools or knaves than ordinary!
   This man made no excuse of any sort about his family, or his trade, or
   predestination--he just cried out with emotion--"Jesus, Son of David,
   have mercy on me!"

   III. We turn, now, to NOTICE HIS ZEAL and observe that it was A MOST
   REASONABLE ZEAL. It appears, according to the Greek, that this man had
   a good voice, or, at least, made the most of it. He did not sit and
   whisper, "Jesus, Son of David have mercy on me." But he shouted and, as
   the opposition increased, his shouts grew yet more loud, "Jesus, Son of
   David, have mercy on me!" He was zealous and persevering in his
   prayer--but his zeal was justified. He was blind and he knew the misery
   of blindness. There are unutterable woes connected with it and it needs
   much Grace to make a man content when his eyes are closed to the light
   of day.

   This poor soul could not be content while there was a chance of a cure.
   But yours, Sinner, is spiritual blindness--the blindness which does not
   let you see yourself or see your Savior--the blindness which shuts out
   all spiritual joys from your eyes and will shut out the joys of Heaven
   eternally from you and condemn you to wander hopelessly in the
   blackness of darkness forever! However awfully earnest your prayers may
   be, they cannot be too earnest. He was a beggar, and had doubtless
   learned the weakness of man. He had often gone home with nothing when
   he had expected that his bag would be filled.

   And you, too, you are a beggar! You have tried your own works and found
   them worthless! You have begged at the door of ceremonies and you have
   found them to be an empty show! You have trusted first to one thing of
   man's invention and then another--but after all your begging you still
   need heavenly alms to make you rich--you are naked and poor and
   miserable. Now, considering the weakness of man, and that Christ alone
   has power to save you, if your prayer should become as terribly earnest
   even as the shrieks of lost souls it would be fully justified, for
   yours is an urgent pressing case.

   The beggar knew, moreover, that Jesus Christ was near and when Jesus
   Christ is near there is much cause for earnest prayer. If Jesus would
   not listen. If it were not a season of mercy. If Grace were not being
   distributed plentifully, you might be excused from praying! But oh,
   when it is a season of revival! When you are in the place where Jesus
   blesses souls! When you listen to a ministry which God has honored,
   then let your cry be more zealous than it ever has been! This poor man
   felt it was now or never with him. If he did not get his eyes opened
   that day they might never be opened.

   Christ was passing by then and He might never pass that way again. Oh,
   Sinner! It may be now or never with YOU! I know that God saves men at
   the eleventh hour, but I also know that there are many who are not
   saved at the eleventh hour--and that after such-and-such an hour has
   struck, many are given up to hardness of heart, permitted to be their
   own destroyers, without any checks of conscience or of the Holy
   Spirit--and such may be your case.

   The ticking of the clock always cries to men who know how to interpret
   its meaning. "Now, or never! Now, or never! Today on earth, tomorrow in
   eternity!" If you would have Christ, the only time to seek Him is
   today! "Today, if you will hear His voice, harden not your hearts."
   "For now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation." The beggar
   felt this and therefore up went the cry, louder and yet more loud,
   "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"

   He guessed at least something of the value of sight. He had heard what
   others told him of the happiness of gazing upon the landscape, the
   field, the flood, the sky. He longed to look into the face of friends
   and to know his own parents or his own children by sight. Well might
   he, if he guessed the value of his eyesight, cry most mightily! Sinner!
   You have at least a guess of the happiness of pardon! You have at least
   some idea of the sweetness of justification! You know, for you have
   often been told, that Eternal Life is well worth your seeking. Oh, may
   the Holy Spirit stir your heart this morning till you can no longer
   restrain the cry, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"

   I say, if you think of the dreadfulness of his present state, of the
   hope which the Presence of Christ afforded him and of the blessedness
   which he might expect from a restored eyesight, he had good reasons for
   being zealous! And, Sinner, if you will think of the wrath of God
   abiding on you now--of the future with all its array of terror--and if
   you will remember the power of Christ to save and the eternal
   blessedness of being safe in Him, all these things and especially the
   shortness of time and the present necessity of your case should move
   you to cry yet more and more earnestly, "Jesus, Son of David, have
   mercy on me!"

   IV. Let us pass on to a fourth point--THIS MAN EXPERIENCED OBSTACLES IN
   HIS PRAYER and this is a very common affliction. John Bunyan tells us
   that right by the wicket gate Diabolus had a castle! And from this
   castle he used to shoot at all who sought an entrance. Moreover, he
   kept a big dog which did always bark and howl and seek to devour every
   person that knocked at the gate of Mercy. I am sure that is true.
   Whenever a sinner gets to Mercy's gate and begins knocking, that noise
   is heard in Hell and straightway Satan endeavors to drive the poor
   wretch away from the gate of hope.

   In olden times when the Algerian pirates took many Christian prisoners,
   they chained them to the oars of their galleys to row their masters.
   When Christian ships of war were seen in the distance, the captives
   knew that there was a hope of their being liberated--but their masters
   would come on deck and cry, "Pull for your lives," and the whip was
   laid on to make these poor captives fly, by their efforts, from their
   own rescue. This is what the devil does. He gets sinners to tug at the
   oar and whenever Christ with His blood-red flag of liberty is seen
   within hail, the sinner exerts himself to the utmost to get out of
   Christ's way! If that does not suffice, Satan will employ, sometimes,
   bad men and sometimes good men to stop the sinner from seeking a Savior
   at all.

   You know the ways in which the world will try to make a crying sinner
   hold his peace. The world will tell him that he is crying out about a
   matter that does not matter, for the Bible is not true--there is no
   God, no Heaven, no Hell, no hereafter. But if God has set you crying,
   Sinner, I know you will not be stopped with that--you will cry yet the
   more exceedingly, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"

   Then the world will try pleasure. You will be invited to the theater.
   You will be attracted from one ballroom to another. But if the Lord put
   the cry in your mouth, the intense anguish of your spirit will not be
   satisfied by the noise of viols, nor by the shouts of them that make
   merry. Perhaps the world will call you a fool to be vexed about such
   things-- you are melancholy and have got the mopes. They will tell you
   that you will soon go where many others have gone--to Bedlam. But if
   once God has made you cry, you will not be stopped by a fool's
   laughter! The agonizing prayer will go up in secret, "Have mercy on
   me."

   Perhaps the world will try its cares. You will be called into more
   business. You will get a prosperity which will not make your soul
   prosper. And so it will be hoped by Satan that you will forget Christ
   in accumulated wealth and growing cares. But ah, if this is such a cry
   as I hope it is, poor anxious Sinner, you will not be stopped by that!
   Then the world will affect to look down upon you with pity. Ah, poor
   Creature, you are being misled! When you are being led to Christ and to
   Heaven, they will say you have become the dupe of some fanatic, when,
   in truth, you are now coming to your senses and estimating eternal
   things at their proper value!

   Yes, but the worst is that even the disciples of Christ will act us
   these did in this narrative--they will charge you to "hold your peace."
   Some professors have no sympathy with anxious souls. Much mischief is
   done by the light and frothy conversation of Christian professors,
   especially on Sunday. How often sermons are blunted by a spirit of
   caviling! I have heard of a woman who prayed for her husband's
   conversion very earnestly and one day, after the sermon, as she was
   walking home, she was speaking to her friend and pulling the sermon to
   pieces! The doctrine did not quite suit her taste. Her husband looked
   at her with wonder--that sermon had broken his heart and yet here was a
   woman caviling at the very Truth which God had blessed to give her the
   desire of her heart!

   I do not doubt that Christian people, by their unprofitable criticisms
   upon ministrations which God has blessed, may mar the good work and be
   the instruments in the hands of Satan of urging poor sinners to cease
   their cry. But oh, poor Soul, let neither saint nor sinner make you
   stop! If you have begun to pray, though you have cried for months and
   no sweet answer of mercy has come, cry more loudly! Oh, be yet more
   earnest! Take the gates of Heaven and shake them with your zeal as
   though you would pull them up--post, and bar, and all! Stand at Mercy's
   door and take no denial. Knock and knock, and knock again, as though
   you would shake the very spheres, until you obtain an answer to your
   cries!

   "The kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by
   force." Cold prayers never win God's ear. Draw your bow with your full
   strength if you would send your arrow up as high as Heaven. He whom God
   has taught to be resolved to be saved will be saved. He that will not
   take damnation as his fate, but who feels he must have Christ, is al-
   ready under the Divine operation of the Holy Spirit! Such a man bears
   the marks of Divine election upon his very brow! Such a man must and
   shall obtain everlasting salvation!

   V. I come to the closing point. This MAN'S IMPORTUNITY AT LAST BECAME
   SO MIGHTY THAT REBUFFS BECAME ARGUMENTS WITH HIM. "He cried the more a
   great deal." He took the weapons out of their hands and used them on
   his own account! What do you suppose were the arguments that they used
   to induce him to leave off praying? Would not one of them say, "Hold
   your tongue, you ragged, filthy beggar! Hold your tongue!" "That is why
   I will not hold my tongue," says he. "I am such a poor loathsome object
   that I have need to cry. You gentlemen that are better off have no need
   to cry as I have. But the worse you prove me to be, the more need I
   have of the Master's help! And therefore I shall cry the more."

   The devil says to you, "Do not pray, you are such a sinner." Tell the
   devil that is the reason why you will pray, for being so foul and
   filthy, these are all arguments why you, above all others, should cry
   aloud, "Jesus, have mercy on me." Then they said, "Why, you have
   nothing to recommend you! Jesus Christ has not invited you! He has
   never looked on you with an eye of love! He has never called you."
   "Then it is the very reason," said he, "why I should call Him. If I
   have no love token, then so much the worse for me and so much the more
   reason why I should never be happy till I get one! If He has not
   invited me, then I will cry to Him for an invitation!"

   You see, the more you can prove that the sinner's case is hopeless and
   bad, you have only proved that the sinner has the more reason for
   prayer. If I am the furthest from hope, why, then, he who wants to be
   heard and is a very long way off, must call loudly! He that is further
   still, must call more loudly still! And he that is furthest off must be
   the loudest of all--so if I am the furthest off from God and hope--I
   will only pray with the greater importunity till I do prevail. "Yes,
   but," said another of them, "you make such a noise. Be still! You
   disturb the whole neighborhood." "Ah," says he, "I am thankful for
   that, for now He will hear me."

   I think this man, if he had heard the Savior tell the parable about the
   woman whose perpetual coming wearied the Judge, must have said, "Make a
   noise, do I? So much the better! Then I will make more, for I see I
   tease you--perhaps I shall weary Him, so I will even keep on till the
   Judge is drawn to grant my request by the very noise I make." Some tell
   you, you should not be so earnest! You really disturb your friends--you
   have become so concerned about your soul that your friends are
   concerned about your sanity! Tell them you are glad of it and you mean
   to be more earnest, for if you have made hard-hearted man feel, you
   will soon make God, who bids us give Him no rest, at last give you the
   desire of your heart!

   Then they would say to him, "Now, do not disturb the Savior! He is so
   busy. He has so much to do. He is preaching now. He is talking to His
   disciples." "Ah, well," says he, "then if He does so many good things,
   the more reason why I should cry that He would do me a good turn,
   also." It is of no use to ask a man to give anything who never gives
   any-thing--but the man who is always giving--always will give. And so
   from Christ's many works he derives a reason why he should cry! "Is He
   blessing others, then why not me?" So, dear Hearer, when you hear of
   showers of blessings, ask that they may fall on you. And when you know
   that Christ is saving so many, make that a reason why He should save
   YOU-- even you.

   Then they said, "He is on a journey. He is going to Jerusalem. He
   cannot be stopped by every beggar. Hold your tongue! When do you think
   He will ever get there if He is to turn aside to every clamorous beggar
   who chooses to urge his claim?" "Traveling is He?" said he. "Then I
   will stop Him now, for if I once let Him go by I shall never catch Him
   again. Going to Jerusalem to die! Ah, then my hope will be all over! I
   have Him now--I will not give Him a chance of going by." Louder goes up
   the cry, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me."

   If the devil tells you, "It is too late!" Then say, "I will go
   directly, I will not stop. If so many years have passed over my head
   without my finding a Savior, then every one of these shall be a spur to
   make me fly, like the wind, more swiftly." It is very likely that they
   also said to him, "How dare you, a beggar, interrupt such a person as
   Jesus Christ? Why, He is going in triumph through Jerusalem. He is to
   ride with solemn pomp all through the streets. How can you think that
   you are to have an audience with such a great one as He is?" "Great
   one, is He?" the man seemed to say. "Great one! I need a great one! A
   little one will not serve my need. It must be a great one that can open
   my eyes and the greater He is the more reason why I should cry to Him."

   So whenever you are alarmed at the glory and greatness of the Lord
   Jesus Christ, do not be put off because of that, but rather say, "Is He
   mighty? Then He is mighty to save. Is He a Savior and a great one? Then
   He is just such a Savior as I need. I will never rest, I will never
   pause till He says unto my soul 'I am your salvation.' "

   Now I did solemnly ask God that He would, this morning, excite in some
   sinner a desire to pray, and that if there were one here who had been
   praying and who was tempted to stop, the Word might be blessed by God
   the Holy Spirit to make him more incessant in his prayer. O may He
   grant my petition! Remember that the only way in which this praying and
   this waiting will come to an end, is by looking alone to Jesus Christ!
   If you turn those eyes of yours away from yourself and your feelings
   and yes, your prayers, to Jesus Christ's finished work and trust Him,
   you will find peace directly!

   There is peace to the soul that looks alone to Jesus! While I have been
   exhorting you to pray--and I meant to do it earnestly, more earnestly
   than I have been able to do it--I did not wish you to put praying in
   the place of believing. If you cannot as yet understand Christ so as to
   rest on Him. If you cannot as yet cast yourself on Him--then pray for
   more enlightenment! Pray to be led to faith. Pray that faith may be
   given you.

   But O may God give you the power and the will now, even now, to exert a
   living faith upon the crucified Savior-- for there is "life in a look
   at the Crucified One." Praying will ultimately bring you to that point,
   but I pray God to bring you to it now through His mighty Spirit and so
   like Bartimaeus, may we receive our sight and follow Jesus in the way
   and to Jesus be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

                           In Whom Are You Trusting?

   A SERMON PREACHED BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE,
   NEWINGTON.

   "Now in whom do you trust?" Isaiah 36:5.

   THAT question may not be without importance in matters of ordinary
   life. We have all to trust our fellows, more or less, and I suppose we
   have all had to smart in some degree, as the result of it. We may trust
   the mass of men in trifles without any serious consequences. But when
   it comes to large sums--when the whole of a man's fortune, for
   instance-- is staked upon the character and reputation of someone else,
   then it is not altogether an unimportant question, "On whom do you
   trust?" Oh, many have rested on some choice friend and found him play
   the Judas! How often have our dearest counselors turned away from us as
   Ahithophel did from David? How frequently have we confidently rested
   upon the integrity, friendship and fidelity of some person whom we
   thought we knew and could trust, only to find that, "Cursed is he that
   trusts in man and makes flesh his arm."

   Be cautious, my Brothers and Sisters--perhaps you need not that I
   should say this to you--but use discretion in all your transactions in
   life, as to how far you will trust the sons of men. Or else this may be
   whispered in your ear and may send you to your bed with a heavy heart,
   "Now in whom do you trust?" But, surely, if this is important in
   temporal matters, it is overwhelmingly so in regard to spiritual
   things. If I become bankrupt in trade, I may yet set up in business and
   retrieve my fortune. But in soul-matters if I once make bankruptcy in
   the commerce of life, there is no hope of my receiving a fresh
   certificate and attempting to retrieve my losses.

   Here, if a general is defeated in some great battle, he may yet
   possibly retreat in such good order and again get together his troops
   so as to win another battle and turn the current of the campaign. But
   once beaten in the great life-struggle--once feel that sin has utterly
   got the mastery over you--and there is no hope here and you will die
   so. And there is no more possible contest--you are vanquished. The
   battle is fought and the victory is lost forever. Let us, then, be very
   much concerned, dear Friends, to enquire and to give an honest answer
   to the question, "In whom do you trust?"

   First, let us go round the congregation and collect a little bundle of
   answers. Then, secondly, let us hear the Christian's answer. And when
   we have listened to it, let us give the Christian some few words of
   advice with regard to what his line of action ought to be, seeing he
   has such an One to trust.

   I. First, then, let us put this question and collect, I say, A LITTLE
   BUNDLE OF ANSWERS, "In whom do you trust?" I think I hear some answer,
   "I do not know that I have thought about the matter at all. You ask me,
   'In whom do you trust?' I shall have to say I have left the matter of
   dying and of eternity and of judgment out of my consideration. I hope
   it is a long time before I shall die and there is no need to trouble
   myself before it is necessary. Therefore I put the matter off. I feel
   it is an unpleasant task to make too much enquiry and, therefore, I
   have just left well enough alone. I cannot give you an answer, for I
   have not considered the matter."

   My dear Friend, don't you think that you are very foolish? Do you
   forget that you may die this very moment--that there are more gates to
   death than you dream of--that there is a gate to death, yes, and to
   Hell, too, from the place where you are now sitting? Have you never
   heard of persons falling dead in the street, of bowing down as Sisera
   did, of whom it is said, "Where he bowed himself there he fell down
   dead"? Have you a lease of your life? Are you certain that death is so
   far off? Have not you walked with dying men? I have. I have talked with
   them one day and I have heard the next that they were in eternity.

   We shall hear the same of you. And is it wise to be trifling with these
   things as though you knew that you had fifty or sixty more years to
   live? And suppose you were sure of a long life, would you wish to delay
   being happy? Do you desire to postpone being made supremely
   comfortable? Remember that to have your soul affairs set right in a
   proper manner is to obtain present joy and happiness. I do not think
   that young people ever say, "We are too young to enjoy ourselves. Let
   us wait till we grow older and then let us he happy." And yet to be
   saved is to enjoy yourselves in the most emphatic sense of that term
   and to find Christ precious is to be happy beyond all expression!

   Why postpone that which is more pleasant than pleasure itself and more
   sweet than honey dropping from the honeycomb? I pray, dear Friends,
   think of this matter now, because you may have to think of it when it
   will only bring you bitterness and grief! That is a dreadful verse,
   where Christ says of the rich man in Hell, "He lift up his eyes." Poor
   Soul, why did you not lift up your eyes before? It is too late, for ah,
   you can see as you look up, Lazarus in Abraham's bosom and yourself
   with a great gulf fixed, dividing you from him. It is too late for you
   to look about you then, for there is nothing to see but the consuming
   flames and the tormentors who are to be your perpetual companions--with
   that dark despair, which, like a great gravestone--is to be forever on
   your heart!

   O, why did you not lift up your eyes before? Surely the only answer I
   can get from this poor wretch is, "Tell my brethren lest they come into
   this place of torment! Ask them to lift up their eyes now, and to begin
   now to consider what shall be their confidence and what the ground of
   their hope with regard to eternal things." Careless Sinner, I wish that
   those few words might be blessed to you. I would look you in the face
   and evoke you by the living God, by life, by death, by judgment, by
   eternity, by Heaven, by Hell--by everything that has power to move a
   rational being--set your house in order and consider your latter end!
   And if you have no trust as yet, God help you to find one.

   Well, we will try again and put the question to another. "In whom do
   you trust?" And I hear one stand up and say, "I thank God I am about as
   good as most people. I do not know that I have any particular cause to
   worry myself. If everybody's life had been like mine, Sir, it would be
   much better for their day and generation. I have never been a gross and
   open sinner. I have been a man who has set a good example to his family
   and brought them up well. When the hospital wanted a guinea, I put my
   hand into my pocket and did not bring it out empty! When my poor
   neighbors have needed charity, they have never found a churl in me! I
   hope I can say it will go well with me and if it does not, Sir, it will
   go badly with a good many."

   My Friend, with that last sentence I perfectly agree--I am afraid it
   will go badly with a great many! But I do not see what consolation you
   ought to get out of that, for company in being ruined will not
   decrease, but rather increase the catastrophe! Let me say to you that
   it proves that the sum and the substance of your confidence is that you
   are trusting in yourself. Now, do you really and honestly think that
   you are, of yourself, sufficient to carry your soul through all the
   pangs and terrors of death and to bring yourself, by your own merit,
   safe to God's right hand? I think your conscience can remind you of
   some slips and some flaws--your memory must tell you of some sins, if
   they are not of the grosser kind--yet of some sins!

   And let me say to you remember that God has revealed in His own Word
   this Truth--if any man will be saved by his own works there is one
   condition which cannot be altered--namely, that he must be an
   absolutely perfect man! He must never have even sinned so much as once!
   He must never have had a sinful thought in his heart, or word on his
   tongue, or act in his entire life, or else he is guilty of a breach of
   the whole Law! Now what do you say to that? This is no mere assertion
   of mine--this is God's own Word! And let me give you another passage,
   "By the works of the Law there shall no flesh living be justified."

   proud man, woman--do you think there was any need for Christ to die to
   save us if we could save ourselves? What? Do you think that God's
   servants have to say, "The righteous are scarcely saved," and do you
   who believe in no Savior think it such a simple thing to get to Heaven
   that you are going there by your own good deeds? I counsel you, (I pray
   you would take my advice), do with your good works just as the
   Ephesians did with their magical books--bring them out and burn all of
   them! They will never do you any good and they may do you infinite
   mischief. Come, my good Friends, come as you are to that Savior who has
   opened a new and living way by His own precious blood and who can do
   for you what these fine boastings of yours can only pretend to
   accomplish! Only He can save your guilty soul from the wrath to come!

   1 do not suppose that I should get from anybody present the answer
   which has come, no doubt, from the lips of very many--"In whom do I
   trust? Why, I trust in my priest! He has been regularly ordained! He
   belongs to an Apostolic Church! He tells me that he will forgive my
   sins if I confess them to him, and that when I come to die he will give
   me my viaticum--he will grease my boots for the last journey and send
   me off in such a state that the devil himself cannot hold me with this
   anointing oil upon me! If I cannot trust to a priest, where can I fix
   my confidence?" I can give you an answer to that last enquiry, where
   can you trust--but let me appeal to any man of sense who is here
   tonight and who may have been relying upon a priest:

   What is there in any man, though he is six foot of clay, that you
   should put your trust in him? No doubt there have been some mystical
   incantations performed upon him, but in this nineteenth century are you
   such a fool as to believe that he has any grace to spare for you? If
   you would read the Scriptures, dear Friend--only your priest does not
   care that you should do this, except it be his own version which he has
   well doctored before you get it--if you read the Bible, you will find
   that if you are a follower of Christ, you are as much a priest as he
   can be! You will find that one man is as much a priest as another when
   he believes in Jesus--for, according to Scripture--all saints are a
   "royal priesthood."

   As for myself, though I preach in this place the Word of God, I hate
   the very thought and name of priest and I wonder how it can be that
   persons calling themselves Evangelical clergymen can talk of themselves
   as priests. Priests, indeed! I fear many of them are, but I wonder at
   the effrontery which should make them take the name and wear it.
   Priests? Great God! There is but one Priest before Your Throne who can
   offer acceptable sacrifice and that is Your dear Son who offers Himself
   forever as a great Sacrifice unto You! And as for us, we are but
   secondary priests under Him, and here none of us has any superiority
   over his brother, for all the saints are made in Christ Jesus kings and
   priests unto God and they shall reign with Him forever and ever! Do not
   be misled, dear Friend--your priest might as well trust in you as you
   trust in him!

   But it is probable, very probable, that I should get another answer if
   I were to put this question round. Perhaps a considerable number of
   people would say, "Well, God is merciful. He is not so severe as to be
   unkind towards us and we dare say, though we may have a good many
   faults, yet as He is a very good and a very gracious God, He will
   forgive us our sins and accept us." Then it seems, dear Friends, that
   you are trusting in the mercy of God. Let me say to you that as you
   state it, you are trusting in what you will never find!

   Let us suppose you are very generous and there are a number of poor
   people in the city who you are determined to feed with bread. Let us
   suppose that you, therefore, issued an order that they were all to call
   at your son's house and that there they might have as much bread as
   they pleased. If they all declared that they would have nothing to do
   with your son, would not go to his house, and would sooner starve than
   go--and if they all came clamoring to your door--what would you say to
   them?

   You would say, "There is bread enough and to spare. I have provided it.
   My son will give it to you, but if you insult me to my face by telling
   me that you will not have what I freely give to you because of the way
   in which I present it, you may go without it." And this certainly is
   how God will deal with you! He has treasured up all His mercy in the
   Person of His own dear Son--and there it is--come and welcome! And it
   is said, that "Whoever comes" to Jesus Christ, He "shall in no wise
   cast out."

   But if you go to God out of Christ you will find Him to be a consuming
   fire! And instead of mercy you shall receive justice--and that justice
   will smite you to the lowest Hell! What? Shall the King of Heaven leave
   His Throne and lay aside His crown! Shall He take off His azure mantle,
   put on the garments of a man-- become poor and needy, live in poverty
   and die in shame--and yet will you not take Divine Grace through such a
   channel as this? Shall God ordain this better than golden pipe through
   which the crystal stream of love and mercy shall run, and do you
   disdain this pipe? Shall God say that He has treasured up in Christ
   Jesus all the fullness of the Godhead and will you turn from Christ and
   say, "We will not have this Man to reign over us"?

   Then know this, that the King sits upon His holy hill of Zion and He
   will dash you in pieces like a potter's vessel, because you said, "Let
   us break His bonds asunder and cast His cords from us." Rather let me
   bid you bow the knee and kiss the Son. Cling to Jesus and then--

   "Comeand welcome, Sinner, come." Come through Jesus, for in God there
   is no mercy to those who come leaving Christ behind them. There is only
   one other answer which I think it is likely I should get tonight, and
   it might be this--"Well, Sir, I do not say that I can trust to my
   works, but I am a good-hearted man. I am a man of good intentions and
   though I have a great many faults--still, Sir, I am good-hearted at
   bottom--and I think God will look at my heart and He will put me right
   at the end, notwithstanding my slips and wanderings by the way."

   Well, my dear Friend, it is very well for you to say you have got a
   good heart, you know. But we have nobody to prove it except yourself.
   That is a very silly thing which people say of men when they die, "Oh,
   he was rather bad in his life and loose in his morals, but he was a
   good-hearted man at bottom." It reminds me of Rowland Hill's saying,
   "Yes, but when you go to market to buy apples and you see a number of
   rotten ones at the top, if the market woman says, 'Oh, never mind, it
   is only the rotten apples at the top! They are very good at bottom,'
   you will say to her, 'My good Soul, I will be bound to say the best are
   on the top and they will not improve as you go down, for generally they
   will get far worse.' "

   And so if a man is rotten at the top, bad on the surface, I cannot tell
   how much worse he may be down below. It is said there was a man who
   used to swear and drink, who, nevertheless, applied for membership with
   Mr. Hill and gave this reason for it, that though he did drink
   occasionally and frequently swear, yet he was good at bottom. Mr. Hill
   said, "Then you think I am going groveling down through the dirty foul
   filth of your life to get the little good that is somewhere at the
   bottom of you! Why, Sir," he said, "it will not pay for the risk of
   digging out and I am not going to do it." And there is much truth in
   that saying, "If it is bad at top it is worse at bottom and if it is
   not good on the surface it will never pay for getting at it."

   It will turn out, I am afraid, to be a delusion and a snare. Do not
   rest in that. If you will not be angry, I will tell you what your heart
   is. Your heart--you that have such good hearts--your heart, I say, is
   deceitful above all things and desperately wicked! In your breast there
   are what you little think of--envy, lust, enmities and murders. All
   manner of unclean things are housed and caged within your breast. Do
   not talk about its goodness any more, for when you do, you call God a
   liar, and how can you expect to go to the Heaven where God is, when you
   are thus insulting Him all the while?

   II. Well, we have done with these poor answers and we will come now to
   THE CHRISTIAN'S ANSWER. "In whom do you trust?" "I trust," says the
   Christian, "a triune God--Father, Son and Holy Spirit. I trust the
   Father, believing that He has chosen me from before the foundations of
   the world. I trust Him as my father to care for me, to provide for me
   in Providence. To teach me, to guide me, to feed me, to correct me if
   need be and to bring me home to His own house where the many mansions
   are.

   "I trust the Son. Very God of very God is He--the Man Christ Jesus. I
   trust in Him to take away all my sins, for He suffered their penalty
   upon the Cross. I trust Him to put all those sins away forever by His
   own Sacrifice. I trust Him to wrap me about with His perfect
   righteousness and to adorn me with all His excellencies. I know Him to
   be my Intercessor--so often as I pray to present my prayers and desires
   before His Father's Throne. I believe Him to be my resurrection and my
   life, that, though I die, yet I may live again!

   "I expect Him to be my Advocate at the last great assize, to plead my
   cause and to stand there to justify me. I trust Him with all that I
   have, having no merit of my own--no confidence in my own tears, or
   prayers, or preaching, or will-ings, or doings, or believing--I trust
   Him for what He is, what He has done, what He has promised yet to do--I
   rely on Him, the incarnate Son of God."

   "And next," says the Christian, "I trust the Holy Spirit. He has begun
   to save me from my inbred sins. I trust Him to drive them all out. I
   trust Him to curb my temper, to subdue my will, to enlighten my
   understanding, to check my passions, to comfort my despondence, to help
   my weakness, to illuminate my darkness. I trust the Holy Spirit to
   dwell in me as my Life, to reign in me as my King, to sanctify me
   wholly--spirit, soul and body--and then to take me up to dwell with the
   saints in light forever! Thus I trust a triune God through the
   Man-Mediator, Christ Jesus."

   And now, dear Friends, there is much difference between the Christian's
   trust, you will plainly see, and the trust of other men. But to some
   men this does not look like a real trust. "Why, we cannot see God,"
   says one. "How do we know all this about the Trinity? We can neither
   see, nor hear, nor feel God. Is this a real trust?" Cannot you trust in
   a thousand things you have never seen or heard? You take, I believe,
   bank notes and yet you never saw the person who signed them or who
   issued them. There are a thousands things in this world which are real
   grounds of confidence and yet you never saw them!

   Some of you, perhaps, may be earning your living by electricity. You
   are engaged in telegraphic operations and you believe in electricity,
   but you never saw it. Every builder trusts in gravity! Every engineer
   in the world has to put his confidence in the law of gravitation, and
   yet nobody ever saw this mighty power! But the thing is just as true as
   though one could see it. Those that have trusted in God find Him to be
   as real as if they could see Him! Though unperceived by sense, they
   find that when they get to Him, whom they cannot see, they get to One
   who is more substantial than things which are seen--which are
   temporal--for the things which are not seen are eternal!

   Some have said, "But does God interfere to help His people? Is the
   trust you impose in Him so really recognized by Him that you can
   distinctly prove that He helps you?" Yes, we can, though God has never
   worked a miracle for me, yet He has done what I thought only a miracle
   could accomplish and He has worked it in the common order of
   Providence. And you shall find the same if you trust Him with all your
   heart! He will hear your prayer and listen to your cry and deliver you
   out of deep waters and from bitter anguish.

   And though the depths will not be divided, fire will not cease to burn,
   nor will lion's mouths be closed, yet you shall be as well delivered as
   if miracles were still the order of the day! A Christian is sometimes
   asked whether he has a right to trust God. I have no business to rely
   upon one of you to do something for me merely because I choose to trust
   you to do it. I must have your promise before I am wise in my
   confidence. Now, the Christian has God's promise for it. He believes
   that Bible to be God's Book and, therefore, when he finds God saying
   anything in that Book to him, he believes it to be true and he even
   finds it to be so!

   God has promised His people that if they trust Him they shall lack no
   good thing. He invites them to trust--no-- He commands them to trust.
   And, therefore, Brethren, the Christian is justified in venturing to
   put His confidence in His God. But the worldling wants to know whether
   God is worthy to be trusted. And the Christian can say, "Yes, that He
   is. Our fathers trusted in Him and they were not confounded. We have
   trusted in Him and we have never found Him to fail." If I knew anything
   amiss of my God tonight, I would honestly tell it. But I know nothing
   but this--that He is faithful and true. I rest with my whole soul upon
   the finished work of Christ and I have not found anything yet that
   leads me to suspect I am resting where I shall meet with a failure.

   No, the older one grows, the more one is convinced that he who leans by
   faith on Christ, rests where he never needs to be afraid! He may go and
   return in peace and confidence, for the mountains may depart and the
   hills be removed, but God shall not change and His purpose shall not
   cease to stand. Yes, God is worthy of our confidence! And I think we
   can say, also, by way of commending our God to others, that we feel we
   can rest upon Him for the future. We have been in strange places and in
   very peculiar conditions in the past, but we never were thrown where we
   could not find in God all we needed. And we are therefore encouraged to
   believe that when death's dark night shall come with all its gathering
   of terror, we shall fear no evil, for the same God will be with us to
   be our succor and our stay.

   The Isle of Man has for its coat of arms three legs, and turn them
   which way you will, you know they always stand. And such is the
   Believer--throw him which way you will--he finds something to stand on!
   Throw him into death, or into life. Into the lion's den, or into the
   whale's belly--cast him into fire, or into water--the Christian still
   trusts in his God and finds Him a very present help in time of trouble.
   "In whom do you trust?" We can answer boldly, "We trust in Him whose
   power will never be exhausted, whose love will never cease, whose
   kindness will never change, whose faithfulness will never be sullied,
   whose wisdom will never be nonplussed and whose perfect goodness never
   can know a reduction."

   III. Well now, if this is true, I am to close with SOME WORDS OF ADVICE
   TO THOSE WHO ARE SO TRUSTING. They are, first of all, drive out all
   unbelief! Dear Brothers and Sisters, if we have such a God to trust,
   let us trust with all our might and let us endeavor to get rid of those
   horrible doubts and fears which so much mar our comfort. Why should we
   fear, my Brethren? "Oh, you of little faith, why do you doubt?"

   "Oh," says one, "I do doubt, but I can hardly tell why." Well, if your
   God is such an One as He really is, it is an insult to Him to doubt
   Him! We say of a rogue, we will trust him as far as we can throw him,
   and some people hardly give their God better measure than that! We
   never ought to count a man dishonest till we find him in some trick.
   Now you have never found your God to be untrue. Then do not doubt Him
   till you have! Give Him your trust till He proves unworthy of it! Let
   us repent for our harsh thoughts of God. I know you said you would be
   starved, but you are not starved yet. You said you should go to the
   poorhouse, but you are not there yet! You said you should die of a
   broken heart, but you have not died yet--you have a smiling face
   tonight.

   You told your friend you could never get through that trouble, yet you
   have got through it and fifty worse troubles than that! You said you
   would rather die than live, yet you did live--you have not died and you
   do not want to die. Now why give God a bad name? When the devil calls
   God a liar, I can understand it. But it is hard of a man's own child to
   think ill of his father. I think it would cut me to the heart if my
   child could not trust me. And oh, how ungenerous, how unkind on your
   part--no, I will say on my part, on our part--that we cannot put more
   confidence in this kind, generous Father of ours who has never failed
   us and who never will!

   Come, let us not doubt Him again! David does not appear to have made
   any very lengthy trial of the mighty sword of the giant Goliath, and
   yet he said, "There is none like it." He had tried it once in the hour
   of his youthful victory and it had proved itself to be of the right
   metal, and therefore he is able to praise it forever after! He has no
   doubt about the keenness of the edge, or fineness of the tempering.
   Even so, my Brethren, let us speak well of our God--there is none like
   He in the heavens above or the earth beneath! "To whom can you liken
   Me, or shall I be equal says the Lord." You may search the world around
   and you will find that there is no rock like the Rock of Jacob--our
   enemies themselves being judges.

   So far from suffering any doubt to live in our hearts, we will take
   them all, as Elijah did the prophets of Baal, and slay them over the
   brook! And as our stream to kill them at we will select the sacred
   torrent which wells forth from our Savior's wounded side. My Brethren,
   we are truly guilty in speaking harsh things of our God! When the
   children of Israel came to the borders of the promised land they sent
   out spies to search it and see what the prospect was and how to prepare
   for the future occupation of it. Ten of the men on their return gave an
   ill report of the country which God had sworn to give to His people.

   Now, what was the punishment which was inflicted on them for this evil
   speech concerning God's gift? Why, they died by the plague before the
   Lord and thus God proved His anger and wrath against their sin! Happy
   is it for us that He does not thus visit our evil words and harsh
   thoughts concerning Himself. We have often brought up an ill report of
   our God when we ought to have praised Him without ceasing for all His
   loving kindness towards us, the sons of men. Brethren, let us give up
   all repining and fretful speaking--

   "Were half the breath thus vainly spent,
   To Hea ven in supplication sent,
   Our cheerful song would oftener be,
   'Hear what the Lord has done for me.'"

   Try this plan of turning all your complaints into prayers and soon we
   shall hear you singing--

   "O magnify the Lord with me,
   With me exalt His name!
   When in distress, to Him I called,
   He to my rescue came.
   O make but trial of His love.
   Experience will decide,
   How blest are they and only they,
   Who in His Truth confide."

   And then, Brothers and Sisters, let us seek the Holy Spirit's help in
   this matter. We have often said we would not doubt again, yet we have.
   Let us ask to be strengthened. We often forget that the Author of our
   faith must be the Finisher of it, also. It is well to keep in mind the
   fact that our faith is like the lamp which was burning in the temple
   and never allowed to go out--but it had to be daily replenished with
   fresh oil. Our faith is an immortal flame, but only so because God
   keeps it burning. He expects us to feed the flame by all possible
   means--and above all to ask Him to give it the oil of Divine Grace
   through the means we employ for that purpose. Foolish virgins we shall
   be if we do not secure this needed sustenance for our lamps.

   I am sure that many Christians are to blame for their own trials and
   afflictions of spirit through dark doubts and unbelief. I know that
   there is a devil, and that he will seek to flood your fields and make
   the fair garden a desolation and a mass of mud and corruption. But I
   know, also, that many Christians leave open the sluice gates themselves
   and let in their own deluge through carelessness and lack of prayer to
   God to guard and protect them. I know that Satan will try to keep your
   soul in darkness and gloom, but it is very often your own fault if he
   succeeds. Walk out into the beams which come from the Sun of
   Righteousness! Stand in the light of God's reconciled Countenance! Come
   to the brightness of the Shekinah which covers the Mercy Seat and all
   the powers of darkness, led on by the master Fiend of Hell, cannot cast
   a cloud or shadow over the joy and peace of your believing!

   Of course you will feel the shafts of the foe if you forsake the
   shelter of the high tower into which the righteous run and are safe.
   Confide, then, the custody of your soul to the good Spirit who is the
   Comforter and who will preserve you from those evils which will arise
   if you think that you can be your own keeper. Furthermore, let us try
   to bring others to trust where we have trusted. When a man finds
   something that is good and safe, he likes to recommend it to his
   friends-- let us speak well of God to all our neighbors! Let us tell
   them, whenever we get an opportunity, that God does not leave His
   people--that He is not a wilderness unto His chosen and it may be that
   God will bless our testimony to the bringing in of others.

   I have often mused on that account of our Lord's first disciples, where
   it is written that Jesus welcomed to His house two of John's disciples
   and, "One of the two which heard John speak and followed Jesus, was
   Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. He first finds his own brother, Simon,
   and says unto him, We have found the Messiah, which is, being
   interpreted, the Christ. And he brought him to Jesus." Then further on,
   we find our Lord saying to Philip, "Follow Me." What was the result?
   "Philip finds Nathanael and says unto him, We have found Him of whom
   Moses in the Law and the Prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son
   of Joseph."

   No sooner do these men truly believe in Christ as the long-promised
   Messiah than they call others to Christ, that they may also believe
   upon Him and become His disciples! So also with the woman of Samaria.
   She leaves her water pot and goes into the city and says, "Come, see a
   Man that told me all things that ever I did. Is not this the Christ?"
   Now, with the same spirit we should be moved to go and proclaim to
   others the Grace and goodness of the Lord our God!

   When men engage in that perilous and foolhardy amusement of scaling the
   summits of ice-covered mountains for no other reason than to be able to
   say that no one ever risked breaking his neck on that spot of the
   universe before, they were foolish enough to lead the way! How do they
   climb up these almost inaccessible peaks? Why, one man cuts the steps
   first with his axe, and, mounting up, gives a hand to the next. And he
   puts his feet where the other has trod and so they aid each other.

   And thus it is that we should ascend heavenward! Mount higher and
   higher yourself--ascending daily--and as you ascend, cut steps for
   others and help them up, that together you may mount to the skies! If
   you were overtaken by a deluge, as sometimes happens in the lowlands of
   Australia, what should you think of doing first of all? Would you not
   make for the nearest hill and climb to the summit and get your family
   and goods, if possible, safe out of the waters onto that hilltop, by
   your side? Yes, but if you are a man--in the highest meaning of the
   word--you would not rest content with that! You would try to rescue
   your neighbor and his family and cattle. Yes, everything that was in
   danger or within reach of the flood, would be, if possible, saved by
   you and landed in safety by the side of your own property.

   Such is life! A flood of unbelief is abroad--"get up into the high
   mountain"--and lift up your voice with strength, lift it up, be not
   afraid! "Cry aloud and spare not," but proclaim far and wide that there
   is a Refuge here for all who wish to flee from the wrath to come. I
   think many of us, when we first were seeking the face of an offended
   God, vowed that if ever we were saved we would seek to warn others,
   also, and save them from being lost. Did we not say--

   "Then will I tell to sinners round,
   What a dear Savior I have found!
   I'll point to His redeeming blood,
   And cry, Behold, the way to God'"?

   Begin now, then, to keep your promise! Warn all men and say to each
   with all your heart and soul--

   "O, be earnest, do not stay!
   You may perish even today!
   Rise, you lost one, rise and flee!
   Lo! Your Savior waits for you."

   And if, again, we are trusting in God, let us love Him who thus gives
   Himself to be trusted by us. No man can truly trust God who does not
   love Him. The sister Graces ever live together. They have but one
   address, for they all live in one home. Whenever there is faith, there
   love also dwells and each Grace takes up its residence likewise. Some
   are packed away into cellars or up in attics by many Christians so that
   they are often not seen and you would fancy that they were not at home
   when you called.

   I know that the chain of Graces is unbroken even when some links are
   unseen. God has sown the seeds of all the Graces and they will
   eventually, in the garden of the heart, all spring up and be to the
   glory of His name. What I want is that you should stir up the good
   thing which is in you. Bring it out to the front and make it appear.
   Show your love! If it is as a spark hidden in the midst of a heap of
   refuse, clear out the evil matter, fan the spark into a flame, add fuel
   to it till you shall be all ablaze with love to God! Nothing short of
   this will satisfy God. Anything else is wrong and should not, for one
   moment, be tolerated by us.

   What? Shall I hope for a Heaven through the Grace of God in Christ? Am
   I expecting deliverance from ten thousand ills here and from Hell
   hereafter? Do I trust the Most High for all temporal and spiritual
   good, and am I aware that I deserve not the least of all the many
   mercies I am receiving today and hope to receive in days to come? Do I
   nevertheless cultivate no love to this loving God, this bounteous
   Benefactor? Then I am one of the basest and most sinful of men because
   of my heartlessness and vile ingratitude!--

   "A very wretch, Lord, I should prove
   Had I no love for You!
   Rather than not my Savior love,
   Oh let me cease to be."

   And yet another thought before I conclude--We must prove our faith by
   our works. We must labor for the Lord in whom we are trusting--all must
   see that this is only right and fitting. What have we received and why
   have we been made the recipients of these mercies? Is it not that we
   may go and do for others as God has done for us? O God, do You carry my
   burden and shall I not carry Yours? O Christ, do You not carry the
   Cross for me and shall I not carry the Cross for You? O my Father, do
   You, as it were, lay Yourself down and become a stone for me to build
   on, and shall not I desire to be built on You that I may help others to
   rest on You, too?

   Christian Brothers and Sisters, let us do more for God! As we find Him
   more and more worthy of our trust, let us launch out into fresh fields
   of labor! Let us seek each day to labor for God, as the poet says--

   "No day without a deed."

   So let us have no day without doing something by which we may advance
   the honor of the glorious name of our God! We are bound to leave our
   affairs in God's hands, and then, instead of being idlers and
   loiterers, we are to go and work in His vineyard as long as it is
   called today.

   In this way we can prove our love and show our gratitude--but here let
   me also call your attention to what is one sure way of augmenting your
   faith and increasing your spiritual health. It is this--constant hard
   working for the Lord your God! Cease working and you will soon cease
   believing. You will best secure the constant joy and peace of believing
   by living near to God and, like the Savior when on earth, always being
   "about your Father's business." Love Him as you trust Him! Work for Him
   as you love Him! Grow like He as you work for Him and you shall soon
   come to be with Him as you are like He and His shall be the glory,
   forever and ever. Amen.--

   "Though faint, yet pursuing, we go on our way,
   The Lord is our Leader, His Word is our stay.
   Though suffering and sorrow and trial are near,
   Our God is our Refuge and whom can we fear?
   He raises the fallen, He cheers the faint;
   The weak and oppressed--
   He will hear their complaint.
   The way may be weary and thorny the road,
   But how can we falter? Our help is in God!
   Though clouds may surround us, our God is our light!
   Though storms rage around us, our God is our might.
   So faint, yet pursuing, still onward we come
   The Lord is our Leader and Heaven is our home!"

                                  Heart'S Ease

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, AUGUST 27, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting
   in the Lord."

   Psalm 112:7.

   THE last month has been a peculiarly gloomy season. Evil tidings have
   followed on one another's heels like Job's messengers. Epidemics have
   been rampant among our families and many are the early graves which
   have been filled by contagious diseases. It is greatly to be feared
   that the cholera is stretching its wings of death and hastening to find
   its prey in our crowded lanes and alleys. The disease among the cattle
   is cutting off the herd from the stall and polluting the most
   substantial food of man. And it is much to be feared that the continual
   showers must be spoiling much of the un-crated corn and causing serious
   loss to farmers in the more northern counties.

   In the newspapers of the last few weeks there has been a constant
   succession of the most fearful crimes. Scarcely have we known a period
   in which persons disposed to be melancholy might more thoroughly
   indulge their taste for the darkest apprehensions and forebodings.
   Cheerful as I am, I could, in some degree, sympathize with a good old
   saint with whom I sat a few minutes the other night. He began to lament
   our national sins and tremble at the presence of what he conceived to
   be national judgments. Though I am very far from being troubled with
   uneasy forecasts, yet I freely admit that old age and long experience
   may justly suggest to us earnest searching of heart because of the ills
   of the present period.

   More terrible than rumor of plague or infectious disease of our cattle
   is the manifest fact that Popery is advancing among us with giant
   strides. Turn which way we will, Popery--Romish or Anglican--reeks in
   our nostrils! It is no longer engaged in secretly undermining our
   bulwarks--it has set its ladder to the wall and is scaling the
   ramparts! The Popish party in the Establishment, supported by the
   undoubted superstition of the National Prayer Book, now seeks to regain
   its ancient prominence while its allies without are moving Heaven and
   earth to win this nation to the dominion of Antichrist.

   Meanwhile, there are numerous causes for mourning in the Church of God
   itself--many defections, many departing from first principles and
   fundamental doctrines--and some, who did run well, suddenly turning
   aside and proving that they had never run in the power and energy of
   the Spirit of God. If one preferred the night side of life, one might
   sit down and readily gather congenial shades of cloud and mist about
   one's head and heart. But what good would this do? Despondency wins no
   victories! Let us pluck up courage and go to our knees and to our God!

   Those who have laid hold on Christ Jesus and are resting in the
   Father's love and power have no reason to be disquieted--should all
   Hell be unmuzzled and all earth be unhinged--they may rejoice with a
   joy undampened by carnal fear or earthly sorrow! They have found a
   secret source of supply from which they can draw, if all earth's wells
   should suddenly run dry--for all their fresh springs are in their God!
   Of each Believer, when full of faith, it is true, "He shall not be
   afraid of evil tidings--his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord."

   I. To come directly to the text. EVIL TIDINGS MAY COME TO THE BEST OF
   MEN--to those whose hearts are fixed and are trusting in the Lord. It
   may be of great service to us to remember this dreary fact, for it may
   lead us to let go of earthly things. Let us chew this very bitter
   morsel for a moment or two--there is nothing very palatable or pleasant
   in the recollection that we are not above the shafts of adversity, but
   it may humble us and prevent our boasting with the Psalmist, "My
   mountain stands firm: I shall never be moved." It may stay us from
   taking too deep root in this soil from which we are so soon to be
   transplanted into the heavenly garden.

   1. Let us remember the frail tenure upon which we hold our temporal
   mercies--how soon may evil tidings come concerning them! We rightly
   class our families first in our possessions. We look with delight into
   the faces of our children. We mark their growing abilities. We are
   charmed with evidences of opening intelligence--yet they may never live
   to manhood--their sun may go down before it is yet noon. We are,
   perhaps, perplexed as to what we shall do with them when they shall be
   old enough to be apprenticed to a trade, or initiated into a
   profession. But we may never have that task to care for--long before
   they reach that period of life they may be slumbering in their graves.

   We gaze with ever fresh delight upon those beloved ones with whom we
   are united in the ties of wedlock, but if we gaze wisely we shall
   clearly see mortality written upon the fairest brow and glistening in
   the most loving eyes! How soon may these partners of our heart's best
   affections be torn away from us! We must beware of making idols of
   those who are nearest and dearest, for the objects of our idolatry may
   soon, like the golden calf, be dashed in pieces and we may have to
   drink the waters of bitterness because of our sin.

   If we would remember that all the trees of earth are marked with the
   woodman's axe, we should not be so ready to build our nests in them. We
   should love, but we should love with the love which expects death and
   which reckons upon separations. Our dear relations are but loaned to us
   and the hour when we must return them to the Lender's hand may be even
   at the door. The same is certainly true of our worldly goods. Do not
   riches take to themselves wings and fly away? And though we have heard
   some almost profanely say that they have clipped the wings of their
   riches so that they cannot fly away, yet the bird of prey may rend them
   where they are, and the rotting carcass of the wealth which the owners
   cannot enjoy may be a perpetual curse to them.

   Full often gold and silver canker in the coffer and fret the soul of
   their claimant. God can do with us as with Israel-- "While the meat was
   yet in their mouths, the curse of God came upon them." What substance
   have we beneath the skies? Is not what we call substance a mere shadow
   soon departing? Your good substantial ship has often returned from her
   voyage to enrich her owner and just now she flies before a favoring
   gale. But there are storms and hurricanes and sunken reefs and
   quicksand--and who knows how soon your promising venture and the vessel
   which bears it may sink into the briny sea?

   There stands your warehouse--it is full of merchandize upon which, with
   but a fair profit, great wealth may be obtained! But a fire may come
   and there may happen to be no insurance, or by a change of market,
   profit may wither into loss. Your present prosperity may soon be turned
   into distress by the failure of some larger warehouse, the dishonoring
   of large bills, a breach of credit, or an unexpected drain of capital.
   How often have enterprises high as the tower of Babel suddenly rocked
   and reeled and fallen in total ruin? This world, at best, is but a
   sandy foundation and the wisest builder may well look for an end to the
   most substantial of its erections.

   Evil tidings may also come to us in another respect--we may suddenly
   find our health decay. That strength which now enables us to perform
   our daily business with delight may so fail us that the slightest
   exertion may cause us pain. Although unconscious of so sad a fact, we
   may be, even now, fostering within our bodies the disease which is
   destined to stretch us upon the bed of sickness. We should be prepared
   for the days of darkness, for they are many. The day of sickness would
   not overtake us as a thief if we were wise enough to remember that we
   are dust. Frail flowers of the field, we must not reckon upon blooming
   forever.

   Spring lasts not all the year--the time of the sere and yellow leaf
   must come and the frosts of winter must nip our root. Why should I
   suppose that I am to enjoy an immunity from the common ills of mankind?
   Am I not among those who are born of woman? Is it not written that all
   such are "of few days and full of trouble"? Do not the "sparks fly
   upward" from my hearth? And why, then, should I suppose that I am not
   "born to trouble" like the rest of my race? It were well for us if we
   would remember that there is a time appointed for weakness and
   sickness. Then we should be more thankful for the privilege of going up
   to the Lord's House, since the day comes when we can no longer go up
   Zion's hill.

   While we can serve God let us remember that the time may come when we
   shall rather have to fear than to do--when we can only glorify Him by
   suffering and not by earnest activity. Be it ours to live while we live
   and snatch the present moment out of the jaws of Time. And while the
   evil days come not, nor the days draw near in which we shall say we
   have no pleasure in them, let us serve God with both our hands and
   spend and be spent in His service! There is no single point in which we
   can hope to escape from the sharp arrows of affliction. The fondest
   hope which you and I have cherished may yet drop like the fruit of the
   tree before it is ripe--destroyed at the core by a secret worm.

   Set not your affections upon things of earth--set your whole heart upon
   things above, for here the rust corrupts and the moth devours and the
   thief breaks through--but there all joys are perpetual and eternal!
   What is there here, after all, but cloud land? Why seek we to be lords
   of acres of mere mist? What are earth's treasures but vapor? Will you
   heap up for yourself haze and fog? Cloud and mist will pass away and if
   these are your riches, how poverty-stricken will you be when you can
   carry none of these airy riches into the land of solid wealth!

   Christian, remember well the insecurity of all earthly things and be
   content to have it so! Certain expositors refer this passage to slander
   and reproach, and they translate it, "He shall not be afraid of evil
   hearing." It is one of the sharpest trials of the Christian's life to
   be misunderstood, misrepresented and belied. But any man who will serve
   his Master well must make up his mind to endure much of this
   affliction. The more prominent you are in Christ's service, the more
   certain are you to be the butt of jokes.

   I have long ago said farewell to my character--I lost it in the earlier
   days of my ministry by being a little more zealous than suited a
   slumbering age! And I have never been able to regain it except in the
   sight of Him who judges all the earth, and in the hearts of those who
   love me for my work's sake. Beloved fellow-laborers in the vineyard of
   the Lord Jesus, you must all set your account upon being despised and
   reproached for His dear sake! You weaker ones come to your minister and
   say, "So-and-So has spoken evil of me." What? Young Friend, is this a
   strange thing? Did this never happen to anybody before?

   You sit down and cry, "It will break my heart! This cruel report will
   be the death of me!" Was no one else ever broken in heart by reproach?
   Did nobody else have his character besmeared by the fingers of envy and
   the tongue of talebearing? Who are you, my fine Sir, that you should
   escape? Gentle Sister, who are you that you are never to be abused?
   Humble yourself and do not be so proud as to think a special escape
   should be made for you when your Lord and all His followers have had to
   endure much contradiction of sinners!

   Woe unto you when all men speak well of you! It is a blessing to attain
   to such a state that you care no more than the rock cares for the
   raging billows what men may say, so long as you have a conscience void
   of offense both toward God and toward man! In all these things, we
   ought to expect evil tidings.

   2. Evil tidings will also come to us concerning spiritual matters, and
   babes in Grace will be greatly alarmed. Every now and then there comes
   a messenger with breathless haste who tells us that the sages have
   discovered that the Bible is a lie. Years ago we were all astonished to
   find that people had been digging down into the earth and had brought
   up loads of very hard stones with which Revelation was to be slain,
   like Stephen by the Jews. Revelation has lived on wonderfully well and
   flourished amazingly, notwithstanding all that!

   Another very judicious naturalist afterwards discovered--and oh, what
   consternation there was--that we had all sprung from monkeys and that
   all living creatures were the result of successive developments from
   infusible atoms! Somehow or other the Gospel has managed to survive
   even this tremendous blow! Not many months ago a learned quarryman dug
   up a jawbone and a bushel or two of pointed flints--the undoubted
   property of primeval men who lived-- according to report, ages before
   Adam!

   Now this discovery was to silence forever the teachings of Inspiration.
   Those flints were invincible and deadly weapons! But the religion of
   Jesus is so full of life that her deadliest foes cannot make an end of
   her! Voltaire, you remember, had a printing press at Geneva some years
   ago with which he printed a prophecy that Christianity would not
   survive the century of which he thought himself the bright and shining
   light! That very press is now printing copies of the Bible in Geneva!

   A few weeks ago we were informed ethnologically that Negroes were
   nearly allied to apes and that the Scripture statement that God has
   made of one blood all nations that dwell upon the face of the earth was
   clearly contrary to fact. But, my Brethren, this grand old Book manages
   still to survive and I think the most of us who know its value can say
   we are not afraid of evil tidings which prophesy the overthrow of its
   authority--for it will see all its foes withered in the grass and yet
   not one of its jots or tittles shall pass away!

   Our heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord! We can leave these gentlemen
   to the old women among us, whose experimental acquaintance with the
   power of godliness will be as a two-edged sword to slay the enemies'
   sounding professions of superior intelligence. The blind and the lame
   in the Lord's army shall laugh to scorn the champions of the
   Philistines, for the Lord of Hosts is with us as our Captain, and Jesus
   rides forth conquering and to conquer!

   Sadder tidings at times afflict us. We hear, dear Friends, that
   professors have fallen. What a thunderclap it seems when we are told
   that such-and- such a prominent member has forsaken the path of
   rectitude, or a minister has departed from sound doctrine. Yes, and we
   must expect this. Judas and Demas will be represented over and over
   again and even

   Simon Magus will not be wanting in the Church as long as it is here
   below. We shall, moreover, hear that success has vanished where once it
   ruled. We may preach the Gospel and win thousands of souls--but
   suddenly there may be no conversions and those who are the warmest
   adherents of the Truth of God may gradually grow cold.

   Be ready for these things! There have been ebbs and flows in the Church
   in all ages. And her progress has been like that of the ocean when it
   comes to its flood--it has been by a succession of in-rolling waves and
   waves that fall back again into the sea. So will it be till Christ
   comes. We shall also hear evil tidings about ourselves. Satan will tell
   us that we are hypocrites and conscience will remind us of sundry
   things which raise the suspicion that we are not soundly regenerated.
   It will be a blessed thing if then we can fly again to the Cross of
   Jesus Christ!

   If the Law thunders at us and gives us evil tidings of wrath to come,
   happy are we if we can fly to the great Law-Fulfiller and find a
   shelter from the Law's clamorous demands. But we must expect this. No
   saint gets to Heaven without being attacked by Satan. An old Divine
   said that the way to Heaven passed by the mouth of Hell. You must have
   spiritual conflicts. How could you be crowned if you did not fight and
   how could you win the victory if you knew no battle?

   3. Moreover, to conclude the list, the evil tidings of death will soon
   be brought to you by the appointed messenger. How evil are the solemn
   tidings of departure to the most of men! The message will be given to
   us, "The Master is come and calls for you." We shall see the
   spirit-finger which beckons down to the cold flood of Jordan--but we
   shall not fear those evil tidings! No! Faith shall count them a blessed
   message and we shall march cheerfully onward where Jesus leads the way!

   In eternity there shall be the evil tidings of the angelic trumpet,
   evil to all but saints! "Arise, you dead and come to judgment." The
   general summons shall gather together all nations of men to stand
   before the dread tribunal, but truly in that case our heart shall be so
   fixed--no--flooded with Divine delights! With joy shall we receive the
   resurrection and with transport stand to be acquitted at the Judgment
   Seat!

   I have thus marshaled before you a line of grim-visaged messengers--any
   one of whom may, within a moment--rush into your chamber, crying,
   "Tidings! Man of God! Tidings!"

   II. Now for a second and more cheerful thought. A CHRISTIAN AT NO TIME
   OUGHT TO FEAR EITHER AN EXPECTATION OF EVIL TIDINGS OR WHEN THE TIDINGS
   ACTUALLY ARRIVE. Under no conceivable circumstances ought you,
   Christian, to be afraid. And why? Because, if you are troubled and
   distressed and distracted, what do you more than other men?

   Other men have not your God to fly to! They are not favorites of Heaven
   as you are! They have never proved the faithfulness of God as you have
   done and it is no wonder if they are bowed down with alarm and cowed
   with fear--but as for you--you profess to be of another spirit! You
   testify to the world that God dwells in you, and you in Him! You say
   that you have been begotten again unto a lively hope! You testify that
   your heart lives in Heaven and not on earthly things!

   Now, if you are seen to be distracted as other men, what is the value
   of that Divine Grace which you profess to have received? Where is the
   dignity of that new Nature which you claim to possess? Surely, dear
   Brothers and Sisters, unless you would be suspected of having boasted
   beyond your measure, you must not be afraid of evil tidings! Again, if
   you should be filled with alarm, as others are, you would, doubtless,
   be led into the sins so common to others under trying circumstances.

   The ungodly, when they are overtaken by evil tidings, rebel against
   God. They murmur and think that God deals harshly with them. Will you
   fall into that same sin? Will you provoke the Lord as they do? If you
   are the subject of the same distraction, you will, probably, fall into
   the same murmuring. Moreover, unconverted men often run to wrong means,
   to evil shifts in order to escape from difficulties. And you will be
   sure to do the same, saint as you are, if your mind yields too far to
   the present pressure. Trust in the Lord and wait patiently for Him!
   Your wisest course is to do as Moses did at the Red Sea--"Stand still
   and see the salvation of God."

   But if your heart is troubled. If the water gets to leaking into your
   ship and the vessel, itself, is filled with the boiling flood--why, you
   will be plotting this and plotting the other--and before long you will
   be putting forth your hand unto iniquity and so piercing yourself
   through with many sorrows! But if the Holy Spirit enables you, in
   patience, to possess your souls--then, if you suffer, you will not sin
   and, with all your temptations--you will not suffer, by His Grace, from
   the regret of having departed from the living God.

   Further, you must not give way to these doubts and alarms and fears,
   for if you do you will be unfit to meet the trouble. In storms landsmen
   are all in alarm and fear and they are fit for nothing. Just put them
   under the hatches and keep them down below, or else they will be in the
   sailors' way. But the old sailor has seen a storm before and the
   captain has had many a nor'wester blowing upon him--so he looks around
   him just as if all were calm and gives his orders to the pilot and the
   first mate with perfect composure.

   And when they have to reef all sail and lie under bare poles, or, worse
   still, if the mast goes by the board, the captain is very serious, but
   still quiet and hopeful. He has weathered other tempests and he shall
   outlive this, also! But you flurried people who are all in a fluster at
   every piece of evil tidings, what will you do? Why, you will cut your
   own fingers in seeking to carve your own deliverance! You will push
   down your house about your head when you meant to have propped it up!
   You will be quite unable to meet the difficulty if your heart is not
   "fixed, trusting in the Lord."

   Let me ask you another and very important question. If you give way to
   fright and fear when you hear of evil tidings, how can you glorify God?
   Saints can sing God's high praises in the fires and bless His name on
   beds of sickness! But you cannot if you fall into distractions. Why,
   Man, can your murmuring praise God? Your doubts and fears, as if you
   had none to help you--will these magnify the Most High? Come, I pray
   you, if you would honor God, be brave!

   A certain good man was much troubled under a loss in business. His wife
   tried to comfort him but failed. But being a very wise woman she gave
   it up till the morning. In the morning when she came downstairs her
   face looked so sad that her husband said, "What is the matter with
   you?" She, still preserving a mournful countenance, said that a dream
   had troubled her. "What was it, my Dear?" he said, "you ought not to be
   troubled with dreams."

   "Oh," she said, "I dreamed that God was dead and it was such reason for
   trouble that all the angels were weeping in Heaven and all the saints
   on earth were ready to break their hearts." Her husband said, "You must
   not be foolish! You know it was only a dream." "Oh but," she said, "to
   think of God's being dead!" He replied, "You must not even think of
   such a thing, for God cannot die! He ever lives to comfort His people."

   Instantly her face brightened up and she said, "I thought I would bring
   you thus to rebuke yourself, for you have been dreaming that God had
   forsaken you and now you see how groundless is your sorrow. While God
   lives, His people are safe." So, Christian, I think I could give you
   many reasons why you should praise God and take courage even when evil
   tidings come! For the sake of blessing others. For your own spiritual
   health and profit, that you may get fatness out of famine, safety out
   of danger, gain out of loss--pray that your heart may be fixed in sure
   confidence upon the faithfulness of your covenant God!

   III. But now somebody will say, "I do not know how I am to keep from
   these fears. My mind is like that of another man and I am readily
   disturbed." Dear Brother, the text tells you, in the third place, that
   FIXEDNESS OF HEART IS THE TRUE CURE FOR BEING ALARMED AT EVIL TIDINGS.
   "Fixedness of heart." The translators somewhat differ as to what this
   passage means. And some think it means preparedness of heart--"my heart
   is fixed," or, "my heart is prepared." Let it mean both and then we
   shall have the whole truth, for he whose heart is fixed is prepared!

   Now in what respect is a Christian's heart fixed? I think in many.
   First, the Christian's heart is fixed as to duty. He says within
   himself, "It is my business to walk as Christ walked--it can never be
   right for me to do contrary to God's will. I have set the Lord always
   before me and in integrity of heart will I walk all my way, wherever
   that way may lead." Such a man is prepared for anything! Whatever trial
   comes he is prepared to meet it because his soul is resolved that come
   gain, come loss, he will not be dishonest to make himself rich.

   He will not tell a lie to win a kingdom. He will not give up a
   principle to save his life. He has not to go, as some of you have, to
   the next neighbor to say, "What am I to do? What is the best policy?"
   The Christian has no policy! He does right and leaves consequences to
   God. I know that if the skies wanted propping with sin, it is no
   business of mine to prop them and if they could only be sustained by my
   speaking falsely, they should fall.

   The Truth of God is our business! Integrity is our line of duty and
   results remain with the Most High. In this respect the man who, by
   Grace, is fixed for the strait and narrow road is prepared, come what
   may. But, more comfortable than this, the Christian's heart is fixed as
   to knowledge and so prepared. There are some things which a Believer
   knows and is quite fixed about. He knows, for instance, that God sits
   in the stern-sheets of the vessel when it rocks most. He believes that
   an invisible hand is always on the world's tiller and that wherever
   Providence may drift, Jehovah steers it. That reassuring knowledge
   prepares him for everything.

   "It is my Father's will," says he. He looks over the raging waters and
   he sees the spirit of Jesus treading the billows and he hears a voice
   which says, "It is I, be not afraid." He knows, too, that God is always
   wise and, knowing this, he is prepared for all events. They cannot come
   amiss, says he. There can be no accidents, no mistakes, nothing can
   occur which ought not to occur. If I should lose all I have, it is
   better that I should lose than have, if God so wills--the worst
   calamity is the wisest and the kindest thing that could occur to me if
   God ordains it.

   "We know that all things work together for good to them that love God."
   The Christian does not merely hold this as a theory--he knows it as a
   matter of fact. Everything has worked for good as of yet. The poisonous
   drugs that have been mixed in the compound have, nevertheless, worked
   the cure. The sharp cuts of the lancet have cleansed out the proud
   flesh and facilitated the healing. Every event as yet has worked out
   the most divinely blessed results. And so, believing this, that God
   rules it, that God rules wisely, that God brings good out of evil--the
   Believer's heart is fixed and he is well prepared.

   Bring me which cup you will, my Father fills them all and I will drink
   them as He sends them--not merely with res-ignation--but with
   sanctified delight! Send me what You will, my God, so long as it comes
   from You! Never was that a bad portion which came from Your table to
   any one of Your children. My Father, write what You will concerning
   Your child--I will not, by Your Grace, seek to pry between the folded
   leaves--but I will patiently hope and quietly wait as leaf by leaf is
   unfolded, knowing You are too wise to err and too good to be unkind.
   Now see what a preparation this is for evil tidings--this having the
   heart fixed in a knowledge of God!

   Further, there is another kind of fixedness, namely, the fixedness of
   resignation. There is a verse we sing in one of the hymns, that I
   hardly think at times some of us ought to sing, for it is not at all
   times true--

   "O You gracious, wise and just,
   In Your hands my life I trust,
   Have I somewhat dearer still?
   I resign it to Your will."

   It is very easy to say that, but very difficult to carry it out. To
   take Isaac, our only son, up to the altar and unsheathe the knife at
   God's command needs an Abrahamic faith and that kind of faith is not so
   common as it should be among Christians.

   Beloved, when we gave ourselves to Christ we gave Him our person, our
   estate, our friends and everything--we made a full surrender and the
   only way to be right when affliction comes is to stand to that
   surrender--in fact, to renew it every day. It is a good thing every
   morning to give all up to God and then to live through the day and
   thank Him for renewing the daily lease. If you think you have mercies
   on a fifty years' lease you will become discontented if turned out of
   the tenancy. But if you feel you are only, as it were, a daily tenant,
   you will feel grateful that the great Landlord has given you a new
   lease!

   The eyes of your body--are they given forever? Their light may never
   know tomorrow's sun. Those lips which you today give to God's service
   may soon chill in silence. So is it with all you have. Then resign all
   to God, for if you give it all up to Him every day, it will not be hard
   to give it up when He takes it away at last. If you have resigned it a
   thousand times before, it will only be a repetition of what you have
   rehearsed to yourself before and, therefore, are well taught in. Stand
   to your resignation! Be fixed about that and you will be prepared for
   the most evil tidings.

   Better still, let me remind you of one form of fixedness which will
   make you outride every storm, namely, fixedness as to eternal things.
   "I cannot lose," the Christian may say--"I cannot lose my best things."
   When a carrier has many parcels to carry, if he has gold and silver or
   precious stones, he is sure to put them near himself. Perhaps he has
   some common goods and these he ties on behind--some thief, it is
   possible, steals from the cart some of the common goods which were
   outside. "Oh, well," says the man when he gets home, "I am sorry to
   lose anything, but my precious things are all right. I have them all
   safe. I thank God the thief could not run away with them."

   Now our earthly goods, and even our dearest friends, are only the
   common mercies of God--but our Savior, our God, our eternal interest in
   the Covenant, our Heaven which we are soon to inherit--these are kept
   where they cannot be lost! A friend of mine once went up to the bank
   with a thousand pounds in his pocket. I do not think he was very wise,
   for after putting that large sum in his pocket, he put his handkerchief
   over it and somewhere or other down in the Borough, or over London
   Bridge, a thief stole his handkerchief!

   He said to me, "I never thought at all about that! I was so full of joy
   at finding that the money was not gone." The anecdote is instructive,
   for our earthly comforts compared with our eternal interests are but as
   the handkerchief compared to the thousand pounds--no--they do not bear
   so high a relation! If adversity should come and take everything else
   away, yet, Christian, your heart is still fixed because you have a
   grasp of eternal things. And neither life nor death, nor time, nor
   eternity can make you let go of your hold of the Glory which is to be
   revealed in you! Thus you are prepared, come what may.

   I will only add one other thought on this point. I believe that holy
   gratitude is one blessed way of fixing the soul on God and preparing it
   for trouble. You have a friend who gave you a very hard word the other
   day. You felt very grieved, but after a few minutes you said, "There,
   now, if he were to kick me, I should always love him for the great
   kindness that he did to me years ago when I was in great straits." Now,
   when I think of what our God has done for us, how He saved us from
   going down into the pit and found a ransom in His own dear Son! When we
   remember how He has plucked us out of the horrible pit and out of the
   miry clay--let Him do to me what seems good to Him!

   The Lord gave us Christ! Then let Him take away what He will--we cannot
   think harshly of Him--after such a proof of love we are bound to Him by
   such ties of gratitude that let Him take away one mercy after the other
   till there is hardly one left, we will yet bless His name. "Though He
   slay me, yet will I trust Him." Let every saint of God feel himself so
   fixed and bound by ties of gratitude that he is prepared, whatever may
   come, still to bless his God!

   IV. The last point is this--THE GREAT INSTRUMENT OF FIXEDNESS OF HEART
   IS FAITH IN GOD. "His heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord." You see
   that we have come here by progressive steps. Evil tidings may come to
   an heir of Heaven--he ought not to be afraid of them. The way to be
   prepared for them is to have your heart fixed and prepared. And the
   method of having the heart fixed is confident trustfulness in the Lord.

   The Christian is not prepared for trial by trusting in his fellow men,
   or by relying upon his own wisdom and experience. We lean on a better
   prop than an arm of flesh! The Christian relies only upon his God.
   Every attribute engages this confidence. The heir of Heaven rests in
   the love of God. "Oh," says he, "my Father loves me too well to suffer
   any evil thing to damage me. I know by that very Spirit which He has
   given, by which I cry, 'Abba, Father'--I know the tenderness of His
   heart forbids that I should ever perish, or that anything should happen
   to me which shall do me serious damage."

   When there was a fire many years ago in the little town of Delft, in
   Holland, it occurred in a house upon the top of which a stork's nest
   had been built. Now the storks are very affectionate to their young and
   it was observed that as the flames went up, the storks tried first of
   all to carry off their young, but when that could not be done, both
   parents kept flapping their nests with their wings, as though to cool
   the young ones. And when the flames drew nearer, both parents set
   themselves down over the top of the nest and there died with their
   young ones.

   Can it be possible that our God could have less affection for His own
   children than these poor birds had for the offspring of their nest?
   Impossible! He will cover us with His feathers and under His wings will
   we trust! His Truth shall be our shield and buckler. Come famine, come
   pestilence, come disease, come death, come judgment--

   "He that has loved us bears us through, And makes us more than
   conquerors, too." The Believer, thus dependent upon God's love, is also
   trusting in God's power. He knows that none ever did resist the Lord
   with success. That mighty arm breaks the enemy in pieces! When he goes
   forth to war, it is as when the potter breaks earthen vessels with a
   rod of iron. The Christian feels that the Omnipotence of God is more to
   be trusted than the power of the devil is to be dreaded.

   "More is He that is for us than all they that are against us." The
   Christian perceives the enemy round about, but his eyes have been
   touched with heavenly ointment and he can also see the mountain full of
   horses and chariots of fire! And therefore he trusts in the power of
   his God and his soul is not disturbed. He relies also, as we have said,
   upon the wisdom of God, for indeed, every attribute of the Most High
   becomes a subject of the Believer's joy. I am afraid, dear Friends, we
   forget our God too often. I am sure that at the bottom we do not
   believe Him to be wise, or else we do not believe Him to be gracious.
   For if we did know and feel and realize that He is God and just such a
   God as Scripture says He is, we should lean back upon Him and leave
   trouble, adversity, loss and crosses with Him--casting all our care on
   Him because He cares for us.

   Get, I pray you, to be assured of His sympathy with you. Do not think
   He is indifferent to the griefs that vex you. You are in the furnace,
   but He sits at the mouth of it watching you as the dross melts in the
   flame. God is never away from any of His children, but He is nearest to
   those who are the most sad and sick and troubled. If there is one sheep
   in the fold that is more watched over than the rest, it is the weakest
   sheep. "He carries the lambs in His bosom and gently leads those that
   are with young." You cannot imagine how dear you are to His heart! And
   He is so determined to bring you safely home that He has sworn it with
   an oath. By two immutable things, wherein it was impossible for God to
   lie, He has given you strong consolation.

   Will you reject the consolation when He brings it? Is not the Comforter
   Himself able to comfort you? Christ has gone to Heaven that you might
   have that precious gift of the Comforter within you! Why will you
   grieve the Holy Spirit of God and bring this trouble upon your own
   spirit by these anxieties, these doubts, and fears? "Trust in the Lord
   Jehovah, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength." Go with joy
   and draw water out of the well of salvation and praise Him all the days
   of your life.

   When Dr. Payson was getting near his end he reminded his friends that
   God is enough for His people. He said, "In years gone by I often
   dreaded the taking away of certain earthly comforts. But when they have
   been withdrawn, I have had so much more of the Grace and Presence of
   God that I have had to be thankful for the apparent loss, for it was a
   real gain. And now," he said, "that I am a cripple and confined to my
   house, I am far happier than I ever expected to be, and am as happy as
   a man well could be out of Heaven." We can sing that verse together--

   "And if our dearest comforts fall
   Before His Sovereign will,
   He never takes away our all.
   Himself He gives us still."

   Since you have your God left, Christian, let the text be true of you,
   "He is not afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the
   Lord." I have not time to say anything about the contrast to all this,
   but it is a contrast which would bear very hard upon those of you who
   have not looked to Jesus Christ. You have need to be afraid of
   everything. The stones of the earth are not in league with you, nor are
   the beasts of the earth at peace with you. There is no Providence
   working your good. There is no special eye upon your benefit. You are
   orphan children.

   The stars in Heaven fought against Sisera, remember, and they fight
   against you. The sweet influence of the Pleiades you cannot know, and
   heavenly blessings you can claim no share. Oh, that you could hide
   yourself beneath the wings of God! Do you desire it? Then remember who
   it was that said, "How often would I have gathered you as a hen gathers
   her chickens under her wings."

   Fly to the Savior! There are His wounds. They will afford you shelter.
   He died to save the lost! For the rebellious He has obtained mercies.
   Give Him your soul to save! Trust Him to work a good work in you and
   for you and you shall never die, but, with holy joy and confidence
   shall live in the light of His Countenance forevermore! The Lord bless
   this sermon to the staying of His people's hearts upon Himself and His
   shall be the praise. Amen.

                     Degrees Of Power Attending The Gospel

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 3, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For our Gospel came not unto you in word only, but also inpower, and
   in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance; as you know what manner of
   men we were among you for your sake." 1 Thessalonians 1:5.

   PAUL here claimed two things which are absolutely necessary to success
   in the Christian ministry. He could call the Gospel, "our Gospel," and
   this is a foremost essential in a sent servant of Jesus Christ. Paul,
   Silas and Timothy, here speaking at once, declare the word which they
   had preached to be their own in a peculiar sense--every true minister
   must be able to do the same--we must, ourselves, have been saved before
   we preach salvation. "I believed, therefore have I spoken," says the
   Psalmist. "We also believe, and therefore speak," say the whole college
   of the Apostles. Without faith, the religious teacher is a mere
   pretender unworthy of respect.

   The Christian minister must, however, not only believe the truth of
   what he asserts, but he must experimentally enjoy it. The farmer that
   labors must, himself, also first be a partaker of the fruit. Before
   Ezekiel delivered to the people the prophecies which were written in
   the roll, the voice came to him, "Son of man, eat this roll." And he
   did not only take it into his mouth, where it was like honey for
   sweetness, but it descended even into his bowels and mingled with his
   innermost self. We must, ourselves, feel the weight of that burden of
   the Lord which we proclaim to others, or we shall not be ministers of
   the Apostolic sort, but rather shall be descendants of the hypocritical
   Pharisees who bound heavy burdens, grievous to be borne, upon other
   men's shoulders but were not willing to touch them with so much as one
   of their fingers.

   The Apostle Paul could, with peculiar propriety, call the Gospel his
   own. On the road to Damascus he had singularly experienced its mighty
   power. And afterwards--in many trials, in many difficulties, in varied
   experiences, in furious temptations--he had made each Truth of
   Scripture his own by having tasted its sweetness, handled its strength,
   proved its comfort and tried its power! Do not think of preaching,
   young man, until you have the Truth of God written on your very soul!
   As well think of steering the Great Eastern across the ocean without
   knowing the first principles of navigation! As well think of setting up
   as an ambassador without your country's sanction as to dare to intrude
   yourself into the Christian ministry unless the Gospel is first your
   own.

   No amount of training at Oxford, or Cambridge, or anywhere else--no
   extent of classical or mathematical teaching can ever make you a
   minister of Jesus Christ--if you lack the first qualification, namely a
   personal interest in salvation by Jesus Christ. What? Will you profess
   to be a physician while the leprosy is on your own brow? Will you
   attempt to stand between the living and the dead when you are,
   yourself, devoid of spiritual life? The priests of old were touched
   with the blood upon their thumb, toe and ear to show that they were
   consecrated everywhere. And none among us must dare to exercise any
   office for God among His people till first of all we know the
   cleansing, quickening, refining and sanctifying power of the blood of
   the Lord Jesus Christ!

   It must be our Gospel before we may so much as think of aspiring to the
   high and holy office of the Gospel ministry. But this alone is not
   sufficient. The Christian minister, if he would imitate Paul, must be
   very careful of his manner of life among the people. He must be able to
   say without blushing, "You know what manner of men we were among you
   for your sake." Unselfishness must be our prominent attribute--all must
   be done for our people's sake. And then we must, in our lives, show the
   truthfulness of our unselfish professions. O God, how much of Grace is
   needed that Your servants may be clear of the blood of all men and make
   full proof of their ministry!

   We are not appointed to stand as motionless way-posts to point the way
   with lifeless accuracy and unsympathizing coldness--this many have
   done, and while showing the road have never moved one inch in it
   themselves--such men shall have terrible judgment at the last. We are
   appointed to be guides to the pilgrims over the hills of life and we
   are bound to attend their footsteps and tread the road ourselves!
   Clambering up every Hill of Difficulty and descending every Valley of
   Humiliation, we are to be crying to the pilgrim band, "Be followers of
   us even as we are followers of Christ Jesus."

   It is not for us to say, "Go!" but, "Come!" We are not to bid you do
   anything without first doing it ourselves. It is an ill time with the
   preacher when he is compelled to say, "Do as I say and not as I do."
   Evil practice will drown the best of preaching! Holy living, intense
   earnestness, passionate longing for souls, vehement importunity in
   prayer, humility and sincerity must so blend together in our walk and
   conversation, that having the Gospel to be our own, we may be fully
   fitted for the work of the Christian ministry--"for your sake"--that
   you who bear us may not find us unprofitable in the day of the Lord
   Jesus Christ.

   Having said this much upon the ministry itself, we observe that our
   text deals mainly with the hearers, and therefore has a voice for you.
   We shall use the text for two purposes--first, by way of
   discrimination. And, secondly, for instruction.

   I. The text suggests and very strongly, too, a thoroughly
   heart-searching DISCRIMINATION--a mode of testing ourselves by which
   our election may be proven, or our unregeneracy discovered. The Gospel
   comes to all who hear it. In our own land, especially among you who
   constantly attend places of worship, it comes to you all. If I
   understand Scripture aright, it is the same Gospel which comes to the
   unregenerate as to the regenerate. And though in some it is "a savor of
   death unto death," and in others, "a savor of life unto life," yet the
   distinction is not in the Gospel but in the way in which it is received
   or rejected.

   Some of our Brethren--who are very anxious to carry out the decrees of
   God--instead of believing that God can carry them out Himself, always
   try to make distinctions in their preaching. They preach one Gospel to
   one set of sinners and another to a different class! They are very
   unlike the old sowers, who, when they went out to sow, sowed among
   thorns and on stony places and by the wayside. These Brethren, with
   profound wisdom, endeavor to find out which is the good ground. They
   insist upon it that not so much as a single handful of invitations may
   be cast anywhere but on the prepared soil.

   They are much too wise to preach the Gospel in Ezekiel's fashion to the
   dry bones in the valley while they are yet dead. They withhold any Word
   of the Gospel till there is a little quivering of life among the bones!
   And then they commence operations. They do not think it to be their
   duty to go into the highways and hedges and bid all, as many as they
   find, to come to the supper. Oh, no! They are too orthodox to obey the
   Master's will! They desire to understand, first, who are appointed to
   come to the supper and then they will invite them! That is to say they
   will do what there is no necessity to do. They have not faith enough,
   or enough subjugation of will to the supreme commands of the great
   Master to do that which only faith dares do--namely, tell the dry bones
   to live--bid the man with the withered hand stretch out his arm and
   speak to him that is sick of the palsy and tell him to take up his bed
   and walk!

   It strikes me that refusing to set forth Jesus to all men of every
   character and refraining from inviting them to come to Him is a great
   mistake. I do not find David suiting his counsels to the ability of
   men. David gives commands to ungodly men--"Be wise, therefore, O you
   kings; be instructed you judges of the earth. Kiss the Son, lest He be
   angry and you perish from the way, while His wrath is kindled but a
   little." He did not withhold his exhortation because they were such
   rebels that they would not, and could not, kiss the king. No! He told
   them to do it whether they could or not!

   So with the Prophets. They boldly say, "Wash you! Make you clean! Put
   away the evil of your doings from before My eyes; cease to do evil,
   learn to do well." One of them absolutely cries, "Make you a new heart
   and a new spirit," (Ezek. 18:31). And yet, I doubt not, that he was
   perfectly agreed with that other Prophet who taught the powerlessness
   of man in those two memorable questions, "Can the Ethiopian change his
   skin, or the leopard his spots?" These men did not think that they were
   to judge of what they were to preach by the degree of power in the
   hearers--they judged by the power which dwells in their God to make the
   Word effectual!

   As it was with Prophets, so was it with Apostles! Peter cried to the
   crowd who gathered about the Beautiful Gate of the temple, "Repent you,
   therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out." They
   delivered the Gospel, the same Gospel, to the dead as to the
   living--the same Gospel to the non-elect as to the elect. The point of
   distinction is not in the Gospel, but in its being applied by the Holy
   Spirit, or left to be rejected of man. The same Gospel, it strikes me
   in the text, came to all! And the point of distinction was farther on,
   namely, in the operation of that Gospel upon the heart.

   1. It appears, then, in the first place, that to some the Gospel comes
   only in words. Even here there are different levels. To some it only
   comes in words in a fashion that they scarcely know what it is all
   about. Some of you go to a place of worship because it is the right
   thing to do. You sit down on the seats and sit out an hour-and-a-half
   or so of penance. When that is done you feel you have performed a very
   proper act--but you have no idea what the talk was all about. It may be
   said of you that hearing you do not hear for your ears are dull and
   heavy.

   You know no more of the Divine mind than the men who were with Saul on
   the road to Damascus who heard a voice but saw no man. I believe a very
   large majority of church goers know no more of what the preaching is
   about than did Jonathan's lad when he ran after the arrows. Their
   flight David well understood, "but the lad knew nothing of the matter."
   Too many are merely the stolid, unthinking, slumbering worshippers of
   an unknown God. In others the Word comes in a little better sense, but
   still in words only. They hear it and they understand it in theory, and
   probably are much pleased with it, especially if it is delivered in a
   manner which suits their taste, or which commends itself to their
   understanding. They hear and they do not quite forget.

   They remember and are gratified with illustrations, doctrinal truths,
   and so on--but when you have said that, you have said it all. The
   Gospel remains in them as certain potent drugs remain in the chemist's
   bottles--they are there but they produce no effect. The Gospel comes to
   them as an unloaded cannon rumbles into its shed, or as a barrel of
   gunpowder is rolled into the magazine--there is no force in it because
   the fire of God's Spirit is absent. The preacher lashes the air and
   whips the water. He woos the wind and invites the cloud when he
   preaches to such as these. They hear, but hear in vain--insensible as
   steel.

   To others it comes in a preferable manner but still only in words. They
   are really affected by it--the tears stream down their cheeks! They
   scarcely know how to sit. They resolve, if they once get home, they
   will pray. They think of amending their lives--past follies and present
   dangers come before them and they are somewhat alarmed. But the morning
   cloud is not more fleeing, and the early dew vanishes not sooner than
   these good things of theirs! They look at their natural face in the
   glass of the Word, but they go away and forget what manner of men they
   are--because the emotion felt is produced by the words and not by the
   Spirit and Life of the Truth of God.

   Why, Brothers and Sisters, men weep at a theater! And weep far more
   there than they do in many places of worship! Therefore, merely to weep
   under a sermon is no sign of having derived profit from it. Some of my
   Brethren are very great hands at unearthing the dead. They conduct you
   to the funeral urns of your parents, or remind you of your departed
   little ones, and possibly they may be the means of introducing better
   feelings by this kind of working upon your emotions! But I am not
   convinced of it--I am afraid that much of the holy water which is spilt
   from human eyes in our places of worship is not much more valuable than
   the holy water at the doors of the Catholic chapels! It is mere eye
   water, after all, and not heart sorrow.

   Mere excitement produced by oratory is the world's weapon in attaining
   its end. We want something more than that for spiritual purposes. If we
   could "speak with the tongues of men and of angels" and stir you up to
   as great an enthusiasm as ever Demosthenes worked in the Greeks of
   old--all that would avail nothing if it were only the effect of the
   preacher's impassioned language and telling manner--the Gospel would
   have come to you "in word only." And that which is born of the flesh is
   flesh and nothing more.

   At this point I may very solemnly ask whether it is not true of some
   who compose the present congregation that you know the truth only in
   word? There is a certain class of persons, and some of them are present
   this morning, who are professional sermon hearers! You go one Sunday to
   hear Mr. A. And then another Sunday to hear Mr. B. And you carry with
   you our sacchraometers--instruments for measuring the quantity of
   sweetness in each sermon! And you take a gauge of the style and manner
   of the preacher. You estimate what blunders he makes and how he could
   be improved. And you compare or contrast him with somebody else, as if
   you were tea tasters tasting Souchong and Bohea, or cheese mongers
   trying Cheddar and American!

   Some individuals of this order are little better than spiritual
   vagabonds without settled habitation or occupation! They go about from
   place to place, listening to this and to that and getting no good
   whatever. And as to doing good, the thought never enters their brain.
   You cannot expect that the Gospel will come to you in anything else but
   as a killing letter, for you go to hear it as merely words. You do not
   look for fruit--if you see leaves you are quite satisfied. You do not
   desire a blessing! If you did, you would receive it. It is at once one
   of the most wicked and one of the most foolish habits to waste our time
   in constantly criticizing God's Word and God's ministers.

   Well said George Herbert, "Judge not the preacher, he is your judge."
   What have you to do to say of God's ambassador? That his words were not
   well mouthed? If God speaks by him, God knows who is best to speak for
   Him. And if his Master sent the man, beware lest you ill-treat him, or
   you may suffer like they of old who ill-treated the ambassadors of
   David and drove him to proclaim war against them.

   2. According to the text, there are others to whom the Word comes with
   three accompaniments. The Apostle speaks of "power," and "the Holy
   Spirit," and "much assurance." I do not think that the Word of God
   comes to many people with all these three things. It comes to a very
   numerous class with "power." To a smaller number with "power and the
   Holy Spirit." And to an inner circle of select ones "in the Holy Spirit
   and in much assurance." If I have the meaning of this passage, and I am
   not so certain about it as to dogmatize, it strikes me that there are
   three degrees of effect produced by the Gospel.

   At any rate, we shall not be wrong in saying that there is sometimes an
   effect produced by the Gospel which may be called "power," but which,
   nevertheless, is not the power which saves. To many of you, my dear
   Hearers, the word of our Gospel has come with power upon your
   understandings. You have heard it, weighed it, judged it, and received
   it as being true and of Divine authority. Your understanding has
   assented to the various propositions which we have proclaimed as
   doctrines of Christ. You feel that you could not well do otherwise.
   These Truths of God agree so well and are so adapted at once to the
   ruin of your nature and to its best aspirations, that you do not kick,
   as some do, against it. You have been convinced of the authenticity and
   authority of the Gospel by the Gospel.

   Perhaps you have never read "Paley's Evidences," and never studied
   "Butler's Analogy," but the Gospel itself has come to you with
   sufficient power to be its own witness to you and your understanding
   joyfully acknowledges that this is the Word of God and you receive it
   as such. It has done more than that--it has come with power to the
   conscience of some of you. It has convicted you of sin. You feel now
   that self-righteousness on your part is folly, and though you may
   indulge in self-righteousness, it is with your eyes open. You do not
   sin now so cheaply as you once did, for you know a little of the
   sinfulness of sin.

   Moreover, you have had some alarms with regard to the ultimate end of
   sin. The Gospel has made you know that the wages of sin will be death.
   You feel that you cannot dwell with everlasting burnings. Your heart is
   ill at ease when you think upon the wrath to come. Like Felix you
   tremble when you are reasoned with concerning "righteousness and
   judgment to come." And though you have put it off as yet and have said,
   "Go your way till I have a more convenient season," yet it has come to
   you so far with a degree of power.

   More than this, it has had an effect upon your feelings as well as upon
   your conscience. Your desires have been awakened. You have sometimes
   said, "Oh that I were saved!" You have advanced as far, at any rate, as
   Balaam when he said, "Let me die the death of the righteous." Your
   feelings of hope are excited--you hope that you may yet lay hold of
   eternal life and your fears are not altogether dead--you tremble when
   under the Word of God. Natural emotions, which look like spiritual
   ones, have been produced in you by the beaming of the Word--though as
   yet the Gospel has not come with the Holy Spirit. Beyond all this, the
   Gospel has come with power to some of you on your lives. I can look
   with anxious pleasure upon some of you because I know the Gospel has
   done you much good, though it has not saved you.

   Alas, there are others to whom it has only been for a time as a bit and
   bridle. But they have afterwards turned aside from it. There are those
   here, who, like the dogs, have gone back to their vomit and, like the
   sow that was washed, to their wallowing in the mire. We had hope for
   you once, but we must almost cease to hope. Certain persons rush into
   drunkenness after seasons of abstinence--having known the evil of the
   sin--and having professed to hate it. The passion has been too strong
   for them and they have fallen again into that deep ditch in which so
   many of the abhorred of the Lord lie and rot.

   Oh, may God, in His infinite mercy, bring the Gospel with something
   more than this common power to your souls! May it come with "the Holy
   Spirit" as well as with power! You see, we have come up by steps to
   some considerable height already, but we now come to a far nobler
   elevation and speak of saving Grace. To many in this house, as at
   Thessalonica, the Word has come "in the Holy Spirit." Brothers and
   Sisters, I cannot describe to you how it is that the Holy Spirit op-
   erates by the Word. The work of the Spirit is figured forth by some
   such mysterious timing as a birth, or as the blowing of the wind. It is
   a great secret, and therefore not to be expounded.

   But many of you know it experimentally. The Holy Spirit, first of all,
   came to you as a great Quickener. How He made you live you do not
   know--but this you do know--that what you once had not, you now have!
   You know that there burns within you a vital spark of heavenly flame
   far different from that ordinary spark of life which had been there
   before! You now have different feelings, different joys, different
   sorrows from any you were conscious of before! While you were listening
   to the letter which kills, the Spirit of God came with it and the
   quickening Spirit made you live with a new, higher and more blessed
   life!

   You now have within you Jesus Christ, who is Life and Immortality! You
   have Heaven begun within your heart! You have passed from death unto
   life and shall never come into condemnation! To you the Word of God has
   come with the Holy Spirit in a quickening sense. Then it entered with
   an illuminating power. It enlightened you as to your sins. What
   blackness you discovered in your sins when the Holy Spirit once cast a
   light upon them! Brethren, you had no idea that you were such sinners
   as you turned out to be. The Holy Spirit startled and astonished you
   with revelations of that great and fathomless depth of depravity which
   you found to be surging within your souls!

   You were alarmed, humbled, cast into the dust. You began, perhaps, to
   despair--but the same illumination of the Spirit came in to comfort
   you--for He then showed you Christ Jesus! He showed you the unbounded
   power of His blood to take away your unbounded sins! He revealed to you
   His willingness to receive you just as you were, His suitability to
   your case and to your circumstances. And as soon as you saw Jesus in
   the light of the Holy Spirit you looked unto Him and were
   lightened--and therefore your face has never been ashamed.

   So the Spirit of God came to you as light to dispel your darkness and
   give you joy and peace! Since that time you have experienced the Holy
   Spirit as comforting you. Amidst darkest shades He has risen as the
   sunlight upon your souls. Your burdens have been removed by Him, the
   blessed Paraclete! He has brought Christ, and the things of Christ, to
   your remembrance. He has opened up to you precious promises. He has
   cracked the shell and given you to partake of the kernel of the
   privilege of the Covenant of Grace. He has broken the bone and
   satisfied you with marrow and fatness out of the deep things of God.
   His dove-like wings, whenever they brood over you, bring order out of
   confusion and yield kindly comfort in the midst of adversity.

   You have also felt the Holy Spirit in His inflaming energies. He has
   rested on you when you have heard the Word, as the Spirit of
   burning--your sin has been consumed by the holy revenge which you felt
   against it. You have been led to great heights of love to Christ, till
   you could sing--

   "Had I ten thousand thousand tongues, Not one should be silent! Had I
   ten thousand thousand hearts, I'd give them all to You."

   When the Holy Spirit has blessed the Word, your heart has been like the
   altar of incense with the flame always burning and a sweet perfume
   going up, acceptable to the Most High!

   Beloved, you have also felt the Holy Spirit with the Word as a spirit
   of rejoicing! Oh, the bliss we have sometimes tasted! I am very
   frequently heavy in spirit, but oh, the raptures which my heart has
   known when the Holy Spirit has shown me my eternal election of God! My
   standing in Christ Jesus! My completeness and acceptance in the
   Beloved! My security through the faithfulness of the eternal God! What
   delights come streaming into the soul when you read of everlasting
   love, of faithfulness never wavering, of affection never changing, of a
   purpose standing fast as pillars of brass and firm as the eternal
   hills!

   And oh, Beloved, what extravagance I was about to say, ofjoy do we
   sometimes feel in anticipation of the glory to be revealed! Looking
   from Nebo's brow we see the landscape down below, but, better than
   Moses could do, we drink already of the rivers which flow with milk and
   honey and pluck ripe fruits from celestial trees. While in communion
   with Christ Jesus we get the best taste of the glory that remains. Now
   this it is to receive the Word, "in the Holy Spirit." Beloved, I hope
   we know what this means and you who do not know it, may a prayer go up
   from every living soul here, "Lord, let the Holy Spirit go with the
   preaching of Jesus Christ and let it be made effectual unto salvation."

   Beloved, the highest point in the text is, "much assurance." If I
   understand the passage, it means this--first, that they were fully
   persuaded of its truthfulness and had no staggering or blinding doubts
   about it. And secondly, that they had the fullest possible conviction
   of their interest in the Truth delivered to them! They were saved, but
   better still they knew that they were so! They were clean, but better
   still they rejoiced in their purity! They were in Christ, but what is
   more joyous still, they knew that they were in Christ! They had no
   doubts, as some of you have, no dark suspicions. The Word had come with
   such blessed demonstration that it had swept every doubt clean out of
   their hearts!

   According to Poole the Greek word used here has in it the idea of a
   ship at full sail, undisturbed by the waves which ripple in its way. A
   ship, when the wind is thoroughly favorable and its full sails are
   bearing it directly into harbor, is not held back by the surging
   billows. True, the vessel may rock, but it neither turns to the right
   hand, nor to the left. Let the billows be as they may, the wind is
   sufficiently powerful to overcome their contrary motion and the vessel
   goes straight ahead.

   Some Christians get the Gospel in that way. They have not a shadow of a
   doubt about its being true. They have not even the beginning of a doubt
   about their interest in it, and therefore they have nothing to do, but
   with God's strong hand upon the tiller and the heavenly wind blowing
   right into the sail, to go straight on, doing the will of God and
   glorifying His name. May the Word come to you, dear Friends, as it does
   to so very few! May it come in "full assurance," as well as in "power,"
   and in "the Holy Spirit!"

   3. I shall leave this first head of the text when I observe that this
   is the way in which God's elect are known. The Apostle says, "Knowing,
   Brethren beloved, your election of God." Why? Knowing it not by making
   a guess about it-- not by questioning you whether you are awakened
   sinners--whether you are sensible or insensible sinners! Not by waiting
   to preach the Gospel to you when you are prepared to receive the
   Gospel--but preaching the Gospel to you as you were and finding out who
   were the elect by this--that the elect of God received the Gospel as it
   came, "in power, and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance." This is
   the test of election--the Holy Spirit blessing the Word!

   And, dear Friends, if the Holy Spirit has blessed it to you, you need
   not turn over the mysterious pages of the Divine decrees--for your name
   is there! You have not my word for it, but God's Word for it. He would
   not have brought you to feel the indwelling life of the Holy Spirit if
   He had not, from before all worlds, ordained you unto eternal life! But
   mark and observe from the ensuing context--you must give good proof
   that it is so, or we cannot say, and even the Apostle could not have
   said--"Knowing, Brethren beloved, your election of God."

   We cannot tell whether the Word has come to you in the Holy Spirit and
   in much assurance unless there are the corresponding results. Listen to
   these words--"And you became followers of us and of the Lord, having
   received the Word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit: so
   that you were examples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia. For
   from you sounded out the Word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and
   Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread
   abroad, so that we need not to speak anything. For they themselves show
   of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how you turned to
   God from idols to serve the living and true God. And to wait for His
   Son from Heaven whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus, which
   delivered us from the wrath to come."

   So you see an imitation of Apostolic example, a faith which becomes so
   known as to sound abroad, a joy which affliction itself cannot dampen,
   and a perseverance which is not to be turned aside by difficulties. You
   see a conversion which gives up the dearest idols and binds us to
   Christ and makes us watch and wait for Him--all these are necessary as
   proofs of the Holy Spirit having been with the Word. O Beloved, I would
   have you, the members of this congregation, not only converted, but so
   converted that there should be no doubt about it! I would love to have
   you not only Christians, but such fruit-bearing Christians that there
   can be no doubt that you have received the Word "in much assurance."

   Then shall it be equally clear that you are the elect of God. May the
   Lord grant that the word here may ever be like a powerful magnet thrust
   into a heap of steel filings and of ashes which shall attract all the
   filings and bring them out. For that is what the Gospel is to do--it is
   to discern between the precious and the vile! It is to be God's
   winnowing fan to separate His elect from those who are left in their
   ruin. And it only can do this by the way in which it is received,
   proving the election of those who receive it, "in the Holy Spirit."
   Thus much by way of discrimination.

   II. Have patience for a few minutes while we now use the text by way of
   PRACTICAL INSTRUCTION. It is clear from the text, by way of practical
   instruction, that it is not enough to preach the Gospel. Something more
   is needed for the conversion of souls than even that. I have stirred
   you up very often to assist me, dear Brethren, in training those of our
   young men who have been called to preach the Gospel--that they may be
   more efficient in their ministry--and you have kindly helped me.

   But we must ever bear in mind that though God should privilege us to
   send out hundreds of His ministering servants, yet there will not be a
   solitary case of conversion worked by them, alone. We wish to do our
   best to erect fresh places of worship for this ever-increasing city and
   it is a happy day to me whenever I see the top stone brought out of a
   new House of Prayer! But not one single soul shall ever be made to
   rejoice in Christ Jesus by the mere fact of a place of worship being
   erected, or of worship being celebrated in it! We must have the energy
   of the Holy Spirit! There is the one all-important matter!

   What is there practical about this? Why, then it becomes more and more
   imperatively necessary that we should be much in prayer to God that the
   Holy Spirit would come! We have the spirit of prayerfulness among us as
   a Church. Let me earnestly entreat you never to lose it. There are
   certain of my Brothers and Sisters here who are never absent from our
   great gathering on Monday evening, and whose prayers have brought down
   many blessings! But it is the part of fidelity for me to say that there
   are some of you who might be here if you would, but seldom favor us
   with your presence. Or, let me say, who seldom do yourselves the
   happiness of waiting up on God in Prayer Meetings. You are not the best
   of our members. You will never be the best of them if you stay away
   without having a justifiable excuse.

   I do not say this to those who I know must be absent. And I do not say
   it to bring women out who ought to be seeing to their husbands, or to
   bring men out who ought to be attending to their shops. But I say it to
   some who might as well be here as not, and would bring no detriment to
   themselves whatever by being here. And I must qualify what I say with
   this--I have less to complain of in this respect than any man in
   Christendom, for there is no place that I ever knew or heard of where
   the Prayer Meeting bears so good and fair a proportion to the Sunday
   gathering as it does here.

   But still, Brethren, we want you ALL to pray! I would I could see you
   all! Oh, it were a happy day if we could see this place full on Monday
   evening. I do not know why it should not be. It strikes me that if your
   hearts were once to get thoroughly warmed we should fill this house for
   prayer. And what a blessing we might expect to receive! Why, we have
   had such a blessing already that we have not room enough to receive it
   now! But still, as the cup begins to run over, let it run over and
   over. There are many churches in this neighborhood that can catch the
   spillover and may they be profited thereby!

   Let us increase our praying as we increase our doing. I like that of
   Martin Luther, when he says, "I have so much business to do today that
   I shall not be able to get through it with less than three hours'
   prayer." Now most people would say, "I have so much business to do
   today that I must only have three minutes' prayer--I cannot afford the
   time." But Luther thought that the more he had to do the more he must
   pray, or else he could not get through it! That is a blessed kind of
   logic--may we understand it! "Praying and provender hinder no man's
   journey." If you have to stop and pray, it is no more an hindrance than
   when the rider has to stop at the farrier's to have his horse's shoe
   fastened, for if he went on without attending to that, it may be that
   before long he would come to a stop of a far more serious kind.

   Let us learn from the text our own indebtedness to distinguishing and
   Sovereign Grace. You observe, Beloved, that the Gospel does not come
   with the power of the Holy Spirit to everybody. If, then, it has come
   to us, what shall we do but bless and praise the distinguishing Grace
   which made it come to us? You observe that the distinction was not in
   the persons themselves--it was in the way in which the Gospel came. The
   distinction was not even in the Gospel, but in the attendant Holy
   Spirit, making it effectual. If you have heard the Word with power, it
   was not, dear Brethren, because you were more ready, because you were
   less inclined to sin, or more friendly towards God. You were an alien,
   a stranger, a foreigner, an enemy--you were "dead in trespasses and
   sins"--even as others were and are.

   There was in you, whatever Papists may say, no Grace of congruity to
   meet with the Grace of Christ. They say that there is something in man
   congruous to the Grace of God, so that when saving Grace comes to those
   who have the Grace of congruity they are saved. In me I know everything
   was incongruous, everything contrary to God. There was darkness and
   Light came. There was death and Life entered. There was hatred and Love
   drove it out! There was the dominion of Satan and Christ overcame the
   traitor--

   "Then give all the glory to His holy name,
   To Him all the glory belongs.
   Be yours the high joy still to sound forth His name,
   And praise Him in each of your songs."

   A third practical lesson we will but hint at, namely, we see that there
   are degrees of attainment even among those who have received the Word
   with the Holy Spirit. Let us seek for the very highest degree! You are
   not generally satisfied with the same qualities of life--you desire to
   possess its comforts and luxuries. I will commend you if you carry this
   into spiritual things. Do not be content merely to be saved, merely to
   be spiritually alive--ask to be valiant for the Truth of God! I should
   feel it a great honor, I hope, to be the most common soldier if called
   upon to defend my country. But I must confess I should not like to be
   in the ranks always. I should like, at least, to be made a corporal
   very soon and a sergeant as soon as possible. And I should grumble
   wonderfully much if I could not rise to rank among the commissioned
   officers!

   I should like to be found doing my very best and I would reach to the
   most prominent position if I might better serve my country than in the
   ranks. So I think it should be with the Christian. He is not to seek
   for honor among men, but, if he can, by getting more Grace be more
   serviceable to his God and bring more honor to His name, why let him
   press forward! Ah, my dear Brethren, what business have you to be
   sitting still and saying, "It is enough." The "rest-and-be-thankful"
   policy is not much approved of in politics--and in religion it will
   never do!

   On! Forward! Upward! As the eagle takes for its motto, "Superior," and
   still mounts higher and higher and higher till the young wing which
   first trembled at the height has grown into the strong pinion which
   makes him companion of the sun and playmate with the lightning, so let
   the Christian do! If he has learned to "run and not be weary," let him
   seek to "mount up as on the wings of eagles." Onward, fellow soldier!
   Be yet more valiant till your name is written among the first three.

   To close, does not this text, as a last practical lesson, show us
   indirectly how a privilege may become a curse? The Word of God has come
   to you all. I suppose there is not one here who has not heard the story
   of the love of God in Christ Jesus. You have been told many times that
   though man has fallen and offended God, yet the Lord has set forth His
   suffering Son, Christ Jesus, to be a Propitiation for sin and that
   through faith in His name, "Whoever believes on Him shall never
   perish."

   You have been told that God waits to be gracious and that whoever looks
   to Christ shall live! Whoever calls upon the Lord shall be saved! Now,
   having heard this, regardless of what some may tell you, we feel bound,
   as in the sight of God, to warn you that if this comes "in word only"
   to you, it will increase your condemnation! Certain preachers think
   that this Word is not "a savor of death unto death" to any, but it is,
   it is! Whatever their theories, whatever hyper-Calvinistic theology may
   say, it is God's Word that it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and
   Sidon in the Day of Judgment than it shall be for cities like Capernaum
   and Bethsaida, which heard the Word and yet repented not!

   You are not machines. You are not creatures merely to be acted
   upon--you are to act as well as to be moved. And every good word that
   reaches your ear is written down as a debt against you. There is no
   declaration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ which, if refused, does not
   leave you more disobedient than you were. Remember how the Apostle
   states it-- "Unto them which are disobedient, the stone which the
   builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner and a
   stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at
   the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed."

   Now they could not have been disobedient if it was not their duty to
   obey. No man is disobedient where there is no law. It is, therefore,
   the duty of every sinner hearing the Gospel to believe it! And if he
   does not, this same stone shall fall upon him and shall grind him to
   powder. Kiss the Son, therefore, lest He, lest He be angry and you
   perish from the way while His wrath is kindled but a little. The same
   Savior who blesses will be angry. He who loves His people, grows angry
   with those who reject Him.

   And when His wrath is kindled but a little, woe unto the object of it!
   Blessed are all they that trust in Him and may we be found among that
   blessed number to the praise and glory of His Grace, wherein He makes
   us to differ according to the appointment of His own Divine will. May
   God bless this assembly for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

                           Songs For Desolate Hearts

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 10, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Sing, O barren, you that did not bear. Break forth into singing, and
   cry aloud, you that did not travail with child: for more are the
   children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, says
   the Lord."

   Isaiah 54:1.

   IT was a great sorrow to an Eastern woman to be childless. In modern
   times that affliction is endured with cheerful equanimity, but in those
   days it was regarded as a dreadful curse and the feelings of those
   afflicted by it were of the most painful kind, as we find in the case
   of Hannah. Alas, for human nature! Those who were favored with children
   were often guilty of cruel haughtiness and taunting derision towards
   those who were not so blessed. We may instance the cases of Peninnah
   over Hannah and Hagar over her mistress, Sarah. We must therefore
   endeavor to bring our minds to the Eastern idea and we shall then have
   before us a case of very great, deep, constant, abiding, bitter sorrow.
   And yet the person in that case is bid to sing and to rejoice aloud,
   because the visitation of God's mercy should soon come to make
   desolation itself glad!

   I. The text shall first of all be taken in its reference TO THE CHURCH
   OF GOD. For a long season before the coming of Christ the Church of God
   was desolate. Few were her sons and daughters. Her solemn feast days
   were attended by a multitude of hypocrites and her courts were crowded
   with formalists--the genuine children of Israel were sadly few. And
   when the Lord, the Husband of the Church, Himself arrived, the Church
   was in no happy condition. And even while He remained with her, her joy
   was not complete, for Christ's ministry was, with all reverence to His
   name, by His own appointment, doubtless comparatively an unsuccessful
   one.

   After all His preaching there were but some hundred and twenty persons
   who believed on Him. "He came unto His own and His own received Him
   not." The children of the married wife were but very, very few.
   Isaiah's wailing might have been heard all through the life of Christ,
   "Who has believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord
   revealed? For He shall grow up before Him as a tender plant and as a
   root out of a dry ground: He has no form nor loveliness. And when we
   shall see Him, there is no beauty that we should desire Him."

   What a dark night that must have been when the Savior was betrayed by
   Judas! Ah, Church of God, what will come of you now? While the
   Bridegroom was with you your children were but few and now that He is
   taken away to prison and to death, what will you do? As for your sons,
   you can not rely upon them. Yonder is Peter, denying his Master with
   oaths and curses. John--even the loving John--has forsaken Him and
   fled. They have all gone their ways. They have all turned their backs.
   Like the children of Ephraim, "being armed and carrying bows, they have
   turned their backs in the day of battle."

   Alas for you, Zion, for now you are desolate! Your Husband is led away
   captive. Your sons have forsaken you--your hour of mourning has come!
   Still darker must have been the hour when Salem's daughters wept around
   the Savior, led away to a shameful crucifixion along the via dolorosa.
   See Him as He dyes the streets of Jerusalem with drops of blood
   trickling from His thorn-crowned head. He is taken outside the camp to
   the mount of doom. They fasten Him to the wood. They lift Him high upon
   the Cross--His enemies compass Him about. The bulls of Bashan roar upon
   Him and the dogs of Hell bark about Him.

   Where are you now, O Zion? But for a few that cluster round the
   shameful tree, where are your sons and daughters now? Your sun has set
   forever and your candle is gone out in darkness! So Unbelief whispers,
   but not thus speaks the Lord! For after the Lord had been lain in the
   grave and risen again and ascended and left the Church, then were the
   days of refreshing and the times of the visitation of the Spirit!
   Suddenly when the saints were met together in an upper room, for they
   were so few that they could all be enclosed within one room, there was
   heard a sound as of "a rushing mighty wind," and suddenly flames of
   fire sat on each chosen one.

   Then was fulfilled the saying of the Prophet Joel, "I will pour out My
   Spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy."
   Rejoice, O Zion! Sing you barren, you that did not bear, for three
   thousand are your children in one day and there are multitudes yet to
   come! There are added to the Church daily of such as shall be saved.
   And the multitude increases! Persecution scatters them, but as they
   scatter they grow--in every land the Church of God has its sons and
   daughters.

   Even in the palace of the Caesars the Truth of God is confessed.
   Mountains cannot stay the progress of Messiah's kingdom. Goths and
   Gauls, uncivilized men of war, feel the potent power of the love of the
   Cross. From eastern coast to western, Jupiter and Venus fall from their
   thrones, and Jesus Christ is exalted. "From the river even to the ends
   of the earth" His name is known. Thus you see there was to the whole
   Church at Jerusalem a glorious fulfillment of this text, "Sing, O
   barren, you that did not bear." And more were the children of the
   desolate Church in the absence of her Lord than when she was as a
   married wife having Jesus Christ the Bridegroom with her!

   Although this is a well-known fact, it ought not to be passed over
   without a little thought, because it is very pleasant to remember that
   at all seasons when the Church has been desolate and has become barren,
   God has appeared to her. In the dark ages when the children of the
   Church were a little and hidden flock--probably a few monks in
   monasteries holding a faith which they dared not confess, and feeding
   it by turning over the Bible in secret--a handful among the mountains
   of Piedmont. The Albigenses and Waldenses, a few scattered ones among
   the Nestorians and a few "even in Sardis" who had not defiled their
   garments.

   The poor Church was barren. There were no ministers, but here and there
   one to preach the Gospel, and these were hunted like partridges upon
   the mountains by those who thirsted for their blood. She might have
   taken up her wailing and her heart might have sounded like a harp for
   her ruin and decay. But in her hour of dire necessity the Lord appeared
   to her and the children of the desolate were suddenly many! The monk of
   Wirtemburg began to proclaim the Gospel. The mighty seer of Geneva
   stood up and declared the Truth of God as it is in Jesus, distinctly
   enunciating the glorious doctrines of Grace!

   Zwingli, full of fire and energy, led on the saints in Switzerland. It
   is true the stakes began to flame with their victims-- the racks were
   red with the blood of martyrs and prisons crowded with the elect of
   God--but what did it matter? The day was come when God had visited His
   people and, as in some desperate fight when suddenly a reinforcement
   comes with a mighty captain at its head and every man along the line
   gathers courage, every coward becomes a hero and every hero seems
   gifted with a thousand hands--each hand filled with a two-edged
   sword--even so it was in that day of struggle and of victory!

   A song went up from earth even to Heaven, "Sing unto the Lord, for He
   has triumphed gloriously! His own right hand and His holy arm has
   gotten Him the victory!" Nor has God failed since the days of the
   Reformation. We in England had gone to sleep. The Church of England was
   sleeping in the dark--Dissenters were sleeping in the light--that was
   the only difference between them. There seemed to be no breath of life
   throughout the whole of England. Spiritual death crept over all
   ministers and all professors. There were, of course, a few exceptions,
   but those were, alas, so weak and so isolated that they could effect
   but little.

   Six young men were expelled from Oxford for the egregious crime of
   praying! Among those young men were three destined to carve their names
   in everlasting rock--the two Wesleys and George Whitefield. These men,
   little knowing why they were called, preached the Word. First of all in
   the regular and orderly fashion, but still with the Holy Spirit sent
   down from Heaven. They were driven by persecution to the gross
   irregularity of preaching in the open air. Blessed day! Whether they
   stood on the tombstone and preached to the living from the portals of
   the grave, or by the mountain-side, calling Heaven and earth to
   witness, it mattered not!

   The Gospel had broken from the chains of lethargic propriety. And what
   a change, my Brothers and Sisters, came over the spirit of the age!
   "The Lord gave the Word: great was the multitude of them that published
   it." The fire came down from Heaven like that of old in Pharaoh's day
   and it ran along upon the ground and consumed the enemies of God!
   Irresistible as the lightning flash it descended and none could stand
   against it--for the day of the Lord was come and it was a day of
   burning and a day of might--and blessed be the name of God, "the
   children of the desolate" were many!

   Now we know what has been said concerning the Church of God in England
   at the present time and here is the practical lesson I want you to
   gather. Some of our Brethren are perfectly contented, but I cannot
   number myself among those who think that the Church is flourishing and
   that vital godliness is abundant. It may be so, Brethren, it may be so.
   I wish I could thoroughly feel satisfied of it. I would not, however,
   on the other hand, unite myself altogether with the ranks of the
   alarmists who say that everything is wrong.

   The Christian Church, according to some, is nothing but a mass of
   hypocrisy. We are all going post haste, as fast as ever we can, towards
   Romanism and Romanism is next door to the abode of Satan himself. We
   are supposed to be going down, down, down a most precipitous descent.
   Well, I do not know. It may be so. I wish I was quite sure it was not
   so. I hardly think it, but I strike the balance between the two and
   rejoice with trembling. On this we may all be agreed--there is an
   abundant room both for mourning because we have not the Presence of God
   as once we had it and, on the other hand, for a hopeful anxiety that
   yet our desolation may be turned into fruitfulness.

   Supposing--taking the worst view of the case--supposing it is so--and I
   am sure there is very much truth in the supposition--suppose it is so
   that the sturdiness with which we once held orthodoxy is giving place
   to a trifling latitudinarianism? Suppose it to be true that the
   enthusiasm which once made us worthy to be called fanatics, is
   gradually dwindling down into indifference? Suppose it to be so that
   the Puritan rigidity of morals which once made the professing Christian
   something awful to look upon, is now turning into a looseness and
   laxity of behavior? Well, then, we are like the barren and desolate
   woman! But, at any rate, we have a promise still to cling to and we
   will hold it fast--"Sing, O barren, you that did not bear. Break forth
   into singing, and cry aloud, you that did not travail with child: for
   more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married
   wife, says the Lord."

   Doubt not but that the Lord will appear for His Church even yet. Let
   not your gloomy apprehensiveness cause your hands to hang down, for in
   your darkest night God will suddenly light a candle. It may be that He
   will let wickedness grow ripe and not send forth the reaper, the
   ordained man, with the sickle to cut it down, till it is ripe. It may
   be that He may let iniquity abound and the love of many may wax cold.
   But fear not! Though He never is before His time, He never is behind!
   He will come punctually at the moment, in a time which shall be best
   for His Church and most for His own Glory!

   Once again we shall hail the happy days of revival and the seasons of
   gladness of heart--when "one shall say, I am the Lord's, and another
   shall call himself by the name of Jacob," and the children of Zion
   "shall spring up as willows by the watercourses." Let us hope and
   labor! Let us lament our desolation! Let us expect the gracious
   visitation and it shall yet come and we shall "sing together," even we,
   "the waste places of Jerusalem."

   II. I now intend to use the text, as God helps me, in reference to ANY
   ONE CHURCH. I do not think that what I have to say now will have very
   special reference to the Church which meets in this place, for we have
   reason to thank God that through eleven years or more we have had about
   as high a flood-tide of revival as we could well endure. And I do not
   know if God had given us more conversions, what we should have done
   with them. He has already increased our numbers so marvelously that we
   scarcely know how we shall oversee the whole. And it has become almost
   a matter of necessity that some should swarm off to form other
   churches.

   But still a part of what is said may, nevertheless, apply to our case.
   And as there are many Brothers and Sisters here from the country and
   yet, since some twenty or thirty thousand will read these words, I
   shall not speak without having an audience even though not a word may
   belong to the members of this Church. Let us observe, then, that there
   are some separate churches which are in a very sad condition and may
   most truly be said to be barren and desolate. Do we not know some in
   our land which are cursed with a lifeless ministry? A ministry which
   murders the Truth of God by a drawling, careless utterance of it? A
   ministry without force or life?

   Some ministries are not truthful. They may preach part of the Truth,
   but not the whole--ministries, which, for some reason or other, give
   prominence to one or two doctrines, while other parts of the Truth of
   God, equally precious, are kept back from the people. And the whole of
   what is preached is too often delivered in a cold, official,
   ministerial manner--without passion or earnestness and so the Church
   necessarily, I may say, becomes barren. And how many churches have to
   complain of worldly Church officers?

   We cannot help observing with grief and regret that certain Church
   officers are far more active when they are in the world than they are
   in the Church! And that if they show some little common sense in
   conducting their own business, they show little enough in managing
   Christ's business. They put out both their hands and all their heart
   when the matter is one of personal gain. But when it is only that the
   Church of God may be fed, or that the boundaries of Zion may be
   enlarged, they go about it as though it were a thing of no consequence,
   or of very small importance.

   And worse than this, for the Church might still live even with a
   lifeless ministry and a worldly deaconship and eldership, but often
   there is a lifeless membership! How many churches are there where a
   large portion of members scarcely think of assembling themselves
   together for supplication? Where, if there is any life, it seems to
   expend itself in quarrelling and fault-finding? They do not contend
   earnestly for "the faith once delivered to the saints," against the
   common foe, but they wrangle over that faith and make foes of one
   another!

   Oh, how many Christians there are that can boast of
   respectability--there are no end of carriages at the door! They can
   talk of the wealth, the large subscriptions which they can give to
   God's cause! But where is their zeal and the sounding of their hearts
   over dying men? Where are the tears that move the heart of God? Where
   are the sighs and cries which bring down a blessing upon the preached
   Word? Alas, in many of our churches echo can only answer to the
   question "Where are they?" with the refrain, "Where are they?" for they
   are gone and gone so long that some Christians seem content that they
   should be gone forever!

   They scarcely remember the time when they were in earnest--the period
   when the bedewing of the Holy Spirit rested upon them! I hesitate not
   to say solemnly that I know in our own denomination there are many,
   many churches in such a state of desolation--if the places where they
   worship were closed it would be small loss to the neighborhoods in
   which they stand. And if the ministry to which they listen were put out
   and silenced, it might be almost a gain--for it only enables the people
   to wrap themselves up in the idea that they are all right and that they
   have the Spirit of God among them when they have only the name to live
   and are dead!

   This being their present state, Brothers and Sisters present this
   morning who are in earnest, will ask me what is their present duty as
   members of such churches? I reply, Brethren, your duty is very plain.
   Labor to be conscious of the sad barrenness of the Church to which you
   belong! Has the Baptism pool not been stirred for the last five or six
   years? Will you be easy about that? Have there been no additions to the
   Church for many months? Can you be satisfied about that? Do you observe
   an absence of all earnestness, of all passion and vehemence for the
   promotion of the Savior's kingdom? Can you be quiet about that? If so,
   my dear Friend, I really cannot say anything to you about what you can
   do, for it seems to me that you are not the person to whom I ought to
   appeal in this matter.

   But I will say, do labor, dear Brethren, if you are members of churches
   that are not prospering, to be conscious of the sad mischief that you
   are doing. If the salt has lost its savor it is therefore good for
   nothing! It is neither fit for the land nor for the dunghill and men
   cast it out. We can manage to struggle on with a bad trader, for he may
   make a good politician or philosopher--but a dead Church is good for
   nothing, good for nothing of any sort or in any way--it is only fit to
   be cast out.

   Even the dunghill rejects a dead Church. Oh, if we did but know it, the
   existence of the devil is not more pretentious of evil than the
   existence of a Church that has lost spiritual life. Mind, I am not
   exaggerating, for I have a proof of it. What is the Church of Rome in
   its deadly operation upon the world but the greatest curse that could
   ever come from Hell itself? I question if Hell can find a more fitting
   instrument within its infernal lake than the Church of Rome is for the
   cause of mischief.

   And your Church will, in its measure, be the same if bereft of the
   Spirit. I do not care if it is Wesleyan, Baptist, Independent, or what
   it is--when the life is gone it becomes good for nothing--it is not
   even fit to fertilize the ground, as the contents of the dunghill
   are--but men cast it out and tread it under foot. Get conscious of that
   and then let those of you who are humbled in the sight of God meet
   together and spread the case before the Lord. We ought to have great
   faith in the power of the twos and threes, for, "Where two or three are
   gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them," says
   the Lord.

   The long thin red line, which has often won the battle, will yet win it
   in England--I mean the thin line of the few that sigh and cry for the
   desolations of the Church! If you, my Brother, an earnest man, are the
   only member of the Church that does really sigh and cry before God, God
   intends to bless that Church yet--for He has already blessed it in
   sending you to it! Look out for others of a kindred sort, and without
   murmuring, without raising divisions, without seeking to expel the
   minister or make any changes in the discipline, just set to work, and
   pray down, as Elijah did, the fire from Heaven upon the sacrifice.

   This is the one thing which is needed. The wrong in organization, the
   mistakes in government, the unfitness of the Church officers--all this
   will come right enough if you once get the Divine Life. But without
   this, though you should rectify everything else, you would have done
   but little to any real purpose. Let me beg of you, therefore, to spread
   the case before Jehovah and be sure that you look away from everything
   that you, yourself, can do and look to Him and to Him alone. What can
   the barren woman do? What can she that is desolate do? Why, she can
   take this promise before God and say, "You have said, 'Sing, O
   barren'--Lord, make me sing! You have said, 'The children of the
   desolate shall yet be many'--Lord make our children many!"

   The desolate woman can do this and your poor desolate heart, though you
   sigh and cry over the fewness of the congregation and the coldness of
   the Church members--your desolate heart can do the same! And doing it,
   you shall get an answer of peace. But mind you, do not pray without
   proving the sincerity of your prayers by action. Do bestir yourself! I
   have noticed that many who complain of a want of brotherly love are
   just the people who have least themselves. And those who see no
   spiritual life in a Church are often the people who have no spiritual
   life themselves. They see outside what they see within.

   But I hope I am addressing myself to nobler men than these. You feel
   that you would not willfully and willingly make any false accusation
   against God's saints, nor impeach them for anything in which they are
   not guilty. You love the Church too well! You would rather paint her
   with your finger upon her spots, than magnify her blemishes. Well, dear
   Brothers and Sisters, if such is your state of heart, live and labor
   for Jesus Christ yourselves and give the Lord no rest till this Word of
   His servant Isaiah is fulfilled to the very letter!

   This my message may seem to be of no importance to some here present,
   yet I hope it may be fraught with usefulness to churches represented
   here by gracious and godly men.

   III. By your leave, we will now turn to a third use of our text. Here
   the case is before us--THE POOR HELPLESS

   SINNER HAS HIS CASE WELL DESCRIBED BY THE PROPHET AS BARREN AND
   DESOLATE. I will speak for you and you will recognize your own words.
   "Barren! Ah, that I am. I have not one meritorious fruit that I can
   bring before God. As well might one expect to gather grapes from
   thorns, or figs from thistles, as to find any good thing in me! My
   heart is a fountain of polluted waters and all that comes forth
   deserves to be called Marah, Marah--for every drop is bitter. How is it
   possible that I can ever hope, while I see in myself all that is evil
   and nothing that is good?

   "Alas, I am not only barren of merit but I am also barren of feeling! I
   ought to be humbled on account of sin, but I am not. My eyeballs ought
   to be perpetual conduits of tears, but they are dry. My heart should be
   like Moses' rock when it was smitten! But alas, it is a flinty rock
   yielding no water. O that my heart would break! O that I were truly
   contrite! Unto the contrite and broken heart the Lord will have regard,
   but I am barren even of that! And alas, I seem to be barren even in
   prayer. If I get upon my knees I cannot pray! 'God be merciful to me, a
   sinner,' is as far as I can reach.

   "And I am afraid I am so barren that I cannot even pray that prayer as
   the publican prayed it, so as to get acceptance. I come down from my
   closet with the sense that I have tried to pray, but that I have been
   so distracted both with doubts and with wandering thoughts that I have
   rather multiplied my sins than had any prevalence with God! I am
   commanded to believe in Jesus and I wish I could exert faith in Him--

   'O could I but believe!
   Then all would be easy
   I would, but cannot, Lord, believe--
   My help must come from You!'

   "I have a will, but I have no power. I can say, 'To will is present
   with me'--and I am thankful to God for that--but 'how to perform that
   which I would, I find not.' I am barren of merit, barren of feeling,
   barren of power, barren of prayer, barren of faith. I am barren--barren
   with a vengeance."

   Yes, and Sinner, it is very probable that I can also speak out your
   heart if I take the word "desolate." You are desolate, too--no one can
   comfort you. The friend to whom you told your trouble tried his best,
   but he could not succeed in cheering your heavy heart. You have been up
   to this House, sometimes, hoping that I might say a word, but I have
   only added fuel to the flame, for the Truth preached has been far from
   comfortable to you! It has rather depressed you and brought you still
   lower. You have listened, you have read good books, you have turned
   over Scripture, but for all that there does not seem to be a text that
   speaks comfortably to you. But the threats leap up out of the page and
   seem as if they would drag you down, as the dogs drag down the stag
   when they seize him for their prey.

   You are "desolate" as a poor lone wanderer who has lost his way far out
   in the desert. He looks around upon the horizon and sees not one single
   hope or glean of hope! But far above he sees the cruel vulture, waiting
   for his lifeless corpse. So it is with you--you see the vultures of
   Hell ready to devour you and there is no hope, no comfort whatever. You
   are barren and you are desolate. I will tell you one of your thoughts.
   You have often envied those whom you would not envy if you knew better.
   You poor barren souls have often envied "the married wife." I mean the
   Pharisee--you have said of him, "Ah, I wish I could say that I was not
   as other men are! I wish I could say I had not sinned, but had walked
   in righteousness--'All these things have I kept from my youth up'--O
   that I could say that!"

   You have heard these married wives, as it were, boast of all their
   goodness and you have looked at them and thought, "What blessed people
   they must be! O that I could see what they can see!" There are some
   about in the world who preach up human ability. They tell us that men
   can believe and can repent and can do all sorts of spiritual actions.
   And there are some who think they can do them irrespective of the Holy
   Spirit. Well, then, I do not doubt but what you envy them! You say, "I
   wish I could feel as So-and-So. I wish I could rejoice as Such-and-Such
   does. Oh, if I could get as good a hope as he has." Hark to this, he is
   a hypocrite.

   "Oh, that I could be as full of peace as he is!" Mark, he is a mere
   formalist. "Oh, that I had his unbroken peace!" If you had such peace
   as he has it would be your eternal ruin! Poor, barren Sinner, let me
   say this much to you. Your help is to be found, not in your barrenness,
   not in your desolation--do not look to that as though it could help
   you! Your barrenness is barrenness forever if left to itself! And your
   desolation is utter and helpless unless someone shall intervene. May I
   ask you to look at the chapter which precedes my text?

   I wish the Bible had never been chopped up into chapters at all, it
   spoils it so! It was not intended by the Holy Spirit that it should
   be--that is human device! If you read it right on you see how it
   runs--"All we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned every one to
   his own way. And the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all." You
   know how it continues till it gets to this--"He shall see of the
   travail of His soul and shall be satisfied: by His knowledge shall My
   righteous Servant justify many, for He shall bear their iniquities.
   Therefore will I divide Him a portion with the great and He shall
   divide the spoil with the strong, because He has poured out His soul
   unto death: and He was numbered with the transgressors. And He bore the
   sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors. Sing, O
   barren, you that did not bear. Break forth into singing and cry aloud,
   you that did not travail with child."

   Do you see the drift of it? Jesus has taken the sinner's sin upon
   Himself and made a complete Atonement. Therefore, "sing, O barren." The
   mighty Redeemer has come out of His dwelling place, and has fought the
   enemy and won the victory. "Sing, O barren." Sin can be pardoned now,
   for Christ has died. "Sing, O barren!" Sinfulness can be conquered now,
   for Christ has won the victory over the hosts of Hell. You barren one!
   All barren as you are, stand here and see that wondrous sight. He comes
   from Edom "with garments dyed in blood."

   Can you see the blood upon His garments? It is red as though He had
   trod the wine vats. Can you see that blood? It is the blood of all your
   sins! They are gone! They are gone! O Desolate! They are gone! The
   blood of all your foes--they are slain! O barren woman! They are slain!
   And now He who vanquished Hell, comes! Can He not rescue you? "The prey
   shall be taken from the mighty and the lawful captive shall be
   delivered." And though you stood bound in iron surrounded with darkness
   about you like that of Egypt, "which night he felt," He could set you
   free--

   "He comes the prisoners to release, In Satan's bondage held. The gates
   of brass before Him burst, The iron fetters yield."

   Your hope is in a bleeding Savior who is now ascended up on high to
   receive gifts for men! Surely I myself will lead the strain, while I
   ask you now, you barren ones, to sing! Break forth into singing and cry
   aloud, for your Redeemer is mighty and will save! Whereas you envied
   the Pharisee, you shall have greater joy than he. "More are the
   children of the desolate than the children of the married wife."
   Whereas you envied the proud man who said, "I can do this and I can do
   the other," you who could do nothing because you were so barren, shall
   be filled with such love and endowed with such Grace--you shall be
   admitted into such familiarity with Christ, such oneness with God, such
   glory with Him forever-- that your joy, your glory, shall be far
   greater than the married wife could claim!

   I pray the sinner, as he hears these gladsome words, to be obedient to
   them! Trust in the Savior and, "You shall go out with joy and be led
   forth with peace. The mountains and hills shall break forth before you
   into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands."

   IV. Does not this text, in the fourth place, belong to the DEPRESSED
   BELIEVER? Here, as before, I can speak experimentally. Beloved in the
   Lord Jesus Christ, you and I, though we have brought forth some fruit
   unto His name, and are still confident that we are "plants of His own
   right hand planting," yet sometimes feel very barren. I hope you do not
   feel it so often as I do. There are occasions when, having preached to
   others, I have to examine myself, "lest I myself should be a castaway."

   I would, if I could, always weep for the sins and for the ruin of
   rebellions men. I would always feel tenderness of heart on account of
   those who reject His great salvation. But sometimes I am barren of all
   this. I feel my heart cold as a stone and hard as a rock. Do you ever
   feel, Brothers and Sisters, when you try to pray--you that have nearest
   access to God-- that there are times when you cannot pray? You would
   wrestle with the angel, but it is as much as ever you can say, "Lord, I
   believe! Help my unbelief." You want to love Christ, but instead of a
   furnace of love, you can only find a spark in your soul.

   Oh, how you want to burn! How you desire to grow, to mount, to reach to
   something higher and better than this poor dead level of a mere
   profession--but you cannot get up to it. O dew of Heaven, water my dry
   branch! O river of God, flow hard by my poor barren roots! For if not,
   I shall be always barren! Have you not often felt desolate? I know the
   righteous man never is desolate, but still he sometimes thinks himself
   so. His soul abhors all manner of meat and he refuses to be comforted.
   He was no bad man who said, "I watch and am as a sparrow alone upon the
   housetop." For those who have looked the sun in the face have,
   nevertheless, sometimes had to say, "Look not on me, for I am black,
   because the sun has looked upon me."

   Depressions of spirit, humiliating thoughts of one's self, deep and
   grievous bondage--all these the children of God are well aware of. With
   Paul we have, at times, to cry, "O wretched man that I am, who shall
   deliver me from the body of this death?" Beloved, it is well for us to
   know, as I am sure we do know experimentally, that in this matter of
   barrenness and desolation the creature can do but little. It is the
   Spirit that quickens--the flesh profits little. When we get into this
   state, we feel like a man who cannot swim. And the more we kick and
   struggle the more rapidly we sink. It seems as if all human energy were
   but the energy to sin and a power to make us yet more dead to true
   spiritual life.

   Well, what are we to do, then? Why, let us remember that the text is
   addressed to us in just such a state. "Sing, O barren! Break forth and
   cry aloud you that did not travail with child." But what can I sing
   about? I cannot sing about the present. I cannot even sing concerning
   the past. Well, but yet I can sing of Jesus Christ, can I not? I can
   turn to that which precedes the text and I can sing of visits which the
   Redeemer has before paid to me! Or, if not of these, I can sing of the
   great love with which He loved His people when He came from the heights
   of Heaven for their redemption!

   I will go to the Cross again. Come, my Soul, heavy laden you were once
   and you did lose your burden there. Come again, come again! Once you
   did wash in yonder fount and you were clean. O my poor bespattered
   Spirit, come and wash again! A prodigal I once returned--He fell upon
   my neck and kissed me then. I will go to Jesus yet once more. Though my
   sins rise like mountains, I will be obedient to the Word which says,
   "Return, you backsliding children, for I am married unto you, says the
   Lord."

   What is my barrenness? It is the platform for His Divine power! What is
   my desolation? It is the black setting for the sapphire of His
   everlasting love! I will go in poverty! I will go in helplessness! I
   will go in all my shame and backsliding! I will tell Him that I am
   still His child and in confidence in His faithful heart, I, even I, the
   barren one, will sing and cry aloud! Beloved, I think this is a very
   delightful text for us to think upon--especially when we remember that
   the joy of hardened hearts is, by-and-by, greater than the joy of those
   who never did feel their barrenness so much.

   There are some Christians that seem to be like the married wife. They
   have an equable temperament. They are not much depressed. They keep the
   even tenor of their way. I know I often envy them. We have our ups and
   downs, but mark you, when our ups come, those who despised us when we
   were in the downs might very well envy us! Though the valleys are dark
   and very gloomy, yet oh, the hilltops! The hilltops are so bright that
   when the Lord makes our feet to stand upon our high places, we no
   longer envy the married wife with all her ordinary calm and peace! We
   will take our trails for the sake of our joys--for as our tribulations
   abound, so our consolations abound in Christ Jesus!

   V. And now, lastly, it strikes me that our text ought to have a very
   special voice TO THOSE CHRISTIANS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DOING
   GOOD. As a Church I am sure it is our unanimous desire that we might
   bring forth spiritual children unto Christ Jesus. I hope I have not a
   single member of this Church who is content to go to Heaven alone. As
   far as I know you, I believe there is commonly among you this
   desire--that you may bring sinners to Christ.

   Now it is possible that some dear Brothers and Sisters present have not
   yet been successful. You have been at work. You have been in prayer.
   You have depended upon Christ in simple faith and hoped for His Spirit,
   but still you have been denied the happy privilege of being made
   useful. Well, now, two or three words to you. You are barren and I am
   glad that while you are barren your heart feels desolate! You will not
   be barren long if you are unhappy in your barren state!

   Now, my dear Friends, it may be possible that you are only barren in
   your own esteem. It is possible that God may have blessed you to many,
   though you think He has never blessed you to one. There may be,
   somewhere, precious jewels which you first brought up from the depths
   of sin--though you have not seen them glisten, Christ has! And though
   you thought you did not succeed the other day in your attempt, it is
   just possible that you are not a good judge of your own success!

   Frequently I have gone home groaning over a sermon which God has
   blessed to never-dying souls. And those very discourses which I have
   thought the worst of, God has blessed the most. I think we are not to
   be judges of how we do our work--the Master knows better than we do the
   success of our enterprises. Beside, dear Friends, you do not expect to
   see fruit at once, do you? "Cast your bread upon the waters and you
   shall find it tomorrow"--is that the text? If I read rightly it is,
   "You shall find it after many days." You have not had your "many days"
   to wait yet. The farmer, when he plants corn, may plow in October or
   November, but he does not expect to have a harvest in January! He will
   wait till the season comes. And you farmers of your Lord must wait and
   be patient for the precious fruits of your toil--"In due season you
   shall all reap if you faint not." Therefore wait on.

   Perhaps, however, your barrenness really is true and if so, ought not
   this greatly humble you? You were not always barren, my Brethren--when
   you were fruitful, did you give God all the glory? Were you very
   careful not to say, "Well done, I"? Possibly this barrenness has come
   upon you to make you feel your nothingness and to qualify you for yet
   greater success. It often happens that before God means to bless His
   servants He depresses them greatly. Whether or not it is absolutely
   necessary, I cannot tell. But this I know, it is generally the rule
   that there is a flogging behind the door for the man whom God means to
   honor in public. He will give him a thorn in the flesh either before or
   after He gives him marvelous revelations.

   Dear Friend, perhaps this is the reason. "Well," you say, "I do not
   know what the reason is, but I wish I could be rid of it, for I cannot
   bear to be useless, to be a tree cumbering the ground." My dear
   Brother, I am thrice glad to hear you say that, because now that you
   are really ashamed of being barren, you will soon be fruitful! And now
   that God makes you loathe to be without fruit, He will soon cover you
   with precious clusters. One thing is certain--you cannot alter your
   being barren. You cannot, yourself, change your barrenness into
   fruitfulness.

   But is it not significant that my text should stand just after the
   passage to which I have invited your attention just now? Just after the
   story of the despised and rejected Savior stands this note of joy for
   you poor barren ones! Let me invite you, then, to come to the Cross!
   Perhaps that very Cross which gave you life may give you fruitfulness.
   You have found help there before--may you not find vigor there now?

   Brothers and Sisters--my fellow workers for Christ Jesus--let us look
   up and view the flowing of the Savior's precious blood. Let us see the
   chastisement of our peace as it falls in cruel blows upon His blessed
   shoulders. Let us see the scourging. Let us mark the drops of blood as
   they roll down to the ground and what do we feel but this?--"Now for
   the love I bear His name." Yes, and I must and will esteem what was my
   gain I count my loss, all things but loss for Jesus' sake. My former
   pride I call my shame, O may my soul be found in Him. And nail my glory
   to His Cross. And of His righteousness partake.

   O Beloved, there is nothing like a sight of the Savior! I have heard of
   a minister who was ready to give up his work but he fell asleep and
   dreamed that he saw the thorn-crowned Redeemer reaping with a sweat of
   blood upon His face. The Crucified One said to him as He saw him
   standing idly by, "Could you not reap with Me one hour?" He seized a
   sickle and worked on and on and on, with the Crucified One at his side
   and his strength grew as he continued at his work.

   O servants of God, will you depart from your work when the pierced hand
   is at your side? Courage, my Brethren, courage! We cannot fail, for
   Christ is with us! And we must not cease, for Jesus ceases not.
   Together let us praise our Lord that He has sent us this morning such a
   promise to gird about our loins to make us strong even to the end.
   "Sing, O barren, you that did not bear. Break forth into singing and
   cry aloud you that did not travail with child: for more are the
   children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, says
   the Lord."

   The Lord grant it may be so to us for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

                     Judgment Threatening But Mercy Sparing

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 17, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Cut it down; why does it use up the ground? But he answered and said
   to him, Lord, let it alone this year also."

   Luke 13:7,8.

   THE comparison of a man to a tree and of human works to fruit is
   exceedingly common in Scripture because it is most suggestive, natural,
   and appropriate. As fruit is the production of the tree's life and the
   end for which the tree exists, so obedience to the Divine will and
   holiness unto the Lord should be the product of man's life and for it
   he was at first created. When men plant trees in a vineyard, they very
   naturally expect to find fruit on them. And if at the age and season of
   fruit bearing they find no produce, their natural and justifiable
   expectation is disappointed.

   Even thus, speaking after the manner of men, it is natural that the
   great Maker of all should look for the good fruit of obedience and love
   from the men who are the objects of His providential care and be
   grieved when He meets with no return. Man is very much more God's
   property than a tree can ever be the property of the man who plants a
   vineyard. And as God has spent so much more skill and wisdom in the
   creation of a man than a farmer can have spent in the mere planting of
   trees, it becomes the more natural that God should look for fruit from
   His creature, man. And the more reasonable that His most righteous
   requirements should not be refused.

   Trees that bear no fruit must be cut down. And sinners who bear no
   repentance, faith and holiness, must die. It is only a matter of time
   as to whether or not the vineyard shall be cleared of the encumbrance
   of its barren trees. And it is but a matter of time as to when the
   world shall be delivered from the burdensome presence of barren souls.
   It stands to reason that barren trees, which soon become the haunts of
   all sorts of mischievous creatures, should be a nuisance to the
   vineyard. Neither can sinners be permitted forever to become the
   dwelling places of evil spirits and the dens of iniquity-- a thorough
   riddance must be made of impenitent sinners as well as of rotten trees.
   There is a time for felling fruitless trees, and there is an appointed
   season for hewing down and casting into the fire the useless sinner.

   I. We shall not linger on the threshold of our solemn work this
   morning, for our burden is very heavy and we would be rid of it
   speedily. We shall address ourselves at once to those persons who are
   living without God and without Christ, among whom many of my hearers
   must be numbered. We shall speak to those who are not saved--there are
   such in the professing Church everywhere. O may the Holy Spirit find
   them out by our word and bring them in real earnest to consider their
   ways.

   To all unprofitable, unfruitful sinners, we utter this hard, but
   needful sentence--TO CUT YOU DOWN WOULD BE MOST REASONABLE. It is right
   and reasonable to fell barren trees and it is just as right and
   reasonable that you should be cut down.

   1. This will appear in the first place, if we reflect that this is the
   shortest and the surest way to deal with you. It will cost the least
   trouble and be most certainly effectual in removing you from the place
   to which you are an injury rather than a benefit. When the owner of the
   vineyard says to the gardener concerning the tree, "Cut it down," the
   remedy is very sharp, but it is very simple. The felling is soon done,
   the clearance is thorough--and when another tree is planted the benefit
   is evident. To dig about the tree, to trench it, to feed it, to prune
   it and water it--all this takes time-- requiring care and labor and
   attention.

   And, after all that, the process may fail and love's labor may be lost.
   To spare is difficult and involves trouble. To cut down is easy and
   effectual. Unconverted Hearer, to preach the Gospel to you, to call you
   to repentance, to entreat, exhort, instruct and warn you is a laborious
   process and will probably be unsuccessful, after all. The work will
   require much thought! Providential agencies must be directed with
   wisdom! Saints must pray with earnestness! Ministers must plead with
   tears! The Scriptures must be written and those Scriptures must be
   expounded and explained!

   All this is more than you have any natural right to expect that God
   should do with you, when He has in His hands a far simpler remedy by
   which He may at once ease Himself of His adversary and prevent your
   being any further offense-- He has but to take away your breath and
   permit your body to descend into the grave and your soul into Hell and
   the vineyard is clear and there is room for another tree.

   This sharp, short, simple process is one which commends itself to men
   in the case of trees. And it is one in which it is a thousand wonders
   that the Lord has not used with you! There will be no more blaspheming
   God, Sinner, when the axe has laid you low! There will be no more
   rejecting the promise of His mercy! No more violating Sundays! No more
   despising Scripture when the day of doom arrives! Death shall end all
   these abominations forever! We shall no more have to agonize for you in
   vain. No more shall we weep bitterly because of your hardness of
   heart--no longer study to meet your objections and sigh at your
   constant oppositions.

   The flames of Hell will end all this, to your sad and awful cost. No
   longer will a long-suffering God be wearied with your sins and pressed
   down under the load of your iniquities. He will make short work in
   righteousness and a clean work, too. He will sweep you away with the
   broom of destruction and your rebellions will end and your iniquities
   will receive a reward most sure and terrible! Barren fig tree, you will
   draw the fatness from the ground no longer and overshadow with evil
   influence your fellow trees no more! You are become a mere waste and
   worse than a waste.

   Sinner, I ask you, is not the readiest plan to be rid of you suggested
   by the text, "Cut it down"? You yourself would do thus with a tree!
   What reason is there why the Lord should not deal thus with you? Do you
   argue that you are of far greater importance than a tree? How do you
   figure this? A tree is far more valuable to you than you can be
   supposed to be to the infinite God! The gardener would possibly lose
   something by cutting down his tree--but how can you suppose that your
   ruin would be any damage to the great God?

   The man who has many acres of vineyard is not much distressed if one
   barren vine is cut down, for there are so many more. If God had but one
   man in His dominions, it might seem to be of importance whether that
   man were saved or not--but there are so many of our race that your loss
   will be no more than the blowing of one atom of sand from the shore, or
   the removal of one drop from the sea! You yourself could not well
   complain of being cut down, for you do not think much of your own
   soul--you are not concerned about its salvation--you trifle with its
   best interests!

   Why should you expect another to value you at a higher rate than you
   have set upon yourself? You fling away your soul for passing joys! You
   neglect the great salvation! You live in daily disobedience against
   God, who alone can do you good! Even the preaching of the Gospel, that
   all-powerful engine, seems to have no effect upon you because you
   despise yourself. Well, man, if God despises you, too, and commands His
   angels to cut you down, you cannot complain--it is but reasonable that
   God should estimate you at your own price and weigh you in your own
   balances!

   You have wantonly used the axe to yourself on many occasions. Why
   should not the proper Executioner use it in earnest? Some men ruin
   their health by their sins. They wildly dash the axe against their own
   roots and wound themselves terribly. On your soul you are using that
   axe continually--for you damage it by sin and seek out folly and the
   way to damnation--and labor to be lost! You cannot, therefore,
   complain. The crushing of you will be of no more consequence in this
   great universe than the killing of some one ant upon the hill. You will
   never be missed! You may think greatly of yourself, but you are no more
   than a mere worm compared with the great universe of God.

   Beware, O rebellious, unrepentant Sinner! My love yearns for your
   salvation, but my reason approves of your ruin! I foresee it and expect
   it speedily unless you turn unto the Lord and live.

   2. Another reason makes the argument for judgment very powerful,
   namely, that sufficient space for repentance has already been given
   you! If there had been any hope of your repentance, I think many of you
   would have repented long ago. I do not know what can be done for some
   of you more than has been done. You have been dug about--the digging, I
   suppose, is to loosen the roots of their hold upon the earth. And you
   have had affliction, trial and trouble--like the gardener's great
   spade--to wean you from earth and loosen your hold of carnal things.
   You have had sickness--you have tossed to and fro upon the bed of pain.

   You have been in the jaws of death and the horrid teeth seemed above
   and beneath you, as though they would enclose you forever--but all this
   has been of no avail. Why should you be stricken any more? You will
   revolt more and more. Already some of you have been smitten until your
   whole head is sick and your whole heart faint, but you will not hear
   the rod. By the blueness of the wound, says Solomon, the heart is made
   better. But in your case it has not been so. Those blue wounds of
   yours--those great and grievous afflictions--have not been sanctified
   to you, but rather you have gone on offending God and provoking the
   Most High.

   The gardener spoke of feeding as well as of digging and some of you
   have had plentiful helps towards repentance. The Gospel has been put
   close by your roots hundreds of times. You have a Bible in every house.
   You have had, some of you, the advantage of godly training from your
   youth up. You have been warned again and again and again, sometimes
   sternly, sometimes affectionately. You have heard the wooing voice of
   Mercy and the thundering notes of Judgment! But yet, though Jesus
   Christ's own Gospel has been laid close to your roots, O barren Tree,
   you are barren still! What is the use, then, of sparing you?

   Sparing has been tried and it has had no effect--the other remedy is
   certain--"Cut it down." O God, cut not down the sinner! And yet we dare
   not say it would be unreasonable, but on the contrary, the most natural
   result of slighted mercy. O Sinner, you may well say--

   "I have long withstood His Grace,
   Long provoked Him to His face.
   Would not hearken to His calls,
   Grieved Him by a thousand falls.
   Depths of mercy! Can there be
   Mercy still reserved for me?
   Can my God His wrath forbear?
   Me, the chief of sinners spare?"

   3. Sinner, I argue your case somewhat harshly, you think. Ah, Man,
   would God I could make you think me harsh if you would but have pity on
   your own soul! For my harshness is only apparent, not real, and your
   carelessness for your soul is real harshness, for you care not for your
   own soul but treat it as a thing to be cast away and its ruin to be
   laughed at, as though it were contemptible.

   And all this while there has been no sign of improvement whatever in
   you. If there had been some little fruit. If some tears of repentance
   had been flowing from your eyes. If there had been some seeking after
   Christ. If your heart had been a little softened. If you had but a
   little faith in Jesus, though it were but as a grain of mustard seed,
   then there were, indeed, reasons for sparing you! But, sorrowful to
   add, your sparing has had an ill effect upon you. Because God has not
   punished you, therefore you have waxed wanton and bold! You have said,
   "Does God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High?"

   You think that He is altogether such an One as you are and that He will
   never bring you into judgment. You fancy that His sword is rusted into
   the scabbard and His arm waxed short. Strange madness of evil that you
   should pervert the long-suffering which calls you to repentance into a
   reason for running to greater lengths of sin! What? When Jehovah spares
   you that you may turn to Him--shall that very sparing make you lift up
   the foot of your rebellion and spurn Him? It has done so. Up to this
   time you have grown hardened instead of softened. You have grown older,
   but you are no wiser, except it be with Satan's subtlety to be more
   wise in sin.

   The Gospel has not now the effect it once had on you. This voice could
   make your soul shiver and your very blood chill in its veins, but it
   cannot do so now. These eyes have sometimes looked on you and seemed as
   though they flashed with fire--but now they are dull as lead to you.
   Once, when we spoke to you of the wrath to come, the tears would
   flow--there were some tears of gentle pity for your own soul. But ah,
   it is not so with you now! You will go your way and our most earnest
   tones will seem but as the whistling wind and our most importunate
   entreaties as a child's playful song.

   O God, it is reasonable, indeed, that You should lift up that sharp axe
   of Yours and say, "Cut it down." I think I could abundantly justify the
   severity of God, if now He were to use it, when I thus perceive that
   all His sparing has had no effect but to make you worse! When I
   perceive that, notwithstanding these years of waiting, there are no
   tokens of improvement in you, if He says, "Cut it down," Justice and
   Reason say, "yes, Lord, it is well it should be so."

   4. But there are other reasons why, "Cut it down," is most reasonable,
   when we consider the Owner and the other trees. First of all, here is a
   tree which brings forth no fruit whatever and therefore is of no
   service. It is like money badly invested bringing in no interest. It is
   a dead loss to the owner. What is the use of keeping it? The dead tree
   is neither useful nor ornamental--it can yield no service and afford no
   pleasure. Cut it down, by all means!

   And even so with you, Sinner! What is the use of you? You are of use to
   your children, to your family. In business you may be of some service
   to the world--but, then, the world did not make you! And your children
   and your family-- they did not create you. God has made you. God has
   planted you. God is your proprietor--you have done nothing for God.
   Even in coming up to His House today, you did not come with any desire
   to honor Him. And tomorrow, if you should chance to give something to
   the poor, it will not be because they are God's, nor out of love to
   Him. You neither pray to God, nor praise God, nor live for God.

   You live for anything, for everything, for nothing, sooner than live
   for the God that made you. Then what is the good of you to God? All His
   other creatures praise Him. There is not a spider spinning its web from
   leaf to leaf but does His bidding. "The ox knows his owner and the ass
   his master's crib," but you do not know. Would you keep a horse that
   never did you service? Would you have a dog in your house that never
   licked your hand or fawned upon you, or did your will? You would say,
   "What is the good of this? A servant in my house to feed upon my bread,
   to be clothed with my bounty, and yet never to obey me but to live in
   constant reckless disregard of my most reasonable commands!"

   You would say to such a servant, "Get out! You are no servant of mine."
   Well might the Lord say this to you! All these years preserving
   Goodness has winked at the past. Longsuffering has borne with your
   follies and your faults--but it cannot be so forever, for reason
   demands that a useless thing should not always stand and--"Cut it
   down," is the natural inference from the uselessness of your life.

   Nor is this all. While you have been thus living without yielding
   anything, you have been a very costly tree. The tree in the vineyard
   does not cost much except to dig about it and to feed it and to prune
   it. There is, of course, the expense of the gardener who has to watch
   over it, but this is very little. You may let the barren tree stand,
   for it is no great expense. But see what it costs to keep you! You have
   to be daily fed. The breath in your nostrils must come from God every
   moment. There has to be an emanation from Omnipotence at every single
   tick of that clock, or else you would not live.

   The complicated machinery of the human body needs to be tended and kept
   in order by the great Master Craftsman, or else before long the cogs
   would cease to act upon one another and the wheels would be broken and
   the whole machine would be put out of gear. Your body is a mass of
   thousands of strings--and fails if one is gone. The good harpist must
   watch with sedulous care to prevent the strings from snapping.

   You cost God much patience, much bounty, much skill, much power. Why
   should He spare you? What is there in you that He should go on with you
   in this manner? You would not spare the gnat that was always stinging
   you, buzzing in your face and every moment insulting you. If it cost
   you much of your poor gold to spare that poor gnat's life, you would
   not be long about it--you would crush it! And oh, it is a marvel that
   Jehovah does not deal thus with you, for you are more impertinent than
   that gnat could be! Sinner, if you were in God's place and were as
   ill-treated by your creature as the Lord is by you, would you lavish
   love and goodness upon him to receive hardness of heart and rebellion
   in return? Assuredly not! Judge, then, whether it is not right that the
   Lord should say, "Cut it down."

   But there is a worse consideration, namely, that all this while you
   have been filling up space which somebody might have been filling to
   the glory of God. Where that barren tree stands there might have been a
   tree loaded with fruit. You are using up the ground, as the text says,
   that is, doing nothing but just being a cumbersome nuisance. If another
   mother had those children, she would pray for them and weep over them
   and teach them of Christ--but you do no such thing. If another man had
   that money it would be laid out for God's glory--but you lay it out for
   your own pleasure and forget the God who gave it to you!

   If another had sat in that seat which you occupy, it may be that he had
   long ago repented in sackcloth and ashes! But you, like the men of
   Capernaum, have been hardened, instead of being softened under the
   Gospel. It may be, man of influence, if another had stood where you
   have stood in the world's judgment, he would have led hundreds in the
   path of right--but you, standing there, have done no such thing! Oh, if
   another had your gifts, young man, he would not be making a company
   laugh at the tavern, but pleading with all his might for Jesus! If
   another had but your gifts of utterance he would be spending in prayer
   and teaching what you now spend in fun and frolic to make amusement for
   fools.

   Oh, if another had that time to live in, he would live in earnest for
   his Master. If that young saint, just going through the flood, had your
   health and vigor, how would he spend and be spent! I recollect a
   minister of Christ who had but one talent, but much heart. I remember
   hearing him pray this prayer--"O God, I wish I had ten talents, that I
   might serve You better." When I think of some that have them and do not
   serve my Master with them, I am inclined to pray,

   "Lord take away their ten talents and trust me with them if You will,
   for I do desire to have something more to lay out for You."

   Take heed, O my dear, but sinful Hearer, lest the Lord remove you
   suddenly and fill up your place with one who will be obedient to His
   will. Moreover and to make bad worse even to the worst degree--all this
   while ungodly men are spreading an evil influence. Thinking over the
   two lines of the verse we have been singing, I felt a horror of great
   darkness as I realized fully their solemn truthfulness with regard to
   some of you--

   "I have shed His precious blood,
   Trampled on the Son of God.
   Filled with pains unspeakable
   I who yet am not in Hell."

   Well may the question arise--"Why to me this waste of love?" It is so
   apparently a waste of long-suffering and mercy that some transgressors
   should be spared at all, that they may well marvel. Look at it, and I
   think you will see it very clearly--the very fact that God does not
   punish sin on the spot is mischievously interpreted. Men in all ages
   have drawn a wicked inference from the patience of the great Judge. The
   Preacher, in Ecclesiastes, says, "Because sentence against an evil work
   is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is
   fully set in them to do evil." "Why," you say, "So-and-So drinks and
   swears and he has lived to be a hale, hearty old man. He has plunged
   into all sorts of folly and wickedness. He was a thief and everything
   bad besides, and yet he prospers in the world and grows rich. Instead
   of God sinking him down at once to Hell, He has favored him and
   fattened him as a bullock in rich pasture. "Oh," the worldling says,
   "there is no justice in God. He does not punish sin."

   The very fact that you are spared, O Sinner, is doing mischief in the
   world. Do you see that? Your mere existence in this world is to others
   an inducement to continue in sin! While you are spared, others look at
   you and say, "God has not punished him." Therefore they infer that He
   will not punish sin at all. Moreover, how many there are of you whose
   example is fearfully contagious--whose lips and lives combine to lead
   your associates astray from God? In this dreadful disease which has
   ravaged our fields and destroyed the cattle, farmers have been advised
   as soon as ever the cow is attacked with the disease, to kill it on the
   spot and bury it five feet deep out of the way.

   Let us reflect that the murrain of sin is much more pestilential and
   more certain to kill than this murrain among the cattle and therefore
   stern Justice cries, "Let the sinner be at once sent where He cannot
   increase the plague of iniquity-- it is of no use sparing him--he grows
   no better. All the means used only make him worse and meanwhile we must
   look to the welfare of others, lest he perish not alone in his
   iniquity. He teaches his children to swear! He makes others worldly!
   The whole current of his life is to incite men to rebel against
   God--let his desperate course be stopped at once. The leprosy is upon
   him and all that he touches he pollutes--for high sanitary reasons,
   therefore, he must be removed."

   It is better that one die than that many should be smitten and
   therefore the highest consideration for the good of mankind in general
   renders it necessary that the mandate should go forth, "Cut it down."

   II. The second most solemn work is to remind you, O impenitent Sinner,
   that FOR GOD TO HAVE SPARED YOU

   SO LONG IS A VERY WONDERFUL THING. That the infinitely just and holy
   God should have spared you, unconverted man, unconverted woman, up till
   now, is no small timing but a matter for adoring wonder. Let me show
   you this. Consider, negatively, God is not sparing you because He is
   insensible towards your sins--He is angry with the wicked every day. If
   the Lord could be indifferent towards sin and could bring His holy mind
   to treat it as a mere trifle, then it would be no wonder that He should
   let the transgressor live.

   But He cannot endure iniquity--all the day long His anger smokes and
   burns towards evil and yet He holds back the thunderbolt and does not
   smite the guilty. If you had been angry for half-an-hour, you would
   have come to hard words or blows. But here is the Judge of all the
   earth angry every day for twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy,
   or eighty years with some of you and yet He has not destroyed you! It
   is not because the offense is at a distance and therefore far from His
   observant eyes. No--your sins are like smoke in His nose--your
   iniquities provoke Him to His face! You touch the apple of His eye and
   yet, for all that, though this accursed thing called sin intrudes into
   His Presence every instant, yet still He has spared you until now!

   Mark, Sinner, He has spared you not because He was unable to have
   destroyed you. He might have bid the tiles fall from the roof, or the
   fever might have killed you in the street. The air might have refused
   to heave your lungs, or the blood might have ceased its circulation in
   your veins. The gates to death are many. The quiver of Judgment is full
   of sharp arrows. The Lord has but to will it and your soul is required
   of you. He said to the foolish rich man, "This night your soul shall be
   required of you," and he never saw the morning. And He might as easily
   have sent the same sad message to you, and what then?

   As I have said before, this great patience is not manifested towards
   your sinful soul because the Lord is at all dependent upon you--your
   living will not increase and your dying will not diminish His Glory!
   You will be no more missed than one sere leaf is missed in a forest, or
   one dewdrop in a thousand leagues of grass. Judgment needs but a word
   to work its utmost vengeance and you are so provoking that the marvel
   is that Divine severity has spared you so long! Admire and wonder at
   this long-suffering. Remember that this wonder is increased when you
   think of the fruit He deserved to have had of you. A God so good and so
   gracious ought to have been loved by you. He has treated you so well
   and given you such capacities for pleasure that He ought to have had
   some service of you.

   You are not to God what the ox is to its owner--you give to the ox but
   his grass or his straw and you have done with him. But God gives to you
   not only your daily food, but your very life--you are wholly dependent
   upon Him! Nothing can be so much yours as you are God's. You ought to
   have served Him, to have delighted in that service, to spend and to
   have been spent for your Lord! He asks no more of you than He ought to
   have had and yet He asks you to love the Lord your God with all your
   heart, your soul, your strength--this was His first and great
   commandment--and this you have constantly, persistently broken.

   Oh, think, then, when you have given to God such a bad return, when He
   ought to have received so much better-- think, I pray you, how you must
   have provoked Him! And ah, my Hearers! I have to touch upon a very
   solemn part of the business now when I notice again that some, perhaps
   here present, have been guilty of very God-provoking sins. Some
   offenses provoke God much more than others--I believe that cursing
   does, for it is wanton insolence by which nothing can be gained. It is
   altogether a gratuitous piece of insult. To swear, to imprecate the
   curse of God upon one's limbs and souls, is an unnecessary, superfluous
   sin.

   There cannot be any pleasure in pronouncing oaths any more than in
   uttering any other form of words. It is just because man will hate his
   Maker and will provoke Him, that he does this. O Sinner, did you ever
   ask God to damn you and are you not astonished that He has not done it?
   Did you ever desire that the blast should come upon you and do you not
   marvel that He has not long ago swept you where His wrath would wither
   you forever? Swearing is a sin that provokes the Most High! O Sinner,
   abhor this most detestable of vices!

   Infidelity, and how many are guilty of that? How provoking to God for a
   man to deny His very existence! Standing up and breathing God's air and
   living upon God's life and yet saying that there is no God? An
   insignificant worm dares challenge the Almighty to prove His Godhead
   and existence by a tremendous act of justice. This is a God-provoking
   sin. So again is persecution. There may be some here present who have
   persecuted wife and child because of their following Christ. "He that
   touches you touches the apple of My eye," says God. Beware, Sinner--you
   will not touch the Lord's eye long without feeling His heavy hand!

   If any man injures your children, the blood is in your cheek at once!
   If you are a father you feel that you will show yourself strong in
   their defense--even so the heavenly Father will avenge His own elect.
   Therefore, take heed lest you persevere in this Heaven-provoking sin.
   And slander, too--lying against God's servants--inventing and spreading
   wicked tales against those who walk in God's fear. This is another evil
   which awakens the anger of God and stirs up righteous fury against the
   man who is guilty of it. Beware! Beware!

   Filthiness, filthiness of body and of life, will also provoke the Most
   Holy One. This once brought Hell out of Heaven upon Sodom! God sent
   down fire and brimstone because of the lusts of the flesh that made
   Sodom to stink in His nostrils. The harlot and the adulterer and the
   fornicator shall know that they sin not without provoking God very
   terribly. And let me add here among these God-provoking sins there is
   that quenching of conscience of which some of you have been guilty. Ah,
   my dear Hearers, there are not many of you to whom I spoke under these
   first heads, for I know that very few of you would indulge in these
   grosser sins!

   But there are some of you quite as bad in another sense, for you know
   the right and choose the wrong! You hear of Christ and do not give your
   hearts to Him. We had hoped of some of you that long before this we
   should have seen you walking in the Lord's fear. But you are still
   strangers to Christ. You must have had hard work to do this. You must
   have had a terrible tug with conscience, some of you! I know you have
   been stifling many a holy desire and when the Spirit of

   God has been striving with you, you have been so desperately set on
   mischief that still you have gone on in the error of your ways.

   Now these sins provoke God. I do not believe that I stand in this
   pulpit and plead with you in God's name and then go back and tell my
   Master that you have rejected His warnings without God's being angry
   with your hardness of heart and stiff necks. I know if we send an
   Ambassador to a foreign court to try and make peace and he honestly and
   earnestly lays down proper stipulations for peace, if they are
   rejected, you will soon find the newspapers and public opinion ringing
   with indignation. "Why," they say, "will not the men have peace when
   the terms are so reasonable? Get out the iron-dads, let them have
   war--war to the knife. If they will not yield to what is reasonable,
   thus let us dress ourselves in thunder and go forth across the sea."

   And what do you think? Shall God be always provoked? Shall mercy be
   preached to you in vain forever? Shall Christ be presented and always
   rejected and will you continue to be His enemies and shall He never
   proclaim war against your souls? It is a marvel! It is a wonder that
   these God-provoking sins have so long been borne with, and that you are
   not yet cut down!

   III. And now, WHAT IS THE REASON FOR ALL THIS LONG-SUFFERING? Why is it
   that this tree has not been cut down? The answer is because there is
   One who pleads for sinners. I have shown you, and some of you will
   think I have shown you with very great severity, too, how reasonable it
   is that you should be cut down. I wish you felt it, for if you felt how
   reasonable it was that God should send you to Hell, then you would
   begin to tremble and there would be some hope for you!

   I can assure you I have trembled for you when I have thought how
   rational, how just--no, it would seem to me, how necessary it was that
   some of you should be lost--it has made me tremble for you, and I would
   to God you would tremble for yourselves! But what has been the secret
   cause that you have been kept alive? The answer is Jesus Christ has
   pleaded for you! The crucified Savior has interfered for you! And you
   ask me, "Why?" I answer, because Jesus Christ has an interest in you
   all. We do not believe in general redemption, but we believe in every
   word of this precious Bible--and there are many passages in the
   Scripture which seem to show that Christ's death had an universal
   bearing upon the sons of men.

   We are told that He tasted death for every man. What does that mean?
   Does it mean that Jesus Christ died to save every man? I do not believe
   it does, for it seems to me that everything which Christ intended to
   accomplish by the act of His death He must accomplish or else He will
   be defeated, which is not supposable. Those whom Christ died to save I
   believe He will save effectually, through His substitutionary
   sacrifice. But did He in any other sense die for the rest of mankind?

   He did. Nothing can be much more plain in Scripture, it seems to me,
   than that all sinners are spared as the result of Jesus Christ' death.
   And this is the sense in which men are said to trample on the blood of
   Jesus Christ. We read of some who denied the Lord that bought them. No
   one who is bought with blood for eternal salvation ever tramples on
   that blood--but Jesus Christ has shed His blood for the reprieve of men
   that they may be spared--and those who turn God's sparing mercy into an
   occasion for fresh sin do trample on the blood of Jesus Christ. You can
   hold that doctrine without holding universal redemption, or without at
   all contradicting that undoubted Truth of God that Jesus laid down His
   life for His sheep and that where He suffered He suffered not in vain.

   Now, Sinner, whether you know it or not, you are indebted to Him that
   did hang upon the tree for the breath that is now in you. You had not
   been on praying ground and pleading terms with God this morning if it
   had not been for that dear suffering One. Our text represents the
   gardener as only asking to have it spared--but Jesus Christ did
   something more than ask--He pleaded, not with His mouth only, but with
   pierced hands and pierced feet, and pierced side. And those prevailing
   pleas have moved the heart of God, and you are yet spared. May I speak
   to you, then? If your life had been spared, when you were condemned to
   die, by my intervention--suppose such a case--would you despise me?

   If I had power at the Court and when you were condemned to die, had
   gone in and pleaded for you and you had been reprieved--year after year
   would you hate me? Would you speak against me? Would you rail at my
   character? Would you find fault with my friends? I know you better--you
   would love me! You would be grateful for the sparing of your life. O
   Sinner, I would you would treat the Lord Jesus as you would treat man!
   I would you would think of the Lord Jesus Christ as you would think of
   your fellow man who had delivered you from death!

   You are not in Hell where you would have been if He had not come in and
   pleaded for you. I do beseech you, think of the misery of lost souls
   and recollect that you would have been in such a woeful case yourself
   this morning if He had not lifted up that hand once pierced for human
   sin. There, there, where the flames can no abatement know, where a drop
   of water is a gift too great to be received--there, where hope is
   excluded and despair sits upon a throne of iron, binding captive souls
   in everlasting bands--where "Forever!" is written on the fire and
   "Forever!" is printed on the chain and "Forever! Forever! Forever!"
   rings out as the awful death-knell of everything like hope and
   rest--there you would have been this morning--this morning--if sparing
   Grace had not prevented!

   Where are your companions, your old companions? You sat in the pothouse
   with them. They are in Hell, but you are not. When you were younger you
   sinned with them and they are lost, but you are not. Why this
   difference? Why are they cast away and you spared? I can only ascribe
   it to the gracious long-suffering of Jehovah. O, I pray you look at Him
   who spared you and weep and mourn for your sins! May the Spirit of God
   come down on you this morning and draw you to the foot of His dear
   Cross! And as you see the blood which has spared your blood and the
   death which has made you live until now, I do trust that the Divine
   Spirit may make you fall down and say, "O Jesus, how can I offend You?
   How can I stand out against You? Accept me and save me for Your mercy's
   sake."

   While I have thus spoken of the general interest which Christ has in
   you all, I have good hope that Christ has a special interest in some of
   you! I hope that He has specially redeemed you from among men and
   bought you not with silver and gold, but with His own precious blood,
   having loved you with an everlasting love. I trust He intends with the
   bands of His kindness to draw you this morning. "Oh," says one, "I
   cannot think that such can be the case!" But suppose you were to find
   out before long that you were chosen of God and dear to Christ and were
   to be a jewel in His crown for-ever--what would you say, then, of
   yourself?

   "I would mourn that I could ever have hated Him that loved me so well!
   Oh, that I could ever have stood out against Him that was determined to
   save me! What a fool I was to quarrel with Him who had paid my price
   and chosen me by His Grace and taken me to be married unto Himself
   forever!"

   I tell you that God will forgive you, but you will never forgive
   yourselves for having stood out and resisted so long. Oh, may eternal
   Mercy, which has not yet said, "Cut it down," now dig about you and
   feed you that you may bring forth fruit--and then it shall be all to
   the praise of Him whose precious blood has saved us from eternal wrath.
   May God bless these feeble words of mine. He knows how I meant
   them--how I meant to speak them, how I meant to have wept over you, how
   I wanted that my soul should heave with passionate desire for your
   conversion--but if there have been no such outward manifestations, yet
   I pray God that the Truth itself may be irresistible and may He get to
   Himself the victory and His shall be the praise, forevermore. Amen.

                              A Sermon From A Rush

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 24, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Can the rush grow up without a marsh? Can the reeds grow without
   water? While it is yet green and not cut down, it withers before any
   other plant. So are the paths of all that forget God. And the
   hypocrite's hope shall perish."

   Job 8:11-13.

   ISAAC walked in the fields at eventide to meditate. I commend him for
   his occupation. Meditation is exceedingly profitable to the mind. If we
   talked less, read less, and meditated more we should be wiser men. I
   commend him for the season which he chose for that occupation--at
   eventide--when the business of the day was over and the general
   stillness of nature was in harmony with the quiet of his soul. I also
   commend him for the place which he selected--the wide expanse of
   nature--the field.

   Wise men can readily find a thousand subjects for contemplation abroad
   in the open country. Our four-square room is not very suggestive. But
   when a man walks in the fields, having the Lord in his heart and his
   whole mental faculties directed towards heavenly things, all things aid
   him in his pleasing occupation. If we look above to the sun, moon and
   stars, all these remind us of the grandeur of God and make us ask
   ourselves, "What is man, that the Lord should be mindful of him, or the
   son of man, that Jehovah should visit him?"

   If we look below, the green meadows, or golden cornfields all proclaim
   Divine care and bounty. There is not a bird that sings, nor a
   grasshopper that chirps in the grass which does not urge us to praise
   and magnify the name of the Most High--while the plants, from the
   hyssop on the wall to the cedar which spreads its boughs so gloriously
   on Lebanon-- exhibit to observant eyes the wisdom of the great Creator
   of all things. The murmuring brook talks to the listening ear in
   hallowed whispers of Him whose cloudy Throne supplies its stream. And
   the air, as it sighs amid the trees, tells in mysterious accents of the
   great unseen but ever-active Spirit of the living God.

   The great book of Nature only needs to be turned over by a reverent
   hand and to be read by an attentive eye to be found to be only second
   in teaching to the Book of Revelation. He who would have us forget to
   study the fair creation of God is foolish. He would have us neglect one
   book by a great Author in order that we may the better comprehend
   another from the same hand. The pages of Inspiration reveal God far
   more clearly than the fields of creation--but having once obtained the
   light of God, the Holy Spirit, we can then enter the world of nature
   which has become consecrated to our best devotions and find that "in
   His temple does everyone speak of His Glory."

   Down by the river's bank let us go, like Pharaoh's daughter, and
   perhaps among the rushes we shall find a subject for thought of which
   we may say, as she did of Moses, "I drew it out of the water." The
   reed, as it waves in yonder marsh, has a word of warning and whoever
   has ears to hear, let him hear. I claim your attention for a preacher
   who is not often heard--lend him your ears and when any shall ask you,
   "What did you go out to see?" you need not blush to answer, "A reed
   shaken by the wind."

   The rush shall, this morning, by God's Grace, teach us a lesson of
   self-examination. Bildad, the Shuhite, points it out to us as the
   picture of a hypocrite--so, going to our work at once we shall have
   three things to talk about this morning. The hypocrite's
   religion--first, what is it like? Secondly, what it lives on. And
   thirdly, what will become of it?

   I. First, then, THE HYPOCRITE'S PROFESSION--WHAT IS IT LIKE? It is here
   compared to a rush growing in the mire and a reed flourishing in the
   water. This comparison has several points in it.

   1. In the first place, hypocritical religion may be compared to the
   rush for the rapidity with which it grows. True conversions are often
   very sudden--as, for example, the conversion of Saul on the road to
   Damascus and the conversion of the Philippian jailer when suddenly
   startled out of his sleep and made to cry, "What must I do to be
   saved?" But the after-growth of Christians is not quite so rapid and
   uninterrupted--seasons of deep depression chill their joy. Hours of
   furious temptation make a dreadful onslaught upon their quiet.

   They cannot always rejoice. Their life is checkered. They are emptied
   from vessel to vessel and are acquainted with grief. True Christians
   are very much like oaks which take years to reach their maturity--many
   March winds blow through them before they are well rooted. And
   oftentimes tempest and flood and drought and hurricane exercise their
   tremendous powers upon them.

   Not so the hypocrite--once having made a profession of being converted,
   things generally go very smoothly with him. "Because they have no
   changes, therefore they fear not God." They are strangers to
   lamentations over inbred corruption. When Believers talk of a warfare
   within, they are astonished! If we groan out, "O wretched man that I
   am-- who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" these gentlemen
   say, "What bad people these Christians must be, to talk in that way!
   What black hearts they must have! And how inconsistent for them to
   claim to be children of God!"

   The hypocrite can always pray well and sing well. He meets no
   hindrances in coming to the Mercy Seat, has no groans to mingle with
   his formal songs. The backs of living men ache under their loads, but a
   steam-engine having no living sensibilities knows no pains. A horse may
   stumble from weariness, but a locomotive, never! Even so, the
   mechanical professor goes on and on and on at an even rate--when living
   souls enjoy no such perfect equanimity.

   Strong temptations do not grieve the mere professor. The devil does not
   care to molest him--he knows he is sure of him and so he lets him very
   much alone. The Pharisee's house stood very firmly though it was built
   on sand--and it neither shook nor stirred till the flood came. It was
   as firm to all human appearance as if it had been founded on the Rock
   of Ages. When the trial-hour came--then the destruction was terribly
   complete--but meanwhile its foundations were dug without labor and its
   timbers were set up without trouble.

   It is an ill sign, dear Friend, if you never have to search your heart
   with deep anxiety lest you should be deceived. To have such strong
   faith that you never waver is one thing--but to be filled with such
   strong presumption that you never examine yourself is quite another.
   "Tush!" says this man, "I can do all things. I can run and not be
   weary! I can walk and not faint! I do not understand these sighings of
   Little-Faith, and limping of Ready-to-Halt. I cannot understand all
   this noise about conflict within--I am peaceable and quiet always."
   Yes, so it may be. Alas, many have heard the voice, "Peace, peace,
   where there is no peace."

   So, like the rush by the river, the hypocrite grows up suddenly and
   flourishingly in Divine things, to all appearances, and finds it easy
   work to be green and fair in the ways of the Lord.

   2. The rush is of all plants one of the most hollow and unsubstantial.
   It looks stout enough to be wielded as a staff, but he that leans upon
   it shall most certainly fall. It is a water-loving thing and it
   partakes of the nature of that on which it feeds--it is unstable as
   water and it does not excel. It has a fine appearance, but it is of no
   service whatever where stability is needed.

   So is it with the hypocrite! He is fair enough on the outside, but
   there is no solid faith in Christ Jesus in him--no real repentance on
   account of sin--no vital union to Christ Jesus. He can pray, but not in
   secret, and the essence and soul of prayer he never knew. He has never
   wrestled with the angel, never sighed and cried unto God and been
   "heard in that he feared." He has a pretended confidence, but that
   confidence never was founded and bottomed on the finished work of Jesus
   Christ.

   He was never emptied of self, never brought down to feel that all his
   own doing, and willing, and power are less than nothing and vanity. If
   there had been a deep repentance, and a real confidence, and a true
   life in Jesus, then he had not been the hypocrite that he now is. Oh,
   dear Friends, while I speak upon these things, I have over my spirit
   the overshadowing of a great gloom. What if some of us should be found
   to have been as unsubstantial as the rush by the river when God comes
   to judge the world?

   What? When you need a hope to bear you up in the hour of death--what if
   it should snap beneath you? You high professors! You ancient members
   and revered Church officers! You eloquent preachers of the Word--what
   if all your profession should, like the baseless fabric of a vision,
   pass away? You have been drinking of the cup of the Lord. You have been
   feasting at His sacramental table. You have talked a great deal of rich
   experiences. You have boasted of the Divine Graces which you think the
   Spirit of God has given you--but what if it should all be a delusion?
   What if you should have fostered in your soul self-deception and should
   now be traversing the way of darkness while you dream that you are in
   the way of light?

   May the Lord search us and give us that true, solid, substantial, real,
   strong-hearted faith in Christ which will stand the test! The reed is
   hollow and has no heart--and the hypocrite has none either--and lack of
   heart is fatal, indeed. When the Roman seer killed the victim to take
   an omen from the innards, he always considered it to be the worst sign
   of all if no heart was found, or if the heart was shriveled. "Their
   heart is divided," said Hosea, "now shall they be found wanting."

   God abhors the sacrifice where the heart is not found. Sirs, if you
   cannot give God your hearts, do not mock Him with solemn sounds upon
   thoughtless tongues! If you do not mean your godliness, do not profess
   it! Above all things, abhor mere profession. Jonathan Edwards tells us
   that in the great revival in America there were conversions of all
   sorts of people--from harlots upwards, but not one single conversion,
   he said--of ungodly professors. Those seemed to have been the only
   persons upon whom the Spirit of God did not descend. Beware, then, of
   having the outward form of religion and being hollow and heartless like
   the rush, for then your case is desperate, indeed.

   3. A third comparison very naturally suggests itself, namely, that the
   hypocrite is very like the rush for its bending properties. When the
   rough wind comes howling over the marsh, the rush has made up its mind
   that it will hold its place at all hazards. So if the wind blows from
   the north, he bends to the south and the blast sweeps over him. And if
   the wind blows from the south, he bends to the north and the gale has
   no effect upon him. Only grant the rush one thing--that he may keep his
   place--and he will cheerfully bow to all the rest.

   The hypocrite will yield to good influences if he is in good society.
   "Oh yes, certainly, certainly, sing, pray, anything you like." With
   equal readiness he will yield to evil influences if he happens to be in
   connection with them. "Oh, yes, sing a song, talk wantonness, run into
   gay society, attend the theater, take a turn with the dice! Certainly,
   if you wish it! 'When we are at Rome we do as Rome does.' "

   Anything to oblige anybody is his motto. He is an omnivorous feeder and
   like the swine can eat the vegetable of propriety, or the flesh of
   iniquity. One form of doctrine is preached to him--very well, he would
   not wish to contend against it for a moment! It is contradicted by the
   next preacher he hears--and really, there is a great deal to be said on
   the other side--so he holds with hare and hounds, too. He is all for
   heat when the weather is hot and quite as much for cold when it is the
   season. He can freeze and melt and boil, all in an hour--just as he
   finds it pays best to be solid or liquid. If it is most respectable to
   call a thing black, well, then, it is black! If it will pay better to
   call it white, well, then, it is not so very black--in fact it is
   rather white, or white altogether if you like to call it so!

   The gross example of the Vicar of Bray comes at once to one's mind. He
   had been a papist under Henry VIII, then a Protestant under a
   Protestant reign--then a papist under Mary--then again a Protestant
   under Elizabeth. And he declared he had always been consistent with his
   principle, for his principle was to continue the Vicar of Bray! Some
   there are who are evidently consistent in this particular and in the
   idea that they will make things as easy for themselves as they can--and
   will get as much profit as they can--either by truth or lies.

   Do you not know some? They have not an atom of that stern stuff of
   which martyrs are made in the whole of their composition. They love
   that modern goddess, Charity. When Diana went down Charity went up. And
   she is as detestable a goddess as ever Diana was. Give me a man who
   will be all things to all men to win souls, if it is not a matter of
   princi-ple--but give me the man who, when it comes to be a matter of
   right and wrong, would rather die than deny his faith-- who could burn,
   but could not for a moment conceal his sentiments, much less lay them
   aside until a more convenient season.

   True godliness, such as will save the soul, must not be the mere bark,
   but the heart, the sap, the essence of a man's being--it must run right
   through and through, so that he cannot live without it. That religion
   which you do not carry with you every day and which is not the dearest
   object for which you live is not worth picking up from a dunghill!
   Beloved, we must be ready to die for Christ or we shall have no joy in
   the fact that Christ died for us.

   4. Yet again the bulrush has been used in Scripture as a picture of a
   hypocrite from its habit of hanging down its head. "Is it to hang your
   head like a bulrush?" asks the Prophet, speaking to some who kept a
   hypocritical fast. Pretended Christians seem to think that to hang down
   the head is the very index of deep piety. To look piously miserable. To
   speak in a wretched tone of voice. To be constantly lamenting the
   wickedness of the times and bewailing the badness of the harvests and
   the wickedness of our legislature.

   To see nothing anywhere but what is vile, deceptive and abominable is
   thought to be the trademark of superfine godliness. It is the mark of a
   hypocrite to wear always a sad countenance--Job says of the hypocrite,
   "Will he delight himself in the Almighty?" And the answer that he
   expected was, "No, it is altogether impossible!" A real hypocrite finds
   no satisfaction in his religion. He goes through with it because he
   thinks he must. He walks to his place of worship with his books under
   his arm just as a culprit might be supposed to walk up the gallows
   stairs. And when he gets to a place of worship he is very proper in all
   his demeanor--very proper, indeed, but he is never joyous.

   Smile on Sundays? Shocking! What? Enjoy anything like mirth at any
   time! Awful! Now you understand all about this. There are some things
   which you must handle very tenderly because they will break if you
   don't. A man, dressed in shoddy garments, walks very demurely for fear
   the rubbish should tear. But good broadcloth allows us liberty of
   action without fear of such an accident. Gingerbread religionists may
   only be looked at in their somber aspects--genuine Believers are not
   ashamed to be viewed even when their cheerfulness is at its full.

   A person who has bought a pair of shoes made of brown paper must
   mincingly tread with delicate steps. But he who, according to
   Scripture, is shod with iron and brass may, with manly gait, march on
   and even leap for joy without fear! I love Christian preciseness of
   action, but I abhor hypocritical decorum and formalistic exactness of
   worship. I would advocate holy cheerfulness--a Christian freedom which
   lets the whole man show itself--a freedom of sorrowing when it is the
   time for sorrow and a freedom of rejoicing when it is the time for
   rejoicing!

   That constrained, stiffly starched religion which some people think
   such a great deal of is nothing but the bulrush religion of the
   hypocrite and the Pharisee--and the sooner we throw it out the better.
   The man whose heart is right with God does not stop to say, "How will
   this look?" His heart tells him, as he reads the Word, that such a
   course is right and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit he follows
   it. Right with him is delight. He knows that evil is not denied to him
   as though he were debarred from pleasure, but that it is only kept from
   him as a tender parent would keep poison from a child. Our life is the
   life of liberty. And we find, of true religion, that "Her ways are ways
   of pleasantness and all her paths are peace."

   5. Once more--the rush is well taken as an emblem of the mere professor
   from its bearing no fruit. Nobody would expect to find figs on a
   bulrush, or grapes of Eshcol on a reed. So it is with the hypocrite--he
   brings forth no fruit. The hypocrite gets as far as this--"I do not
   drink. I do not swear. I do not cheat. I do not lie. I do not break the
   Sabbath." His religion is all negative. And when it comes to anything
   positive he fails. What have you ever done for Christ? You may look at
   the whole of the hypocrite's life and it yields nothing.

   Perhaps he has given a guinea or two to a charity. Yes--but did he give
   it to God? He has been kind to the poor. Did he look at the poor as
   being God's poor and care for them because God cares for them? Did he
   do it for God? Throughout the whole life of the hypocrite there is
   nothing in which he really serves God. What? Not when he has made that
   long prayer? He did it either to satisfy his conscience or to please
   those who were listening to him. Did he really pray to God and do it
   for God's Glory and in order that he might have fellowship with God?

   If so, he is no hypocrite--but the hypocrite proper--though he has left
   off many wrong things, yet he has not advanced so far as to bring forth
   fruit meet for repentance. He has not run in the way of holiness. He
   has not sought after the image of Christ. He does not delight in
   communion with Christ. He has no faith, no joy, no hope, no conformity
   to the Spirit of the Master. He lacks fruit and therefore he is as the
   rush and not as a plant of the Lord's right hand planting.

   I will not stay further to work out this parallel--only if any words
   have seemed to strike you--let them strike you. If there has been a
   sentence in what I have said that suited my own case, I do desire to
   feel its power. The worst is that some of you who are most sincere will
   be troubled when you search yourselves, when we do not want you to be.
   And others who are really hypocrites are the very last persons to think
   they are. When our young members come to me in such trouble, crying,
   "Sir, I am afraid I am a hypocrite," I always think, "/believe you are
   not, or else you would not be afraid of it."

   But those who are never afraid--who have just written it down as a
   matter of fact that all is well with them--should listen to the word of
   the Prophet, "Strangers have devoured his strength and he knows it not:
   yes, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knows not." The
   worm may be in the center of the apple when the cheek of the fruit is
   still beautiful to look upon. God save us from hypocrisy and grant us
   Grace to see ourselves in a true light!

   II. Secondly, we have to consider WHAT IT IS THAT THE HYPOCRITE'S
   RELIGION LIVES ON. "Can the rush grow up without a marsh? Can the reeds
   grow without water?" The rush is entirely dependent upon the ooze in
   which it is planted. If there should come a season of drought and the
   water should fail from the marsh, the rush would more speedily die than
   any other plant. "While it is yet green and not cut down, it withers
   before any other plant." The Hebrew name for the rush signifies a plant
   that is always drinking. And so the rush lives perpetually by sucking
   and drinking in moisture.

   This is the case of the hypocrite. The hypocrite cannot live without
   something that shall foster his apparent piety. Let me show you some of
   this mire and water upon which the hypocrite lives. Some people's
   religion cannot live without excitement--revival services, earnest
   preachers and zealous Prayer Meetings keep them green. But the earnest
   minister dies, or goes to another part of the country. The Church is
   not quite so earnest as it was and what then? Where are your converts?

   Oh, how many there are who are hot-house plants--while the temperature
   is kept up to a certain point they flourish and bring forth flowers, if
   not fruits! But take them out into the open air. Give them one or two
   nights' frost of persecution and where are they? My dear Hearers,
   beware of that godliness which depends upon excitement for its life! I
   do not speak against religious excitement--men get excited over
   politics, and science, and trade--why should they not be excited about
   the far weightier things of religion?

   But still, though you may indulge yourself with it, sometimes, do not
   let it be your element. I am afraid that many Churches have been
   revived and revived till they have become like big bubbles full of wind
   and now they have almost vanished into thin air! The grace which man
   gives, man can take away. If your piety has sprung up like a mushroom,
   it will be about as frail. Doubtless many are converted at revivals who
   run well and hold out. And then their conversion is the work of the
   Spirit of God.

   But there are as many, I fear, of another kind! They get delirious with
   excitement--they fancy that they have repented, dream that they have
   believed--and then imagine themselves to be the children of God! They
   may go on in such a delusion perhaps year after year. Beware! Beware!
   Some hypocrites can no more live without excitement than the rush can
   live without water! Dear Hearers, pray that you may be like the palm
   tree, which even in the desert still continues green and brings forth
   its fruit in the year of drought.

   Many mere professors live upon encouragement. You are the child of
   godly parents--those parents naturally look with great delight upon the
   first signs of Divine Grace in you and they encourage and foster, as
   they should do, everything that is good. Or you belong to a class such
   as some of those most blessed classes which meet here, presided over by
   tender, loving spirits--and whenever you have a little difficulty you
   can run to these kind helpers. Whenever any fresh temptation arises you
   find strength in their warning and counsel.

   This is a very great privilege. I wish that in all Churches we would
   practice the text, "Encourage him," more and more. We ought to comfort
   the feeble-minded and support the weak. But, dear Friends, beware of
   the piety which depends upon encouragement. You will have to go,
   perhaps, where you will be frowned at and scowled at, where the head of
   the household, instead of encouraging prayer, will refuse you either
   the room or the time for engaging in it. You may meet with hard words,
   bitter sneers, and cruel mockery because you profess to be a Christian.
   Oh, get Grace which will stand that fiery trial! God give you a Grace
   that will be independent of human helpers because it hangs upon the
   bare arm of God Himself!

   Some, too, we know, whose religion is sustained by example. It may be
   the custom in the circle in which you move to attend a place of
   worship--no, more--it has come to be the fashion to join the Church and
   make a profession of religion. Well, example is a good thing. When I
   was crossing the Humber from Hull to New Holland the other day, a
   steamer came in with sheep on board and there was some difficulty in
   getting them from the boat to the pier. The butcher first dragged one
   sheep over the drawbridge and then the others came along readily
   enough. Example is a good thing--one true sheep of Christ may lead the
   rest in the way of Truth and obedience.

   But a religion which depends entirely on other people must obviously go
   to ruin when subjected to the temptation of an evil example. Why, if
   you simply join the Church because other young people do it, or profess
   such-and-such a faith because it happens to be the prevailing doctrine
   in the district where you reside--why, then, your religion will depend
   on the locality! And when you move somewhere else, your religion will
   move off, too, or you from it. Young man, avoid this feeble sort of
   piety. Be a man who can be singular when to be singular is to be right.

   If the whole world shall run headlong down the broad road, be it yours
   to thread your way through the crowd against the current along the
   uphill way of life. The dead fish floats down the stream, the live fish
   goes against it. Show your life by shunning unholy example.
   Furthermore, a hypocrite's religion is often very much supported by the
   profit that he makes by it. Mr. By-Ends joined the Church because, he
   said, he should get a good wife by making a profession of religion.

   Besides, Mr. By-Ends kept a shop and went to a place of worship
   because, he said, the people would have to buy goods somewhere--and if
   they saw him at their place--very likely they would come to his shop
   and so his religion would help his trade. Thus he argued that there
   were three good things--a profession of religion, a good wife and a
   good trade as well. Suppose, Mr. By-Ends, that your religion involved
   your missing the supposed good wife, and losing the good customers,
   what about it then? "Why, then," says he, "I'm very sorry, but really
   we must look to the main chance. We must not commit ourselves too far."

   That is Mr. By-Ends' way ofjudging. He does not look upon the things of
   God as the main choice. They are means to an end--that is all. I fear
   there is much of this everywhere. You will know best, any of you, how
   far you are affected by it. I am sure there are few, if any of you, who
   can be suspected of coming here to gain trade, for the thing does not
   answer in such a city as London. But in country towns this operates
   marvelously. You can have the Dissenting trade if you go to meeting, or
   you can have the Church trade if you go to the steeple-house.

   Well, worshippers of the golden calf, do you know what Christ will do
   with you if you are found in His temple when He comes? That scourge of
   small cords will be on your backs! "Take these things from here," He
   will say, as He sees your tables and your doves and your shekels. "My
   Father's house shall be called a House of Prayer--you have made it a
   den of thieves." The rush will grow where there is plenty of mire,
   plenty of profit for religion--but dry up the gains and where would
   some people's religion be? Pray with all your might against this
   loathsome disgusting sin of making a pretension to godliness merely for
   the sake of getting something by it.

   Yet, doubtless, there are crowds who do this. With certain persons
   their godliness rests very much upon their prosperity. "Does Job serve
   God for nothing?" was the wicked question of Satan concerning that
   upright man. And of many it might be asked with justice, for they love
   God after a fashion because He prospers them. But if things went ill
   with them they would give up all faith in God. I remember two who
   joined this Church. I remember them with sorrow. I faintly hope good
   things of them, but I frequently fear the worst.

   They joined this Church when things were going very well. But almost
   from that very time they had a succession of losses and they imputed
   this to their having made a profession of religion. And so they gave up
   outward religious duties. Whether they did that out of a scrupulous
   honesty, I scarcely can tell. Or whether it really was this--that they
   could not receive evil at the hand of God as well as good--I do not
   know. I am inclined to fear it was the latter. There are some who
   quarrel with the most High. If they can clearly see that since the time
   of their supposed conversion, the world has gone prosperously with
   them, then they will love God in their poor carnal way. But if it has
   been nothing but adversity then they are astonished and think God is
   not kind with them.

   Do you know that the promise of the old Covenant was prosperity, but
   the promise of the new Covenant is adversity? Listen to this
   text--"Every branch in Me that bears not fruit He takes away and every
   branch that bears fruit"--what? "Hepurges it, that it may bring forth
   more fruit"! If you bring forth fruit you will have to endure
   affliction! "Alas," says one, "that is a terrible prospect!" Ah, but,
   Beloved, this affliction works out such comfortable fruit that the
   Christian, who is the subject of it, has learned to rejoice in
   tribulations--because as his tribulations abound so his consolation
   abounds by Christ Jesus!

   Rest assured if you are a godly man, you will be no stranger to the
   rod. Trials must and will befall. But do not let me mislead anybody
   into the idea of praying for trouble! I have heard of one who did
   so--he only did it but once--many trials made him wiser! The true-born
   child knows how to bear the rod, but he will not ask for it--if he
   asked for it he would be very silly--and it would be of no service to
   him. You will have it sooner or later! And though it may be months and
   years will roll very quietly with you, yet there will be days of
   darkness and you ought to rejoice that there are such, for in these you
   will be weaned from earth and made ready for Heaven! You will be
   delivered from your clinging to the present and made to long, and pine
   and sigh for the things which are not seen but eternal, so soon to be
   revealed to you.

   To conclude this point. The hypocrite is very much affected by the
   respectability of the religion which he avows. John Bunyan's pithy way
   of putting it is, "Many walk with religion when she wears her silver
   slippers." But they forsake her if she goes barefoot. May I ask you
   this question? What would you do if to follow Christ were penal
   according to the laws of the land? If you had to live under perpetual
   jeopardy of life for reading the Word--would you hide it as the saints
   of God did, behind the wainscot or under the floor--and read it down in
   the cellar or up in the attic at spare moments?

   Could you come forward in the day of trial as those did in Pliny's time
   and say, "I am a Christian"? Do you think that like poor Tomkins, when
   Bonner held his finger over the candle to let him see what it was like,
   you could still say you could burn but you could not turn? Could you
   stand as some of the martyrs did at the stake, telling those who looked
   on that if they did not clap their hands at the last they might know
   their religion was not true, and so at the very last, when their poor
   fingers were all on fire, they would still lift them up and wave their
   hands to and fro, and cry out, "None but Christ! None but Christ!"?

   Do you think you would have the Grace to suffer for Christ Jesus? You
   may say, "I fear I should not." My dear Friends, that fear is a very
   natural one. But mark you, if you can bear the ordinary trials of the
   day, the constant trials of the world, and take them before God and
   exhibit Christian patience under them, you may hope that as a Believer
   in Christ you would have more Grace given you when the trials became
   more severe. And so you would be able to pass through them as the
   saints of old did!

   But mark you, if the present trials and troubles of the day are too
   much for you and you cannot exhibit Christian patience under them, I am
   compelled to ask you in the language of Jeremiah, "If you have run with
   the footmen and they have wearied you, how will you contend with
   horses? And if in the land of peace wherein you trusted, they wearied
   you, then how will you do in the swelling of Jordan?" This may help us
   to try ourselves.

   III. We have a third point to close with and that is, WHAT BECOMES OF
   THE HYPOCRYTE'S HOPE? "While it is yet green and not cut down, it
   withers before any other plant. So are the paths of all that forget
   God. And the hypocrite's hope shall perish. Long before the Lord comes
   to cut the hypocrite down it often happens that he dries up for want of
   the mire on which he lives. The excitement, the encouragement, the
   example, the profit, the respectability, the prosperity upon which he
   lived fail him and he fails, too.

   Alas, how dolefully is this the case in all Christian Churches! Little
   have we had to mourn over defections during the years of our ministry.
   But we have had some sorrowful, very sorrowful cases, and I doubt not
   we shall have more. "Lord, is it I?" "Lord, is it I?" is a question
   that may be passed round among professing Christians. I fear that there
   are those here this morning who one day will deny the Lord that bought
   them and crucify the Son of God afresh and put Him to an open shame.

   "Oh," says one, "it cannot be me." Do not be too sure, Friend, do not
   be too sure! If I could come in Prophetic spirit to some of you who
   will do this and look you in the face and tell you what you will do,
   you would say like Hazael, "Is your servant a dog that he should do
   this thing?" And I should have to settle my countenance until I became
   ashamed and look at you yet again and say, "You are no dog and yet you
   will play the dog and return to your vomit and become yet again what
   once you were, only with this aggravation, that you will have sinned
   against light and against knowledge, against sacred influences and
   professed enjoyments of Divine love."

   You have cleansed the house. You have swept it. You have garnished it
   and the evil spirit is gone. But if the Holy Spirit has not driven him
   out--if this has not been a work of power on the part of God--that evil
   spirit will come back and he will take unto himself seven other spirits
   more wicked than himself and they shall enter in and dwell there and
   your last end will be worse than the first! Better not to have known
   the way of righteousness than, having known it, to be turned back
   again.

   The worst of men are those traitors who leave the army of Truth to side
   with the foe. I believe in the doctrine of the final perseverance of
   every true child of God--but there are in all our Churches certain
   spurious pretenders who will not hold on their way--who will blaze and
   sparkle for a season and then they will go out in darkness. They are
   "wandering stars, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness
   forever." Better far make no pretension of having come to Christ and of
   having been born again, unless through Divine Grace you shall hold fast
   to the end! Remember the back door to Hell! Remember the back door to
   Hell!

   There is a public entrance for the open sinner--but there is a back
   door for the professed saint. There is a back door for the hoary-headed
   professor who has lived many years in apparent sincerity but who has
   been a liar before God. There is a back door for the preacher who can
   talk fast and loudly, but who does not, in his own heart, know the
   Truth of God he is preaching. There is a back door to Hell for Church
   members who are amiable and excellent in many respects, but who have
   not really looked unto the Lord Jesus Christ and found true salvation
   in Him. God grant that this may wake some who otherwise would sleep
   themselves into perdition!

   Yet again, where the rush still continues green because it has mire and
   water enough on which to feed, another result happens, namely, that
   before long the sickle is used to cut it down. So must it be with you,
   Professor, if you shall keep up a green profession all your days. Yet
   if you are heartless, spongy, soft, yielding, unfruitful like the
   rush--you will be cut down and sorrowful will be the day when, with a
   blaze, you shall be consumed! Oh, to be cut down at the last! Death, I
   hope, Beloved, will be to many of you the season of your greatest joy!

   You will climb to Pisgah's top with weary footsteps, but when once
   there, the vision of the landscape will make amends for all the toil.
   The brooks, and hills, and valleys will flow with milk and honey! And
   your delighted eyes shall gaze upon your portion--your eternal
   heritage! But oh, how different will be our lot, if instead of this,
   "Tekel" shall be written upon us at the last because we are found
   wanting!

   "O my God! My God! Have You forsaken me? Am I, after all, mistaken?
   Have I played the hypocrite and must I take the mask off now? Have I
   covered over the cancer? Have I worn a golden cloth over my leprous
   forehead and must it be torn away? And must I stand the mockery of
   devils and the laughter of all worlds? What? Have I drunk of Your cup?
   Have I eaten with You in the streets and must I hear You say, 'I never
   knew you, depart from Me you worker of iniquity'? Oh, must it be?"

   Then how hard will be the bed on which I die! How stuffed with thorns
   that pillow! How tortured and anguished my poor broken heart, when
   every prop is knocked away and the house comes tumbling down about my
   ears! When every drop of comfort is dried up and even here the thirsty
   spirit lacks a drop of cordial to afford it comfort! O my dear Hearers,
   by the eternal God I do beseech you--seek a genuine religion! Do not
   put off self-examination! I dare not put it off on my own account and I
   pray you do not postpone it on yours. If I have not said a word to
   comfort and to cheer you this morning, forgive that lack of service,
   for my aim is to drive at this one thing--it will in the end be the
   best and most comforting to you all if you will set to work now and
   with diligence to try yourselves--whether you are in the faith.

   Cry to God to aid you in this! You cannot do it well yourself, for,
   "the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked, who
   can know it?" O Cry to Him--"Search me, O God and know my heart, try me
   and know my ways." Time is flying--set about the business before it is
   gone! Death is coming on--search yourselves before the darkness
   thickens into midnight gloom. The Judgment Day will soon arrive! The
   King will sit upon the Great White Throne. Oh, before He judges you,
   judge yourselves, that you be not judged!

   The division will soon take place between the goats and the sheep. O,
   seek to be under Christ, the heavenly Shepherd now, that you are not
   banished from His Presence at the last. What more can I say? It is not
   your body that is at stake--it is not your estates that are in
   jeopardy--your soul, your undying SOUL--destined to Heaven's glories or
   to Hell's miseries are now in question! Search yourselves, search
   yourselves and God Almighty search you, too!

   Ah, there are some of you who have no need to search. Without any trial
   you know yourselves to be on the wrong side. And there are others of
   you who, when you have searched, will still be afraid that you are
   wrong. Ah, well, whatever we are, or may have been, remember Jesus came
   into the world to seek and to save that which was lost. "This is a
   faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came
   into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief." Looking to that
   thorn-crowned head, those dear hands and feet nailed to the tree, that
   blessed heart all exposed by the soldier's spear--looking there,
   looking there only, looking there NOW--we find salvation!

   Believers, you have looked before. But if that is a matter of question,
   look now. "Look unto Me and be you saved, all you ends of the earth."
   Repeat that glance which gave you comfort. There is life still in a
   look at that Crucified One. There is life at this moment for you.
   Jesus! Your people look to You again! Lover of our souls! Accept us!
   Oh, you who never looked before, He reigns in Glory, mighty to save! He
   gives repentance and remission of sins!

   Only trust Him with your soul. Have done with all your works, your
   willings, your prayers, your tears, your everything as a ground of
   confidence, and trust in HIM who died for sinners and you "shall never
   perish, neither shall any pluck you out of His hands." The Lord grant
   we may be found right at last for Jesus' sake! Amen.

                               Jesus The Shepherd

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 1, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He shall feed His flock like a shepherd." Isaiah 40:11.

   OUR Lord Jesus is very frequently described as the Shepherd of His
   people. The figure is inexhaustible, but it has been so often handled
   that I suppose it would be difficult to say anything fresh upon it. We
   all know and are very glad and comforted in the knowledge that the Lord
   Jesus Christ, as our Shepherd, exercises towards us all the kind and
   necessary offices which a shepherd performs towards his sheep. With
   gentle sway He rules us for our good--"Let us worship and bow down; let
   us kneel before the Lord our Maker; for He is our God and we are the
   people of His pasture and the sheep of His hand."

   He guides us--"And when He puts forth His own sheep He goes before them
   and the sheep follow Him, for they know His voice." He provides for
   us--"The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me to lie down
   in green pastures: He leads me beside the still waters." He protects us
   from all forms of evil. Therefore, "though we walk through the valley
   of the shadow of death, we will fear no evil, for He is with us: His
   rod and His staff, they comfort us." If we wander, He seeks us out and
   brings us back. "He restores my soul; He leads me in the paths of
   righteousness for His name's sake."

   If we are broken, He binds us up. If we are wounded, He heals according
   to His own Word, "I will bind up that which was broken and will
   strengthen that which was sick." The sheep is an animal of many
   diseases and many needs and so the Christian is an individual of many
   sins and many infirmities. But as the shepherd endeavors to meet all
   the needs of his flock, so our Lord Jesus succors all the blood-bought
   company in all their needs. We propose to illustrate the great doctrine
   of the text in a Scriptural, and therefore we hope in an interesting,
   manner. First, we shall consider in connection with the text, Old
   Testament illustrations. In the second place, New Testament
   descriptions. And, in the third place, impressive applications.

   I. We commence with OLD TESTAMENT ILLUSTRATIONS of the manner in which
   the Lord Jesus Christ discharges the office of feeding His flock like a
   shepherd. Out of five great types we begin with Abel, the shepherd
   slain. The second man who was born into the world was a shepherd and
   was, in many respects, typical of our Good Shepherd. "Abel was a keeper
   of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground." Abel was a type of the
   Savior in that, being a shepherd, he sanctified his work to the glory
   of God and he offered sacrifice of blood upon the altar of the Lord.
   The Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering.

   This early type of our Lord is not very full and comprehensive, but it
   is exceedingly clear and distinct. Like the first streak of light which
   tinges the east at sunrise, it does not reveal everything--but it
   clearly manifests the great fact that the sun is coming. Abel is
   nothing like so complete and perfect a portrait of our own Lord Jesus
   as other shepherds of whom we have to speak--but as we see him standing
   as a shepherd and yet a sacrificing priest offering upon the altar a
   sacrifice of sweet smell unto God--we discern there, at once, the
   picture of our Lord, who brings before His Father a sacrifice of
   precious blood, to which Jehovah ever has respect.

   Abel, the sacrificing shepherd, was hated by his brother--hated without
   a cause. And even so was the Savior--the spirit of this world, the
   natural and carnal man--hated the better Man, the accepted Man in whom
   the Spirit of Grace was found. And the man of the world rested not
   until His blood had been shed. Abel fell and sprinkled his own altar
   and his sacrifice with his own blood. And he must be blind, indeed who
   cannot behold the Lord Jesus slain by the enmity of man while serving
   as a priest before the Lord.

   Abel is the type of Jesus the slain shepherd. Let us attentively
   consider him. We have been reading in the tenth chapter of John, this
   morning, that the Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep--let
   us weep over Him as we view

   Him stretched upon the ground by the hatred of mankind at the foot of
   His own altar of sacrifice, pouring out His blood. We read of Abel's
   blood, in the New Testament, that it speaks. "He being dead yet
   speaks." "The Lord said unto Cain, The voice of your brother's blood
   cries unto Me from the ground."

   Herein we have a blessed type of the Lord--His blood had a mighty
   tongue and the import of its prevailing cry is not vengeance but
   mercy--

   "The rich blood of Jesus slain Speaks peace as loud from every vein.'"
   It is precious beyond all preciousness to stand at Jesus Christ's altar
   and to see Him, Himself, offered there as a whole burnt-offering
   acceptable unto God! To see Him lying bleeding there as the slaughtered
   Priest and then to hear the voice of His blood speaking peace in our
   consciences, peace in the Church of God, peace between Jew and Gentile,
   peace between man and his offended Maker--speaking peace all down the
   ages of eternity for blood-washed man! Abel is first in order of time
   and Jesus first in order of excellence.

   The earth opened her mouth to receive Abel's blood and Jesus' sacrifice
   has blessed this poor, sin-ruined world. Abel received Divine witness
   to his righteousness and Jesus obtained the same in the day of His
   Resurrection--but fullness of other matters forbid us to linger.

   Further down the page of sacred history we find another shepherd. He is
   a more instructive type of the Savior, perhaps, than the first. But in
   Abel we discover a Truth of God which is absent in all the others. Abel
   is the only one of the typical shepherds who dies at the foot of the
   altar. He is the only sacrificing shepherd. And here you see Jesus
   Christ in the very earliest ages set forth to mankind as the
   slaughtered Victim--that whatever else the early saints might not
   see--yet they might know that the Seed of the woman would shed His
   precious blood. This most vital Truth is not withheld even for a little
   season.

   Now we turn to Jacob, the toiling shepherd. Here is a type of the Good
   Shepherd not as dying, but as keeping sheep with a view to get unto
   Himself a spouse and a flock. Jacob left his father's house. He
   departed from all the joy and comfort of the house in which he was the
   recognized heir both by his own purchase and his Father's promise. Our
   Lord Jesus Christ, out of the love which He bore us, left His Father's
   house above and came down to tabernacle among men. Jacob repaired to
   his mother's brethren.

   And even so our Lord, on the mother's side, counts men His brethren.
   "He came unto His own." That vision which Jacob saw the first night
   after he had left his father's house seems to me to be a representation
   of the great object which our Lord had set before Him as the intent of
   His mission here below. Jacob slept and dreamed that he saw a ladder,
   the foot of which stood upon the earth, while the top reached to
   Heaven, from where a Covenant God spoke to His chosen servant.

   And so, before the Savior's eyes, as the great reward of all His life's
   travail, He saw a ladder set up by which earth should be connected with
   Heaven. He saw fallen man at the foot of it, but He beheld a Covenant
   God at the top while the angels of God ascending and descending upon
   His own Person, as upon the Divine road of communication by which
   prayer mounts and mercy descends. As soon as Jacob arrived at the house
   of his mother's brethren, he began to work out of the love he bore to
   Rachel.

   And Jesus Christ no sooner descended upon this lower earth than He
   began at once to labor to win His spouse. Now there were in the house
   of manhood two daughters to both of whom Jesus must be affianced. There
   was first of all the Jewish Church, which was in His eyes His
   Rachel--His dearly beloved--and He toiled for her. But in the days of
   His flesh His own received Him not. Though while He was here below He
   declared that He was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of
   Israel, yet Israel was not gathered. But Jesus did not lose His reward,
   for the Gentile Church, the tender-eyed Leah, was His reward.

   "Though Israel is not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of
   the Lord and My God shall be My strength. And He said, It is a light
   thing that You should be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and
   to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give You for a Light to
   the Gentiles, that You may be My salvation unto the end of the earth."
   Leah, the Gentile Church, is far more fruitful unto Christ in spiritual
   children than the Rachel for whom He served in the days of His flesh!

   But the day comes when Rachel shall be more fully increased--when the
   fullness of the Gentiles having been gathered in--the Jew shall
   recognize Messiah and the Jewish people shall acknowledge their King.
   We understand from Jacob's own description of his toil that his labor,
   in order to get to himself his spouse, was of the most arduous
   character. And it will be well for the intelligent Christian to see
   Jesus Christ in just such toil--seeking to redeem unto Himself His own
   beloved--that they might forever be one with Himself in His own Glory.

   In the thirty-first chapter of Genesis, at the thirty-eighth verse,
   Jacob, while expostulating with Laban, thus describes his own
   toil--"These twenty years have I been with you; your ewes and your
   female goats have not miscarried their young and I have not eaten the
   rams of your flock. That which was torn by beasts I did not bring to
   you; I bore the loss of it. You did require it from my hand, whether
   stolen by day, or stolen by night. There I was! In the day the drought
   consumed me and the frost by night, and my sleep departed from my eyes.
   Thus I have been in your house twenty years. I served you fourteen
   years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you have
   changed my wages ten times."

   Even more toilsome than this was the life of our Savior here below. He
   watched over all His sheep till He could give as His last account, "Of
   all those whom You have given Me I have lost none but the son of
   perdition, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled." His hair was wet
   with dew and His locks with the drops of the night. Sleep departed from
   His eyes, for all night He was in prayer wrestling with God. One night
   it is Peter who must be pleaded for. Another time another claims His
   tearful intercession. No shepherd sitting beneath the cold skies,
   looking up to the stars, could ever utter such complaints because of
   the hardness of his toil as Jesus Christ might have uttered, if He had
   chosen to do so, because of the sternness of His service in order to
   gather unto Himself His people--

   "Cold mountains and the midnight air, Witnessed the fervor of His
   prayer. The desert His temptation knew, His conflict and His victory,
   too."

   It is sweet to dwell upon the spiritual parallel of Laban having
   required all the sheep at Jacob's hand. If they were torn of beasts he
   must make it good. If any of them died, he must stand as surety for the
   whole. And did not the Savior stand just so while He was here below?
   Was not His toil for His Church just the toil of one who felt that he
   was under suretyship obligations to bring every one of them safe to the
   hand of him who had committed them to his charge? Look upon toiling
   Jacob and you see a representation of Him of whom the text says, "He
   shall feed His flock like a shepherd."

   One other point of resemblance there is here, namely, that when Jacob
   had thus purchased to himself his spouse and had received a reward for
   all his toil out of the flock which he himself tended, he then
   conducted both his family and his flock away from Laban. This is a
   point never to be forgotten! Shouldering His Cross, Jesus went outside
   the camp! And in so doing He speaks to each of us! "Let us, therefore,
   go forth outside the camp, bearing His reproach."

   He went to His mother's brethren that He might fetch out His chosen
   from among men and His voice to His spouse is, "Hearken, O daughter and
   consider: forget also your own people and your father's house. So shall
   the King greatly desire your beauty: for He is your Lord. And worship
   you Him." Jacob coming back from Laban to the Promised Land is a true
   picture of Jesus Christ coming up from the world, followed by His
   Church, to enter upon that better Canaan which has been given to us by
   a covenant of salt forever.

   The toiling shepherd never ceased his work till he had bid farewell to
   Laban once and for all and had come to dwell in tents where Abraham and
   Isaac had dwelt before him. And Christ's work is not accomplished in us
   till He has made us, like Himself, holy, harmless, undefiled and
   separate from sinners! Although these types are very full, I choose
   rather to give them to you as suggestions to think out for yourselves
   than to enlarge upon them myself.

   Joseph is a type of Jesus, reigning in the Egypt of this world for the
   good of his own people, while they are here below. Remember Joseph's
   history. We find that he kept his father's flock with his brethren. So
   did our Savior when He began to teach and to preach. In the midst of
   the envious Scribes and Pharisees He kept His Father's flock. They
   could not, however, tolerate Him in whom they discerned a royalty not
   in themselves. As Joseph wore a coat of many colors, indicative of
   princely rank and of his father's love, even so, Jesus Christ, in the
   perfections of His Nature, being something more than ordinary man, was
   soon spied out by envious shepherds as anointed with the oil of
   gladness above His fellows.

   Then they began to find fault with Joseph's words. He had seen a dream
   in which the sun and moon and the eleven stars were made obeisance unto
   him. And as the envious Scribes and Pharisees listened to the word of
   the Savior and heard Him claim that He was the Son of God, and that He
   came down from Heaven, they thought that He dreamed. They charged Him
   with blasphemy and straightway their hearts were set against Him and
   they were determined upon His destruction. They sold Him for thirty
   pieces of silver, the price of a slave.

   So our Joseph was sold into Egypt to the powers of evil. There He was
   falsely accused, though in Him was no sin. Our Joseph, our blessed
   Shepherd, was cast into the prison of the grave and there He abode for
   awhile, but by-and-by He came out of prison and Joseph/Jesus--it
   matters not which word I use--Joseph was made ruler over all the land
   of Egypt. That same Shepherd of ours who was sold by His envious
   brethren and who went down into the prison-tomb, is now exalted high
   above all principalities and powers and every name that is named!

   And even here, in this Egypt, where His people now dwell, Jesus Christ
   is King. Not a dog dare move his tongue in all the land of Egypt
   without the permission of Joseph and surely no enemy can forge a weapon
   against Christ's Church here on earth--

   "He overrules all mortal things, And manages our mean affairs."

   The Father has committed all power unto His Son. Jesus Christ is King
   over Egypt's realm. Now observe the likeness between Joseph and Jesus
   in this respect. Joseph was of very singular advantage to the
   Egyptians. They would have starved in the years of famine if his
   prescient eye had not foreseen the famine and stored up the plenty of
   the seven previous years.

   And Jesus Christ is of great service even to this wicked world. It is
   by Him that it is preserved. The barren fig tree was spared because the
   farmer pleaded for it and the intercession of Jesus Christ spares the
   lives of the unregenerate. And though they will be swept away with the
   broom of destruction when their iniquity is fully ripe, yet meanwhile
   they are spared because of the mediatorial sovereignty of the great
   Shepherd. Jesus Christ, like Joseph, rules over the land of Egypt--but
   Joseph ruled for a special purpose. God had sent Joseph to Egypt, but
   not mainly for the sake of the Egyptians. "God has sent me here to save
   your souls alive." This was Joseph's own testimony.

   Jesus Christ now has power over all flesh--why? "That He should give
   eternal life to as many as You have given Him." The universal reign of
   Christ, in which respect His redemption comes to all the sons of men,
   has for its object that special redemption in which respect it comes
   only to His own people who are His sheep. Perhaps some of you may
   wonder how I venture to call Joseph a shepherd. You grant me that in
   his early days he kept his father's flock, but was he a shepherd while
   he was in Egypt?

   You will believe the dying words of his father Jacob, will you not? His
   father Jacob, when speaking of him said, "Joseph is a fruitful bough,
   even a fruitful bough by a well, whose branches run over the wall. The
   archers have sorely grieved him and shot at him and hated him. But his
   bow abode in strength and the arms of his hands were made strong by the
   hands of the mighty God of Jacob." Then there comes a sentence between
   brackets--"for there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel." Joseph is
   here called the Shepherd and the Stone. I could not make out, in
   meditation, why he should be both a shepherd and a stone, but you
   remember that Jesus Christ was at once the Shepherd and the Stone which
   the builders refused, which afterwards became the headstone of the
   corner.

   And so Joseph, in being a shepherd of his people, and in having been
   the cornerstone of the Israelites while they were in Egypt, was both
   the Shepherd and the Stone of Israel. Beloved, it seems to me to be
   such a delightful thought to think that Jesus Christ is King today in
   the world. The Lord reigns--let the earth rejoice! Jesus Christ wears
   the crown of universal monarchy this day! "The Lord said unto my lord,
   sit You on My right hand until Your enemies are made Your footstool,"
   so that nothing happens now, but that which Jesus permits, ordains and
   overrules. Let empires go to pieces--it is Christ who breaks them with
   a rod of iron and shivers them like potters' vessels!

   Let conflagrations burn down cities and let diseases devastate nations!
   Let war succeed war and pestilence famine-- yet still our Joseph rules
   all things well and we know that all things work together for good to
   them that love God, that are called according to His purpose. The
   saints are in the world, but Christ reigns over the world for His
   Church, that it may be kept and preserved in the midst of an evil
   generation.

   You remember that remarkable saying, "Now every shepherd is an
   abomination unto the Egyptians"--a strange thing and yet Egypt found
   their shelter in the shepherds! Now every Christian is an abomination
   to the world, and yet it is in this world that at the present time we
   dwell in so much temporal comfort, under such excellent government,
   with so little disturbance. To what can we attribute it to but this,
   that Jesus sits upon the Throne and rules Egypt for the good of Israel!
   And the world is made subservient to the blessedness of the Church of
   God! I must not tarry any longer, though it is a very tempting theme,
   but I want to take you on to the next shepherd.

   Jesus Christ will be represented to you in quite a different character
   under the next illustration. Moses was not a ruler in Egypt, but quite
   a distinct character. Moses, when he kept sheep, kept them in the
   wilderness, far away from all other flocks. And when he became a
   shepherd over God's people Israel, his business was not to preserve
   them in Egypt, but to conduct them out of it.

   Here, then, is a representation of Jesus Christ as the Shepherd of a
   separated people, called from among men and made to be a distinguished
   nation, not numbered among the people. Jesus, like Moses, might have
   been a king. The devil said to Him, "All these things will I give You
   if You will fall down and worship me." The people would have taken Him,
   we read, and made Him a king, for He was naturally of royal race, but
   He refused. As Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's
   daughter, so Jesus Christ said, "Get you behind Me, Satan," to all the
   pomp and glory of this present world and preferred to take part with
   His poor, despised people who were crushed down by the reigning powers
   in the Egypt of His days.

   Moses began his mission, you remember, by going to Pharaoh and saying,
   "Thus says the Lord, Let My people go, that they may serve Me." Jesus
   Christ begins as the Shepherd of the separate ones by demanding that
   they should be let go from the bondage of their natural estate. With a
   high hand and with an outstretched arm Moses fetches out his people
   from among the Egyptians. He works plagues and marvels, but he brings
   them all out. "Not a hoof shall be left behind." Not one child of God,
   not one sheep of His pasture shall be left in the Egypt of sin and
   death. They shall all be made to go outside the camp--leaving even
   Goshen to go into a wilderness because they must be alone with God and
   they cannot worship Him in a land full of idols.

   I might dwell for a long time on all the transactions of Moses in Egypt
   and especially upon the paschal supper, all of which was doubtless
   typical of Him of whom the text says, "He shall feed His flock like a
   shepherd." Our main point is the great exodus of Moses, who at the head
   of all the tribes goes forth to Succoth. There they pitch their tents.
   By-and-by they advance to Pi-hahiroth with the Red Sea before them.
   With Moses' staff to lead the van they pass through the sea dry shod
   and come absolutely into the wilderness of separation, as, Beloved,
   every heir of Heaven is brought right out of Egypt, led through the Red
   Sea of Jesus Christ's blood, baptized into Jesus and brought out into
   the separated position in the wilderness.

   Now it is easy to see how Moses was a shepherd to the people while in
   the wilderness. He led them in all their wanderings. He was King in
   Jeshurun over the people whom God had given to him. When they needed
   food, his prayer brought down the manna or the quail. When they needed
   water, it was his voice that made the rock burst forth with floods, or
   his rod that smote and lo, the flinty rock gushed with torrents! If
   there were Amalekites to fight, the uplifted arm of Moses did more than
   the sharp sword of Joshua. They sometimes received chastisement from
   him. He ground the golden calf to pieces and threw the powder on water
   and made them drink it.

   They were equally dependent upon him for comfort, too. His speech
   distilled as the dew and dropped as the rain, the small rain upon the
   tender herbs. Moses, like a shepherd, had to carry all the people in
   his bosom as God's appointed Messenger and often did he find it a very
   weary load, so that he said, "I cannot bear the burden of this great
   people alone." You have here a suggestive type of Jesus Christ, the
   leader of the separated Church. Brethren, I think we may, all of us,
   not only catch the idea but live it out--the Church is in the desert
   now. We have left the world, we have left its maxims, its customs, its
   religion.

   We hate the world's religion as mach as we do its irreligion. We have
   forsaken it for good, never to go back again. And though the flesh
   sometimes falls to lusting and would desire go back to the old bondage,
   yet, under the guidance of our Great Shepherd who leads His people far
   away from Mizraim's polluted shore, we march onward by devious ways to
   the promised rest.

   The last type I mean to give you is David. This shepherd represents
   Jesus Christ, not at all as the others, but as King in the midst of His
   Church. David, like Jesus Christ, begins his life with trials. He is
   anointed and straightway he begins to suffer. The world's king
   recognizes him, fixes his eyes upon him, hurls the javelin at him,
   hunts him like a partridge on the mountains and rests not till he
   himself is slain. Poor David is the apt picture of Jesus Christ in the
   days of His flesh-- hunted by the world's king who would desire to put
   Him down and crush out His spark. David, at last, mounts to his throne.
   Quietly and in peace he sits in Jerusalem as king over Israel and
   Judah.

   And even at this day, though the kings of the earth set themselves
   against Him and their rulers take counsel together, yet this is the
   decree concerning our Lord: "Yet have I set My King upon My holy hill
   of Zion." That same Shepherd who of old snatched the lamb out of the
   jaw of the lion and delivered His sheep from the paw of the bear--that
   same Shepherd who, in pangs of death, took the lion of Hell by the
   beard and slew him--that same Shepherd sits as King in the Jerusalem
   above and all His saints delight to do Him homage!

   All hail You, Son of David! Reign forever! Hosanna unto You! Your
   enemies cannot dispossess You! You have smitten them terribly and they
   shall yet feel the terror of Your arm. The Shepherd reigns, Jesus
   Christ is King of God's Church and one of these days the reign of David
   will blossom into the reign of Solomon. We shall see Jesus Christ under
   a yet more glorious type, for He shall reign from the river even unto
   the ends of the earth. There shall be no war with the Ammonites, no war
   anywhere!

   All enemies shall have been put beneath His feet and the kings of the
   nations shall bow before Him and they that dwell in the wilderness
   shall lick the dust. May that millennial splendor soon dawn, when the
   Son of David shall be King forever and ever as the great Shepherd,
   reigning over all lands. Think these five illustrations over, and there
   will be much instruction here concerning Him who feeds His flock like a
   shepherd.

   II. Now let the Christian who is not weary follow me in three NEW
   TESTAMENT DESCRIPTIONS. Jesus Christ the Shepherd, is described in the
   New Testament, as I dare say you all remember, in three ways. He is
   first of all spoken of as the Good Shepherd. Next, as the Great
   Shepherd, and thirdly, as the Chief Shepherd. I do not know that any
   other adjective is appended to His name of Shepherd.

   First, turn to the tenth of John, there you find Him described as the
   Good Shepherd. "The Good Shepherd gives His life for the sheep."
   Goodness is the special excellence which seems to gleam in the
   Character of our Lord in His earthly life and in His passion for the
   sons of men. As I look upon my Lord and Master here, despised and
   rejected of men, I know He is the Great Shepherd. But His greatness
   does not strike me because His flock is so few. We read in the Acts
   that, "the number of the names together were about one hundred and
   twenty."

   "Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but I, the Son
   of Man, have not where to lay My head." Herein is goodness, but the
   greatness is concealed. When He saw the multitude He had compassion
   upon them, for they were as sheep having no shepherd. Here is the Good
   Shepherd--He healed their sicknesses and wept over their sins. Here is
   goodness, indeed. When it was time for Him to die, He crossed the brook
   Kidron and suffered till He sweat great drops in the garden. He went to
   trial and condemnation and then to the mount of doom to suffer, bleed
   and die. Here is the Good Shepherd--the Good Shepherd bleeding for the
   sheep.

   Can you tell me how good a Shepherd Jesus was? Can you measure the
   height and depth of the extraordinary goodness that dwelt in Him? So
   good that He saved others, Himself He could not save. So good that when
   He rendered in His account, He could say, "I have lost none." He had
   kept them all safely, though He Himself had bowed His head and given up
   the ghost. You will find in Hebrews 13:20, that He is called the Great
   Shepherd. Does that refer to his life on earth and to His death? Not at
   all! Kindly observe the connection. "Now the God of peace which brought
   again from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ, that Great Shepherd of the
   sheep, through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant, make you perfect
   in every good work to do His will."

   Do you understand? He is not the Great Shepherd when He dies--He is the
   Good Shepherd. But He is the Great Shepherd when He is brought again
   from the dead. In the Resurrection you perceive His greatness! He lies
   in the grave slumbering. He is the Good Shepherd then, having laid down
   His life for the sheep. Life appears again in Him--the stone is rolled
   away, the watchmen are seized with terror and He stands out the Risen
   One--no more dying! Now He is the Great Shepherd!

   He manifests Himself for forty days among His own disciples and then,
   at last, taking them to the hill of Galilee a cloud receives Him out of
   their sight and up He mounts as the Great Shepherd. When he has told
   them to go to Jerusalem, they sit waiting till the time of the fullness
   is come and suddenly there is heard the sound of a rushing mighty wind
   and fiery tongues sit upon all of them. Who has given this gift to
   each? Who is it? This is the Great Shepherd! He has ascended on high
   and has received gifts for men.

   The Shepherd, still, you see, but now he is the GREAT Shepherd, the
   Shepherd riding in triumphal state through the midst of New Jerusalem,
   amidst the acclamations of angels and sending to His sheep down below
   the precious gift of Apostles and ministers of various orders,
   according to His own will. He was the Good Shepherd before--He is the
   Good Shepherd now--but He is also pre-eminently the Great Shepherd. Let
   us delight to think of this greatness of our Lord Jesus Christ! Let us
   extol and bless Him!

   Observe, carefully, that while the Good Shepherd lays down His life
   that you may have life and have it more abundantly, He is the Great
   Shepherd for another purpose. What does it say? "Make you perfect in
   every good work to do His will." Yes, He dies to wash away your sins,
   but He rises for your justification and your complete sanctification,
   that as the Lord left His grave clothes behind Him, you may leave your
   sins behind you! And as He left the tomb behind Him, never to reenter
   it, you may leave the old dead world in which you once lived and live
   in newness of life!

   We have a third text remaining--the first Epistle of Peter, fifth
   chapter and fourth verse. Here you have the Savior called the Chief
   Shepherd. When is this? In Peter He is not the Good Shepherd--He is not
   the Great Shepherd--He is all that, but He is a great deal more--He is
   the CHIEF Shepherd. When will He wear this title? Do you notice,
   Beloved, this one thing? Let me have your hearts here. While He is the
   Good Shepherd He is all alone--no other mentioned. While He is the
   Great Shepherd He is still alone and only a bare hint of others.

   But when He is the Chief Shepherd, it is implied that there are others
   among whom He is chief. Notice, then, that in the Atonement Jesus is
   alone--there is no one with the good Shepherd. In the Resurrection for
   our justification He is alone--no one aids the Great Shepherd. But at
   the Second Advent He will be with His people, Chief among many. Read
   the verse--"And when the Chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive
   a crown of glory that fades not away." So you see Christ is the Chief
   Shepherd at the Second Advent.

   Then shall the world be astonished to find that though alone in
   Atonement and alone in Justification, He is not alone in service or in
   Glory. Then every minister who has fed His sheep, every teacher who has
   fed His lambs--all of you, holy men and women who have in any way
   whatever contributed under Him towards the guidance and the government
   and the feeding and the protection of His dear, blood-bought flock--you
   shall appear! He has no crown, you perceive, as the Good Shepherd. We
   do not read of a crown for Him as the Great Shepherd. But when He comes
   with the crown with which His mother crowned Him, then shall you also
   appear with Him in Glory, having the crown of life that fades not away.

   I do not know whether this peculiar circumstance interests you, but it
   did me when I observed it--Good in His dying, Great in His rising,
   Chief in His coming! It seems to me to gather such force--Good to me as
   a sinner--Great to me as a saint--Chief to me as one with Him in His
   glorious reign! I pass, as it were, through three stages--a
   sinner--then I look to the Good Shepherd laying down His life for the
   sheep. I reach higher ground and I am a saint--I look to the Great
   Shepherd to make me perfect in every good work to do His will. I mount
   higher still--I die, I rise again, I walk in resurrection life-- and
   now I look to the Chief Shepherd and hope to receive at His hands the
   crown of life which He shall give to me and not to me only, but unto
   all them that love His appearing--the Good, Great, Chief Shepherd!

   May God give us Grace, meditating upon these things, to know them and
   enter into them.

   III. In conclusion I promised one or two IMPRESSIVE APPLICATIONS. The
   first application is one of comfort and satisfaction to you who are
   poor, needy, weary and troubled lambs or sheep of the flock. Our own
   text runs thus, "He shall feed His flock like a shepherd." What next?
   "He shall gather the lambs with His arms and carry them in His bosom
   and shall gently lead those that are with young."

   The lambs have not the value of mature sheep, yet they are the most
   thought of under the Good Shepherd. They might fetch the least price in
   the market, but they have the greatest portion of His heart. You needy,
   troubled ones, I want you to look here and note down in your memories
   that though there are promises for all saints, there are special
   promises for you. Jesus Christ will take care that the lambs and those
   who are with young shall be specially housed.

   Notice this in Jacob, whom I introduced to you as the toiling
   shepherd--when he met with Esau, Esau wanted him to accept a guard to
   go with him. But Jacob said, "My lord knows that the children are
   tender and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men
   should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die."

   Jesus, the Good Shepherd, will not travel at such a rate as to
   overdrive the lambs. He has tender consideration for the poor and
   needy. Kings usually look to the interests of the great and the rich,
   but in the kingdom of our Good Shepherd, He cares most for the poor.
   "He shall judge the poor of the people." The weaklings and the sickly
   of the flock are the special objects of the Savior's care. A proof of
   this you find at the thirty-fourth chapter of Ezekiel, sixteenth verse,
   "I will seek that which was lost and bring again that which was driven
   away. And I will bind up that which was broken and I will strengthen
   that which was sick."

   Inexpressibly comforting words to the broken, sick, needy, Christian!
   You think, dear Heart, that you are forgotten because of your
   nothingness and weakness and poverty? This is the very reason why you
   are remembered! There is a mother here this morning--she has seven
   children. I know what child she has been thinking of while we have been
   preaching. She has not been thinking of John, who is married and away,
   nor of Mary who is in health, nor of Thomas who is sitting by her side.
   She has been thinking of the poor little one at home in bed and she has
   wondered whether it has had any sleep this morning and whether it has
   been well taken care of. You know that my guess is correct.

   Now Jesus Christ, our loving Shepherd, if He should forget those of us
   who are strong and in sound health, will be sure to recollect the
   sickly ones! He shall feed His flock like a shepherd. He shall gather
   the lambs with His arms and carry them in His bosom. He shall gently
   lead those that are with young.

   A second application containing comfort and warning, too. Sinner, to
   you our Lord Jesus Christ now represents Himself as being a Shepherd
   who is come to seek and to save that which was lost. Here are his own
   words--"What man of you having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of
   them, does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after
   that which is lost, until he find it? And when he has found it, he lays
   it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And calls together his friends and his
   neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me for I have found the sheep which was
   lost."

   Such is Jesus now, looking after stray sheep. Where are you? Where are
   you this morning? The Great Shepherd comes after you, and oh, what joy
   will be in His heart--what joy there will be in Heaven when the Great
   Shepherd shall throw you on His shoulders and bring you home! But hark!
   Did you ever notice that the same Shepherd who saves the lost will
   curse the finally impenitent? He shall separate them, one from another,
   as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats. And He shall set the
   sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left.

   Then shall He say unto them on the left hand, "Depart you cursed!" What
   lips are those which pronounce those dreadful words? The Shepherd's
   lips! The lips of that same Shepherd who flies over the mountains to
   the lost sheep--of whom, I trust, it will yet be said, "We were as
   sheep going astray, but we have now returned unto the Shepherd and
   Bishop of our souls." That same Seeker of the lost and Gatherer
   together of them that are scattered, will say, Depart you cursed, into
   everlasting fire in Hell prepared for the devil and his angels.

   Oh, Sinner, may you know the Shepherd as binding up your broken bones
   and healing your wounds and rejoicing over your saved soul! For if you
   do not, you will have to know Him in another and more terrible
   Character, when He shall curse you, separating you from His own sheep
   as the Shepherd divides the sheep from the goats! So we shall conclude
   with these words, which may be for both saint and sinner. Let it never
   be forgotten, that in all we have said about Jesus Christ, still, as a
   Shepherd, He is pre-eminently to be preached as the Suffering One.

   I began with Abel and I must conclude with Abel. Zechariah has recorded
   these remarkable words of Jehovah, "Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd
   and against the Man that is My Fellow, says the Lord. Smite the
   Shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered." O Sinner, you have most of
   all to do today with the Abel-shepherd--with the Shepherd dead at the
   altar! With the Shepherd with His blood crying up to Heaven, with the
   sword of Jehovah in His heart! You shall know about the
   toiling-shepherd by-and-by.

   The Shepherd reigning in Egypt, the Joseph you shall know soon. The
   Shepherd of the separated flock you shall follow before long. The
   Shepherd reigning in Jerusalem, the David you shall rejoice to serve!
   But now you have to do with the Shepherd bleeding and dying! Hark to
   these words and I have done--"All we, like sheep, have gone astray. We
   have turned, everyone, to his own way and the Lord has laid on Him the
   iniquity of us all." In this is Jesus to be seen--suffering, bleeding,
   dy-ing--on yonder accursed tree!

   He is there, the Shepherd to whom if we look we shall live and live
   forever! God enable you to turn those poor eyes of yours which have
   been red with weeping over sin, or red with the drunkenness of
   wickedness and see in Jesus Christ your iniquity put away, Jehovah
   reconciled, and your souls eternally saved. Amen.

                              A Blow For Puseyism

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 8, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "It is the spirit that quickens. The flesh profits nothing: the words
   that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life." John 6:63.

   OUR Lord had plainly told His hearers that He was the Bread of Life.
   And that except they ate His flesh and drank His blood there was no
   life in them. His hearers understood this in a sensual manner and they
   very naturally put the question, "How can this Man give us His flesh to
   eat?" Now the Savior had never intended to be understood in a carnal
   manner. It was far enough from His design to inculcate the carnal
   eating of His body and therefore He at once told them that His words
   were not understood.

   And He delivered Himself of a great general principle, as truly
   applicable to our day as to His own. In effect He taught them just
   this--"It is not the eating My flesh in a carnal way, even if you could
   do it, which would be of any service to you. For that would be only
   feeding the flesh, which profits nothing. A spiritual feeding can alone
   quicken and bless you. It is this which you cannot understand. And
   therefore you hear My words as if they were as dead and fleshly as
   yourselves, whereas My teaching bears no gross and sensuous meaning,
   for the words which I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are
   life."

   If I am not mistaken, this verse contains a great principle which
   needs, in these days, to be proclaimed on the housetops. It is the
   medicine which would cure the diseases of this present time if men were
   divinely led to receive it. The text is very deep--like all the
   teaching of our Savior recorded by John, the words are extremely
   simple--but the mystery is most profound. May the Holy Spirit lead us
   all not only to comprehend its teaching, but to feel its power.

   What is meant by "the flesh" here? The word "flesh" in Scripture has
   eleven or twelve different modifications of its one abiding meaning. In
   this passage it means that which is outward and sensuous and appeals to
   the eye, or the ear, or to other powers of man's bodily nature. There
   was much of this in the Jewish faith--but whenever the worshippers
   rested in it and did not reach to its spiritual teaching--it profited
   them nothing. Paul uses the same term when, speaking to the Judaizing
   Galatians, he asks them, "Having begun in the Spirit, are you now made
   perfect by the flesh?"

   Which we understand to mean, having begun by God's Holy Spirit with a
   spiritual love to God, a spiritual faith in Jesus and a spiritual life
   within, do you mean, now, to be made perfect by external ordinances,
   resting and abiding in them as though they had a power to bless?
   External ceremonial religion is well and aptly set forth here as
   "flesh." What is the meaning of the term "spirit" here? If the Holy
   Spirit had been intended, in the judgment of our translators, they
   would have placed a capital S. It cannot, however, refer to the Holy
   Spirit because the explanatory key sentence is this-- "The words which
   I speak unto you, they are spirit."

   Now, as we all know, words cannot be the Holy Spirit. The word "spirit"
   stands here in contrast with the term "flesh." Flesh is external
   religion, the carnal part of it--that which the eye sees and the ear
   hears. Spirit is the inward part of religion--that which the soul
   understands, receives, believes and feeds upon. It is this--this
   spiritual element in religion which quickens it and makes it a living
   thing--while the mere external, the flesh, except as the Spirit
   quickens it, profits nothing.

   This spiritual religion is consistent with the spiritual nature which
   God the Holy Spirit gives to us. And as Christ's teachings are
   themselves living and spiritual, they are the proper food of spiritual
   men. The Jews commonly thought that religion lay in ceremonial
   observances--in eating certain meats or abstinence from them--in
   washings of the hands before eating. In various baptisms, in going up
   to the temple to pray, and such like outward performances. Jesus tells
   them to their faces that this flesh religion profits nothing--it is
   dead, unquickened and unquickening!

   What, then, is the life of godliness? What is the vitality and essence
   of acceptable worship? His answer, virtually, is, "It is not your
   outward observances, but your inward emotions, desires, beliefs and
   adoration which are living worship." Then He adds, in effect, "My words
   are not concerning outward observances, but are of a spiritual
   character. I come not to you with 'touch not, taste not, handle not,'
   or with 'wash, vow, stand, sit, kneel'--My words deal with inner life
   and spirit and are addressed to your spiritual natures. The words which
   I speak unto you are spirit and life."

   I. Our first point will be THE UNPROFITABLE FLESH--the external
   observances of religion are, in themselves, utterly unprofitable. To
   begin with the greatest monstrosity of this kind in the present
   day--the real and corporeal Presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in what
   is superstitiously called the Blessed Sacrament! I would scarcely
   mention this if it were a doctrine merely of the Church of Rome. But
   when I read the newspapers and other productions of the High Church
   party, I find that transubstantiation with all its fullness of
   absurdity is extensively preached and believed in the Church of
   England!

   And there are hundreds of clergy who speak of the Lord's Table as an
   "altar" and of the Supper as the celebration of a "sacrifice," while
   the symbols are spoken of as though they were to be reverenced even as
   the Lord Himself! It is laid down as a doctrine, that every time the
   bread is broken by these priests, the very body of Jesus Christ is
   actually received by the persons participating! That this is
   monstrously absurd, I think every intelligent person knows! But it has
   been said that the more absurd it is, the more room there is for faith!
   And now some have even been thankful for having its absurdity proven,
   "For," they have argued, "it will be the more meritorious for us to
   believe it."

   To such persons we would briefly say, if Jesus Christ's body is really
   received into your mouth, broken with your teeth and made to enter into
   your stomach, then, in the first place, you are guilty of a gross act
   of cannibalism and nothing better, inasmuch as you eat human flesh!
   And, in the next place, you cannot derive any virtue from it, for Jesus
   Christ tells you at once, "It is the Spirit that quickens. The flesh
   profits nothing."

   If you did actually eat the very body of Christ it would affect your
   digestive and secretive organs and through them your flesh, just as
   other bread, or, if you like it better, other flesh would do! And how
   could this affect your heart and soul? Does Divine Grace operate
   through the stomach, and save us through our bowels? Prove this and you
   will make converts of us!

   But do not men receive the body and blood of Christ in the Lord's
   Supper? Yes, spiritual men do, in a real and spiritual sense, but not
   in a carnal sort--not so as to crush it with their teeth, or taste it
   with their palate, or digest it by the gastric juices! They receive the
   Lord Jesus, as Incarnate and Crucified, into their spirits, as they
   believe in Him, love Him, and are comforted by thoughts of Him. "But
   how is that a real reception of Him?" cries one! Alas, this question
   reveals at once the world's thoughts! You think the carnal, alone,
   real, and that the spiritual is unreal. If you can touch and taste you
   think it real--but if you can only meditate and love--you dream it to
   be unreal.

   How impossible it is for the carnal mind to enter into spiritual
   things! Yet, hearken once again--I receive the body and blood of Christ
   when my soul believes in His Incarnation. When my heart relies upon the
   merit of His death. When the bread and wine so refresh my memory that
   thoughts of Jesus Christ and His agonies melt me to penitence, cheer me
   to confidence and purify me from sin. It is not my body which receives
   Jesus, but my spirit! I believe in Him, casting myself alone upon Him.
   Trusting Him, I feel joy and peace, love and zeal, hatred of sin and
   love of holiness--and so as to my spiritual nature I am fed upon Him.

   My spiritual nature feeds upon truth, love, Divine Grace, promise,
   pardon, covenant, atonement, acceptance--all of which I find, and much
   more--in the Person of the Lord Jesus. Up to the extent in which my
   spirit has communion with the Lord Jesus, the ordinance of breaking of
   bread is living and acceptable because the spiritual element quickens
   it. But to the extent in which I merely receive the bread and wine and
   my spirit is not exercised about Jesus Christ--to that extent it
   profits me nothing--it is a mere external ceremony and nothing more.
   The bread is only bread, the wine is merely wine, the eating is simply
   eating bread and no more. The whole outward ceremony is what it seems
   to be and not a jot more! But the unseen fellowship of hearts with
   Jesus--this is the quickening element and this, alone.

   The same principle applies in the case of Baptism. According to God's
   Word, Romans 6:4 and Colossians 2:12, Baptism sets forth our union with
   Jesus in His death, burial and resurrection. Is there anything in the
   water in which the person is immersed? Nothing whatever! Is there
   conveyed, by the water, or in the water, any spiritual gift or Grace?
   Not in any way except so far as this--if the water reminds the
   spiritual nature in the man of the death of Christ. Then his spirit
   enjoys communion with Christ in His death. If the water forcibly
   portrays to him the Savior's burial so that his spirit feels itself to
   be buried to the world. If rising out of the water reminds the man of
   the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, so that he, in spirit, rises from a
   dead world into a newness of life, then there is life in the Baptism.
   The Holy Spirit quickens it-- but the mere water--the carnal part of
   the ordinance, in itself profits nothing!

   The putting away of the filth of the flesh is nothing, but the answer
   of a good conscience toward God is the vitality of Baptism. It is only
   vital up to the extent in which the spirit exercises itself. This
   speaks strongly against the Baptism of infants. We do not enter on this
   subject from love of controversy, but the question is fairly involved
   in the subject. If the baptized person, infant or adult, enters in
   spirit into the meaning and teaching of Baptism, he is truly baptized.
   But, inasmuch as in our firm conviction a babe does not enter in spirit
   into the subject at all, it has only received the unprofitable Baptism
   of the flesh, since the Spirit which quickens was absent.

   Whether you are infants or adults, if your renewed spirit enters into
   the form, it quickens the form and makes it live. But if you come to it
   without spiritual life and without exercising spiritual emotions, the
   water, the fleshly part of the ordinance, profits you nothing. It is
   only so far as your spirit has fellowship with Jesus Christ in it--both
   in the act and in meditation upon it afterwards--that Baptism becomes
   of the slightest possible profit to you. We put the two ordinances
   together and say to you--you will find in these just as much as your
   spirit shall get from them and not an atom more! Only so far as the
   symbol aids thought and emotion can it be of service. The outward does
   not profit a little, it profits nothing whatever.

   Take next the doctrine of the Apostolic succession. There are certain
   persons still out of Bedlam who say of all ministers but those of their
   own sect, no matter how much the Lord may have honored them in the
   conversion of sinners and the edification of saints, they are intruders
   and not true ministers of Jesus Christ! Their clerics are the
   legitimate successors of the Apostles and they only. For the moment we
   will allow the historical question--we will suppose that up to Judas,
   or some other Apostle, they can trace a line through Popes of Rome, or
   Archbishops of Canterbury. We will suppose that a little stream comes
   trickling down to them through the dunghill of the dark ages, having
   its original rise in the Apostolic era.

   Well, what now? Hear this Word of God--"The flesh profits nothing." The
   mere fleshly connection between bishop and bishop established by
   successive laying on of hands and anointing is utterly valueless! The
   great question is concerning the spiritual succession! Do we see in you
   the same spirit that was in the Apostles? Open your mouths and let us
   hear the same simple, unadorned Gospel which the Apostles proclaimed!
   Let us hear you say with Paul, "You observe days and months, and times
   and years. I am afraid of you lest I have bestowed upon you labor in
   vain." Let us hear from your lips the Doctrines of Grace and faithful
   warnings against looking for salvation by our own works!

   Let us perceive that you are free from the beggarly elements of
   ceremonialism, and are not to be judged in meat, or in drink, or in
   respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath (Col.
   2:16). Is there as little pomp about you as about the tentmaker of old?
   From where do these silk chasubles, albs of fine linen, stoles of
   watered silk, maniples, capes and garments covered with gold and silver
   and embroidery come? The Apostolic fishermen surely did not fish for
   souls in such fine raiment!

   Show us Apostolic simplicity, faith and truthfulness! We care not a fig
   either way for your fleshly succession! We demand that you prove your
   spiritual one! It was a tolerably impudent thing for a bishop once to
   say, in reference to John Williams and other missionaries in the South
   Sea Islands, "They act as pioneers. They prepare the way for a more
   regular force. The missionary in due time is followed by the Churchman
   who erects the converts into an orderly edifice, having for its
   foundation the lively stones of an Apostolic priesthood, qualified to
   offer the oblation of a spiritual sacrifice."

   Now, my Lord Bishop, you shall, yourself, decide which is the more
   Apostolic--yourself at home at ease, in enjoyment and luxury--or John
   Williams, traveling from island to island with his life in his hand. He
   is casting down idols by the power of the Gospel and transforming
   savages into Christian men! You live in state and he dies a martyr! You
   boast and he toils! You talk of your own priesthood and he of Jesus
   Christ! You are filled with zeal for a sect and he with love for
   souls--surely if wit remains beneath your miter, you, yourself, can
   judge which of the two is the more Apostolic!

   If the Apostle Paul, himself, came to find out his successor, where
   would he look for him--in the missionary doing Apostolic work--or in
   the bishop talking about what he will do after the other has laid the
   foundation and stained it with his blood? When we see the Divine
   calling of our honored pastors denied and hear the impudent claims of a
   tribe of hireling priests, we can only cry, "To what an extent pretense
   may run!" Let them boast the fleshly succession, but let us seek
   spiritual union with the Apostle's Lord.

   The Puseyites of our Savior's day said, "We have Abraham for our
   father," just as these say, "We are the successors of the Apostles."
   And we meet our modern Pharisees with the same rebuke with which the
   Baptist met their ancient types, "They which are of faith, these are
   children of Abraham," and successors of the Apostles, too! Let us
   remain content with spiritually following Jesus and doing His work. And
   let the sons of the bondwoman boast a worthless fleshly succession if
   they will--"It is the spirit that quickens. The flesh profits nothing."

   These things more concern other people than ourselves, therefore let us
   come a little nearer home. Much is said nowadays about an ornate form
   of worship. The excellency of melodious music is much extolled. The
   swell of the organ, it is said, begets a hallowed frame of mind. But
   how far is the effect sensuous and how far spiritual? Is it not to be
   feared that an anthem in a service is often no more a spiritual
   exercise than a glee at a concert? Music has charms and he who cannot
   feel them is to be pitied.

   But, acceptable heart worship is quite another thing--no arrangement of
   notes and chords can ever do the work of God the Holy Spirit. Unless
   music can aid in making sinners penitent--in leading souls to Jesus
   Christ, or uplifting saints in holy joy to the Throne of God--we must
   hold that in vital godliness, it profits nothing. Architecture, with
   its arched roofs and noble pillars and dim religious light is supposed
   to impart a reverence and awe which befit the solemn engagements of
   Sunday and draw the mind towards the invisible God. Well, if
   combinations of stone can sanctify the spirit of man, it is a pity that
   the Gospel did not prescribe architecture as the remedy for the ruin of
   the Fall! If gorgeous buildings make men love God and long-drawn aisles
   renovate men's spiritual nature, build, all you builders, both day and
   night!

   If bricks and mortar can lead us to Heaven, alas, for the confusion
   which stopped the works at Babel! If there is such a connection between
   spires and spiritual things as to make human hearts beat in unison with
   the will of God, then build high and loftily and lavish your gold and
   silver! But if all that you produce is sensuous and nothing more, then
   turn to living stones and seek to build up a spiritual house with
   spiritual means!

   We are told, nowadays, that the pompous array of ministering priests,
   the beauty of symbolism, the painting of windows, the smoke of incense
   and so on, tend to draw people into the place of worship and that when
   there, they aid in elevating their minds. What does Scripture say about
   it all? This thing was tried among the Jews and Christ's remark when He
   comes to sum up the long trial is, "It is the spirit that quickens. The
   flesh profits nothing." The real inward spirit of man is not blessed by
   sounds which charm the ear but appeal not to the understanding. Nor by
   colors which delight the eye but gladden not the affections of man!

   To gratify taste is well enough for the carnal, but it profits nothing
   in the sight of God. It may be as well to be artistic as to be plain,
   but it is of no matter either way if tested by the Word--in the
   balances of the sanctuary these matters are lighter than vanity. We
   must make precisely the same remark concerning eloquence. Here we deal
   more closely with our own Brethren, who, in this thing look to the
   flesh as others do. Many persons have come to think that oratorical
   ability is essential in the minister.

   It is not enough, some think, to preach the Truth with the Holy Spirit
   sent down from Heaven--we must also preach it in the wisdom of words
   with excellency of speech! The trappings of oratory and the drapery of
   eloquence are thought to be profitable. Ah, dear Friends, one half of
   the emotions excited in our places of worship are of no more value than
   those excited at the theater. The mere ring of words is no more than a
   sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. "The flesh profits nothing."

   So far as the Truth of God itself moves our inmost souls, preaching is
   of real service. But if that which you hear only commends itself to you
   because of the sweet voice that speaks it--or the telling tones in
   which it is delivered--your hearing is a carnal exercise and profits
   you nothing! It is only when your spirit grasp the truths. When your
   heart embraces Christ. When your soul beholds God by the eye of faith
   that you derive benefit! We may bring this principle to bear on the
   revivals over which we have watched with much hope but with more
   anxiety. In many revivals there has been too much aim at getting up an
   excitement--a carnal enthusiasm.

   Excited persons pray one after the other. Excited persons speak and the
   stamp and motion of the hand and the tear trickling from the eye--all
   these are supposed to be of great service. I grant you that excitement
   may sometimes be used by God to stir the spirit of man, but unless, my
   dear Hearers, your religion is based on something more than animal
   excitement, it is based upon a lie! Your spirit must come to know its
   ruin before God, and be humbled. Your spirit must come to take hold of
   Jesus Christ and believe in Him. Your spirit must undergo the Divine
   change which only God the Holy Spirit can work--or else that excitement
   shall be nothing more than the blowing up of a bubble which shall burst
   and leave not a trace behind.

   Take care of any religion which merely tickles your fancy, excites your
   passions, or stirs your blood! True Grace penetrates the very core of
   our nature. It changes the heart, subdues the will, renews the passions
   and makes us new creatures in Christ Jesus! To come yet closer to
   ourselves, in the matter of prayer and the ordinances of God's House, I
   am afraid we too often forget this great rule--that it is the spirit
   that quickens and that the flesh profits nothing. We pray, I suppose,
   as a matter of habit--every morning and evening. But how often we spend
   our few minutes and we rise from our knees satisfied.

   And if anybody should ask, "Have you been praying?" We would say,
   "Yes," but it has been the flesh prayer, the dead form without the life
   of the heart. In reality there has been no prayer at all! It has been
   the flesh, which profits nothing. It is only that prayer in which the
   spirit talks with God that is real prayer! The carnal man is quite
   satisfied if he can get through a certain string of expressions, but
   the spiritual man is not content with this. Luther used to complain
   very much of distractions in prayer and some said they could not
   understand it. "No," Luther might have said, "I dare say you cannot,
   for, being unspiritual, you do not understand spiritual difficulties."

   Bernard complained much of the wandering of his thoughts in prayer and
   when someone said he thought Bernard must be a very great sinner to let
   his thoughts wander so, Bernard said, "I will give you a trial. I will
   give you a horse if you can say the Lord's Prayer and think of nothing
   else." So the man began, "Our Father which are in Heaven," when he
   stopped short and turning round, said, "But you must give me the bridle
   to get him home with." So hard is it to keep the mind upon the object
   of devotion!

   While the sinner's words are going up to God he thinks that he is
   praying, but he has not prayed at all unless his heart has talked with
   God. Why, Brethren, some of the best prayers that have ever been prayed
   had not a single word to express them with. They were heart prayers and
   went up to Heaven in all their naked unclothed glory, like disembodied
   spirits and God accepted them. Many a prayer that has had the choicest
   words to garnish it has been nothing but a dead prayer wrapped up in
   cerements and only fit to be cast into the grave forever.

   So with public worship. You would feel unhappy if you had spent the
   whole Sunday without going to a place of worship--but you are quite at
   ease if you come here and leave your hearts at home. When we are
   singing, you sing with us. And when we are praying, you cover your
   eyes, too. And when we are preaching, some of you think of what I am
   talking about and some do not. But when you get through the appointed
   hour, you feel quite easy--but oh, remember that the mere carnal act of
   being here profits nothing.

   Oh, dear Friends, shake off the idea that going up to a place of
   worship, or opening a Bible, or reading family prayer, or kneeling
   down, can, as mere acts, save your souls! I do not speak against them
   as to their profit in some respects, but as to salvation and the real
   vital work, which is acceptable before God, the mere form profits
   nothing! It is only as your spirit prays, as your spirit seeks, as your
   spirit worships, as your spirit listens to God's Word, that there is
   any quickening power in it whatever!

   Once more. There are certain persons who take considerable delight in
   having seen, as they think, visions and other manifestations of Christ
   with their eyes--and having heard certain texts mysteriously spoken in
   their ears. Now I am not going to deny that you may have seen these
   visions and heard these sounds. I do not think you did, but whether you
   did or not is no matter--they profit you nothing. That which merely
   comes to this eye is nothing--it must come to the soul's eye of faith.
   That which comes to this ear is nothing unless it gets into the heart's
   ear--unless your soul hears it.

   If I were to see all the devils in Hell I should not think myself
   damned because of that. And if you have seen all the angels in Heaven
   you must not think you are saved because of that! It is not what a man
   sees with his eyes, or hears with his ears--it is what the spirit
   receives which saves the soul. "God is a Spirit and they that worship
   Him must worship him in spirit and in truth, for the Father seeks such
   to worship Him."

   II. The text mentions the QUICKENING SPIRIT. That which puts life into
   our religion is its being received and acted out by a spiritual nature.
   For, first of all, it is the spiritual nature which quickens the man.
   The man who has not received, by the work of God, the Holy Spirit, a
   spiritual nature, is described by Paul as being dead in trespasses and
   sins. The Spirit finds men carnal and breathes into them a new and
   better nature, and then they become what they never were before,
   quickened, spiritual men.

   This spirit of theirs is a quickening spirit, for it quickens all the
   ordinances. A carnal man is baptized--but it is the fleshly Baptism
   which profits nothing. A spiritual man comes to Baptism, and he is
   baptized and he quickens the Baptism--it becomes a real living Baptism
   to him, for he has fellowship with Jesus Christ in it. A carnal man
   comes to the Lord's Supper and he eats and drinks, what? "Damnation
   unto himself, not discerning the Lord's body." A spiritual man comes
   there and he eats and drinks and what, then? Why it becomes a living
   ordinance to him--the bread sets forth to him the body of Christ and
   the wine sets forth the blood--and in spirit he feeds upon his
   incarnate Savior.

   The possession of a spiritual nature and the exercise of that spiritual
   nature in the ordinances quickens them. So it is with prayer. The mere
   act of speaking one form of words is of no more profit than the
   repeating of any other. The Lord's Prayer, said backwards, is quite as
   acceptable to God as the Lord's Prayer said forwards unless the spirit
   enters into it. You might as well repeat the multiplication table as
   repeat the collect of the day as far as God is concerned, unless your
   spirit prays.

   But when the spirit is engaged in repentance, in faith, in joy, in
   love--then the prayer is quickened. So with all the actions of man's
   life. If I give bread to the hungry, if I visit the sick, if I
   subscribe towards a good object--that is all nothing unless my heart is
   in the deed. But if I feed the poor because I love Jesus. If I seek to
   glorify God in my deeds of charity and holiness, they become living
   actions. Apart from all that they profit nothing to me before God. The
   spiritual part of my nature must quicken my whole life and make it real
   life, or else it will be a dead carnal existence before the Lord.

   The spiritual nature has for its Author the Divine Father. The
   sixty-fifth verse of the chapter in which our text is found tells us
   that no man can come unto Christ except it is given him of the Father.
   To be spiritual is a gift of God the Father. He has begotten us again
   into a lively hope by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
   The new life is the actual operation of the Holy Spirit--no man becomes
   spiritual except the Holy Spirit enters into him. Deity comes into
   contact with humanity and quickens the spiritual man. The mark by which
   this spirituality is discovered is faith. "Whoever believes that Jesus
   is the Christ is born of God."

   Every man who rests upon Christ for salvation has the proof of his
   being spiritual. Modes of speech, or dress, or worship are not the
   marks of the spiritual--only simple, spiritual faith in the Lord Jesus
   is. True religion has always been spiritual, but mere professors have
   ever been content with the outward form alone. Among the Jews, when
   symbols were abundant, the mass either stuck fast in the types and
   could get no farther, or else they went clean away to idolatry. In
   these latter times the Lord has taken away almost all that is
   ceremonial in our religion. Two simple forms, alone, remain.

   And now there is another grand trial to see whether men can live in a
   spiritual religion and that trial has come to prove just this--that
   none can do so but those who are born of God. The most of mankind
   cannot get on with a religion in which there is nothing to see, nothing
   to please the ear, or to gratify their taste. It is only the spiritual
   man who is so overwhelmed with the glories of God that he does not need
   the glories of man! He is so overcome with the splendor of Christ that
   he does not want the splendor of the masses! He is so taken up with the
   magnificence of the great High Priest that he does not care for
   gorgeously appareled priests!

   Blessed is that man who sees, though his eyes are blind! Who hears,
   though his ears are deaf! Who tastes, though his appetite fails! Who
   lives, though his heart and flesh fail--blessed is he who sees Him who
   is invisible and has revealed unto him what eye has not seen and what
   ear has not heard! This will not suit many of you. A religion of
   thinking and believing is too hard for you. Repenting, believing,
   trusting--these things men will not do. They will kneel down any
   quantity of times! They will even, if told by a priest, lick the floor
   with their tongues--or they will walk with peas in their shoes, or whip
   their backs--but when it comes to believing, hoping, trusting, fearing
   and so on, men are so little inclined to mental operations, especially
   under the dictation of a higher authority, that they will not have
   anything to do with them.

   What?" they say, "a religion in which there is nothing for me to see!
   What? An unseen altar?" Yes, an unseen altar. "Am I not to see the
   sacrifice?" No. "Never to see it? Then I do not understand it. What? A
   God, but no symbols! No crucifixes! No crosses! What? No holy wafer, no
   sacred place, nothing sacred?" No, nothing visible to be reverenced,
   nothing whatever but the unseen God. "What? Not even my place of
   worship, is not that to be holy?" No, if you are a Christian, all
   places must alike be sacred to you. "Neither in this mountain, nor yet
   at Jerusalem shall men worship the Father, but those that worship Him
   must worship Him in spirit and in truth."

   You must be yourself a temple and God must dwell in you! You must be
   yourself a priest and everywhere you must offer spiritual sacrifice.
   "The spirit quickens, but the flesh profits nothing."

   III. The Savior tells us in the closing sentence THAT HIS WORDS ARE
   SPIRIT AND LIFE. Beloved, never was there a more true sentence spoken!
   Listen to other teachers and you get precepts concerning washing,
   eating, bowing, etc., which are fleshly. But hear Jesus and His
   words--they all aim at the heart. Listen to the Puseyite and hear his
   word--"You should take care to attend Matins and early celebrations in
   our holy and beautiful Church! You should decorate the altar, get a
   surpliced choir, have processions and put on the holy garments."

   Now you see at once that these are not spiritual things--these are not
   life. Ritual performances are very pretty spectacles for silly young
   ladies and sillier men to gaze upon--but there is no shadow of spirit
   or life in them. The High Church ritual does not look like a Divine
   thing--on the contrary--if I stand among the throng and gaze at all its
   pret-tiness, it looks amazingly like a nursery game, or a stage play!

   Lack of taste, you say. Not so, I reply. My eyes admire your glittering
   colors and the splendor of your services is taking to me, as a man. I
   enjoy the swell of your organ and I can even put up with the smell of
   your incense (if you buy it good), but my spirit does not care for
   these fooleries--it turns away sickened and cries, "There is nothing
   here for me. There is no more nourishment for the spirit in all this
   than there is food for man in a swine's trough!" The words of Jesus
   Christ are throughout unceremonial and unformal--they are spirit and
   they are life--and we turn to them with all the greater zeal after
   having seen enough of your childish things!"

   On my Lord's words I fix my hope in the battle now waging with
   ceremonialism and I wish that all ministers of Christ would scorn to
   use any other weapons. I know the talk is that we ought to vie with the
   false churches in the beauty of our services--but this is a temptation
   of the devil! If the simple preaching of the Cross will not attract the
   people, let them go away. Let the Lord's servants renounce the sword
   and shield of Saul and go forth with the Gospel sling and stone! Our
   weapons are the Words of Jesus--these are spirit and these are life.
   Architecture, apparel, music, liturgies-- these are neither spirit nor
   life. Let those rest on them who will--we can do without them, by God's
   help. Our sires, in the Puritan age, fought and won the battles of
   Christ without these things. In later days Whitfield stirred his age
   with nothing but the Word of God. Rowlands and Christmas Evans roused
   the men of Wales with no attraction but the Cross.

   My dear Brethren in Christ, ministers of the Gospel who are now
   present--let me beseech you--stand to the Gospel! Set your backs
   against the tendency of the times to depart from the simplicity of
   Jesus Christ! If men will not come to hear us because we preach the
   Gospel, draw them by no other attraction! I rejoice in the vast crowd
   so constantly assembled here because my enemies, themselves, are
   witnesses that there is nothing in me to which the honor can be
   ascribed! An uplifted Savior still draws all men to Him!

   Dear Friends, pray that the great and blessed Spirit, who first gives
   spiritual life, may continue to feed and nourish and perfect that life
   in you until you shall come to that Heaven where ALL is spiritual!
   Where they need no candles, nor light of the sun. Where no temple is
   found, because the Lord God and the Lamb are the temple! Where
   spiritual life shall be developed into its purest form! Where, in
   spiritual bodies, you shall see the spiritual God and reign before His
   Throne, world without end. Amen.

                          Memory--The Handmaid Of Hope

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 15, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "This I recall to my mind, therefore ha ve I hope." Lamentations 3:21.

   MEMORY is very often the servant of despondency. Despairing minds call
   to remembrance every dark foreboding in the past and every gloomy
   feature in the present. Memory stands like a handmaiden clothed in
   sackcloth, presenting to her master a cup of mingled gall and wormwood.
   Like Mercury, she hastens with winged heel to gather fresh thorns with
   which to fill the uneasy pillow and to bind fresh rods with which to
   scourge the already bleeding heart. There is, however, no necessity for
   this. Wisdom will transform Memory into an angel of comfort.

   That same recollection which may, in its left hand, bring so many dark
   and gloomy omens, may be trained to bear in its right hand a wealth of
   hopeful signs! She need not wear a crown of iron. She may encircle her
   brow with a fillet of gold, all spangled with stars! When Christian,
   according to Bunyan, was locked up in Doubting Castle, Memory formed
   the crab-tree club with which the famous giant beat his captives so
   terribly. They remembered how they had left the right road, how they
   had been warned not to do so and how in rebellion against their better
   selves they wandered into By-Path Meadow.

   They remembered all their past misdeeds, their sins, their evil
   thoughts and evil words--and all these were so many knots in the
   club--causing sad bruises and wounds in their poor suffering persons.
   But one night, according to Bunyan, this same Memory which had scourged
   them, helped to set them free--for she whispered something in
   Christian's ear and he cried out as one half amazed, "What a fool am I
   to lie in a stinking dungeon, when I may as well walk at liberty! I
   have a key in my bosom called Promise, that will, I am persuaded, open
   any lock in Doubting Castle." So he put his hand into his bosom and
   with much joy he plucked out the key and thrust it into the lock.

   And though the lock of the great iron gate, as Bunyan says, "went
   damnable hard," yet the key did open it, and all the others, too. And
   so, by this blessed act of memory, poor Christian and Hopeful were set
   free! Observe that the text records an act of memory on the part of
   Jeremiah--"This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope." In the
   previous verse he tells us that memory had brought him to despair--"My
   soul has them still in remembrance and is humbled in me." And now he
   tells us that this same memory brought him to life and comfort yet
   again--"This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope."

   We lay it down, then, as a general principle, that if we would exercise
   our memories a little more, we might, in our very deepest and darkest
   distress, strike a match which would instantaneously kindle the lamp of
   comfort! There is no need for God to create a new thing in order to
   restore Believers to joy. If they would prayerfully rake the ashes of
   the past they would find light for the present. And if they would turn
   to the Book of Truth and the Throne of Grace, their candle would soon
   shine as before. I shall apply that general principle to the cases of
   three persons.

   I. First of all, to THE BELIEVER WHO IS IN DEEP TROUBLE. This is no
   unusual position for an heir of Glory. A Christian man is seldom long
   at ease--the Believer in Jesus Christ through much tribulation inherits
   the kingdom. If you will kindly turn to the chapter which contains our
   text, you will observe a list of matters which recollection brought
   before the mind of the Prophet Jeremiah and which yielded him comfort.

   First stands the fact that however deep may be our present affliction,
   it is of the Lord's mercy that we are not consumed. This is a low
   beginning, certainly. The comfort is not very great, but when a very
   weak man is at the bottom of the pyramid, if he is ever to climb it,
   you must not set him a long step at first. Give him but a small stone
   to step upon, the first time, and when he gets more strength, then he
   will be able to take a greater stride. Now, consider, you sons of
   sorrow, where you might have been!

   Look down now through the gloomy portals of the grave to that realm of
   darkness which is as the valley of the shadow of death--full of
   confusion and without any order. Can you discern the sound as of the
   rushing to and fro of hosts of guilty and tormented spirits? Do you
   hear their dolorous wailing and their fearful gnashing of teeth? Can
   your ears endure to hear the clanking of their chains, or your eyes to
   see the fury of the flames? They are forever, forever, forever shut out
   from the Presence of God, and shut in with devils and despair!

   They lie in flames of misery so terrible that the dream of a despairing
   maniac cannot realize their woe. God has cast them away and pronounced
   His curse upon them, appointing them blackness of darkness forever.
   This might have been your lot. Contrast your present position with
   theirs and you have cause rather to sing, than to lament! "Why should a
   living man complain?" Have you seen those foul dungeons of Venice? They
   are below the water-mark of the canal! To get to them you must wind
   through narrow, dark, stifling passages. Then you creep into little
   cells in which a man can scarcely stand upright where no ray of
   sunlight has ever entered since the foundations of the palace were
   laid! They are cold, foul and black with damp and mildew--the fit
   nursery of fever and abode of death!

   And yet those places were luxury to inhabit compared with the
   everlasting burnings of Hell! It were an excess of luxury to lost
   spirits if they could lie there with moss growing on their eyelids, in
   lonely misery--if they might but escape for a little season from a
   guilty conscience and the wrath of God! Friend, you are neither in
   those dungeons nor yet in Hell! Therefore pluck up courage and say, "It
   is of the Lord's mercy we are not consumed, because His compassions
   fail not."

   Slender comfort this may be, but then, if this flame shall yield but
   little heat, it may lead to something better. When you are kindling
   your household fire before which you hope to sit down with comfort--you
   do not first expect to kindle the lumps of coal--you set some lighter
   fuel in a blaze and soon the more solid material yields a genial glow.
   So this thought, which may seem so light to you, may be as the kindling
   of a heavenly fire of comfort for you who now are shivering in your
   grief. Something better awaits us, for Jeremiah reminds us that there
   are some mercies, at any rate, which are still continued. "His
   compassions fail not, they are new every morning: great is Your
   faithfulness."

   You are very poor and have come down for wealth. This is very
   difficult, still you are in good health. Just walk into the hospital,
   ask to be permitted to witness the work done in the operating room. Sit
   down by one bedside and listen to the story of pain and weariness, and
   surely you will leave the hospital feeling, "I thank God that with all
   my poverty I have not sickness to complain of and therefore I will sing
   of the mercies which I enjoy."

   Are you sick and have you dragged your weary body to this house this
   morning? Then I shall invite you to accompany me to those dark cellars
   and miserable attics where poverty pines away in wretched unpitied
   obscurity in the heart of this great city. And if you note the
   hard-earned meal too scant to yield sufficient refreshment, and the
   miserable heap of straw which is their only rest, you will escape from
   the foul den of filthy penury and say, "I will bear my sickness, for
   even that is better than filth, starvation and nakedness."

   Evil your plight may be, but there are others in a still worse
   condition. You can always, if you open your eyes and choose to do so,
   see at least this cause for thankfulness--that you are not yet plunged
   into the lowest depth of misery. There is a very touching little story
   told of a poor woman with two children who had not a bed for them to
   lie upon and scarcely any clothes to cover them. In the depth of winter
   they were nearly frozen and the mother took the door of a cellar off
   the hinges and set it up before the corner where they crouched down to
   sleep that some of the draft and cold might be kept from them.

   One of the children whispered to her when she complained of how badly
   off they were, "Mother, what do those dear little children do who have
   no cellar door to put up in front of them?" Even there, you see, the
   little heart found cause for thankfulness. And we, if we are driven to
   our worst extremity, will still honor God by thanking Him that His
   compassions fail not but are new every morning. This, again, is not a
   very high step--but still it is a little in advance over the other--and
   the weakest may readily reach it.

   The chapter offers us a third source of consolation. "The Lord is my
   portion, says my soul. Therefore will I hope in Him." You have lost
   much Christian, but you have not lost your portion. Your God is your
   All--therefore, if you have lost all but God--still you have your all
   left since God is All. The text does not say that God is a part of our
   portion, but the whole portion of our spirit! In Him we have all the
   riches of our heart concentrated. How can we be bereaved since our
   Father lives? How can we be robbed since our treasure is on high?

   It is daylight and the sun is shining bright and I have a candle lit,
   but someone blows it out. Shall I sit down and weep because my candle
   is extinguished? No, not while the sun shines! If God is my portion, if
   I lose some little earthly comfort I will not complain, for heavenly
   comfort remains. One of our kings, high and haughty in temper, had a
   quarrel with the citizens of London and thought to alarm them by a
   dreadful threat that would cow the spirits of the bold citi-zens--if
   they did not mind what they were doing he would remove his Court from
   Westminster. Whereupon, the Lord Mayor begged to enquire whether His
   Majesty meant to take the Thames away, for so long as the river
   remained His Majesty might take himself wherever he pleased!

   Even so, the world warns us, "you cannot hold out, you cannot
   rejoice--this trouble shall come and that adversity shall befall." We
   reply, so long as you cannot take our Lord away we will not complain.
   "Philosophers," said the wise man, "can dance without music." And true
   Believers in God can rejoice when outward comforts fail them. He who
   drinks from the bottle as did the son of the bondwoman may have to
   complain of thirst. But he who dwells at the well as did Isaac, the
   child according to promise, he shall never know lack! God grant us
   Grace, then, to rejoice in our deepest distress because the Lord is our
   sure possession, our perpetual heritage of joy.

   We have now advanced to some degree of hope but there are other steps
   to ascend. The Prophet then reminds us of another channel of comfort,
   namely, that God is forevermore good to all who seek Him. "The Lord is
   good unto them that wait for Him, to the soul that seeks Him." Let Him
   smite ever so hard, yet if we can maintain the heavenly posture of
   prayer we may rest assured that He will turn from blows to kisses! When
   a beggar wants an alms and is very needy, if he sees another beggar at
   the door of some great man, he will watch while he knocks and when the
   door is opened and the man is liberally entertained and generously
   helped, he who has been looking on knocks with boldness in his turn.

   My Soul, are you very sad and very low this morning? The Lord is good
   to them that seek Him! Thousands have come from His door but none have
   had reason to complain of a cold reception, for in every case He has
   filled the hungry with good things. Therefore, my Soul, go boldly and
   knock, for He gives liberally and upbraids not! In all states of
   dilemma or of difficulty prayer is an available source. Bunyan tells us
   that when the City of Mansoul was besieged it was the depth of winter
   and the roads were very bad, but even then prayer could travel them.

   And I will venture to affirm that if all earthly roads were so bad that
   they could not be traveled, and if Mansoul were so surrounded that
   there was not a gap left through which we could break our way to get to
   the king, yet the road upwards would always be open! No enemy can
   barricade that! No blockading ships can sail between our souls and the
   haven of the Mercy Seat. The ship of prayer may sail through all
   temptations, doubts and fears, straight up to the Throne of God. And
   though she may be outward bound with only griefs and groans and sighs,
   she shall return freighted with a wealth of blessings! There is hope
   then, Christian, for you are allowed to pray--

   "The Mercy Seat is open still, Here let our souls retreat."

   We are getting into deeper water ofjoy! Let us take another step and
   this time we shall win greater consolation still, from the fact that it
   is good to be afflicted! "It is good that a man should bear the yoke in
   his youth." A little child needs to be coaxed to take its medicine. It
   may be very ill and Mother may assure it that this medicine will work
   its cure. But the child says, "No, it is so bitter, I cannot take it."
   But men need not thus to be persuaded. The bitter is nothing to them.
   They think of the health which it will bring and so they take the
   draught and do not even wince.

   Now we--if we are little children and have not called to remembrance
   the fruit which affliction bears--may cry and murmur. But if we are men
   in Christ Jesus and have learned that "all things work together for
   good to them that love God," we shall take the cup right cheerfully and
   willingly and bless God for it! Why should I dread to descend the shaft
   of affliction if it leads me to the gold mine of spiritual experience?
   Why should I cry out if the sun of my prosperity goes down, if in the
   darkness of my adversity I shall be the better able to count the starry
   promises with which my faithful God has been pleased to gem the sky?

   Go Sun, for in your absence we shall see ten thousand suns! And when
   your blinding light is gone, we shall see worlds in the dark which were
   hidden from us by your light. Many a promise is written in sympathetic
   ink which you cannot read till the fire of trouble brings out the
   letters. "It is good for me that I have been afflicted that I might
   learn Your statutes." Beloved, Israel went into Egypt poor--but they
   came out of Egypt with jewels of silver and jewels of gold. They had
   worked, it is true, at the brick kilns and suffered bitter bondage, but
   they were bettered by it. They came out enriched by all their
   tribulations.

   A child had a little garden in which it planted many flowers, but they
   never grew. She put them in, as she thought, tenderly and carefully,
   but they would not live. She sowed seeds and they sprang up, but very
   soon they withered away. So she ran to her father's gardener and when
   he came to look at it, he said, "I will make it a nice garden for you,
   that you may grow whatever you want." He fetched a pick and when the
   little child saw the terrible pick, she was afraid for her little
   garden. The gardener struck his tool into the ground and began to make
   the earth heave and shake, for his pickaxe had caught the edge of a
   huge stone which lay under almost all the little plot of ground.

   All the little flowers were turned out of their places and the garden
   spoiled for a season so that the little maid wept much. He told her he
   would make it a fair garden yet and so he did--for having removed that
   stone which had prevented all the plants from striking root--he soon
   filled the ground with flowers which lived and flourished. And so the
   Lord has come and has turned up all the soil of your present
   comfort--to get rid of some big stone that was at the bottom of all
   your spiritual prosperity and would not let your soul flourish! Do not
   weep with the child, but be comforted by the blessed results and thank
   your Father's tender hand.

   One step more and surely we shall then have good ground to rejoice. The
   chapter reminds us that these troubles do not last forever. When they
   have produced their proper result they will be removed, for "the Lord
   will not cast off forever." Who told you that the night would never end
   in day? Who told you that the sea would ebb out till there should be
   nothing left but a vast track of mud and sand? Who told you that the
   winter would proceed from frost to frost, from snow and ice and hail,
   to deeper snow, and yet more heavy tempest? Who told you this, I say?
   Do you not know that day follows night? That flood comes after ebb?
   That spring and summer succeed winter?

   Then have hope! Hope forever! God fails you not! Do you not know that
   your God loves you in the midst of all this? Mountains, when hidden in
   darkness are as real as in daylight and God's love is as true to you
   now as it was in your brightest moments. No father chastens always--he
   hates the rod as much as you do! He only cares to use it for that
   reason which should make you willing to receive it, namely, that it
   works your lasting good. You shall yet climb Jacob's ladder with the
   angels and behold Him who sits at the top of it--your Covenant God.

   You shall yet, amidst the splendors of eternity, forget the trials of
   time--or only remember them to bless the God who led you through them
   and worked your lasting good by them! Come, sing on your bed! Rejoice
   amidst the flames! Make the wilderness blossom like the rose! Cause the
   desert to ring with your exalting joys! These light afflictions will
   soon be over and then, "forever with the Lord," your bliss shall never
   wane!

   Thus, dear Friends, Memory may be as Coleridge calls it, "the bosom
   spring of joy," and when the Holy Spirit bends it to His service, it
   may be chief among earthly comforters.

   II. For a short time, we will speak TO THE DOUBTING CHRISTIAN WHO HAS
   LOST HIS EVIDENCES OF

   SALVATION. It is our habit, in our ministry, to avoid extremes as much
   as possible and to keep to the narrow path of the Truth of God. We
   believe in the doctrine of predestination. We believe in the doctrine
   of free agency and we follow the narrow path between those mountains.
   So in all other Truths. We know some who think that doubts are not
   sins-- we regret their thinking that.

   We know others who believe doubts to be impossible where there is any
   faith--we cannot agree with them. We have heard of persons ridiculing
   that very sweet and admirable hymn, beginning--

   " 'Tis a point I long to know."

   We dare not ridicule it ourselves, for we have often had to sing it--we
   wish it were not so--but we are compelled to confess that doubts have
   vexed us. The true position, with regard to the doubts and fears of
   Believers, is just this--that they are sinful and are not to be
   cultivated, but to be avoided--but that, more or less, most of
   Christians do suffer them and that they are not proof of a man's being
   destitute of faith. The very best of Christians have been subject to
   them. To you who are laboring under anxious thought I now address
   myself.

   Let me bid you to remember, in the first place, matters of the past.
   Shall I pause and let your heart talk to you? Do you remember the
   place, the spot of ground where Jesus first met with you? Perhaps you
   do not. Well, do you remember happy seasons when He has brought you to
   the banqueting house? Cannot you remember gracious deliverances? "I was
   brought low and He helped me." "You have been my help." When you were
   in those past circumstances, you thought yourselves in overwhelming
   trouble. You have passed through them and cannot you find comfort in
   them?

   At the south of Africa the sea was generally so stormy that when the
   frail boats of the Portuguese went sailing south, they named it the
   Cape of Storms. But after that cape had been well rounded by bolder
   navigators, they named it the Cape of Good Hope. In your experience you
   had many Cape of Storms, but you have weathered them all and now, let
   them be a Cape of Good Hope to you. Remember, "You have been my help,
   therefore in the shadow of Your wings will I rejoice."

   Say with David, "Why are you cast down, O my Soul, why are you
   disquieted in me? Hope you in God, for I shall yet praise Him." Do I
   not remember this day some hills Mizar where my soul has had such sweet
   fellowship with God that she thought herself in Heaven? Can I not
   remember moments of awful agony of soul when in an instant my spirit
   leaped to the topmost heights of ecstasy at the mention of my Savior's
   name? Have there not been times with me at the Lord's Table, in private
   prayer and in listening to His Word, when I could say--

   "My willing soul would stay
   In such a frame as this,
   And sit and sing herself away,
   To everlasting bliss"? Vell, let me remember this and have hope, for--
   "Did Jesus once upon me shine,
   Then Jesus is forever mine."

   He never loved where He afterwards hates. His will never changes. It is
   not possible that He who said, "I have engraved you upon the palms of
   My hands," should ever forget or cast away those who once were dear to
   Him.

   Possibly, however, that may not be the means of comfort to some of you.
   Recall, I pray, the fact that others have found the Lord true to them.
   They cried to God and He delivered them. Do you not remember your
   mother? She is now in Heaven and you, her son, are toiling and
   struggling onward here below. Do not you recollect what she told you
   before she died? She said God had been faithful and true to her. She
   was left a widow. And you were but a child then. And she told you how
   God provided for her and for you and the rest of that little needy
   family in answer to her pleadings. Do you believe your mother's
   testimony and will you not rest with your mother's faith upon your
   mother's God?

   There are grey heads here who would, if it were the proper season,
   testify to you that in an experience of fifty and sixty years in which
   they have walked before the Lord in the land of the living, they cannot
   put their finger upon any date and say, "Here God was unfaithful." Or,
   "Here He left me in the time of trouble." I, who am but young have
   passed through many and sore tribulations after my sort and can say and
   must say it, for if I speak not, the timbers of this house might cry
   out against my ungrateful silence--He is a faithful God and He
   remembers His servants and leaves them not in the hour of their
   trouble! Hearing our testimonies, cannot you say in the words of the
   text, "This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope"?

   Remember, again, and perhaps this may be consolatory to you, that
   though you think you are not a child of God at all now, yet if you look
   within you will see some faint traces of the holy Spirit's hand. The
   complete picture of Christ is not there, but cannot you see the crayon
   sketch--the outline--the charcoal marks? "What," you say, "do you
   mean?" Do you want to be a Christian? Have you not desires after God?
   Cannot you say with the Psalmist, "My heart and my flesh pants after
   God--after the living God"?

   Oh, I have often had to console myself with this! When I could not see
   a single Christian Grace beaming in my spirit, I have had to say, "I
   know I shall never be satisfied until I get to be like my Lord." One
   thing I know, whereas I was blind, now I see--see enough, at least, to
   know my own defects and emptiness and misery. And I have just enough
   spiritual life to feel that I want more and that I cannot be satisfied
   unless I have more. Well, now, where God the Holy Spirit has done as
   much as that, He will do more! Where He begins a good work, we are
   told, He will carry it on and perfect it in the day of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. Call that to mind, Brothers and Sisters, and you may have hope.

   But I would remind you that there is a promise in this Book that
   exactly describes and suits your case. A young man had been left by his
   father heir of all his property, but an adversary disputed his right.
   The case was to come on in the court and this young man, while he felt
   sure that he had a legal right to the whole, could not prove it. His
   legal adviser told him that there was more evidence wanted than he
   could bring. How to get this evidence he did not know. He went to an
   old chest where his father had kept his papers, turned all out and as
   he turned the writings over and over and over, there was an old
   parchment. He undid the red tape with great anxiety and there it
   was--the very thing he wanted--his father's will in which the estate
   was spoken of as being left entirely to himself. He went into court
   boldly enough with that!

   Now, when we get into doubts, it is a good thing to turn to this old
   Book and read until at last we can say, "That is it--that promise was
   made for me." Perhaps it may be this one--"When the poor and needy seek
   water and there is none and their tongue fails for thirst, I the Lord
   will hear them. I the God of Jacob will not forsake them." Or this
   one-- "Whoever will, let him take the water of life freely." May I beg
   you to rummage the old Book through? And you, poor doubting, despairing
   Christian, will soon stumble on some precious parchment, as it were,
   which God the Holy Spirit will make to you the title-deed of
   immortality and life!

   If these recollections should not suffice, I have one more. You look at
   me and you open your ears to find what new thing I am going to tell
   you. No, I am going to tell you nothing new, but yet it is the best
   thing that was ever said out of Heaven, "Jesus Christ came into the
   world to save sinners." You have heard that a thousand times--and is
   the best music you have ever heard! If I am not a saint, I am a sinner.
   And if I may not go to the Throne of Grace as a child, I will go as a
   sinner!

   A certain king was accustomed on set occasions to entertain all the
   beggars of the city. Around him sat his courtiers, all clothed in rich
   apparel. The beggars sat at the same table in their rags of poverty.
   Now it came to pass, that on a certain day, one of the courtiers had
   spoiled his silken apparel so that he dared not put it on, and he felt,
   "I cannot go to the king's feast today, for my robe is foul." He sat
   weeping till the thought struck him, "Tomorrow, when the king holds his
   feast, some will come as courtiers happily decked in their beautiful
   array and others will come and be made quite as welcome who will be
   dressed in rags. Well, well," he said, "so long as I may see the king's
   face, and sit at the king's table, I will enter with the beggars." So,
   without mourning because he had lost his silken habit, he put on the
   rags of a beggar and he saw the king's face as well as if he had worn
   his scarlet and fine linen! My soul has done this full many a time and
   I bid you do the same! If you cannot come as a saint, come as a sinner!
   Only come and you shall receive joy and peace.

   There was a lamentable accident which occurred in the North in one of
   the coal pits. A considerable number of miners were down below when the
   top of the pit fell in and the shaft was completely blocked up. Those
   who were down below sat together in the dark and sang and prayed. They
   gathered to a spot where the last remains of air below could be
   breathed. There they sat and sang after the lights had gone out because
   the air would not support the flame. They were in total darkness, but
   one of them said he had heard that there was a connection between that
   pit and an old pit that had been worked years ago.

   He said it was a low passage, through which a man might get by crawling
   all the way, lying flat upon the ground-- the passage was very long,
   but they crept through it and at last they came out to light at the
   bottom of the other pit and their lives were saved. If my present way
   to Christ as a saint gets blocked up. If I cannot go straight up the
   shaft and see the Light of my father up yonder--there is an old
   working, the old fashioned way by which sinners go, by which poor
   thieves go, by which harlots go--come, I will crawl along lowly and
   humbly, flat upon the ground--I will crawl along till I see my Father
   and cry, "Father, I am not worthy to be called Your son. Make me as one
   of Your hired servants, so long as I may but dwell in Your house."

   In your very worst case you can still come as sinners. Jesus Christ
   came into the world to save sinners--call this to mind and you may have
   hope.

   III. I must have a few words with SEEKERS. Always in this congregation
   we have some who are seeking the Lord-- would to God we had many more!
   It were glorious preaching if all were either seeking or had found. If
   it were not for the mixed multitude who neither seek nor find, our work
   were easy work, indeed. Some of you are seeking God today and you are
   very much troubled with the fear that you cannot be saved. I will have
   a few words with you to recall to mind some common-place Truths of God
   which may give you hope.

   First of all some of you are troubled about the doctrine of election. I
   cannot, this morning, explain it to you. I believe it and receive it
   with joy! And you may rest assured, however much it troubles you, it is
   true. Though you may not like it, it is true! And remember it is not a
   matter of opinion as to what you like or do not like-- as to what you
   think or do not think--you must turn to the Bible and if you find it
   there you must believe it.

   Listen to me. You have got an idea that some persons will be sent to
   Hell, merely and only because it is the will of God that they should be
   sent there. Throw the idea overboard because it is a very wicked one
   and is not to be found in Scripture! There could not be a Hell inside
   the man's conscience who knew that he was wretched merely because God
   willed he should be--for the very essence of Hell is sin and a sense of
   having willfully committed it. There could not be the flames of Hell if
   there were not this conviction on the mind of the person suffering it,
   "I knew my duty but I did it not--I willfully sinned against God and I
   am here not because of anything He did or did not do, but because of my
   own sin."

   If you drive that dark thought away you may be on the road to comfort.
   Remember again, that whatever the doctrine of election may be or may
   not be, there is a free invitation in the Gospel given to needy
   sinners, "Whoever will, let him take of the water of life freely." Now
   you may say, "I cannot reconcile the two." There are a great many other
   things that you cannot do. God knows where these two things meet though
   you do not. And I hope you do not intend to wait till you are a
   philosopher before you will be saved--because it is likely enough that
   while you are trying to be wise by persistently remaining a practical
   fool you will find yourself in Hell where your wisdom will not avail
   you.

   God commands you to trust Christ and promises that all Believers shall
   be saved. Leave your difficulties till you have trusted Christ and then
   you will be in a capacity to understand them better than you do now. In
   order to understand Gospel doctrine you must believe in Christ first.
   What does Christ say, "No man comes unto the Father but by Me." Now
   election is the Father's work. The Father chooses sinners. Christ makes
   the Atonement. You must go, then, to Christ the atoning Sacrifice
   before you can understand the Father as the electing God. Do not
   persist in going to the Father first. Go to the Son as He tells you.

   Once more, remember that even if your own idea of the doctrine of
   election were the truth, yet if it were so, you can but perish should
   you seek the Lord--

   "I can but perish if I go, I am resolved to try; For if I stay away I
   know I must forever die. But if I die with mercy sought, When I the
   King have tried, That were to die, delightful thought, As sinner never
   died."

   Trust Christ even if you should perish and you shall never perish if
   you trust in Him! Well, if that difficulty were removed, I can suppose
   another, saying, "Ah, but my case is of great sin." Recall this to mind
   and you will have hope, namely, that "Jesus Christ came into the world
   to save sinners, of whom," Paul says, "I am chief." "I am chief." Paul
   was the chief of sinners and he went through the door of Mercy. And now
   there can be none greater than the chief, and where the chief went
   through you can go through! If the chief of sinners has been saved, why
   not you? Why not you?

   We heard Mr. Offord say the other day that he knew a good woman who,
   when the Salt-Ash Bridge was made down at Plymouth, would not go on it.
   She said she did not believe it was safe. She saw locomotive engines
   and trains go over it so that the bridge sustained hundreds of tons at
   a time, but she shook her head and said she wondered people were so
   immensely presumptuous as to cross it.

   When the bridge was totally clear and not an engine on it she was asked
   if she would not walk on it then. Well, she did venture a little way,
   but she trembled all the while for fear her weight should make it fall.
   It could bear hundreds of tons of steel but it could not bear her! You
   great Sinner, it is much the same case with you. The stupendous bridge
   which Christ has flung across the wrath of God will bear the weight of
   your sin, for it has borne ten thousands of thousands across before and
   will bear millions of sinners yet to the shore of their eternal rest.
   Call that to remembrance and you may have hope.

   "Yes," says one, "but I believe I have committed the unpardonable sin."
   My dear Brother, I believe you have not, but I want you to call one
   thing to remembrance and that is that the unpardonable sin is a sin
   which is unto death. Now a sin which is unto death means a sin which
   brings death on the conscience. The man who commits it never has any
   conscience afterwards--he is dead there. Now, you have some feeling.
   You have enough life to wish to be saved from sin. You have enough life
   to long to be washed in the precious blood of Jesus! You have not
   committed the unpardonable sin, therefore have hope.

   "All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men." "But,"
   you reply, "Oh, I cannot repent! My heart is so hard." Call to
   remembrance that Jesus Christ is exalted to give repentance and
   remission of sins and you may come to Him to get repentance and need
   not bring it to Him! Come without any repentance and ask Him to give it
   to you and He will give it. Rest assured there is no fear whatever that
   if the soul seeks softness and tenderness it has that softness and
   tenderness in a measure even now, and will have it to the fullest
   extent before long. "Oh, but," you say, "I have a general unfitness and
   incapacity for being saved." Then, dear Friend, I want you to call this
   to remembrance, that Jesus Christ has a general fitness and a general
   capacity for saving sinners.

   I do not know what you need, but I do know Christ has it. I do not know
   the full of your disease, but I do know Christ is the physician who can
   meet it. I do not know how hard and stubborn and stolid and ignorant
   and blind and dead your nature may be, but I do know that "Christ is
   able to save unto the uttermost them that come unto God by Him." What
   you are has nothing to do with the question, except that it is the
   mischief to be undone. The true answer to the question of how you are
   to be saved lies yonder in the bleeding body of the immaculate Lamb of
   God! Christ has all salvation in Himself. He is Alpha, He is Omega. He
   does not begin to save and leave you to perish, nor does He offer to
   complete what you must first begin.

   He is the foundation as well as the pinnacle. He commences with you as
   the green blade and He will finish with you as the full corn in the
   ear. O that I had a voice like the trumpet of God that shall wake the
   dead at last! If I might only have it to utter one sentence, it would
   be this one, "Your help is found in Christ." As for you, there never
   can be found anything hopeful in your human nature. It is death itself!
   It is rottenness and corruption. Turn, turn your eyes away from this
   despairing mass of black depravity and look to Christ! He is the
   sacrifice for human guilt. His is the righteousness that covers men and
   makes them acceptable before the Lord!

   Look to Him as you are--black, foul, guilty, leprous, condemned. Go as
   you are! Trust Jesus Christ to save you and remembering this, you shall
   have "a hope that makes not ashamed," which shall endure forever. I
   have labored to speak comfortable words and words in season and I have
   tried to speak them in homely language, too. But, O Comforter, what can
   we do without You? YOU must cheer our sadness. To comfort souls is
   God's own work! Let us conclude, then, with the words of the Savior's
   promise, "If I go away, I will send you another Comforter, who shall
   abide with you forever." And let our prayer be that He would abide with
   us to His own Glory and to our comfort forevermore. Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Lamentations 3:1-33.
     __________________________________________________________________

                              The Great Itinerant

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 22, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Who went about doing good." Acts 10:38.

   You will observe, if you read the chapter before us, that Peter's
   sermon was short and much to the point. He preached Jesus Christ to
   Cornelius immediately and unmistakably. He gave a very admirable sketch
   of the life of Jesus of which he affirmed himself to have been an
   eyewitness and he brought forward, in his closing sentence, just that
   simple Gospel which it is our joy to preach. "To Him all the Prophets
   witness, that through His name whoever believes in Him shall receive
   remission of sins."

   This should be an instructive example to all professed ministers of the
   Gospel. We might say less about other matters without loss if we would
   say more about the Lord Jesus. If we should omit some other teaching,
   if there were more of a savor of the name and of the Person of Jesus
   Christ in our ministry, the omissions might be tolerated. It is a
   strange thing that men should profess to be sent of God and yet talk
   about everything except the great message which they are sent to
   deliver!

   My errand as a minister is to preach Christ and it will avail me little
   to have been clear and earnest upon other points if I have neglected to
   set forth Christ Crucified. To put my own views of doctrine or moral
   practice in the place of Jesus is to put out the sun and supply its
   place with a farthing rush light--to take away the children's bread and
   offer them a stone. We commend Peter as an example to all who preach or
   teach, either in the street, the sick chamber, or the House of
   Prayer--do as Peter did--come at once to the soul of your ministry, and
   set forth Christ Crucified in plain and simple language.

   If any should plead that the subject should be adapted to the audience,
   we see from the narrative that there is sure to be something in the
   history of Christ applicable to the case before us. Peter purposely
   gave prominence to certain points in the history of the Master which
   would be most likely to enlist the sympathy of Cornelius. He says of
   Him, "He is Lord of all," as much as to say, "He is not Lord of the
   Jews only, but also of the Gentiles, and therefore, O Cornelius, His
   dominion reaches to you. He is to be worshipped and adored and He is to
   become a blessing and a propitiatory sacrifice, not only to Israel's
   hosts, but even to Italians. And therefore you, O Centurion, may take
   heart."

   Perhaps the words of our text were uttered by Peter concerning Christ
   because they also would be sure to attract the notice of a man who was
   "A devout man and one that feared God with all his house, which gave
   much alms to the people and prayed to God always." He did as much as
   say, "You go about doing good, Cornelius. It is the very soul of your
   life to help the needy, to feed the hungry and to clothe the
   naked--Jesus also went about doing good in a higher sense and I hold
   Him up to you as one to be beloved by every devout and generous heart."

   Other points are to be noticed in Peter's address which were evidently
   adapted to the case before him, but we have said enough to prove that
   there is something in the story of Jesus suitable to win the attention
   and to gain the heart of any congregation, large or small. Only let the
   Holy Spirit help us to dilate upon the Gospel of the Lord Jesus and we
   have no need to wander abroad for foreign themes. We can sit at the
   foot of the Cross and find a perpetually profitable subject there. No
   need to gather the sheaves of science, or the sweet flowers of
   prose--Christ Jesus is both our science and our poetry and as ministers
   we are complete in Him!

   When we come forth to preach Him and to lift Him up, we are armed from
   head to foot and rich with weapons for our spiritual warfare. Though
   learning and art have had no hand in fashioning our panoply, we need
   not fear that we shall meet a single foe who can withstand the terror
   of those celestial arms. God grant us Grace in all our teachings to
   keep close to Jesus Christ--for His love is a theme most fit for all
   cases and most sweet at all times.

   The few words which we have taken for our text are an exquisite
   miniature of the Lord Jesus Christ. "He went about doing good." There
   are not many touches, but they are the strokes of a master's pencil.
   The portrait cannot be mistaken for anyone else. The mightiest
   conquerors may gaze upon its beauties but they cannot claim that it is
   intended to portray their lives. Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon--these
   went about conquering, burning, destroying, murdering. They went about
   not doing good. Prophets too, who professed to have been sent of God,
   have compassed sea and land to make proselytes, but the good which they
   accomplished none could see.

   Mahomet's career was fraught with incalculable evil. The few good men
   and true, who, like Howard, have perambulated the world seeking to
   minister to the necessities of mankind, have wept over the heavenly
   portrait and sighed that they are not more like it. This is what they
   sought to be and so far as they copied this portrait, this is what they
   were. But they fall short of the original and are not slow to confess
   their shortcomings. What Peter here draws in words, God's Divine Grace
   drew, in some measure, in lines of real life in the case of Howard and
   some other followers of Jesus of Nazareth.

   Still, in the highest and fullest sense, these words are applicable to
   none but the Master, for His followers could not do such good as He
   achieved. His is the model and theirs the humble copy. His the classic
   type and theirs the modest imitation. He did good and good only--but
   the best of men, being men at the best--sow mingled seed. And if they
   scatter handfuls of wheat, there is here and there a grain of rye.
   However carefully they may select the grains, yet the cockle and the
   hemlock will fall from their hands as well as the good seed of the
   kingdom. Of the Master and only of the Master is it true in the fullest
   and the broadest and most unguarded sense, "He went about doing good."

   Two things this morning--first I shall want you, dear Brethren, to
   consider Him. And then, in the second place, to consider yourselves.

   I. The first occupation will be pleasing, as well as profitable. Let us
   CONSIDER HIM.

   1. Consider first, His object. He went about, but His travel was no
   listless motion, no purposeless wandering here and there--"He went
   about doing good." O Man of God, have a purpose and devote your whole
   life to it! Be not an arrow shot at random, as in child's play! Choose
   your target, and swift as the bullet whizzes to the mark, so fly
   onwards towards the great aim and object of your life. Christ's object
   is described in these words, "doing good." Of this we may say that this
   was His only purpose.

   Long before He took upon Himself the nature of man, or even before man
   was formed of the dust of the earth, the heart of Jesus Christ was set
   upon doing good. In the Eternal Council in which the sacred Three
   entered into stipulations of the Everlasting Covenant, Christ Jesus
   became the Surety of that Covenant in order that He might do good--good
   in the highest sense--good in snatching His people from the misery
   which sin would bring upon them and good in manifesting the glorious
   attributes of God in a splendor which could not otherwise have
   surrounded them.

   His delights of old were with the sons of men, because they afforded
   Him an opportunity, such as He could find nowhere else, of doing good.
   He did good, it is true, among the angels, for the heavenly harps owe
   all their music to His Presence. Among the devils there was no room for
   positive good. They were given over to evil--but even there restraining
   goodness found work for itself in binding them down in iron bands lest
   their mischief should grow too rampant. On earth, however, was the
   widest scope and amplest room for goodness in its largest sense--not
   merely the goodness which restrains evil and the goodness which rewards
   virtue--but that greater goodness which descends to sin-stricken
   mortals and lifts them up from the dunghill of their miserable
   degradation to set them upon the Throne of Glory.

   It was the eternal purpose of the Lord Jesus Christ, before the lamps
   of Heaven were kindled or stars began to glitter in the vault of night,
   that He would do good. This was His practical object, when He made His
   ever-memorable descent from the Throne of His splendor to the manger of
   His poverty. Angels might well sing at Bethlehem, "Glory to God in the
   highest and on earth peace, good will toward men," for Jesus Christ
   came not condemning the world, but doing good.

   His Presence in the manger did good. As it cheered both rich magi and
   poor shepherd, both learned and illiterate, both Simeon and Anna, with
   the knowledge that God had come down to men. His childhood afterwards
   did good, for though it was so unobtrusive and obscure that a few words
   suffice to set it forth, yet He has become the very mirror of
   childhood's dutiful obedience to this day. His adult life was one
   practical carrying-out of the solitary object which brought Him from
   the Throne of Glory to the abodes of sinful men. He "went about doing
   good."

   Nor was this His purpose merely and the object of His errand, but His
   official prerogative. He received the name of

   Jesus at His birth, "For He shall save His people from their sins." He
   was named "Christ," because the Spirit of the Lord was upon Him and He
   was anointed to preach good tidings to the meek and to open the prisons
   to them that were bound. Jesus Christ is the title which bespeaks One
   whose office it is to do good. Mention any name you please which
   belongs to the Savior and you will see that it is incumbent upon Him,
   ex officio, to go about doing good.

   Is He a Shepherd? He must do good to His sheep. Is He a Husband? He
   must love His Church and give Himself for her, that He may cleanse and
   perfect her. Is He a Friend? He "sticks closer than a brother" and does
   good. Is He "the Lion of the tribe of Judah?" It is not to do damage or
   mischief to innocence and weakness, but that, strong as a lion when he
   tears his prey, He may rend in pieces the foe of truth and goodness. Is
   he a Lamb? Here His goodness shows itself most completely, for He lays
   down His life that His Israel may go free when the destroying angel
   smites Egypt. Everywhere it was His peculiar prerogative and His
   special business to go about doing good.

   But more, it was not only His intention and the object of His errand
   and His prerogative, but His actual performance. He did good in all
   senses. Jesus Christ worked physical benefit among the sons of men. How
   many blind eyes first saw the light through the touch of His fingers!
   How many silent ears heard the charming voice of affection after He had
   said, "Be open"! Even the gates of death were no barrier to the errands
   of His goodness. The widow at the gate of Nain felt her heart leap
   within her for joy when her son was restored. And Mary and Martha were
   glad when Lazarus came forth from his grave. Jesus Christ did good
   physically.

   We have thought that our Lord did this not merely to show His power and
   universality of His benevolence and to teach spiritual Truth by acted
   parables, but also to say to us in these days, "Followers of Jesus, do
   good in all sorts of ways. You may think it is your special calling to
   feed souls, but remember that your Master broke loaves and fishes to
   hungry bodies. You may deem it your chief object to instruct the
   ignorant, but remember that He healed the sick. You may make it your
   chiefjoy to pray for the healing of sick spirits, but remember that He
   rescued many bodies from incurable disease."

   As much as lies in us, let us do good unto all men, and good of all
   kinds, too, though it is specially to the household of faith, and
   specially in a spiritual sense. Let no act of mercy seem beneath him
   who is a follower of the Man that went about doing good. There is a
   spirit springing up among us which is very dangerous though it wears
   the garb of excessive spirituality. It is impractical and
   unchristlike--a spirit which talks in this fashion--"The sons of men
   tried to improve the world and make it better, but as for Enoch, the
   man of God, he knew that the world was so bad that it was of no avail
   to attempt to better it and therefore he left it alone and walked with
   God."

   It may be well, they say, for such carnal-minded Christians as some of
   us to try and improve society and to give a better tone to morals, but
   these dear spiritual Brethren are so taken up with Divine things and so
   assured that the mission is of a supercelestial character that they
   will have nothing to do with blessing mankind, being quite sufficiently
   occupied with blessing themselves and one another. I pray God that we
   may never fall into the impractical speculations and separations of
   certain Brethren whose superior sanctity they must allow us to suspect.
   The large-heartedness of the Lord Jesus Christ is one of the most
   glorious traits in His Character. He scattered good of all sorts on all
   sides. Let us, if we profess to be His followers, never be straitened
   even by pretended spirituality. Do good "as much as lies in you," to
   the utmost extent of your power and let that be of every sort.

   It strikes me that the Lord Jesus also did much moral good. Where He
   did not save spiritually, yet He elevated. I am not sure that that poor
   adulteress was ever truly converted and yet I know that He said,
   "Neither do I condemn you: go, and sin no more." And I can well believe
   that in this respect, at least, she would sin no more. I do not know
   that the Pharisees ever became followers of the Man of Nazareth, and
   yet I cannot conceive that they could have listened to His stern
   rebukes against their hypocrisy without being in some measure humbled,
   if not enlightened. Or if they were not better, at any rate, their
   professions would not be so readily allowed.

   Society would receive, as it were, a tonic from those sharp and bitter
   words of the Master and become too strong and masculine to receive any
   longer the lofty boastings of those mere pretenders. Jesus Christ, when
   He sat down on the mount, did not deliver a spiritual sermon of the
   style commonly classed under that head. That sermon on the mount is,
   for the most part, morality--good high, heavenly morality--higher than
   any teacher ever reached before. But there is very little in it about
   justification by faith or concerning Atonement! Very little about the
   doctrine of election, the work of the Holy Spirit, or final
   perseverance.

   The fact is the Master was doing moral as well as spiritual good. And
   coming among a degraded people who had set darkness for light and light
   for darkness, bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter, He thought it a
   part of His vocation to preach to them truth on that subject as well as
   upon the higher themes concerning His advent and His salvation. Dear
   Friends, this admonishes us to seek the moral good of the people among
   whom we dwell! The Christian minister must not lay aside his ministry
   to become the mere moralist lecturer, but he may and should lecture
   upon morals--and he can say some things in lectures which he could not
   say in sermons. Let him, by all means, occasionally leave the pulpit
   for the platform if he can do service to society!

   Let him do good in every possible shape and way. I think that it is the
   Christian minister's place not simply to preach the high and glorious
   doctrine of the Cross, but also to deal with the current sins of
   mankind as did the Prophets of old--and to inculcate those virtues most
   needed in the State--as did men God sent in the ages which are past.
   Jesus Christ went about doing good, we say, of a moral kind as well as
   of a spiritual order, but still the Savior's great good was spiritual.
   This was the great end that He was driving at--the bringing out of a
   people prepared to receive Himself and His salvation--He came preaching
   Divine Grace and peace.

   His great object was the spiritual emancipation of the bondaged souls
   of men. Beloved, how He sought after this! What tears and cries went up
   to God from the mountain's bleak summit! With what earnest intercession
   did He plead with men when He addressed them concerning repentance and
   faith! "Woe unto you, Bethsaida! Woe unto you, Chorazin!" were not
   words spoken by One who had a tearless eye. "Woe unto you, Capernaum!"
   was not the desolating curse of One who had a hard, unsympathetic
   heart.

   The Savior, when He wept over Jerusalem, was only doing once before men
   what He did all His life before God. He wept over sinners! He longed
   for their salvation! "Never man spoke like that Man." Having the
   highest Truth, He spoke it after the highest fashion. Never the
   ostentation of eloquence, never the affectation of oratory--but ever
   the earnest, still, small pleading voice which "does not break the
   bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax." He went about in His daily
   preaching instructing the people because He found them as sheep without
   a shepherd, and therefore "He taught them many things."

   Physical, moral, spiritual good, good of all sorts the Savior did--and
   while I close this point as to His object of life, let me say that He
   did something more than all this--He worked enduring good which abides
   with us now. The good that holy men do is imperishable. The Scripture
   says, "Their works do follow them," but not to the grave--their works
   ascend upward. If our works followed our bodies, they would rot in the
   tomb. But they follow our souls and therefore mount up to immortality.
   Look upon the world and see whether Jesus Christ is not still in Spirit
   going about doing good! He has gone up to Glory, but the Spirit of His
   life and of His teaching is still among us.

   And what is His religion doing? Ask of our sires and they will tell you
   how this land was translated from a region of savages into the abode of
   peace and joy! Look yourselves, in your own day, to the far off islands
   of the south and see how they have been transformed from dens of the
   wild blood-loving cannibals into abodes of civilized men! Jesus
   Christ's Gospel flies like an angel through the midst of Heaven
   proclaiming good news to men! And wherever its foot rests but for an
   hour, it transforms the desert into an Eden and makes the wilderness
   blossom as the rose! May the Savior help us so to live that when we die
   we may have sown some seeds which shall blossom over our tomb.

   Thus we have given an outline of the Savior's doing good. May we add
   this sentence as a comfort to any here who are seeking Jesus. If it
   were His eternal purpose and His life's mission to do good, and He went
   about to find out the objects of it, why should He not do good to you?
   If He healed the blind. If He gave spiritual sight, why should He not
   give it to you? O may the desire be breathed by you, poor seeking Soul,
   breathed solemnly but hopefully to Him--"O You who in the days of Your
   flesh did take pity upon misery and wretchedness in every shape, take
   pity upon me! Save me with Your great salvation!"

   Rest assured, beloved Hearer, that prayer will not go up to Heaven in
   vain! His ears are still open to hear the cry of woe and His hands are
   still ready to giving the healing touch and the voice to say, "I will,
   be you clean." May He do good in you this morning!

   2. A short time may be profitably spent in considering the mode in
   which this object was accomplished. We are told that He "went about
   doing good," which seems to suggest several points. First of all He did
   the good Personally. He "went about doing good." He might, if He had
   chosen, have selected His place and having seated Himself, He might
   have sent out His Apostles as ambassadors to do good in His place. But
   you will recollect that when He sent them out, it was not that they
   might be proxies, but that they might be heralds. He sent them two and
   two unto every place where He Himself would go.

   They were to be to Him what John the Baptist had been at His first
   coming. Jesus Christ entered the field of labor in Person. It is
   remarkable how the evangelists constantly tell us that He touched the
   leper with His own finger. That He visited the bedside of those sick
   with fever and in cases where He was asked to speak the word only at a
   distance, He did not usually comply with such a request, but went
   Himself to the sick bed and there Personally worked the cure. A lesson
   to us if we would do good well--do it ourselves.

   There are some things which we cannot do ourselves. We cannot remain
   among our families in England, for instance, and preach the Gospel in
   Hindustan. We cannot be engaged this morning in listening to the Word
   and at the same time visiting the lodging house or den of iniquity in
   some back street. There are some works of mercy which are best
   performed by others--but we can make these more personal by looking
   after the worker and taking a deeper interest in him--and by attending
   him with our prayers. I wish that much more benevolence were performed
   by men themselves.

   I do not care to speak against Societies! But it is such an odd thing
   that if I have twenty-one shillings to give away, I cannot give them to
   a deserving family myself. I must make it into about fifteen shillings
   before it goes at all by paying it into a royal something or other
   Society! And then it proceeds by a roundabout method and at last is
   delivered to the poor by a mere hand without a soul. And it is received
   by the poor, not as a gift of charity, but rather as a contribution
   from an unknown something with a secretary which needs a place in which
   to drop its funds.

   Why should you not go and give away the twenty-one shillings yourself,
   lovingly and tenderly? It will be better than letting somebody else
   pare it down to fifteen and give it away coldly and officially. So much
   depends upon the way of doing good. The look, the word, the prayer, the
   tear will often be more valuable to the widow than that half-crown
   which you have given her. I heard a poor person once say, "Sir, I went
   to So-and-So for help and he refused me. But I would sooner be refused
   by him than I would have money given to me by So-and-So," mentioning
   another who gave it with a sort of, "Well, you know I do not approve of
   giving anything to such as you are, but here it is--you must have it I
   suppose, so be off with you."

   Give your alms away yourselves and you will learn, by so doing, it will
   enable you to exercise Christian virtues. You will win a joy which it
   were not worthwhile to lose, and you will confer, in addition to the
   benevolence that you bestow, a blessing which cannot be conferred by
   the person who is your substitute. He went about doing good. He did it
   Himself. Oh, some of you--preach yourselves, I pray you! Talk to the
   Sunday school children yourselves! Give away tracts--that is well
   enough if you cannot speak--but do try and talk yourselves. The
   influence of that hand laid upon your friend's shoulder, those eyes of
   yours looking into his eyes as you say, "Friend, I wish you were
   converted, my soul longs for your salvation"--there is more in that
   influence than in a whole library of tracts!

   Seek souls yourselves! Fish with your own hooks. You cannot help being
   successful if you imitate your Master and do good yourselves in the
   power of the Holy Spirit. The Savior not only "went about doing good"
   Personally, but His very Presence did good. The Presence of the Savior
   is, in itself, a good, apart from the blessings which He bestowed. At
   the sight of Him courage revived! Drooping faith grew strong! Hope
   brushed a tear from her eye and smiled! The sight of Jesus Christ as
   once it calmed the waves and hushed the winds, did so a thousand times
   in men souls.

   Even devils, when they saw Him, cried out and trembled. Sinners wept at
   the sight of His pitying goodness. The woman who broke the alabaster
   box of precious ointment felt that the only fit place to break it was
   near to Him. His Presence made her sacred action yet more sweet. What
   cannot men do when Christ is there? And, O Beloved, if we are anything
   like our Master, our presence will be of some value. There are some of
   my Brethren, when I see them, I feel strong. You go into a little
   Prayer Meeting and numbers are not there--but such a saint is there and
   you feel, "Well, if he is there, there is a Prayer Meeting at once."

   You have work to do. It is very hard and toilsome, and you cannot
   prosper in it. But a Brother drops into your little Sunday school, or
   into your class and looks at it and you feel, "Well, if I have that
   man's sympathy, I can go on again." Therefore be careful to give your
   presence as much as you can to every good work and do not isolate
   yourself from those actually engaged in labors of love. Does not our
   Lord's going about doing good set forth His incessant activity? He did
   not only the good which was round about Him, which came close to
   hand--He did not only the good which was brought to Him as when men
   were brought on their beds and laid at His feet--he "went about." He
   could not be satisfied to be still. Throughout the whole land of Judea,
   from Dan to Beersheba, He trod its weary acres. There was scarcely a
   village or a hamlet which had not been gladdened by the sight of Him.
   Even Jericho, accursed of old, had been blessed by His Presence and a
   great sinner had been made a great saint. He went everywhere casting
   salt into the bitter waters and sowing with sunshine the abodes of
   sadness. He was ever active in God s service!

   Oh, the creeping, crawling manner in which some people serve the Lord!
   The very way in which some people mumble through religious exercises is
   enough to make one sick at heart, to think that the solemn offices of
   religion should be entrusted to such inanimate beings! If God of old
   said of Laodicea that He would spew that Church out of His mouth, what
   will He do with those professors in modern times who are the very pink
   of propriety, but who were never touched with fire from Heaven and know
   not what the word "zeal" means? Our Master was here and there, and
   everywhere! Let us gird up the loins of our mind and be not weary in
   doing well, but be "steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work
   of the Lord."

   Does not the text also imply that Jesus Christ went out of His way to
   do good? "He went about doing good." There were short cuts which He
   would not take because there were persons dwelling in the roundabout
   way who must be met with. "He must needs go through Samaria." It is
   said that that city lay in the straightest way to Jerusalem. So it was,
   but it was not the right way, because the Samaritans so hated those
   whose faces were towards Jerusalem, that they maltreated them whenever
   they could. Yet the Master did not care for perils of waylaying
   enemies. He did not select the smoothest or the safest road, but He
   selected that in which there was a woman to whom He could do good.

   He sits down on the well. I know it was not merely weariness that made
   Him sit there. And when He said, "I thirst: give Me to drink," it was
   not merely that He was thirsty! He had another weariness--He was
   patient over that woman's sin and longed to reveal Himself to her! He
   had another thirst--He did not mean merely, "Give me water out of that
   well." When He said, "Give me to drink," He meant, "Give Me your
   heart's love. My soul pants for it. I want to see you--a poor
   adulterous sinner--saved from sin."

   How else do we understand the words which He said to His disciples,
   when they wondered that He spoke with the woman? He said, "I have meat
   to eat that you know not of, for it is My meat and My drink to do the
   will of Him that sent Me." He had received meat and drink in seeing
   that woman leave her water pot and go away to tell her fellow sinners,
   "Come, see a Man which told me all things that ever I did. Is not this
   the Christ?" He went round about after the objects of His gracious
   desires. So must the Christian. You must not be content to do good in
   the regular circle of your move-ments--that is so far so good, but go
   beyond your old line! Break through the bounds of propriety every now
   and then and do an odd thing.

   I believe that sometimes these odd expedients achieve more than regular
   methods. That was a quaint expedient of those who broke up the roof to
   let down a palsied man that Jesus might heal him. There has been a good
   deal said about that roof. According to some people it was not a roof
   at all but a sort of awning! But this morning we will stick to our old
   version which tells us, "they broke up the tiling." This must have made
   it a very bad predicament for those down below! but I dare say those up
   top argued--"Well, the Savior is there and if anybody shall be hurt by
   a tile or two He can easily heal them. Anyhow we will get this man
   before Him, for this is the case in which we feel most concerned." Ah,
   dear Friends, many people are so particular about making a little dust
   or breaking up a few tiles! But our mind is, "never care about that,"
   there will be time to clean the repair after souls are saved and for so
   great an end as salvation we may neglect some few niceties and
   punctilios and be most of all vehemently desirous that we may do good.

   We have not quite done with the text yet. It means, too, that Jesus
   Christ went far in doing good. The district of Palestine was not very
   large, but you will observe that He went to the limit of it. He was, as
   it were, the bishop of the Holy Land and He never went out of the
   diocese, for He said He was not sent except to the lost sheep of the
   house of Israel. But He went to the outer limits of it. He went to the
   coasts of Tyre and Sidon. If He might not go over the mark, yet He will
   go up to the edge. So if there should happen to be any limit to your
   doing good in any particular place, at least go to the end of the
   limit.

   However, I rather like Rowland Hill's thought--when he was blamed for
   preaching out of his parish, he claimed that he never did so, for the
   whole world was his parish. Make the world the sphere of your
   occupation, according to the parable, "the field is the world." I
   admire the Lord's going about not simply for the miles He traveled, but
   for the space of character over which He passed. He "went about." It is
   nothing wonderful that He went as far as Tyre and Sidon, but it is much
   that He went as far as publicans and sinners! I do not wonder that He
   went from Dan to Beersheba, but I have wondered often that He went so
   far as to save harlots by His Grace.

   We may in this sense go about doing good without traveling across the
   sea. A minister once announced to his congregation one Sunday morning,
   "I am going on a mission to the heathen." Now he had not told his
   deacons about it and they looked at one another. The good people in the
   congregation, some of them, began to take out their pocket
   handkerchiefs. They thought their minister was going to leave them--he
   was so useful and necessary to them that they felt sad at the bare idea
   of loosing him. "But" he added, "I shall not be out of town."

   So you may go on a mission to the heathen without going out of this
   huge town of ours. You might almost preach to every sort of literal
   heathen within the bounds of London--to Parthians, Medes and
   Elamites--and the dwellers of Mesopotamia. There are men of every
   color, speaking every language under Heaven, now living in London. And
   if you want to convert Mahometans, Turks, Chinese, men from Bengal,
   Java, or Borneo, you may find them all here! There are always
   representatives of every nation close at our door. If you want men who
   have gone far in sin, great foreigners in that respect, you need not
   certainly leave London for that! You shall find men and women rotten
   with sin and reeking in the nostrils of God with their abominations.
   You may go about doing good and your railway ticket need not cost you
   one farthing!

   No doubt Christ's perseverance is intended in our text, for when
   rejected in one place, He goes to another. If one will not hear,
   another will. The unity of His purpose is also hinted at. He does not
   go about with two aims, but this one absorbs all His heart--"doing
   good." And the success, too, of His purpose is here intended. He went
   about and not only tried to do good, but He did it--He left the world
   better than He found it when He ascended to His Father God.

   3. One moment concerning the motive of Christ's doing good. It is not
   far to seek. He did good partly because He could not help it. It was
   His Nature to do good. He was all goodness and as the clouds which are
   full of rain empty themselves upon the earth, even so must He. You will
   have observed that all the good things which God has made are
   diffusive. There is light-- you cannot confine light within narrow
   limits. Suppose we were to grow so bigoted and conceited as to conceive
   that we had all the light in the world inside this Tabernacle. We might
   have iron shutters made to keep the light in--yet it is very probable
   that the light would not agree with our bigotry and would not come in
   at all--but leave us in the dark for wanting to confine it.

   With splendid mirrors, Turkish carpets, jewelry, fine pictures and rare
   statuary you may court the light to come into palatial halls. It comes,
   it is true, but as it enters it whispers, "And I passed through the
   iron grating of a prison, just now. I shone upon the poor cottager
   beneath the rude thatched roof. I streamed through the window out of
   which half the glass was gone and gleamed as cheerily and willingly
   upon the rags of poverty as in these marble halls." You cannot clip the
   wings of the morning, or monopolize the golden rays of the sun! What a
   space the light has traversed doing good! Millions of miles it has come
   streaming from the sun and yet further from yonder fixed star.

   Light! Why could you not be contented with your own sphere? Why journey
   so far from home? Missionary rays come to us from so vast a distance
   that they must have been hundreds of years in reaching us and yet their
   mission is not over, for they flash on to yet remoter worlds. So with
   the air--as far as the world is concerned the air will throw itself
   down the shaft of the deepest coal pit, climb the loftiest Alp--and
   although men madly strive to shut it out--it will thrust itself into
   the fever lair and cool the brow of cholera.

   So with water. Here it comes dropping from every inch of the cloudy
   sky, flooding the streets, flushing the foul sewers and soaking into
   the dry soil. Everywhere it will come, for water claims to have its
   influence felt everywhere. Fire, too! Who can bind its giant hands? The
   King cannot claim it as a royal perquisite. Among those few sticks
   which the widow woman with the red cloak has been gathering in the
   woods, it burns as readily as in Her Majesty's palace. It is the Nature
   of Jesus to diffuse Himself--it is His life to do good. His grand
   motive, no doubt, is the display of the glorious attributes of God.

   He went about doing good in order that Jehovah might be revealed in His
   splendor to the eyes of adoring men. He is the manifestation of
   Godhead. He is the express image of His Father's Person. "In Him dwells
   all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." And through Heaven and earth,
   and sky and sun and stars, all show forth something of the goodness of
   God, yet the life of Jesus is the fullest and clearest manifestation of
   the beneficence of Deity that ever will be accorded to the sons of men.
   This is an object worthy of God, to manifest Himself and such an object
   Christ set before Him when He came to do good among the sons of men.

   1 have not said enough about the Savior, but still as much as time
   allows us and I will close this point with this one thing--if Jesus
   Christ went about doing good and if His motive was simply God's
   Glory--poor troubled Sinner--cannot He glorify God in you? You need
   pardon--you will be an illustrious instance of God's Grace if He should
   ever save you! Have hope. If Jesus Christ goes about, you are not too
   far off. If He looks upon the most forlorn, you are not in too
   desperate a plight. Cry to Him when your spirit is overwhelmed! Look to
   the Rock that is higher than you! "From the ends of the earth have I
   cried unto You, O God and You heard me." May it be your joy today to
   find Him your Friend, who "went about doing good."

   II. We were in the second place to CONSIDER OURSELVES. This is the
   application of the subject. Consider ourselves, then, as to the past,
   with sorrow and shamefacedness. Have we gone about doing good? I fear
   there are some here who never did any spiritual good! The tree is
   corrupt and it cannot bring forth good fruit. The fountain is bitter
   and it cannot yield sweet water. You must be born again before you can
   go about doing good! While your nature is as father Adam left it, good
   cannot come from you. "There is none that does good, no not one."

   How clearly this is true in some persons, as proved by their very
   profession. The profession of some men is one in which they cannot hope
   to do good. There are some in all callings who either do positive harm,
   or at any rate cannot imagine that they are doing any good. Let them
   repent! "Every tree that brings not forth good fruit is hewn down and
   cast into the fire." God grant that neither our character nor our
   vocation may stand in the way of our doing good!

   But you who have new hearts and rights spirits and are saved by faith
   in the precious blood of Jesus, have you done all the good you could? I
   dare not say yes--I wish I could dare it! No, Master, there must have
   been many times when I might have served You when I have not done it. I
   have been an unprofitable servant. I have not done what was my duty to
   have done.

   Ah, some of you have missed a world of joy in having done so little
   good. You have not given, therefore you are not increased. You never
   gave to others much, and so they have not given back to you full
   measure, pressed down and running over. You have not borne the burdens
   of others and so your own burden has become heavy and intolerable.
   Christians, in looking back upon the past, must you not drop tears of
   regret? And do you not bless that preserving love which still follows
   you? Yes, which will never let you go! And in spite of your barrenness
   and unfruitfulness, it will not cease to work upon you till it has made
   you meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light--who
   day without night serve God in His Temple!

   As to the future. The old question comes up--if any man today says, "I
   am resolved to go about doing good"--is he able to do it? And again,
   the reply comes--we must first be good, or else we cannot do good. The
   only way to be good is to seek to the good One, the good Master! If you
   have a new heart and a right spirit, then go your way and serve Him!
   But if not, pause awhile. Unto the wicked, God says, "What have you to
   do to declare My statutes?" He will have clean-handed men to do His
   work! Wash first in the bronze laver if you would be a priest. God will
   not have men for His servants who would defile the sacred place. "Be
   you clean that bear the vessels of the Lord."

   God give us to rest implicitly upon the Lord Jesus Christ by a living
   faith and so to be cleansed in His precious blood. And then we may
   resolve to go forth and live for Him. Have we any work to do now that
   we can set about at once? If we have, whatever our hands find to do,
   let us do it. Let us not be asking for greater abilities than we have.
   If we can get them, let us do so--but meanwhile let us use what we
   have. Go, Housewife, to your house, and from the lowest chamber to the
   top go about doing good--here is range enough for you!

   Go, Teacher, to your little school and among those boys or girls, let
   your example imitate Christ, and there is range enough for you! Go,
   Worker, to your shop and among your fellow workmen. Let fall here and
   there a word for Christ! Above all, let your example shine, and there
   is work for you. You domestic servants, the kitchen is sphere enough
   for you. You shall go about doing good from the dresser to the
   fireplace and you shall have width enough and breadth enough to make it
   a kingdom consecrated to God!

   Without leaving your position, any one of you--without giving up the
   plow, or the cobbler's lap stone, or the needle, or the plane, or the
   saw, any business--without any of you good sisters wanting to be nuns,
   or any of us putting on the serge and becoming monks--in our own
   calling let us go about doing good! The best preparation for it will be
   to renew our dedication to Christ, be much in earnest prayer, seek the
   sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit and then go forth in our
   Master's strength with this as our resolve--that as imitators of Jesus
   Christ it shall be said of us, "He went about doing good."

   May God add His blessing for the Savior's sake. Amen.

                                Preceding Grace

   [This sermon was originally titled "Prevenient Grace."]

   A SERMON PREACHED BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE,
   NEWINGTON.

   " When it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb and
   called me by His Grace, to reveal His Son in me." Galatians 1:15.

   You all know the story of the Apostle Paul. He had been a persecutor
   and went armed with letters to Damascus to hail men and women and drag
   them to prison. On the road there he saw a light exceedingly
   bright--above the brightness of the sun--and a voice spoke out of
   Heaven to him saying, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?" By this
   miraculous interposition he was converted--three days he spent in
   darkness. But when Ananias came to tell him of the Gospel of Jesus
   Christ, there fell from his eyes, as it were, scales. He was baptized,
   became the most mighty of all Christian teachers, and could truly say
   that he was not a whit behind the very chief of the Apostles.

   Paul's conversion is generally considered so very remarkable for its
   suddenness and distinctness and truly it is. Yet, at the same time, it
   is no exception to the general rule of conversions, but is rather a
   type, or model, or pattern of the way in which God shows forth His
   long-suffering to them that are led to believe on Him. It appears from
   my text, however, that there is another part of Paul's history which
   deserves our attention quite as much as the suddenness of his
   conversion, namely, the fact that although he was suddenly converted,
   yet God had had thoughts of mercy towards him from his very birth.

   God did not begin to work with him when he was on the road to Damascus.
   That was not the first occasion on which eyes of love had darted upon
   this chief of sinners. Paul declares that God had separated him and set
   him apart even from his mother's womb that he might, by-and-by, be
   called by Grace and have Jesus Christ revealed in him! I selected this
   text, not so much for its own sake as to give me an opportunity for
   saying a little this evening upon a doctrine not often touched upon,
   namely, that of PRECEDING GRACE, or the Grace which comes before
   regeneration and conversion.

   I think we sometimes overlook it. We do not attach enough importance to
   the Grace of God in its dealings with men before He actually brings
   them to Himself. Paul says that God had designs of love towards him
   even before He had called him out of the dead world into spiritual
   life.

   I. To begin, then, let us talk for a little while upon THE PURPOSE OF
   GOD PRECEDING SAVING GRACE AS IT MAY CLEARLY BE SEEN DEVELOPING ITSELF
   IN HUMAN HISTORY. You generally judge what a man's purpose is by his
   actions. If you saw a man very carefully making molds in the sand, then
   watched him take several pieces of iron and melt them down. And if you
   further noticed him pouring the melted iron into the molds, you might
   not know precisely what class of machine he was making, but you would
   very justly conclude that he was making some part of an engine or other
   machinery. Perhaps you might guess a beam, or a lever, or a crank, or a
   wheel--and according to what you saw the molds in the sand to be you
   would form your idea of what the man was intending to make.

   Now, when I look at the life of a man, even before conversion, I think
   I can discover something of God's molding and fashioning in him even
   before regenerating Grace comes into his heart. Let me give you an
   illustration of my course of thought. When God created man--we are told
   in the book of Genesis--He made him "out of the dust of the earth."
   Mark him beneath his Maker's hand, the framework of a man, the
   tabernacle for an immortal soul--a man made of clay, fully made I
   suppose, and perfect in all respects excepting one and that soon
   followed--for after God had formed him out of the dust, then He
   breathed into his nostrils the breath of Life and man became a living
   soul.

   Now it strikes me that during the early part of the history of the
   people whom God means to save, though they have not received into their
   hearts any spiritual life, nor experienced any of the work of
   regeneration, yet their life before conversion is really a working of
   them in the clay. Let us endeavor to bring this out more distinctly.
   Can you not perceive God's purpose in the Apostle Paul when you think
   of the singular gifts with which he was endowed? Here was a man, a
   rhetorician so noble that there are in his works passages of eloquence
   not to be equaled, much less excelled, by Demosthenes and Cicero.

   As a logician his arguments are most conclusive as well as profound.
   Never had man such eagle eyes to pierce into the depths of a matter!
   Never had man such eagle wings to mount up into its sublimities! He
   argues out questions so difficult to understand that at all times they
   have been the battlegrounds of controversies! And yet he seems to
   perceive them clearly and distinctly and to unfold and expound them
   with a precision of language not to be misunderstood. All Apostles of
   Jesus Christ put together are not equal to Paul in the way of teaching.
   Truly he might have said of them all, "You are but as children compared
   with me."

   Peter dashes, and dashes gloriously against the adversary! But Peter
   cannot build up, nor instruct like the great Apostle of the Gentiles.
   He has to say of Paul's writings that they, "contain some things hard
   to be understood." Peter can confirm, but scarcely can he understand
   Paul--for where intellect is concerned, Paul is far, far above him.
   Paul seems to have been endowed by God with one of the most intelligent
   brains that ever filled human cranium and to have been gifted with an
   intellect which towered far above anything that we find elsewhere.

   Had Paul been merely a natural man, I do not doubt but what he would
   take the place either of Milton among the poets, or of Bacon among the
   philosophers. He was, in deed and in truth, a mastermind. Now, when I
   see such a man as this cast by God in the mold of Nature, I ask
   myself--"What is God's purpose? What is He doing here?" As every man
   has a purpose, so also has God, and I think I see in all this that God
   foreknew that such a man was necessary to be raised up as a vessel
   through whom He might convey to the world the hidden treasures of the
   Gospel. Such a man was needed so that God might speak His great things
   by him!

   You will say, probably, that God reveals great things by fools. I beg
   your pardon. God did once permit an ass to speak, but it was a very
   small thing that he said--for any ass might readily have said it.
   Whenever there is a wise thing to be said, a wise man is always chosen
   to say it. Look the whole Bible through and you will find that the
   Revelation is always congruous to the person to whom it is given. You
   do not find Ezekiel blessed with a Revelation like that of Isaiah.
   Ezekiel is all imagination, therefore he must soar on the eagle's
   wings. Isaiah is all affection and boldness and therefore he must speak
   with evangelical fullness.

   God does not give Nahum's Revelation to the herdsman Amos--the herdsman
   Amos cannot speak like Nahum, nor can Nahum speak like Amos. Each man
   is after his own order and a man of this masterly order of mind, like
   the Apostle Paul, must have been created, it seems to me, for no other
   end than to be the appropriate means of revealing to us the fullness
   and the blessing of the Gospel of peace! Mark, again, the Apostle's
   education. Paul was a Jew, not half Greek and half Jew, but a pure Jew
   of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews, speaking the Jews'
   native tongue and not a stranger to the ancient speech of Israel.

   There was nothing in the traditions of the Jews which Paul did not know
   and understand. He was educated at the feet of Gamaliel. The best
   master of the age is selected to be the master of the hopeful young
   scholar and the school in which he is placed must be a Rabinnical one.
   Now, just observe in this the purpose of God. Paul's life-long struggle
   was to be with Jewish superstition. In Iconium, in Lystra, in Derbe, in
   Athens, in Corinth, in Rome he must always be confronting the Judaizing
   spirit. And it was well that he should know all about it--that he
   should be well schooled in it. And it does strike me that God separated
   him from his mother's womb on purpose that he might go forth to
   proclaim the Gospel instead of Law and shut the mouths of those who
   were constantly abiding by the traditions of the fathers, instead of
   the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

   All this, remember, was going on while as yet he was unconverted,
   though he was even then, as we see, being prepared for his work. Then
   observe the spiritual struggles through which Paul passed. I take it
   that mental struggles are often a more important part of education than
   what a man learns from his schoolmaster. What is learned here in my
   heart is often of more use to me than what can be put into my head by
   another. Paul seems to have had a mind bent upon carrying out what he
   believed to be right. To serve God appears to have been the great
   ambition, the one object of the Apostle's life.

   Even when he was a persecutor, he says he thought he was doing God
   service. He was no seeker after wealth--never in his whole lifetime was
   Paul a Mammonite. He was no mere seeker after learning--never! He was
   learned, but it was all held and used subject to what he deemed far
   more highly--the indwelling Grace of God. Even before he knew Christ he
   had a sort of religion and an attachment, and an earnest attachment,
   too, to the God of his fathers, though it was a zeal not according to
   knowledge. He had his inward fights and fears and struggles and
   difficulties and all these were educating him to come out and talk to
   his fellow sinners and lead them up out of the darkness of Judaism into
   the light of Christianity.

   And then, what I like in Paul and that which leads me to see the
   purpose of God in him, is the singular formation of his mind. Even as a
   sinner, Paul was great. He was "the chief of sinners," just as he
   afterwards became, "not a whit behind the very chief of the Apostles."
   There are some of us who are such little men that the world will never
   see us. The old proverb about the chips in porridge giving one pleasure
   either way, might apply to a great many people, but never to Paul. If
   there was anything to be done, Paul would do it--yes, and if it came to
   the stoning of Stephen, he says he gave his vote against him--and
   though he was not one of the actual executioners, yet we are told that
   "the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose
   name was Saul."

   He would do all that was to be done and was a thoroughgoing man
   everywhere. Believing a thing to be right, Paul never consulted with
   flesh and blood, but girded up his loins and worked with all the powers
   of his being--and that was no mean force--as his enemies felt to their
   cost. Why, as I see him riding to Damascus, I picture him with his eyes
   flashing with fanatic hate against the disciples of the Man whom he
   thought to be an impostor--and his heart beat high with the
   determination to crush the followers of the Nazarene!

   He is a man all energy and all determination. And when he is converted,
   he is only lifted into a higherlife--but unchanged as to temperament,
   nature and force of character. He seems to have been naturally
   constituted a thoroughgoing, thorough-hearted man in order that when
   Grace did come to him, he might be just as earnest, just as dauntless
   and fearless, in the defense of what he believed to be right. Yes, and
   such a man was needed to lead the vanguard in the great crusade against
   the god of this world. No other could have stood forward as Paul did,
   for no other had the same firmness, boldness and decision that he
   possessed.

   "But," I hear someone say, "was not Peter as bold?" Yes, he was. But
   Peter, you remember, always had the failing of being just where he
   ought not to be when he was needed. Peter was unstable to the very
   last, I think. Certainly, in Paul's day, Paul had to withstand him. He
   was a great and good man, but not fitted to be the foremost. Perhaps
   you say, "But there is John--would not John do?" No. We cannot speak in
   too high terms of John, but John is too full of affection. John is the
   plane to smooth the timber, but not the axe to cut it down. John is too
   gentle, too meek. He is the Phillip Melancthon. Paul must be the Luther
   and Calvin rolled into one! Such a man was needed--and I say that from
   his very birth, God was fitting him for this position. And before he
   was converted, preceding Grace was engaged fashioning, molding, and
   preparing the man in order that by-and-by there might be put into his
   nostrils the breath of Life.

   Now what is the drift of all this? A practical one. And to show you
   what it is, we will linger a minute here before we go on to anything
   else. Some of the good fathers among us are mourning very bitterly just
   now over their sons. Your children have not turned out as you wish they
   would. They are getting skeptical, some of them, and they are also
   falling into sin. Well, dear Friends, it is yours to mourn. It is
   enough to make you weep bitterly! But let me whisper a word into your
   ears. Do not sorrow as those who are without hope, for God may have
   very great designs to be answered, even by these very young men who
   seem to be running so altogether in the wrong direction!

   I do not think I could go so far as John Bunyan did, when he said he
   was sure God would have some eminent saints in the next generation
   because the young men in his day were such gross sinners! He thought
   they would make fine saints. And when the Lord came and saved them, by
   His mercy--they would love Him much--because they had had so much
   forgiven. I can hardly say as much as that, but I do believe that
   sometimes in the inscrutable wisdom of God--when some of those who have
   been skeptical come to see the Truth--they are the very best men that
   could possibly be found to do battle against the enemy.

   Some of those who have fallen into error, after having passed through
   it and happily come up through its deep ditch, are just the men to
   stand and warn others against it. I cannot conceive that Luther would
   ever have been so mighty a preacher of the faith if he had not,
   himself, struggled up and down Pilate's staircase on his knees when
   trying to get to

   Heaven by his penances and his good works. O let us have hope! We do
   not know but that God may be intending to call them and bless them! Who
   can tell, there may be a young man here tonight who will one day be the
   herald of the Cross in China, in Hindustan, in Africa and in the
   islands of the sea!

   Remember John Williams wishing to keep an appointment with another
   young man who committed a certain sin. He wanted to know what time it
   was and so stepped into Moorefield's Chapel. Someone saw him so he did
   not want to leave, and the Word, preached by Mr. Timothy East who still
   survives among us, fell on his ears and the young sinner was made a
   saint! And you all know how he afterwards perished as a martyr on the
   shores of Erromanga. Why may there not be another such a case tonight?
   There may be some young man here who has been receiving a first class
   education--he has no idea what for! He has been learning a multitude of
   things--perhaps a great deal which it would be much better if he did
   not know--but the Lord is meaning to make something of him.

   I do not know where you are, young Man, but O, I wish I could fire you
   tonight with a high ambition to serve God! What is the good of my being
   made at all if I do not serve my Maker? What is the use of my being
   here if I do not bring any glory to Him who put me and keeps me here?
   Why, I had better have been a piece of rotten dung strewn upon the
   field and bringing forth something for the farmer's use than to have
   been a mere consumer of bread and meat and to have breathed the air and
   lived upon God's bounty and yet to have done nothing for Him! O young
   Man! If such an army of you as we have tonight could allbe led by
   Divine Grace to say with the Apostle Paul, "God forbid that I should
   glory, save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ," why, there would be
   hope for Old England yet!

   We would yet fling Popery back to the seven hills from where it came.
   Oh that God would grant us this blessing! But if He should not be
   pleased to call all of us by His Grace, yet may some here live to prove
   that they were separated from their mother's womb to God's work and set
   apart that they might have the Son of God revealed in them and might
   proclaim His Gospel with power! We will now leave this point, but shall
   continue the same subject in another form.

   II. You would, perhaps, say that all I have talked about as yet has
   been Providence rather than Grace. Very likely, but I think that
   Providence and Grace are very near akin. At any rate, if Providence is
   the wheel, Grace is the hand which turns and guides it.

   But I am now about to speak of GRACE PRECEDING, CALLING IN ANOTHER
   SENSE. It strikes me that it is impossible to say, concerning the
   elect, when the Grace of God begins to deal with them. You can tell
   when the quickening Grace comes, but not when the Grace, itself, comes.
   For know, in one sense, Grace was exercised upon the chosen--

   "Before the daystar knew its place, Or planets ran their round."

   I should say that is what I cannot call by any other name than
   formative Grace exercised upon the vessels of mercy at their very
   birth. It seems to me to be no small mercy that some of us were born of
   such parents as we were and that we were born where we were. Some of us
   began right and were surrounded by many advantages. We were cradled
   upon the lap of piety and dandled upon the knee of holiness.

   There are some children who are born with a constitution which cannot
   escape sin, and which at the same time seems as if it inevitably led
   them to it. Who can deny that there are some whose passions seem
   naturally to be so violent that, notwithstanding almost any and every
   restraint, they run headlong into sin? And often those failings may be
   distinctly traced to their parents! It is no small blessing when we can
   look back and thank God, that if no blue-blood of nobility flows in our
   veins, yet from our very childhood we have not heard the voice of
   blasphemy, nor strayed into the haunts of vice--but that in the very
   formation of our character--Divine Grace has ever been present with us!

   This formative Grace, many of you, I have no doubt, can trace in the
   examples and influences which have followed you from the cradle through
   life. Why, what a blessing to have had such a Sunday school teacher as
   some of you had! Other children went to schools but they had not such a
   teacher, or such a class as yours. What a privilege to have had such a
   minister as some of you had, though perhaps he has fallen asleep now!
   You know there were others who went to places where there was no
   earnestness, no life--but that good man who was blessed to you was full
   of anxiety for your soul--and at the very first, before you were
   converted, his preaching helped to form your character!

   Why, it strikes me that every word I heard and everything I saw while I
   was yet a child or a youth, had a part in the formation of my later
   life. Oh, what a mercy it is to be placed where a holy example and
   godly conversation tend to form the man in a godly mold! All this may
   be, you know, without Divine Grace. I am not speaking, now, of the work
   of effectual calling, but of that preceding Grace which is too much
   forgotten, though it so richly deserves to be remembered.

   Think, too, of the prayers which brought tears to our eyes and the
   teaching that would not let us sin so deeply as others. Think of the
   light which glowed in us, even in our childhood, and seems to have
   dispelled something of our natural darkness. Think of that earnest face
   that used to look so steadily on us when we did wrong and of that
   mother's tear which seemed as if it would burn itself into our hearts
   when there had been something amiss that made Mother anxious. All
   this--though it did not convertus--yet it helped to make us what we now
   are and unto God let us give the Glory!

   Furthermore, while there was this formative Grace, there seems to me to
   have gone with it very much of preventive Grace. How many saints fall
   into sins which they have to regret even after conversion, while others
   are saved from leaving the path of morality to wander in the morass of
   lust and crime! Why, some of us were, by God's Grace, placed in
   positions where we could not well have been guilty of any gross acts of
   immorality even if we had tried! We were so hedged about by guardian
   care--so watched and tended on every side--that we would have been
   dashing our heads against a stone wall if we had run into any great or
   open sin.

   Oh, what a mercy to be prevented from sinning--when God puts chains
   across the road, digs ditches, makes hedges, builds walls and says to
   us, "No, you shall not go that way, I will not let you. You shall never
   have that to regret. You may desire it, but I will hedge up your way
   with thorns. You may wish it, but it never shall be yours." Beloved, I
   have thanked God a thousand times in my life that before my conversion
   when I had evil desires I had no opportunities! And on the other hand,
   that when I had opportunities I had no desires--for when desires and
   opportunities come together like the flint and steel--they make the
   spark that kindles the fire. But neither the one nor the other, though
   they may both be dangerous, can bring about any great amount of evil so
   long as they are kept apart! Let us, then, look back and if this has
   been our experience let us bless the preventing Grace of God.

   Again, there is another form of Grace I must mention, namely,
   restraining Grace. Here, you see, I am making a distinction. There are
   many who didgo into sin. They were not wholly prevented from it, but
   they could not go as far into it as they wanted to do. There is a young
   man here tonight--he will ask how I know--well, I do know--there is a
   young man here tonight who wants to commit a certain sin, but he
   cannot. Oh, how he wishes to do it, but he cannot! He is placed in such
   a position of poverty that he cannot play the fine gentleman he would
   like.

   There is another! He wants to be dancing at such-and-such a place, but
   thank God he is lame! There is another, who, if he had had his wish
   would have lost his soul--but since his blindness has come upon him
   there is some hope for him. Oh how often God has thrown a man on a sick
   bed to make him well! He would have been such as he was even unto death
   if he had been well--but God has made him sick--and that sickness has
   restrained him from sin! It is a mercy for some men that they cannot do
   what they would and though "to will is present" with them, yet even in
   sin, "how to perform that which they would, they find not."

   Ah, my fine Fellow, if you could have had your own way you would have
   been at the top of the mountain by now! So you think, but no--you would
   have been over the precipice long before this if God had you climb at
   all--and so He has kept you in the valley because He has designs of
   love towards you and because you shall not sin as others sin. Divine
   Grace has its hand upon the bridle of your horse. Or perhaps it is a
   woman and you may speak bitter words against that wife, that sister, or
   that mother whom God has put there to hold you back. But you cannot go
   on, you shall not go on. Another inch forward and you will be over the
   precipice and lost, and therefore God has put that hand there to throw
   your horse back on its haunches and make you pause and think--and turn
   from the error of your ways. What a mercy it is that when God's people
   go into sin to any extent, He speaks and says, "To this point shall you
   go, but no further. Here shall your proud sins be stopped!" There is,
   then, restraining Grace.

   We shall get still further into the subject when we come to what Dr.
   John Owen calls the preparatorywork of Grace. Have you ever noticed
   that parable about the different sorts of ground and the sower of the
   seeds? A sower went forth to sow and some of the seed fell on stony
   ground. You can understand that, because all men have stones in their
   hearts. Some fell on the thorns and thistles. You can comprehend that,
   because men are so given to worldly care. Another part of the seed fell
   on the beaten path. You can understand that--men are so occupied with
   worldliness.

   But how about the "good ground"? "Good ground"! Is there such a thing
   as "good ground" by nature? One of the evangelists says that it was
   "honest and good ground." Now, is there such a difference between
   hearts and hearts? Are not all men depraved by nature? Yes, he who
   doubts human depravity had better begin to study himself. Question--If
   all hearts are bad, how are some hearts good? Reply--They are good
   comparatively. They are good in a certain sense. It is not meant in the
   parable that the good ground was so good that it never would have
   produced a harvest without the sowing of the seed--but that it had been
   prepared by Providential influences upon it to receive the seed and in
   that sense it may be said to have been "good ground."

   Now let me show you how God's Grace does come to work on the human
   heart so as to make it good soil before the living seed is cast into
   it--so that before quickening Grace visits it, the heart may be called
   a good heart--because it is prepared to receive that Grace. I think
   this takes place thus--first of all, before quickening Grace comes, God
   often gives an attentive ear and makes a man willing to listen to the
   Word. Not only does he like to listen to it, but he wants to know the
   meaning of it. There is a little excitement in his mind to know what
   the Gospel tidings really are. He is not saved as yet, but it is always
   a hopeful sign when a man is willing to listen to the Truth and is
   anxious to understand it.

   This is one thing which preceding Grace does in making the soul good.
   In Ezekiel's vision, as you will recall, before the Breath came from
   the four winds, the bones began to stir and they came together bone to
   his bone. So, before the Spirit of God comes to a man in effectual
   calling, God's Grace often comes to make a stir in the man's mind so
   that he is no longer indifferent to the Truth but is anxious to
   understand what it means.

   The next mark of this gracious work is an honest heart. Some persons
   will not hear you, or if they do, they are always picking holes and
   finding fault--they are not honest and good ground. But there are
   others who say, "I will give the man a fair and an honest hearing. I
   will read the Bible. I will read it honestly. I will really see whether
   it is the Word of God or not. I will come to it without any prejudices,
   or, if I have any prejudices I will throw them aside." Now, all this is
   a blessed work of preparatory Grace making the heart ready to receive
   effectual calling.

   Then, when this willingness and honesty are attended with a tender
   conscience, as they are in some unconverted people, this is another
   great blessing. Some of you are not converted, but you would not do
   wrong. You are not saints, but you would not tell a lie for the world!
   I thank God that there are some of you so excellent in morals that if
   you were proposed to us for Church membership, we could not raise any
   objection to you on that ground, at any rate. You are as honest as the
   day is long. As for the things of God, you are outwardly as attentive
   to them and as diligent in them as the most earnest and indefatigable
   Christians.

   Now, this is because your conscience is tender. When you do wrong you
   cannot sleep at night. And you do not feel at all easy in being without
   a Savior--I know some of you do not. You have not come to any decision.
   The Grace of God has not really made you feel your thoroughly blind
   state--still you are not quite easy. In fact, to go farther, your
   affections, though not weaned altogether from earth, yet begin to
   tremble a little as though they would go heavenward. You want to be a
   Christian--when the communion table is spread, you dare not come
   downstairs--but I see you looking from the gallery and you wish you
   were with us.

   You know you have not believed in Jesus Christ, and the world keeps you
   back from doing so--but still there is a kind of twitching in your
   conscience. You do not know what it is, but there is a something in you
   that makes you say at times, "O God, let me die the death of the
   righteous and let my last end be like his." Yes, and you even go
   farther than this and ask to live the righteous man's life, too. Now,
   remember, this will not save you--"You must be born again." But for all
   this the Church of God should feel deeply grateful--for they have seen
   in themselves that this is often God's preparatory work--clearing away
   the rubbish and rubble and digging out the foundations, that Jesus
   Christ might be laid there, the Cornerstone of future hope and of
   future happiness!

   Another work of Grace is the creation of dissatisfaction with their
   present state. How many men we have known who were consciously "without
   God and without hope in the world"! The apples of Sodom had turned to
   ashes and bitterness in their mouth, though at one time all was fair
   and sweet to their taste. The mirage of life with them has been
   dispelled, and instead of the green fields and waving trees and
   rippling waters which their fevered imagination had conjured up in the
   desert, they can see now nothing but the arid sand and wasteness of
   desolation which appall their fainting spirits and promise nothing! No,
   not even a grave to cover their whited bones which shall remain a
   bleached memorial that, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity."

   Multitudes have been brought to see the deluge of sin which has covered
   even the high places of the earth! They find no rest for the sole of
   their feet, but as yet they know not of an ark, nor of a loving hand
   prepared to pull them in as did Noah the dove in olden times! Look at
   the life of St. Augustine, how wearily he wanders here and there with a
   death-thirst in his soul that no fount of philosophy, or scholastic
   argument, or heretical teaching could ever satisfy! He was aware of his
   unhappy estate and turned his eye round the circle of the universe
   looking for peace--not fully conscious of what he wanted--though
   feeling an aching void the world could never fill. He had not found the
   center, fixed and steadfast, around which all else revolved in
   ceaseless change.

   Now, all this appetite, this hunger and thirst I look upon as not of
   the devil, nor of the human heart alone--it was of God! He strips us of
   all our earthly joy and peace, that, shivering in the cold blast, we
   might flee, when drawn by His Spirit, to the "Man who is as a hiding
   place from the storm, a cover from the tempest, and the shadow of a
   great rock in a weary land." Of course, I have not gone fully into this
   doctrine of preceding Grace, but I trust I have said just enough to
   waken the gratitude of all the saints who have experienced it and to
   make them sing with greater emotion than they have ever done before--

   "Determined to save, He watched over my path When, Satan's blind slave,
   I sported with death."

   III. And now we come to the last point, which is, PAUL'S ACTUAL CALLING
   BY DIVINE GRACE. All preparatory work of which we have spoken was not
   the source or origin of the vital godliness which afterwards
   distinguished that renowned servant of God--that came to him suddenly.

   Beloved, there may be some here tonight who cannot discern anything in
   themselves of God's work of Grace at all. I do not wonder at this. I do
   not suppose that the Apostle could discern it in himself, or even
   thought of looking for it! He was as careless of Christ as is the
   butterfly of the honey in the flowers. He lived with no thought of
   honoring Jesus and no desire to magnify Him--but with the very reverse
   passion glowing like a hot coal within his soul. And yet in a moment he
   was turned from an enemy into a friend! Oh, what a mercy it would be if
   some here tonight were turned from enemies into friends in a
   moment--and we are not without hope but that this will be the case!

   You have hated Christ, my Friend. You have hated Him boldly and
   decidedly. You have not been a sneaking sort of adversary, but have
   opposed Him frankly and openly. Now, why did you do it? I am sorry for
   your sin, but I like your honesty. What is there in the Person of
   Christ for you to hate? Men hated Him while He was on earth and yet He
   died for them! Can you hate Him for that? He came into this world to
   gain no honor for Himself--He had honor enough in Heaven--but He gave
   it up for the sake of men. When He died He had not amassed a fortune,
   nor gathered about Him a troop of soldiers--nor had He conquered
   provinces--and He died naked on the Cross!

   Nothing brought Him here but disinterested affection. And when He came
   He spent His life in deeds of holiness and good. For which of these
   things can you hate Him? The amazing loving-kindness of Christ Jesus
   towards sinners should, in itself, disarm your animosity and turn your
   hatred of Him to love. Alas! I know that this thought of itself will
   not do it--but the Spirit of God can. If the Spirit of God once comes
   in contact with your souls and shows you that Christ died for you, your
   enmity towards Christ will be over!

   Dr. Gifford once went to see a woman in prison who had been a very
   gross offender. She was such a hardened reprobate that the doctor began
   by discoursing with her about the judgments of God and the punishments
   of Hell. But she only laughed him to scorn and called him opprobrious
   names. The doctor burst into tears, and said, "And yet, poor Soul,
   there is mercy for you, even for such as you are, though you have
   laughed in the face of Him who would do you good. Christ is able to
   forgive you, hard though you are. And I hope that He will yet take you
   to dwell with Him at His right hand."

   In a moment the woman stopped her laughing, sat down quietly, burst
   into tears and said, "Don't talk to me in that way! I have always been
   told that I should be damned and I made up my mind to be! I knew there
   was no chance and so I have gone on from one sin to another--but oh, if
   there is a hope of mercy for me, that is another thing! If there is a
   possibility of my being forgiven, that is another thing!" The doctor at
   once opened his Bible and began to read to her these words, "The blood
   of Jesus Christ, God's dear Son, cleanses us from all sin." The
   greatest brokenness of heart followed.

   In subsequent visits the doctor was gratified to find that she was
   brought to Christ. And though she had to undergo a sentence for many
   years at the time, yet years later the godly man saw her walking
   honestly and uprightly as a Believer in Jesus Christ. Sinner, I wish
   that thought would bring youto Christ! O that you would know that He
   has chosen you, that He has separated you for Himself, and to be
   His--even from your mother's womb! Ah, you have played the harlot, but
   He will bring you back! You have sinned very greatly, but you shall one
   day be clothed in the white robe and wear the everlasting crown!

   Oh, blush and be ashamed that you should ever have sinned as you have
   done! You have been a thief and a drunkard. You have brought your
   mother's gray hairs with sorrow to the grave, but her prayers are going
   up even now to Heaven and you shall be brought in yet. O stubborn
   Sinner, my Master means to have you! Run as you will, you wandering
   sheep, the Shepherd is after you--yield, yield, yield now! O Prodigal,
   your Father's heart is open! Arise! Go to your Father! You are ashamed
   to go, are you? Oh, let that shame make you go faster! Let it not keep
   you back! Jesus bled, Jesus wept, Jesus lives in Heaven. "Ho, everyone
   that thirsts, come to the waters. And he that has no money, let him buy
   wine and milk, without money and without price." "Whoever will, let him
   come and take of the Water of Life freely."

   There is no sinner too black to be forgiven! There are no iniquities
   that can damn you if you believe in Jesus! All manner of sin and
   iniquity shall be forgiven him who puts his trust in the shadow of
   Jehovah-Jesus. Look to Him! He dies! He lives! Look, He rises, He
   pleads above! "Look unto Me and be you saved, all the ends of the
   earth, for I am God and there is none else." I trust that the whole of
   your past mysterious life, my dear fellow Sinner, will be explained to
   you tonight by your believing in Jesus. That will be the golden key
   which will open the secret and you will say, "Now I see it. I could not
   tell what that mysterious hand was that kept me back from doing a
   certain thing. I could not understand why I was led into such a path,
   but now I know that it was to take me to the feet of the blessed Savior
   where I might be happy forever."

   As you look back and think of all the dealings of Divine Grace and
   Providence with you throughout your life, you will sing--

   "Ah, who am I that God has saved Me from the doom I did desire, And
   crossed the lot myself did crave, To set me even higher?"

   I must give one word of warning to those who are afflicting themselves
   with a notion that in order to a true, real, conversion they must have
   a long course of agonizing soul-conflict. You must mark that I am NOT
   teaching this! The new birth was instantaneous--at once! Saul of Tarsus
   calls Him Lord and it is only three days that darkness rests upon him.
   This is the longest case recorded in the Bible--and how short a time in
   darkness and anguish that is--compared with the experience of some whom
   you are regarding as models on which God must act in your case.

   Remember that God is not the God of uniformity--though He is of union
   and peace. He may lead you at once into joy and peace, as Nathanael,
   who said as soon as he saw Christ, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God. You
   are the King of Israel." God may, and doubtless has been, blessing you
   through His Grace from your birth. But He needs not to plunge you many
   days in the cold dark waters of conviction to wash away your sin--the
   blood of Christ at oncecan cleanse from all sin if you confide your
   soul to Him. Believe, therefore, and you are at once justified and at
   peace with God. May the Lord bless you all, for Jesus' sake.

                               Satanic Hindrances

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 29, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Satan hindered us." 1 Thessalonians 2:18.

   PAUL, Silas and Timothy were very desirous to visit the Church at
   Thessalonica, but they were unable to do so for the singular reason
   announced in the text, namely, "Satan hindered us." It was not from
   want of will, for they had a very great attachment to the Thessalonian
   Brethren and they longed to look them in the face again. They said of
   the Thessalonians, "We give thanks to God always for you all, making
   mention of you in our prayers: remembering without ceasing your work of
   faith, and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ
   in the sight of God and our Father."

   Their will was overruled as to visiting the Church together, but being
   anxious for its welfare, they sent Timothy alone to minister for a time
   in its midst. It was not want of will which hindered them, but want of
   power. They were not prevented by God's special Providence. We find on
   certain occasions that Paul was not allowed to go precisely where his
   heart would have led him. "They assayed to go into Bithynia: but the
   Spirit suffered them not."

   "They were forbidden of the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia,"
   but their course was directed towards Troas that they might preach in
   Europe the unsearchable riches of Christ. They could not, however,
   trace their absence from Thessalonica to any Divine interposition. It
   appeared, to them, to proceed from the great adversary--"Satan hindered
   them." How Satan did so it would be useless to affirm dogmatically, but
   we may form a reasonable conjecture. I find in the margin of my pulpit
   Bible by Bagster, this note, which may probably be correct: "Satan
   hindered Paul by raising such a storm of persecution against him at
   Berea and other places, that it was deemed prudent to delay his visit
   till the storm was somewhat allayed."

   Yet I can hardly allow this to have been the only hindrance, for Paul
   was very courageous, and having a strong desire to visit Thessalonica,
   no fear of opposition would have kept him away. He did not shun the
   hottest part of the battle, but like a truly valiant champion,
   delighted most to be found in the thick of his foes. Possibly the
   antagonism of the various philosophers whom he met with at Athens and
   the heresies at Corinth, from which it seems that this Epistle was
   written, may have called for his presence on the scene of action. He
   felt that he could not leave struggling churches to their enemies--he
   must contend with the grievous wolves and unmask the evil ones who wore
   the garb of angels of light.

   Satan had moved the enemies of the Truth of God to industrious
   opposition and thus the Apostle and his companions were hindered from
   going to Thessalonica. Or it may be that Satan had excited dissensions
   and discords in the churches which Paul was visiting and therefore he
   was obliged to stop first in one, and then in another, to settle their
   differences--to bring to bear the weight of his own spiritual influence
   upon the various divided sections of the Church to restore them to
   unity.

   Well, whether persecution, or philosophic heresy, or the divisions of
   the Church were the outward instruments we cannot tell, but Satan was
   assuredly the prime mover. You will, perhaps, wonder why the devil
   should care so much about Paul and his whereabouts. Why should he take
   so much interest in keeping these three men from that particular
   Church? This leads us to observe what wonderful importance is attached
   to the action of Christian ministers. Here is the master of all evil,
   the Prince of the Power of the Air, intently watching the journeying of
   three humble men. And apparently far more concerned about their
   movements than about the doings of Nero or Tiberius!

   These despised heralds of mercy were his most dreaded foes. They
   preached that name which makes Hell tremble. They declared that
   righteousness against which Satanic hate always vents itself with its
   utmost power. With malicious glance the archenemy watched their daily
   path and with cunning hand hindered them at all points. It strikes us
   that Satan was desirous to keep these Apostolic men from the Church of
   Thessalonica because the Church was young and weak and he thought that
   if it was not fostered and succored by the preaching and presence of
   Paul he might yet slay the young Child.

   Moreover, he has of old a fierce hatred of the preaching of the Gospel
   and possibly there had been no public declaration of the Truth
   throughout Thessalonica since Paul had gone and he was afraid lest the
   fire-brands of Gospel Truth should be again flung in among the masses
   and a gracious conflagration should take place. Besides, Satan always
   hates Christian fellowship--it is his policy to keep Christians apart.
   Anything which can divide saints from one another he delights in. He
   attaches far more importance to godly communion than we do. Since union
   is strength, he does his best to promote separation--and so he would
   keep Paul away from these Brethren who might have gladdened his heart
   and whose hearts he might have cheered.

   He would hinder their fraternal communion that they might miss the
   strength which always flows from Christian communion and Christian
   sympathy. This is not the only occasion in which Satan has hindered
   good men--indeed, this has been his practice in all ages and we have
   selected this one particular incident that some who are hindered by
   Satan may draw comfort from it and that we may have an opportunity (if
   the Spirit of God shall enable us) of saying a good and forceful word
   to any who count it strange because this fiery trial has happened to
   them.

   I. Let us open our discourse by observing that IT HAS BEEN SATAN'S
   PRACTICE OF OLD TO HINDER, WHEREVER HE COULD, THE WORK OF GOD. "Satan
   hindered us," is the testimony which all the saints in Heaven will bear
   against the arch enemy. This is the witness of all who have written a
   holy line on the historic page, or carved a consecrated name on the
   rock of immortality--"Satan hindered us." In sacred Writ, we find Satan
   interfering to hinder the completeness of the personal character of
   individual saints. The man of Uz was perfect and upright before God and
   to all appearances would persevere in producing a finished picture of
   what the Believer in God should be.

   Satan could find no fault with his actions and only dared to impute
   wrong motives to him. He had considered Job and he could find no
   mischief in him--but then he hinted to God, "Have You not made an hedge
   about him and about his house and about all that he has on every side?"
   Satan sought to turn the life-blessing which Job was given of God into
   a curse, and therefore he buffeted him sorely. He stripped him of all
   his substance. The evil messengers trod upon one another's heels--and
   their tidings of woe only ceased when his goods were all destroyed and
   his children had all perished.

   The poor afflicted parent was then struck in his bone and in his flesh
   till he was made to sit upon a dunghill and scrape himself with a
   potsherd. Even then the picture had no blot of sin upon it--the pencil
   was held with a steady hand by the patient one. And therefore Satan
   made another attempt to hinder his retaining his holy character--he
   excited his wife to say, "Why do you hold fast your integrity? Curse
   God and die." This was a great and grievous hindrance to the completion
   of Job's marvelous career, but, glory be unto God, the man of patience
   not only overcame Satan, but he made him a steppingstone to a yet
   greater height of illustrious virtue!

   You know the patience of Job and you would not have known it if Satan
   had not illuminated it with the blaze of flaming afflictions! Had not
   the vessel been burnt in the furnace, the bright colors had not been so
   fixed and abiding. The trial through which Job passed brought out the
   luster of his matchless endurance in submission and resignation to God!
   Now, just as the enemy of old waylaid and beset the Patriarch to hinder
   his perseverance in the fair path of excellence, so will he do with us.
   You may be congratulating yourself this morning, "I have up to now
   walked consistently. No man can challenge my integrity."

   Beware of boasting! Your virtue will yet be tried! Satan will direct
   his engines against that very virtue for which you are the most famous.
   If you have been up to now a firm Believer, your faith will, before
   long, be attacked. If up till now you have been meek as Moses, expect
   to be tempted to speak unadvisedly with your lips. The birds will peck
   at your ripest fruit and the wild hoar will dash his tusks at your
   choicest vines. O that we had among us more eminence of piety, more
   generosity of character, more fidelity of behavior! In all these
   respects, I doubt not, many have set out with the highest aims and
   intentions, but alas, how often have they had to cry, "Satan hindered
   us!"

   This is not the enemy's only business--he is very earnest in
   endeavoring to hinder the emancipation of the Lord's redeemed ones. You
   know the memorable story of Moses--when the children of Israel were in
   captivity in Egypt, God's servant stood before their haughty oppressor
   with his rod in his hand and in Jehovah's name he declared, "Thus says
   the Lord, Let My people go, that they may serve Me." A sign was
   required. The rod was cast upon the ground and it became a serpent. At
   this point, Satan hindered. Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses. We read
   that the magicians did so with their enchantments, whether by devilish
   arts or by sleight of hand, we need not now enquire--in either case
   they did the devil service and they did it well--for Pharaoh's heart
   was hardened when he saw that the magicians worked, in appearance, the
   self-same miracles as Moses.

   Brethren, take this as a type of Satan's hindrances to the Word of the
   Lord. Christ's servants came forth to preach the Gospel. Their ministry
   was attended with signs and wonders. "My kingdom is shaken," said the
   Prince of Evil, "I must bestir myself." And straightway he sent
   magicians to work lying signs and wonders without number. Apocryphal
   wonders were and are as plentiful as the frogs of Egypt. Did the
   Apostles preach the sacrifice of Christ?--the devil's Apostles preached
   the sacrifice of the "mass." Did the saints uplift the Cross?--the
   devil's servants upheld the crucifix! Did God's ministers speak of
   Jesus as the one infallible Head of the Church?--the devil's servants
   proclaimed the false priest of Rome as standing in the same place!

   Romanism is a most ingenious imitation of the Gospel--it is the
   magicians, "doing so with their enchantments." If you study well the
   spirit and genius of the great Antichrist, you will see that its great
   power lies in its being an exceedingly clever counterfeit of the Gospel
   of the Lord Jesus Christ. As far as tinsel could counterfeit gold, and
   paste could simulate the gem and candlelight could rival the sun in its
   glory and a drop in the bucket could imitate the sea in its strength,
   it has copied God's great masterpiece, the Gospel of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. And to this day, as God's servants scatter the pure gold of the
   Truth of God, their worst enemies are those who utter base coin on
   which they have feloniously stamped the image and superscription of the
   King of kings.

   You have another case farther on in history--and all Old Testament
   history is typical of what is going on around us now. God was about to
   give a most wonderful system of instruction to Israel and to the human
   race, by way of type and ceremony, in the wilderness. Aaron and his
   sons were selected to represent the great High Priest of our salvation,
   the Lord Jesus Christ. In every garment which they wore there was a
   symbolical significance--every vessel of that sanctuary in which they
   ministered taught a lesson--every single act of worship, whether it
   were the sprinkling of blood or the burning of incense, was made to
   teach precious and important Truths of God to the sons of men. What a
   noble roll was that volume of the Book which was unfolded in the
   wilderness at the foot of Sinai!

   How God declared Himself and the Glory of the coming Messiah in the
   persons of Aaron and his sons! What then? With this Satan interfered.
   Moses and Aaron could say, "Satan hindered us." Korah, Dathan and
   Abiram arrogantly claimed a right to the priesthood. And on a certain
   day they stood forth with bronze censers in their hands, thrusting
   themselves impertinently into the office which the Lord had assigned to
   Aaron and to his sons. The earth opened and swallowed them up
   alive--true prophecy of what shall become of those who thrust
   themselves into the office of the priesthood where none but Jesus
   Christ can stand!

   You may see the parallel this day. Christ Jesus is the only Priest who
   offers sacrifice of blood and He brings that sacrifice no more--for
   having once offered it He has perfected forever those who are set
   apart. "This Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever,
   sat down on the right hand of God." Paul, with the strongest force of
   logic, proves that Christ does not offer a continual sacrifice, but
   that, having offered it once and for all, His work is finished and He
   sits down at the right hand of the Father.

   Now, this doctrine of a finished Atonement and a completed sacrifice
   seemed likely to overrun the world--it was such a gracious unfolding of
   the Divine mind that Satan could not look upon it without desiring to
   hinder it. And, therefore, look on every hand, and you can see Korah,
   Dathan and Abiram in those churches which are branches of Antichrist--I
   mean the Anglican and the Roman. Men to this very day call themselves,
   "priests," and read prayers from a book in which the rubric runs, "Then
   shall the priest say"--these arrogate to themselves a priesthood other
   than that which is common to all the saints--some of them even claim to
   offer a daily "sacrifice," to celebrate an unbloody sacrifice at the
   thing which they call an "altar"!

   And they claim to have power to forgive sins, saying to sick and dying
   persons, "By authority committed unto me I absolve you from all your
   sins." This in England! And this throughout Europe! This is the great
   hindrance to the propagation of the Gospel--the priestly pretensions of
   a set of men who are no priests of God, though they may be priests of
   Baal. Thus the ministers of Jesus are made to cry, "Satan hinders us."
   Take another instance of Satanic hatred. When Joshua had led the tribes
   across the Jordan they were to attack the various cities which God had
   given them for a heritage and from Dan to Beersheba the whole land was
   to be theirs. After the taking of Jericho, the first contact into which
   they came with the heathen Canaanites ended in disastrous defeat to the
   servants of God.

   "They fled," it is written, "before the men of Ai." Here, again, you
   hear the cry, "Satan hindered us." Joshua might have gone from city to
   city exterminating the nations, as they justly deserved to be, but
   Achan had taken of the accursed thing and hidden it in his tent.
   Therefore no victory could be won by Israel till his theft and
   sacrilege had been put away. Beloved, this is symbolic of the Christian
   Church. We might go from victory to victory--our home mission
   operations might be successful and our foreign agencies might be
   crowned with triumph--if it were not that we have Achans in the camp at
   home!

   When churches have no conversions it is more than probable that
   hypocrites concealed among them have turned away the Lord's blessing.
   You who are inconsistent, who make the profession of religion the means
   of getting wealth! You who unite yourselves with God's people, but at
   the same time covet the goodly Babylonian garment and the wedge of
   gold, you are they who cut the sinews of Zion's strength! You prevent
   the Israel of God from going forth to victory! Ah, little do we know,
   Beloved, how Satan has hindered us. We, as a Church, have had much
   reason to thank God, but how many more might within these walls have
   been added to the number of this Church if it had not been for the
   coldness of some, the indifference of others, the inconsistency of a
   few and the worldliness of many more? Satan hinders us not merely by
   direct opposition, but by sending Achans into the midst of our camp!

   I will give you one more picture. View the building of Jerusalem after
   it had been destroyed by the Babylonians. When Ezra and Nehemiah were
   found to build, the devil was sure to stir up Sanballat and Tohiah to
   cast down. There was never a revival of religion without a revival of
   the old enmity. If ever the Church of God is to be built, it will be in
   troublous times. When God's servants are active, Satan is not without
   vigilant followers who seek to counteract their efforts. The history of
   the Old Testament Church is a history of Satan endeavoring to hinder
   the work of the Lord.

   I am sure you will admit it has been the same since the days of the
   Lord Jesus Christ. When He was on earth Satan hindered Him. He dared to
   attack Him to His face! And when that failed, Pharisees, Sadducees,
   Herodians and men of all sorts hindered Him. When the Apostles began
   their ministry, Herod and the Jews sought to hinder them. And when
   persecution availed not, then all sorts of heresies and schisms broke
   out in the Christian Church--Satan still hindered them. A very short
   time after the taking up of our Lord, the precious sons of Zion,
   comparable to fine gold, had become like earthen pitchers, the work of
   the hands of the potter. The glory had departed and the luster of Truth
   was gone, because by false doctrine, lukewarmness and worldliness,
   Satan hindered them.

   When the Reformation dawned, if God raised up a Luther, the devil
   brought out an Ignatius Loyola to hinder him. Here in England, if God
   had his Latimers and his Wickcliffes, the devil had his Gardiners and
   Bonners. When in the modem reformation Whitfield and Wesley thundered
   like the voice of God, there were ordained reprobates found to hinder
   them, to hold them up to opprobrium and shame. Never, since the first
   hour struck in which goodness came into conflict with evil, has it
   ceased to be true that Satan has hindered us!

   From all points of the compass, all along the line of battle--in the
   vanguard and in the rear--at the dawn of day and at midnight, Satan has
   hindered us. If we toil in the field he seeks to break the plowshare.
   If we build the walls he labors to cast down the stones. If we would
   serve God in suffering or in conflict--Satan hinders us everywhere.

   II. We shall now, in the second place, INDICATE MANY WAYS IN WHICH
   SATAN HAS HINDERED US. The

   Prince of Evil is very busy in hindering those who are just coming to
   Jesus Christ. Here he spends the main part of his skill. Some of us who
   know the Savior recollect the fierce conflicts which we had with Satan
   when we first looked to the Cross and lived.

   Others of you here this morning are just passing through that trying
   season--I will address myself to you. Beloved Friends, you long to be
   saved, but ever since you have given any attention to these eternal
   things you have been the victim of deep distress of mind. Do not marvel
   at this! This is usual, so usual as to be almost universal! I should
   not wonder if you are perplexed with the doctrine of election. It will
   be suggested to you that you are not one of the chosen of God, although
   your common sense will teach you that it might just as well be
   suggested to you that you are, since you know neither the one nor the
   other, nor indeed can know until you have believed in Jesus.

   Your present business is with the precept which is revealed, not with
   election which is concealed. Your business is with that exhortation,
   "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved." It is
   possible that the great battlefield between predestination and free
   will may be the dry and desert place in which your soul is
   wandering--now you will never find any comfort there! The wisest of men
   have despaired of ever solving the mystery of those two matters and it
   is not at all probable that you will find peace in puzzling yourself
   about it.

   Your business is not with metaphysical difficulty, but with faith in
   the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is simple and plain
   enough. It is possible that your sins now come to your remembrance and
   though once you thought little enough of them, now it is hinted to you
   by Satanic malice that they are too great to be pardoned--to which, I
   pray you, give the lie, by telling Satan this Truth--"All manner of sin
   and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men." It is very likely that the
   sin against the Holy Spirit much molests you. You read that whoever
   shall speak a word against the Holy Spirit it shall never be forgiven
   him.

   In this, too, you may be greatly tried. And I wonder not that you are,
   for this is a most painfully difficult subject. One fact may cheer
   you--if you repent of your sins, you have not committed the
   unpardonable offense, since that sin necessitates hardness of heart
   forever. And so long as a man has any tenderness of conscience and any
   softness of spirit, he has not so renounced the Holy Spirit as to have
   lost His Presence. It may be that you are the victim of blasphemous
   thoughts. This very morning, since you have been sitting here, torrents
   of the filth of Hell have been pouring through your soul.

   At this be not astonished, for there are some of us who delight in
   holiness and are pure in heart, who nevertheless, have been at times
   sorely tried with thoughts which were never born in our hearts, but
   which were injected into them-- suggestions born in Hell, not in our
   spirits--to be hated and to be loathed, but cast into our minds that
   they might hinder and trouble us. Now, though Satan may hinder you as
   he did the child who was brought to Jesus, of whom we read that as he
   was, "coming, the devil threw him down and tore him," yet do you come
   notwithstanding! For though seven devils were in him, Jesus would not
   cast the coming sinner out. Even though you should feel a conviction
   that the unpardonable sin has fallen to your lot, yet dare to trust in
   Jesus! And, if you do do that, I warrant you there shall be a joy and a
   peace in believing which shall overcome him of whom we read, that he
   has "hindered us."

   But I must not stop long on any one point where there are so many.
   Satan is sure to hinder Christians when they are earnest in prayer.
   Have you not frequently found, dear Friends, when you have been most
   earnest in supplication, that something or other will start across your
   mind to make you cease from the exercise? It appears to me that we
   shake the tree and no fruit drops from it. And just when one more shake
   would bring down the luscious fruit, the devil touches us on the
   shoulder and tells us it is time to be gone! And so we miss the
   blessing we might have attained. I mean that just when prayer would be
   the most successful we are tempted to abstain from it.

   When my spirit has sometimes laid hold upon the Angel, I have been
   painfully conscious of a counter influence urging me to cease from such
   importunity and let the Lord alone, for His will would be done. Or if
   the temptation did not come in that shape yet in some other, to cease
   to pray because prayer, after all, could not avail. O Brethren, I know
   if you are much in prayer you can sing Cowper's hymn--

   "What various hindrances we meet In coming to the Mercy Seat."

   The same is true of Christians when under the promptings of the Spirit
   of God, or when planning any good work. You have been prompted,
   sometimes, to speak to such a one. "Run, speak to that young man," has
   been the message in your ear. You have not done it--Satan has hindered
   you. You have been told on a certain occasion--you do not know how,
   (but believe me, we ought to pay great respect to these inward
   whispers), to visit such-and-such a person and help him. You have not
   done it--Satan hindered you. You have been sitting down by the fire one
   evening reading a missionary report concerning Hindustan, or some
   district destitute of the Truth of God and you have thought, "Now I
   have a little money which I might give to this object." But then it has
   come across you that there is another way of spending it more
   profitably on your family--so Satan has hindered you.

   Or you yourself thought of doing a little in a certain district by way
   of preaching and teaching, or commencing some new Ragged School, or
   some other form of Christian effort--but as sure as ever you began to
   plan it, something or other arose and Satan hindered you. If he
   possibly can, he will come upon God's people in those times when they
   are full of thought and ardor and ready for Christian effort that he
   may murder their infant plans and cast these suggestions of the Holy
   Spirit out of their minds.

   How often, too, has Satan hindered us when we have entered into the
   work! In fact, Beloved, we never ought to expect a success unless we
   hear the devil making a noise. I have taken it as a certain sign that I
   am doing little good when the devil is quiet. It is generally a sign
   that Christ's kingdom is coming when men begin to lie against you and
   slander you and the world is in an uproar, casting out your name as
   evil. Oh, those blessed tempests! Do not give me calm weather when the
   air is still and heavy and when lethargy is creeping over one's spirit.
   Lord, send a hurricane, give us a little stormy weather! When the
   lightning flashes and the thunder rolls, then God's servants know that
   the Lord is abroad and that His right hand is no longer in His
   bosom--that the moral atmosphere will get clear--that God's kingdom
   will come and His will be done on earth, even as it is in Heaven!

   "Peace, peace, peace!" That is the flap of the dragon's wings! The
   stern voice which proclaims perpetual war is the voice of the Captain
   of our salvation. You say, how is this? "Think not that I am come to
   send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am
   come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter
   against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
   And a man's foes shall be they of his own household." Peace, physical,
   Christ makes. There is to be no strife with the fist, no blow with the
   sword, but moral peace and spiritual peace can never be in this world
   where Jesus Christ is, so long as error is there.

   But, you know, Beloved, that you cannot do any good thing but what the
   devil will be sure to hinder you. What then? Up and at him! Cowardly
   looks and faint counsels are not for warriors of the Cross! Expect
   fights and you will not be disappointed. Whitfield used to say that
   some Divines would go from the first of January to the end of December
   with a perfectly whole skin. The devil never thought them worth while
   attacking! But, said he, let us begin to preach with all our might, and
   soul, and strength the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and men will soon put a
   fool's cap on our heads and begin laughing at us and ridiculing us--but
   if so, so much the better!

   We are not alarmed because Satan hinders us! Nor will he only hinder us
   in working--he will hinder us in seeking to unite with one another. We
   are about to make an effort, as Christian churches in London, to come
   closer together and I am happy to find indications of success. But I
   should not wonder but what Satan will hinder us and I would ask your
   prayers that Satan may be put to the rout in this matter, and that the
   union of our churches may be accomplished. As a Church ourselves, we
   have walked together in peace for a long time, but I should not marvel
   if Satan should try to thrust in the cloven foot to hinder our walking
   in love and peace and unity.

   Satan will hinder us in our communion with Jesus Christ. When at His
   table we say to ourselves, "I shall have a sweet moment now," but just
   then vanity intrudes. Like Abraham, you offer the sacrifice, but the
   unclean birds come down upon it and you have need to drive them away.
   "Satan hindered us." He is not omnipresent, but by his numerous
   servants he works in all kinds of places and manages to distract the
   saints when they would serve the Lord.

   III. In the third place THERE ARE TWO OR THREE RULES BY WHICH THESE
   HINDRANCES MAY BE

   DETECTED AS SATANIC. I think I heard somebody saying to himself this
   morning, "Yes, I should have risen in the world and have been a man of
   money now if it had not been that Satan hindered me." Do not believe
   it, dear Friend! I do not believe that Satan generally hinders people
   from getting rich. He would just as soon that they should be rich as
   poor. He delights to see God's servants set upon the pinnacle of the
   temple, for he knows the position to be dangerous.

   High places and God's praise do seldom agree. If you have been hindered
   in growing rich, I should rather set that down to the good Providence
   of God which would not place you where you could not have borne the
   temptation. "Yes," said another, "I had intended to have lived in a
   certain district and done good and have not been able to go--perhaps
   that is the devil." Perhaps it was--perhaps it was not. God's
   Providence will know best where to place us. We are not always choosers
   of our own locality--and so we are not always to conclude when we are
   hindered and disappointed in our own intentions that Satan has done it,
   for it may very often be the good Providence of God.

   But how may I tell when Satan hinders me? I think you may tell first,
   by the object. Satan's object in hindering us is to prevent our
   glorifying God. If anything has happened to you which has prevented
   your growing holy, useful, humble and sanctified, then you may trace
   that to Satan. If the distinct object of the interference to the
   general current of your life has been that you may be turned from
   righteousness into sin, then from the object you may guess the author.
   It is not God who does this, but Satan. Yet know that God does,
   sometimes, put apparent hindrances in the way of His own people--even
   in reference to their usefulness and growth in Grace--but then His
   object is still to be considered--it is to try His saints and so to
   strengthen them! While the object of Satan is to turn them out of the
   right road and make them take the crooked way.

   You may tell the suggestions of Satan, again, by the method in which
   they come--God employs good motives, Satan bad ones. If that which has
   turned you away from your object has been a bad thought, a bad
   doctrine, bad teaching, a bad motive--that never came from God, that
   must be from Satan. Again, you may tell them from their nature.
   Whenever an impediment to usefulness is pleasing, gratifying to
   you--consider that it came from Satan. Satan never brushes the feathers
   of his birds the wrong way--he generally deals with us according to our
   tastes and likes. He flavors his bait to his fish. He knows exactly how
   to deal with each man and to put that motive which will fall in with
   the suggestions of poor carnal nature.

   Now, if the difficulty in your way is rather contrary to yourself than
   for yourself, then it comes from God. But if that which now is a
   hindrance brings you gain, or pleasure, or emolument in any way, rest
   assured it came from Satan. We can tell the suggestions of Satan, once
   more, by their season. Hindrances to prayer, for instance, if they are
   Satanic, come out of the natural course and relation of human thoughts.
   It is a law of mental science that one thought suggests another and the
   next the next and so on--as the links of a chain draw one another.

   But Satanic temptations do not come in the regular order of thinking.
   They dash upon the mind at odd times. My soul is in prayer--it would be
   unnatural that I should then blaspheme--yet then the blasphemy comes.
   Therefore it is clearly Satanic and not from my own mind. If I am set
   upon doing my Master's will and presently an unfaithful thought assails
   me and--being apart from the natural run of my mind and thoughts--it
   may be at once ejected as not being mine and may be set down to the
   account of the devil, who is the true father of it.

   By these means I think we may tell when Satan hinders and when it is
   our own heart, or when it is of God. We ought carefully to watch that
   we do not put the saddle on the wrong horse. Do not blame the devil
   when it is yourself. And on the other hand, when the Lord puts a bar in
   your way, do not say, "That is Satan," and so go against the Providence
   of God. It may be difficult at times to see the way of duty, but if you
   go to the Throne of God in prayer you will soon discover it. "Bring
   here the ephod," said David, when he was in difficulty. Say the same!
   Go to the great High Priest whose business it is to give forth the
   oracle! Lo, upon His breast hangs the Urim and Thummim and you shall,
   from Him, find direction in every time of difficulty and dilemma.

   IV. Supposing that we have ascertained that hindrances in our way
   really come from Satan, WHAT THEN? I have but one piece of advice and
   that is--go on--hindrance or no hindrance, in the path of duty as God
   the Holy Spirit enables you. If Satan hinders you, I have already
   hinted that this opposition should cheer you. "I did not expect," said
   a Christian minister, "to be easy in this particular pastorate, or else
   I would not have come here. I always count it," he said, "to be my duty
   to show the devil that I am his enemy and if I do that, I expect that
   he will show me that he is mine."

   If you are now opposed and you can trace that opposition distinctly to
   Satan, congratulate yourself upon it--do not sit down and fret! Why, it
   is a great thing that a poor creature like you can actually vex the
   great Prince of Darkness and win his hate! It makes the race of man the
   more noble that it comes in conflict with a race of spirits and stands
   foot to foot even with the Prince of Darkness himself. It is a dreadful
   thing, doubtless, that you should be hindered by such an adversary, but
   it is most hopeful--for if he were your friend--you might have cause to
   fear, indeed!

   Stand out against him because you now have an opportunity of making a
   greater gain than you could have had, had he been quiet. You could
   never have had a victory over him if you had not engaged in conflict
   with him. The poor saint would go on his inglorious way to Heaven if he
   were unmolested. But being molested, every step of his pathway becomes
   glorious! Our position today is like that described by Bunyan, when
   from the top of the palace the song was heard--

   "Come in, come in, Eternal glory you shall win."

   Now merely to ascend the stairs of the palace, though safe work, would
   not have been very ennobling. But when the enemy crowded round the door
   and blocked up every stair and the hero came to the man with the
   ink-horn, who sat before the door and said, "Write my name down, Sir,"
   then, to get from the lowest step to the top where the bright ones were
   singing--every inch was glorious! If devils did not oppose my path from
   earth to Heaven, I might travel joyously, peacefully, safely--but
   certainly without renown! But now, when every step is contested in
   winning our pathway to Glory, every single step is covered with
   immortal fame! Press on then, Christian! The more opposition, the more
   honor!

   Be in earnest against these hindrances when you consider, again, what
   you lose if you do not resist him and overcome him. To allow Satan to
   overcome me would be eternal ruin to my soul. Certainly it would
   forever blast all hopes of my usefulness. If I retreat and turn my back
   in the day of battle what will the rest of God's servants say? What
   shouts of derision will ring over the battlefield? How will the banner
   of the Covenant be trailed in the mire! Why, we must not, we dare not,
   play the coward--we dare not give way to the insinuation of Satan and
   turn from the Master--for the defeat were then too dreadful to be
   endured.

   Beloved, let me feed your courage with the recollection that your Lord
   and Master has overcome. See Him there before you. He of the
   thorn-crown has fought the enemy and broken his head--Satan has been
   completely worsted by the Captain of your salvation! And that victory
   was representative--he fought and won it for you! You have to contend
   with a defeated foe and one who knows and feels his disgrace! And
   though he may fight with desperation, yet he fights not with true
   courage, for he is hopeless of ultimate victory. Strike, then, for
   Christ has destroyed him! Down with him, for Jesus has had him under
   His foot! You, weakest of all the host, you will be triumphant, for the
   Captain has triumphed before you!

   Lastly, remember that you have a promise to make you gird up your loins
   and play the man this day--"Resist the devil and he shall flee from
   you." Christian minister, resign not your situation! Do not think of
   sending in your resignation because the Church is divided and because
   the enemy is making headway! Resist the devil! Flee not, but make him
   flee! Young Christian men--you who have begun to preach in the street,
   or distribute tracts, or visit from house to house--though Satan
   hinders you very much I pray you, now, redouble your efforts! It is
   because Satan is afraid of you that he resists you, because he would
   rob you of the great blessing which is now descending on your head.
   Resist him and stand fast.

   You Christians pleading in prayer--let not go your hold upon the
   Covenant Angel--for now that Satan hinders you it is because the
   blessing is descending! You who are seeking Christ, close not those
   eyes! Turn not away your face from Calvary's streaming tree--now that
   Satan hinders you, it is because the night is almost over and the
   daystar begins to shine! Brethren, you who are most molested, most
   sorrowfully tried, most borne down, yours is the brighter hope-- be
   courageous now--play the man for God, for Christ, for your own
   soul--and the day shall yet come when you, with your Master, shall ride
   triumphantly through the streets of the New Jerusalem!

   Sin, death and Hell will be captive at your chariot wheels and you,
   with your Lord, will be crowned as victor, having overcome through the
   blood of the Lamb! May God bless dear Friends now present. I do not
   know to whom this sermon may be most suitable, but I believe it is sent
   especially to certain tried saints. The Lord enable them to find
   comfort in it! Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--1 Peter 412
     __________________________________________________________________

                        From The Dunghill To The Throne

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 5, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He raises up the poor out of the dust and lifts the needy out of the
   dunghill, that He may set him with princes, even with the princes of
   His people." Psalm 113:7,8.

   THE greatness and majesty of the Most High God are utterly
   inconceivable. The most masterly minds, when in the most spiritual
   state, have felt it impossible for the utmost stretch of their
   imagination to reach to the grandeur of God. Our loftiest conceptions
   of the universe probably fall very far short of what it really
   is--although the researches of astronomy have revealed facts surpassing
   all the powers of the human mind in the attempt to grasp them. Thought,
   reason, understanding, and even imagination are bewildered in the vast
   and illimitable fields of space amidst the marvels of God's handiwork.

   Yet all the wonders which the human eye has seen, or mortal spirit
   guessed at, are but parts of His ways. We have heard no more than one
   stanza of creation's never-ending Psalm. We have viewed but one stone
   in the vast mosaic of the Maker's works. An infusorial atom of life in
   a drop of water may know as much of the great sea as we do of the
   universe as a whole. An ant creeping over a sand heap by the seaside
   must not boast of having counted the grains which bound the ocean--nor
   must the most learned mortal dream that he has a full idea of the vast
   creation of God!

   Above all this, however, is the fact that all these wondrous works bear
   no more proportion to the unseen, all-powerful God, than one line
   written by the pen of Milton would bear to His masterly mind. When God
   has made all that He ordains to create and when we have seen all that
   He has made, yet there remains in Himself infinite possibilities of
   creation. The potter is far greater than the vessel which he fashions
   and the Lord is infinitely greater than all His works. He fills all
   things, but all things cannot fill Him. He contains immensity! He
   grasps eternity! But neither immensity nor eternity can encompass Him--

   "Great God, how infinite You are!
   What worthless worms are we!"

   Very fittingly does the Psalmist sing of Him as God humbling Himself to
   behold the things which are in Heaven. Those majestic beings--cherubim
   and seraphim--who flash with wings of fire to obey the behests of the
   Eternal are not to be observed of Him unless, speaking after the manner
   of men, in condescension He stoops Himself to view them. We sing of the
   Heaven, even the Heaven of heavens, as the Lord's and speak of those
   glorious places as being His peculiar abode, and so they are. And yet
   the Heaven of heavens cannot contain Him and celestial spirits are as
   nothing when compared with Him.

   Consider, then, the condescension of the Lord in visiting the sons of
   men! What a stoop is here, my Brethren! From the Throne of the Infinite
   to the clay tenements of man! Surely in a moment you will perceive that
   all gradations of rank among our race of worms must be less than
   nothing and even contemptible with Him! He does not consort with kings
   when He descends to earth, for what is their mimic pomp to Him? He does
   not seek out for Himself regal society as being more worthy of His
   dignity than association with poverty, for what is the child's play of
   courtly grandeur to Him? A king! What is he but a crowned worm? A king!
   What is he but dust and ashes raised a very little higher on the ash
   heap than the rest of the dust?

   The Lord, therefore, makes but small account of the honor which comes
   from man whose breath is in His nostrils--

   "With scorn Divine, He turns His eyes From towers of haughty kings."

   When His awful chariot rolls downward from the skies He makes men mark
   the fact of His condescension by visiting men of low estate. He would
   have to stoop to a palace--it is no more if He stoops to a dunghill.
   When He is engaged on Mercy's errands, having bowed so low as to enter
   a cabinet-council chamber, it is scarcely a step further to the haunt
   of poverty and the den of vice. Courage, you most humble of the sons of
   men--He who reigns in Heaven despises none. "He raises up the poor out
   of the dust and lifts the needy out of the dunghill."

   This has frequently occurred in Providence. God in His arrangements
   singularly alters the position of men. History is not without many
   instances in which the uppermost have become lowest and the lowest have
   been highest. Verily, "There are first that shall be last and there are
   last that shall be first." Solomon said, "I have seen servants upon
   horses and princes walking in the dust." And the same thing has been
   seen even in these modern times, when kings have fled their thrones and
   men who were prowling about in poverty have mounted to imperial power.

   God in Providence often laughs at pedigree and ancestry and stains the
   honor and dignity of everything in which human nature boasts itself.
   From the kennel to the palace is an easy ascent when Heaven favors. It
   is not upon Providence that I intend to dilate this morning. My text
   has a special bearing upon God's acts of Grace. Here it is above all
   others that we see the condescending sovereignty of His dealings. He
   takes the base things of the world and the things that are not, to
   bring to nothing the things that are.

   He selects for Himself those whom men would have repudiated with
   scorn--He covers His tabernacle of witness with badgers' skins, chooses
   unhewn stones to be the materials for His altar, a bush for a place of
   blazing manifestation and a shepherd boy to be the man after His own
   heart. Those persons and things which are despised among men are often
   highly esteemed in the sight of God. In considering the text this
   morning, let us notice the objects of God's choice. First, where some
   of them are. Secondly, how He takes them from their degraded state.
   Thirdly, how He lifts them up. And fourthly, where He puts them.

   It will be the history of a child of God--from the dunghill to the
   throne! Novelists are plastering our walls with sensational titles.
   Here is one which might even satisfy them in their ambition to delight
   the morbid cravings of this age. "From the dunghill to the throne," is
   a subject which ought to win your attention, and if it does not, the
   fault must surely lie with me--in it there will always be a blessed
   novelty of interest. And yet we thank God that it is a correct
   description of the upward experience of all the Lord's people! He finds
   tens of thousands in the dunghill-state and bears them up by the arms
   of His mercy till He makes them to sit among the princes of His people!

   I. We will begin where God began with us. WHERE GOD'S CHOSEN ONES ARE
   WHEN HE MEETS WITH THEM. The expression used in the text implies, in
   the first place, that many of them are in the lowest scale socially.
   Sovereign Grace has a people everywhere--in all ranks and conditions of
   men. Were we taken up to Heaven and did the heavenly spirits wear any
   token of their rank on earth, we should, on returning, say, "Here and
   there I saw a king. I marked a few princes of the blood and a handful
   of peers of the realm. I observed a little company of the prudent and a
   slender band of the rich and famous. But I saw a great company of the
   poor and the unknown, who were rich in faith and known unto the Lord."

   The Lord excludes no man from His election on account of his rank or
   condition. We shall not err if we say--

   "While Grace is given to the prince, The poor receive their share. No
   mortal has a just pretense To perish in despair."

   Yet how true it is that many of those whom God has chosen are found not
   simply among the workers, but among the poorest ranks of the sons of
   toil! There are some whose daily toil can scarcely find them bread
   enough to keep body and soul together, and yet they have fed daintily
   upon the Bread of Heaven. Many are clad in garments of the meanest
   kind, patched and mended everywhere, and yet they are as gloriously
   arrayed in the sight of God and the holy angels as the brightest of the
   saints! "Yet, I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not
   arrayed like one of these."

   Some of the sweetest biographies of Christians have been the lives of
   the lowly culled from the annals of the poor. Who has not read, "The
   Young Cottager," and "The Dairyman's Daughter"? Who has not found the
   greatest pleasure in visiting those bed-ridden ones who lie in the
   alms' room--those saints of God who owe to charity their daily food
   because sickness has deprived them of the means of earning their bread?
   My poor Hearer, you may this morning, while sitting in that pew, feel
   as if you were scarcely respectable enough to be in a place of worship,
   but I pray you let not your poverty hinder your receiving the Gospel,
   whose peculiar glory it is that it is preached to the poor!

   You may have nothing at all in this world--not a foot of ground which
   you can call your own. You may have been fighting against adversity--a
   deadly struggle--year after year, and yet you may still be as poor as
   poverty itself. I will neither commend nor upbraid your poverty, for
   there is nothing necessarily good or bad morally in any state of life.
   But I beg that you will not let your circumstances discourage you in
   the matter of your spiritual interest before God. Come as a beggar if
   you are a beggar. Come in rags if you have no other covering. "He that
   has no money, come, buy and eat. Yes, come, buy wine and milk without
   money and without price!"

   The expression in the text does not refer merely to social grades. I
   have no doubt it has a more spiritual meaning. The dunghill is a place
   where men throw their worthless things. When you have quite done with
   an article and cannot put it to any further use, you throw it away. It
   has been turned to two or three accounts since it was first employed
   for its original intention and now it is in the way and can no longer
   be harbored. It is of no use to be sold even as old metal and therefore
   you throw it on the dunghill that it may be taken away with the
   rubbish. How often have God's own chosen people felt themselves to be
   mere refuse and sweepings, good for nothing but to be cast away?

   You, dear Friends, are in a like case, for you have discovered your own
   utter worthlessness. Looking upon yourself in the light which you have
   received from Heaven, your fancied value has all departed. You were
   very important once in your own esteem, but you now perceive that your
   loss, so far from affecting Heaven and earth, would be of no more
   consequence to the world at large than the throwing of a rotten fruit
   upon the dunghill, or the falling of a sere leaf from one forest tree
   amidst a myriad.

   In your own estimation there is in you a lack of adaptation for any
   useful purpose. You are of no more use than salt which has lost its
   savor. You cannot glorify God as you could wish. You do not wish as
   much as you should. You can neither pray with the earnestness you
   desire, nor praise with the gratitude you wish to feel. Looking back
   upon your past life you are heartily ashamed. In a corner you mourn
   out, "Lord, what a worthless piece of lumber I have been in this world!
   What a cumberer of the ground! What an unprofitable servant!"

   You have been useful to your family, or to your country and once you
   thought this enough--but now you measure yourself as in the light of
   God--and inasmuch as you have never glorified Him who made you and have
   brought no honor to Him who is your kind and gracious Preserver, you
   feel yourself to be worthless. So worthless that if the Lord should
   throw you on the dunghill and say, "Put him away! He is as worthless as
   dross and dung!" He would only treat you as you richly deserve.

   My dear Friend, this estimate of yourself, though it brings you much
   unhappiness, is a very healthy sign. When we think little of ourselves,
   God thinks much of us. "God resists the proud, but gives Grace unto the
   humble." He will not break you, O you bruised reed! He will not quench
   you, O you smoking flax! But though you are only fit to be cast on the
   dunghill, His mercy will tenderly consider you and exalt you among the
   princes of His people!

   Again, the dunghill is a place of contempt. Contempt sometimes
   sneeringly says of its victim, "He is such a person that I would not
   pick him up if I saw him on a dunghill." The sneer of the world
   condemns some persons thus--"Oh, they are good for nothing. A dunghill
   is too good for them." Possibly, my Hearer, you may be placed in a
   family where you are much despised. You may not have the ability and
   sharpness of others of the household, and therefore you are much looked
   down upon and are regarded as a poor simpleton, not worth noticing. You
   have not succeeded in life as others have done and consequently you are
   viewed with much contempt by those who have prospered much and
   speedily.

   You may even feel, this morning, as if you merited the contempt poured
   upon you. You have been saying, "Ah, you despise me, but if you knew me
   as I know myself, you would despise me more! You think nothing of me
   and I am less than nothing. You call me an ill name, but could you see
   the deceitfulness of my base heart, you would understand that the name
   might be worn in truth though given in jest."

   Well, despised one, let me remind you that the Lord has often looked
   upon those whom man has despised. And though your own parents may have
   taken no pleasure in you and society may sneer at you and you may,
   yourself, now feel as if the sneer were well deserved, yet take
   confidence and be of good heart for God visits dunghills when He does
   not visit palaces and He will lift up the humble and meek from the dust
   where they pine and languish! The next remark may, perhaps, afford more
   comfort--the dunghill is like a place for filthy and offensive things.
   We say of a foul and unsavory thing, "It is too bad to be borne in the
   house, let it be swept away. Put it away with the filth--cover it up."

   When a matter becomes noisome, putrid, offensive, we want it to be
   removed at once. Ah, sad that we should have to say this of any of our
   fellow creatures, but we must say it. There are some whose sins are
   terribly foul. Their iniquities are so vile that they are an offense in
   the eyes and ears of all decent men--and the Holy God looks upon their
   actions with wrath and detestation. Some sinners have become so
   infamous in character that they are an injury to all associated with
   them! They cannot enter into any company without spreading the
   contagion of their sin. Their example is so bad that it is enough to
   poison the parish where they live. They are only fit to be put as so
   much rottenness, foulness, and putridity, on the dunghill where
   immorality rots out its hour of abomination.

   But, oh, the love of my Master! He has often stooped to rescue the
   abandoned from the dunghill. In Heaven I see those who had washed their
   robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb who once were
   harlots like Rahab, adulterers like David, and idolaters like Manasseh!
   Before the Throne of God there stand today, among the peers of God,
   those who, in their days of unregeneracy were thieves and drunkards and
   blasphemers! Heaven's courts are trod by many who once were the chief
   of sinners, but who now are brightest among the saints. I pray you,
   Beloved, never think that the Gospel of Christ saved great offenders in
   years gone by, but that now it is only for the upright and moral!

   The moral are freely invited to Christ, which we never forget to
   testify, but the immoral are bid, too. The Lord came to our earth as a
   Physician. And He came not to call the righteous, but sinners to
   repentance. He came not to heal those who are already sound in health,
   but the sick. O my Hearer, if you are so sick with sin that your whole
   head is sick and your whole heart faint and from the crown of your head
   to the soles of your feet there is no soundness in you--nothing but
   wounds and bruises and putrefying sores--yet still the love of my
   Master will stoop to you!

   If you have added lust to theft and even murder to lust! If you are
   red-handed with infamous iniquity, yet the sacred crimson bath which
   was filled from the heart of Jesus can wash away "all manner of sin and
   blasphemy." Whoever believes in Him is justified from all things from
   which he could not be justified by the law of Moses. Refined minds
   thought just now that I was using a very ugly expression when I spoke
   of rescuing rottenness from the dunghill, but the expression is all too
   clean when compared with sin--for all the filth and loathsomeness that
   ever offended eye and nostril are sweetness itself compared with sin!

   The foulest and most detestable thing in the whole universe is sin. It
   is this which keeps the fire of Hell burning as God's great sanitary
   necessity. There cannot but be a constant Tophet where there is such
   constant sin. We read that in certain French towns they kindled great
   public fires because of the cholera. The cholera? What is it compared
   with sin? Well may God cause the fiery flames of eternal torment to go
   up forever and ever, for it is only by such terrific punishment that
   the plague of sin can be at all restrained within bounds. Sin is a
   horrible evil, a deadly poison!

   And yet, Sinner, though you are as full of it as an egg is full of meat
   and as reeking with it as the foulest piece of noxious matter can be
   reeking with foul smell--yet the infinite mercy of God in Christ Jesus
   can lift you from this utmost degradation and make you shine as a star
   in His kingdom at the last!

   Once more, the dunghill may be spiritually considered as the place of
   condemnation. You look at a certain article of food, for instance, and
   the economical housewife does not wish to waste anything. Well, if it
   may not serve for food, may it not be useful for something else? At
   last, when she sees that it is of no service, the sentence of
   condemnation is, "Let it be cast on the dunghill." Nebuchadnezzar, in
   his memorable proclamation concerning the Lord Jehovah, said that
   whoever should speak a word against Him should be cut in pieces and his
   house should be made a dunghill.

   There is a connection, then, between the dunghill and condemnation. Now
   there may be in this audience, this morning, a man who feels himself to
   be under sentence of condemnation. You have so often had pricks of
   conscience--so frequently have been taught better--and yet you have
   sinned against light and knowledge, and now you consider yourself to
   have sinned beyond the reach of mercy. My voice, this morning, very
   likely grates on your ears. Though it is meant to convey to you the
   most gladsome tidings that ever silver trumpet rung out to bankrupt
   sinner on the day of Jubilee, yet it sounds to you like the voice which
   proclaims your doom.

   Well, poor Sinner, if you are, in yourself, condemned and a hoarse
   voice has said, "To the dunghill with him! To the flames of Hell with
   him!" yet I come to you in Jehovah's name and bid you hear this Word of
   God this morning--"He raises up the poor out of the dust and lifts the
   needy out of the dunghill, that He may set him with princes." What do
   you say to this? What if God should forgive you this morning? What if
   He should make you His child? What if He should give you a crown of
   life that fades not away? "Oh," you say, "if He would, I would love and
   bless Him." Sinner, He will do it if you can now believe in the Lord
   Jesus whose blood cleanses us from all sin!

   By the death of Jesus I beseech you trust in the atoning sacrifice of
   Calvary and you shall live to praise His redeeming love. I must not,
   however, leave out a thought which just occurred to me. A thing which
   lies upon the dunghill is in contact with disgusting associates. And,
   therefore, the text may represent those who have up to now lived in the
   midst of evil associations. When these doors are opened, there often
   come in here, out of curiosity, persons who are not regular attendants
   at places of worship--I must say the most hopeful class that I ever
   address--for some of you who have heard my voice and the voices of
   other ministers so long are almost hopeless!

   We might as well give you up for we have pleaded with you so frequently
   and put the Truth of God before you so constantly, that surely if it
   ever was to have been blessed to you it would have been blessed
   already! But those to whom the Gospel is a new thing occasionally drop
   in and some of these come from the very worst society, fresh from the
   theater, the gin palace and worse places still--the name of Jesus
   scarcely known except as it may be used in blasphemy! And the person
   never thought of God Most High except as He is invoked in a curse.

   Friend, we are glad that you are here! You have been on the dunghill.
   You are on the dunghill now! You have been living with publicans and
   harlots. You have kept bad company. You have not been nurtured among
   the choice and the elite of mankind! On the contrary, you have been
   among the pots and dwelt in the hedges. Now it is such as you are that
   Jesus Christ bids us gather in. "Go out quickly into the lanes and into
   the hedges and as many as you find bid to the supper." And they brought
   in the blind and the halt and the lame and they took their seats and
   feasted where others who were first invited refused to come!

   I call to you, then, if such there are within my hearing--to you who do
   not often darken the doors of God's sanctuary-- to you who live among
   the profane and the debauched--turn to Jesus Christ, I pray you! May
   the eternal Spirit turn you this day and may you be found among the
   chosen of God! Alas, and woe is me that I should have to say it, some
   of you, my Hearers, who have been moral and excellent and have listened
   to the Word these years, will, I solemnly fear, perish in your sins!
   For verily, verily, I say unto you, publicans and harlots will enter
   into the kingdom of Heaven before some of you who hear the Word but do
   it not! And listen to it but feel not its power! And know the joyful
   sound but do not receive it in your hearts!

   Thus much, then, as to where some of God's people are found. Let me say
   that in a certain sense this is where they all are--all on the dunghill
   of Adam's Fall--all on the dunghill of self-conceit, self-righteousness
   and depravity and sin and corruption! But Sovereign Mercy comes to them
   just as they lie there rotting in heaps of ruin and rescues them by
   effectual Grace.

   II. In the second place, we desire to describe HOW THE LORD RAISES THEM
   FROM IT. He lifts the needy out of the dunghill. It is a dead lift and
   none but an eternal arm could do it. It is a feat of Omnipotence to
   lift a sinner out of his natural degradation--it is all done by the
   power of the Holy Spirit through the Word, filled with the energy of
   God. The operation is somewhat on this wise. When the Lord begins to
   deal with the needy sinner, the first lift He gives him raises his
   desires. The man is not satisfied to be where he was, and what he was.
   That dunghill he had not perceived to be so foul as it really is. And
   the first sign of spiritual life is horror at his lost condition and an
   anxious desire to escape from it.

   Dear Hearer, have you advanced so far as this? Do you feel that all is
   wrong with you? And do you desire to be saved from your present state?
   So long as you can say, "It is well with me," and boast that you are no
   worse than others, I have no hope for you. God does not lift those up
   who are lifted up already! But when you begin to feel that your present
   state is one of degradation and ruin and that you desire to escape from
   it, then the Lord has put the lever under you! He has begun to raise
   you up!

   The next sign generally is that to such a man sin loses all sweetness.
   When the Lord begins to work with you, even before you find Christ to
   the joy of your soul, you will find the joy of sin to have departed. A
   quickened soul that feels the weight of sin cannot find pleasure in it.
   Although without faith in Jesus, the evil of sin cannot clearly and
   evangelically be perceived, yet the conscience of an awakened sinner,
   perceiving the terribly defiling character of some sins, compels him to
   give them up.

   The alehouse is abandoned. The scorner's seat is given up. The lusts of
   the flesh are forsaken--and though this does not lift the sinner from
   the dunghill, yet it is a sign that the Lord has begun His work of
   Grace. When sin grows bitter, mercy grows sweet. O my Friend, may the
   Lord wean you from the world's sweet poisons and bring you to the true
   pleasures which are hidden in Christ Jesus! It is another blessed sign
   that the man is being lifted from the dunghill when he begins to feel
   that his own self-righteousness is no assistance to him--when, having
   prayed, he looks upon his prayers with repentance--and having gone to
   God's House, rests not in the outward form.

   It is well when a man is cut off entirely from all confidence in
   himself. He may be on the dunghill still, but I am sure he will not be
   there long, for when you and yourself have quarreled, God and yourself
   begin to be at peace. When you can see through that cobweb
   righteousness of yours, which once seemed to be such a fair silken
   garment--when you can hate that counterfeit coin which once seemed to
   glitter and to chink like the true gold--when you are plunged in the
   ditch and your own clothes abhor you, it is not long before you shall
   be saved with an everlasting salvation!

   Now comes the true lift from off the dunghill. That poor, guilty, lost,
   worthless one hears of Jesus Christ, that He came into the world to
   save sinners--that poor soul looks to Him with a look which means,
   "Lord, You are my last resort! If You do not save me, I will perish.
   And You must save me altogether, for I cannot help You. I cannot give a
   thread with which to finish Your perfect righteousness. If it is
   unfinished, I cannot contribute one farthing to make up my own
   ransom--if You have not completely ransomed me, then Your redemption is
   of no service to me. Lord, I am a drowning, sinking man, I grasp You as
   I sink! O save me for Your mercy's sake!"--

   "All my help on You is stayed. All my trust from You I bring. Cover my
   defenseless head With the shado w of Your wing."

   When a soul gets there, then it is off the dunghill! The moment a
   sinner thus trusts Jesus Christ, his sins cease to be! God has drawn
   His pen through them all. They are gone. He is not guilty in the sight
   of God any longer--he stands acquitted through the Atonement and
   justified through the righteousness of Jesus Christ. He is a saved man!
   He may rise from his sackcloth and ashes, and walking at large, may
   sing of the blood-bought mercy which has set him completely free. Thus
   by the gift of the only-begotten Son, brought personally to the heart,
   the Lord raises His elect ones from their ruined state. He makes them
   see it to be a dunghill--makes them feel that they cannot get off of it
   themselves--points them to Christ--leads them to trust His precious
   blood and so they are delivered!

   III. The third point is, HOW HE RAISES THEM UP. It is a blessed thing
   to be saved from degradation, but praise be to Jehovah, He does not
   stop there! The Lord does nothing by halves. Oh, the lengths and
   breadths of love! When He has come right down to where we are it is
   only half His journey--it remains for Him to bear us right up to where
   He is. Oh, it is a blessed thing to be taken off the dunghill, even if
   our lot were that of hired servants in our father's house--but this
   does not satisfy the infinite heart of Jehovah--He will lift His people
   up above all commonplace joys--he will take them right up, up, up as on
   eagles' wings till He sets them in the place of princes and makes them
   to reign with Him!

   Now let us have a few minutes' consideration of how our blessed Lord
   lifts His people up from the common level of humanity to make them rank
   with princes. In the first place, they are lifted up by complete
   Justification. Every Christian here this morning, whatever may have
   been his past life, is at this instant perfect in the sight of God
   through Jesus Christ. The spotless righteousness of Christ is imputed
   to that sinner believing in Him, so that he stands, this morning,
   "accepted in the Beloved."

   Now Beloved, weigh this--turn it over and meditate upon it. Poor,
   needy, but believing Sinner, you are as accepted before God at this
   present time through Christ Jesus as if you had never sinned--as if you
   had done and performed every work of His most righteous Law without the
   slightest failure! Is not this sitting among princes? Complete
   Justification furnishes the Believer with a throne as safe as it is
   lofty--as happy as it is glorious. Ah, you scions of imperial houses,
   some of you know nothing of this! This is a note which many an emperor
   could never sing, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?
   It is God that justifies. Who is he that condemns?"

   Speak of sitting in pavilions of pleasure, or on divans of state with
   nobles, princes, kings, Caesars--why the figure flags--it falls short
   of the mark, for the state of the soul completely justified outshines
   all this as the sun outshines yon glimmering candle! Take the next
   step. The children of God who have been taken from the dunghill, many
   of them, enjoy full assurance of faith. They are certain that they are
   saved. They can say with Job, "I know that my Redeemer lives." As to
   whether they are children of God or not, they have no question.

   The Infallible witness of the Holy Spirit bears witness with their
   spirit that they are born of God. Christ is their elder Brother, God is
   their Father and they breathe the filial spirit by which they cry,
   "Abba, Father!" They know their own security. They are convinced that
   neither "things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor
   any other creature shall be able to separate them from the love of God,
   which is in Christ Jesus their Lord." I ask every one of understanding
   heart whether this is not sitting among princes?

   Beloved, I would not give a farthing for a prince's throne, but I would
   give all I had a thousand times told, if I might always enjoy full
   assurance of faith! The full assurance of faith is a better joy than
   Shushan's palace of lilies, or Solomon's house of the forest of Lebanon
   could ever yield. A sense of Divine loving-kindness is better than life
   itself--it is a young Heaven maturing below to be fully developed
   above. To know that my Beloved is mine and that I am His and that He
   loved me and gave Himself for me--this is far better than to be
   heir-apparent to a number of empires!

   We go further. The children of God favored by Divine Grace are
   permitted to have interviews with Jesus Christ! Like Enoch, we walk
   with God. Just as a child walks with his father, putting his hand into
   his father's hand, looking up with loving eyes, so the chosen people
   walk with their Father God most lovingly, confidingly, familiarly,
   talking to Him, telling Him their griefs and hearing from His gracious
   mouth the secrets of His love. They are a happy people, for they have
   communion with Jesus of a more intimate and tender sort than even
   angels know.

   We are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones! We are
   married unto Him! He has betrothed us unto Himself in faithfulness and
   in righteousness. We are dearer to Himself than His own flesh and
   blood--that He gave to die--and none of us shall ever perish! Neither
   shall any take us out of His hand. Now, is not this sitting among
   princes? Princes? Princes? We look down upon your pomp from the
   eminence on which Grace has placed us! Wear your crowns! Put on your
   purple! Deck yourselves in all your regal pomp! But when our souls can
   sit with Jesus and reign as kings and priests with Him, your splendors
   are not worth a thought!

   Communion with Jesus is a richer gem than ever glittered in any
   imperial diadem. Union with the Lord is a coronet of beauty outshining
   all the crowns of earth. Nor is this all--the elect of God, in addition
   to receiving complete justification, full assurance and communion with
   Christ--are favored with the Holy Spirit's sanctification. God the Holy
   Spirit dwells in every Christian. However humble he may be, he is a
   walking temple in which resides Deity. God the Holy Spirit dwells in us
   and we in Him. And that Spirit sanctifies the daily actions of the
   Christian, so that he does everything as unto God.

   If he lives, it is to Christ, and if he dies, it is gain. O Beloved, it
   is, indeed, to sit among princes when you feel the sanctifying
   influences of the Holy Spirit. O my God, if I might always feel Your
   Spirit overcoming my corruption and constraining my soul to holiness, I
   would not so much as think of a prince in comparison with my own joy! O
   my dear Brothers and Sisters in Jesus Christ, I am sure you can bear
   witness that when you fall into sin at any time, it brings you very
   low. You smell that vile dunghill once again and are ready to die under
   its fearful noisomeness! But when the Holy Spirit enables you to
   overcome sin and to live as Christ lived, you feel that you have a
   royal standing and a more than imperial privilege in being sanctified
   in Christ Jesus!

   Moreover, many saints receive, in addition to sanctification, the
   blessing of usefulness. And, mark the word, every useful man is of
   princely rank. I am not exaggerating now, but speaking the sober truth.
   He is the true prince among men who blesses his fellows. To be able to
   drop pearls from your lips might make you a prince in a fairy tale, but
   when those lips bless the souls of men by leading them to Jesus--this
   is to be a prince in very deed! To feed the hungry, to clothe the
   naked, to reclaim the fallen, to teach the ignorant, to cheer the
   desponding, to inspire the wavering and to conduct saints up to God's
   right hand-- my Brethren--this is to wear a luster which stars and
   ribbons, orders and distinctions never could confer!

   This is the privilege of each one of you, according as the Spirit of
   God has given you the measure of faith. You, who once did mischief, now
   subserve the interest of virtue. You, who rendered up your members
   servants unto unrighteousness, now make those same members servants of
   righteousness to the praise and glory of God. No courts of sovereigns
   can bestow such true honors as dwell in holiness, charity and zeal. And
   once more, God lifts His people up in another sense--while He gives
   them sanctification and usefulness, He also anoints them with joy. Oh,
   the joy of being a Christian!

   I know the world's idea is that we are a miserable people. If you read
   the pages of history, the writers speak of the gay cavaliers as being
   men of high spirit and overflowing joy--but the poor Puritans--what a
   wretched set they were! They blasphemed Christmas day, abhorred games
   and sports, and going about the world looking so terribly miserable
   that it were a pity they should go to Hell, for they had enough of
   torment here!

   Now this talk is all untrue! Or at best is a gross caricature!
   Hypocrites, then as now, did wear a long face and a rueful countenance.
   But there were to be found among the Puritans hosts of men whose holy
   mirth and joy were not to be equaled. No, not to be dreamed of, or
   understood by those poor grinning fools who fluttered round the
   heartless rake whose hypocrisies had lifted him to the English throne.
   The cavaliers' mirth was the crackling of thorns under a pot, but a
   deep and unquenchable joy dwelt in the breasts of those men--

   "Who trampled on the throng of the haughty and the strong, Who sat in
   the high places and slew the saints of God." Oh, far above the laughter
   of the gallants of the court was the mighty and deep joy of those who
   rode from the victorious field singing unto the Lord who had made them
   triumph gloriously!

   They called them "Ironsides," and such they were, but they had hearts
   of steel, which while they flinched not in the day of danger, forgot
   not to flash with joy even as steel glitters in the shining of the sun.
   Believe me, however, whatever they were, we who trust in Jesus are the
   happiest of people--not constitutionally, for some of us have great
   depression of spirits. Not always circumstantially, for some of us are
   much tried and are brought to the utter depths of poverty--but
   inwardly, truly, really-- our heart's joy, believe us, is not to be
   excelled. I would not stand here to lie for twice the Indies, but I
   will speak the truth--if I had to die like a dog tomorrow I would not
   change places with any man beneath the courts of Heaven for joy and
   peace of mind!

   To be a Christian, and know it, to drink deep of that cup, to know your
   election, to understand your calling--I assure you yields more peace
   and bliss in ten minutes than will be found in one hundred years in all
   the courts of sin, though wantonness should run riot and pleasure
   should know no license--

   "Solid joy and lasting pleasure None but Zion's children know."

   So when I read the text that He sets us among princes, I think little
   of the figure. It halts, it limps--for the Lord puts us far above all
   earthly princes! And were it not for the next sentence I would even say
   that the figure broke down altogether. But that clause makes it
   right--"even the princes of His people"--this puts soul and
   force--these are princes of another blood! These are peers of another
   realm and among such God sets His people!

   IV. To conclude, we have to notice in the last place, WHERE IT IS THAT
   OUR LORD SETS HIS PEOPLE. "Among princes," we are told. We have already
   dwelt upon the same thought, but we will examine another side of it.
   "Among princes," is the place of select society. They do not admit
   everybody into that charmed circle. Among an aristocracy the poor
   plebeian must not venture. The blue blood runs in rather a narrow
   channel and it cannot be expected that the common crimson should be
   allowed to invigorate the languid current.

   The true Christian lives in very select society. Listen! "Truly our
   fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ." Speak of
   select society--there is none like this! We are a chosen generation, a
   peculiar people, a royal priesthood. "We are not come unto Mount Sinai,
   but we are come unto the blood of sprinkling and unto the general
   assembly and Church of the first-born, whose names are written in
   Heaven." This is select society.

   Next they have courtly audience--the prince may be expected to have
   admittance to royalty when common people like ourselves must stand afar
   off. Now the child of God has free access to the royalty of Heaven. Our
   courtly privileges are of the highest order. Listen! "For through Him
   we both have access by one spirit unto the Father." "Let us come
   boldly," says the Apostle, "to the Throne of the heavenly Grace, that
   we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need." We have
   courtly audience and peculiarly select society.

   Next to this it is supposed that among princes there is abundant
   wealth, but what is the wealth of princes compared with the riches of
   Believers? For "all things are yours and you are Christ's and Christ is
   God's." "He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us
   all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?" Among
   princes, again, there dwells peculiar power. A prince has influence. He
   wields a scepter in his own domain--and, "He has made us kings and
   priests unto God and we shall reign forever and ever."

   We are not kings of England, Scotland and Ireland, and yet we have a
   triple dominion! We reign over spirit, soul and body! We reign over the
   united kingdom of time and eternity! We reign in this world and we
   shall reign in the world that is yet to come--for we shall reign
   forever and ever! Princes, again, have special honor. Everyone in the
   crowd desires to gaze upon a prince and would be delighted to do him
   service. Let him have the first position in the empire--he is a prince
   of the blood and is to be had in esteem and respect.

   Beloved, hear His Word--"He has raised us up together and made us sit
   together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus," so that we share the
   honor of Christ as we share His Cross. Paul was taken from the dunghill
   of persecution, but he is not second to any in Glory! And you, though
   you may have been the chief of sinners, shall fare none the worse when
   He comes in His kingdom! But as He owned you on earth and redeemed you
   with His precious blood, so will He own you in the future state and
   make you sit with Him and reign among princes, world without end. May
   the Lord bless these words for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                                     Simeon

   A SERMON PREACHED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   "And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. And
   the same man was just and devout, waiting for the Consolation of
   Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him."

   Luke 2:25.

   WHAT a biography of a man! How short and yet how complete! We have seen
   biographies so wordy, full one half is nonsense and much of the other
   half too dull to be worth reading. We have seen large volumes spun out
   of men's letters. Writing desks have been broken open and private
   diaries exposed to the world. Nowadays if a man is a little celebrated,
   his signature, the house in which be was born, the place where he dines
   and everything else is thought worthy of public notice. So soon as he
   is departed this life he is embalmed in huge folios, the profit of
   which rests mainly, I believe, with the publishers and not with the
   readers.

   Short biographies, which give a concise and exact account of the whole
   man, are the best. What do we care about what Simeon did--where he was
   born, where he was married, what street he used to walk through, or
   what colored coat he wore? We have a very concise account of his
   history and that is enough. His "name was Simeon." He lived "in
   Jerusalem." "The same man was just and devout, waiting for the
   Consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him." Beloved, that
   is enough of a biography for any one of us. If, when we die, so much as
   this can be said of us--our name. Our business, "waiting for the
   Consolation of Israel." Our character, "just and devout." Our
   companionship, having the Holy Spirit upon us--that will be sufficient
   to hand us down, not to time, but to eternity memorable among the just
   and estimable among all them that are sanctified!

   Pause awhile, I beseech you, and contemplate Simeon's character. The
   Holy Spirit thought it worthy of notice since He put a, "behold," in
   the sentence! "Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was
   Simeon." He does not say, "Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose
   name was King Herod." He does not say, "Behold, there was a man in
   Jerusalem who was High Priest." He says, "Behold!"--turn aside here,
   for the sight is so rare you may never see such a thing again so long
   as you live! Here is a perfect marvel--"Behold," there was one man in
   Jerusalem who was "just and devout, waiting for the Consolation of
   Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him."

   His character is summed up in two words--"just and devout."
   "Just"--that is his character before men. "Devout"--that is his
   character before God. He was "just." Was he a father? He did not
   provoke his children to anger, lest they should be discouraged. Was he
   a master? He gave unto his servants that which was just and equal,
   knowing that he also had his Master in Heaven. Was he a citizen? He
   rendered obedience unto the powers that then were, submitting himself
   to the ordinances of man for the Lord's sake.

   Was he a merchant? He overreached in no transaction, but providing
   things honest in the sight of all men, he honored God in his common
   business habits. Was he a servant? Then he did not render eye-service,
   as a man-pleaser, but in singleness of heart he served the Lord. If, as
   is very probable, he was one of the teachers of the Jews, then he was
   faithful. He spoke what he knew to be the Word of God although it might
   not be for his gain. And he would not, like the other shepherds, turn
   aside to speak error for the sake of filthy lucre. Before men he was
   just.

   But that is only half a good man's character. There are many who say,
   "I am just and upright. I never robbed a man in my life. I pay twenty
   shillings in the pound. And if anybody can find fault with my
   character, let him speak. Am I not just?" But as for their religion,
   such a one will say, "I do not care about it. I think it is cant." Sir,
   you have only one feature of a good man and that the smaller.

   You do good towards man, but not towards God! You do not rob your
   fellow, but you rob your Maker! "Will a man rob God?" Yes, and think
   far less of it than he would if he robbed man. He who robs man is
   called a villain. He who robs God is often called a gentleman. Simeon
   had both features of a Christian. He was a "just man," and he was also
   "devout." Mark, it does not say he was a just man and religious. A man
   may be very religious and yet he may not be devout. Religion, you know,
   as the term is used, consists very much in outward observances.
   Godliness and devotion consist in the inward life and action arising
   from the inner spring of true consecration.

   It does not say here that Simeon was a religious man, for that he might
   have been and yet have been a Pharisee, a hypocrite, a mere professor.
   But no, he was a "devout" man. He valued the "outward and visible
   sign," but he possessed the "inward and spiritual Grace." Therefore he
   is called "a just man and devout." "Behold!" says the Holy Spirit!
   "Behold!" for it is a rarity! Come here, you Christians of the present
   day! Many of you are just, but you are not devout! And some of you
   pretend to be devout, but you are not just. The just and the devout
   together make up the perfection of the godly man. Simeon was "a just
   man and devout."

   But now, leaving the character of Simeon as a man, we shall endeavor to
   expound his blessed hope as a Believer. To this end we ask your
   attention, first, to the expectation--he was "waiting for the
   Consolation of Israel." Secondly, the fulfillment--that which he waited
   for, he saw. And when he found Jesus, he said, "Lord, now let Your
   servant depart in peace." And thirdly, the explanation of that
   fulfillment, or how it is that the Lord Jesus is the Consolation of
   Israel.

   I. First, then, SIMEON'S EXPECTATION. He was "waiting for the
   Consolation of Israel." This was the position of all the saints of God,
   from the first promise, even to the time of Simeon. Poor old Simeon had
   now become grey-headed. It is very possible that he had passed the
   usual period allotted to man's life, but he did not wish to die! He
   wished for "the Consolation of Israel." He did not wish that the
   tabernacle of his body might be dissolved, but he did hope that through
   the chinks of that old battered tabernacle of his he might be able to
   see the Lord!

   Like the hoary-headed Christian of our times, he did not desire to die,
   but he did desire to "be with Christ, which was far better." All the
   saints have waited for Jesus. Our mother Eve waited for the coming of
   Christ. When her first son was born, she said, "I have gotten a man
   from the Lord." True, she was mistaken in what she said--it was Cain
   and not Jesus. But by her mistake we see that she cherished the blessed
   hope. That Hebrew Patriarch who took his son, his only son, to offer
   him for a burnt offering, expected the Messiah and well did he express
   his faith when he said, "My son, God will provide Himself a lamb."

   He who once had a stone for his pillow, the trees for his curtains, the
   Heaven for his canopy and the cold ground for his bed, expected the
   coming of Jesus, for he said on his deathbed--"Until Shiloh comes." The
   Lawgiver of Israel who was "king in Jeshurun," spoke of him, for Moses
   said, "A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your
   brethren, like unto me: Him shall you hear." David celebrated Him in
   many a Prophetic song--the Anointed of God, the King of Israel. Him to
   whom all kings shall bow and all nations call Him blessed." How
   frequently does he in his Psalms sing about "my Lord"! "The LORD said
   unto my Lord, Sit You at My right hand, until I make Your enemies Your
   footstool."

   But need we stop to tell you of Isaiah, who spoke of His passion and
   "saw His Glory"? Or of Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Micah, Malachi and of
   all the rest of the Prophets who stood with their eyes strained,
   looking through the dim mists of futurity, until the weeks of prophecy
   should be fulfilled--until the sacred day should arrive, when Jesus
   Christ should come in the flesh? They were all waiting for the
   Consolation of Israel! And, now, good old Simeon, standing on the verge
   of the period when Christ would come--with expectant eyes looked out
   for Him!

   Every morning he went up to the temple, saying to himself, "Perhaps He
   will come today." Each night when he went home he bent his knee and
   said, "O Lord, come quickly! Even so, come quickly!" And yet, that
   morning he went to the Temple, little thinking, perhaps, the hour was
   at hand when he should see his Lord there! But there He was, brought in
   the arms of His mother, a little Babe. And Simeon knew Him!

   "Lord," he said, "now let Your servant depart in peace, according to
   Your word: for my eyes have seen Your Salvation." "Oh," cries one, "but
   we cannot wait for the Savior now!" No, Beloved, in one sense we cannot
   for He is come already! The poor Jews are waiting for Him. They will
   wait in vain now for His first coming, that having passed already.
   Waiting for the Messiah was a virtue in Simeon's day--it is the
   infidelity of the Jews now since the Messiah is come. Still there is a
   high sense in which the Christian ought to be every day waiting for the
   Consolation of Israel.

   I am very pleased to see that the doctrine of the Second Coming of
   Christ is gaining ground everywhere. I find that the most spiritual men
   in every place are "looking for," as well as "hastening unto," the
   coming of our Lord and Savior. I marvel that the belief is not
   universal, for it is so perfectly Scriptural. We are, we trust, some of
   us, in the same posture as Simeon. We have climbed the staircase of the
   Christian virtues from where we look for that blessed hope, the coming
   of our Lord Jesus Christ. Besides, if we do not believe in the Second
   Coming, every Christian waits for the Consolation of Israel at times
   when he misses the sweet consoling experience.

   I speak to some of you, perhaps, who are feeling that you have lost the
   light of the Lord's face lately. You have not seen His blessed
   countenance. You have not heard His love-speaking voice. You have not
   listened to the tender accents of His lips, and you are longing for
   Him. You are, like Simeon, waiting for the Consolation of Israel. He
   will come-- though He tarries, He will come. Christ does not leave His
   people entirely. Though He hides His face, He will come again! The
   child says the swallows are dead because they skim the purple sea.
   Wait, O Child, and the swallows shall come back again!

   The foolish one thinks that the sun has died out because he is hidden
   behind the clouds. Stop for a little season and the sun shall come
   again and you shall know that he was brewing behind dark clouds the
   April shower, mother to the sweet May flowers! Jesus is gone for a
   little while--but He will come again! Christian! Be waiting for the
   Consolation of Israel! I hope, too, I have in this place some poor
   seeking sinner who is waiting for the like Consolation. Sinner! You
   will not have to wait forever! It is very seldom Christ Jesus keeps
   poor sinners waiting long. Sometimes He does. He answers them not a
   word, but then it is to try their faith. Though He keeps them waiting,
   He will not send them away empty. He will be sure to give them mercies,
   sooner or later. "Though the promise tarries, wait for it," and you
   shall find it yet, to your soul's salvation.

   Child of God! Has not your Father come to you yet? Cry for Him! Cry for
   Him! Your Father will come! Nothing fetches the parent to the child,
   like the child's cry. Cry, Little One, cry, you who have but little
   faith! "Ah, but," you say, "I am too weak to cry." Did you ever notice
   that the little one sometimes cries so very low that when you are
   sitting in the parlor with its mother, you do not hear it? Up she goes!
   There is the dear child crying upstairs. And off she goes! She can hear
   it, though you cannot--because it is her child that cries.

   Cry, Little One! Let your prayers go up to Heaven. Though your minister
   does not hear it--though Unbelief says no one can hear it--there is a
   God in Heaven who knows the cry of the penitent! He "heals the broken
   in heart and binds up their wounds." Sweet posture! To be waiting for
   the Consolation of Israel!

   II. This brings us to the second point--THE FULFILMENT OF THIS
   EXPECTATION. Did Simeon wait in vain? Ah, no! He waited for consolation
   and he had the consolation for which he waited. Oh, I can picture
   Simeon's frame! How altered it was that morning! He went, probably, an
   old man limping up to the Temple, his face sad with disappointment, his
   eyes dark with distress because he had not found that for which he
   looked. He wanted to see and could not see. He desired to know and he
   did not know.

   Sometimes, in his unbelieving moments, he thought that, like the
   Prophets and kings, he should wait long and seek, but never find. Do
   you not think you see him, when he held the Babe in his arms? Why, the
   old man did not then need his staff to lean on--down it went and both
   his arms grasped the Child! He may have trembled a little, but the
   mother of Jesus was not afraid to trust her Child to him. How young he
   felt! As young as when ten years ago he walked with light steps through
   the streets of Jerusalem!

   Scarcely in Heaven did old Simeon feel more happy than he did at that
   moment when he clasped the Babe in his arms! Do you not think you see
   him? Joy is flashing from his eyes! His lips speak sonnets which burst
   out like the chorus of immortals, when he says, "Lord, now let Your
   servant depart in peace, according to Your word: for my eyes have seen
   Your Salvation." Ask now! Was he disappointed in the object of his
   search? Was Jesus equal to his expectations, "the Consolation of
   Israel"? We answer, Yes! We dare any person here, or in the wide world,
   to deny what we now assert-- there is certainly sweet and blessed
   consolation in Jesus for all the people of God!

   I do not know whether any have ever been fools enough to say the Gospel
   is not comforting. I do not think they have. Most of them have said,
   "It is a very good religion for old women and imbeciles, for sick
   people--those on deathbeds." The worst of men admit that religion is a
   very comfortable thing. Or if they do not admit it, they have the
   lesson to learn. Come, deist or skeptic, whichever you are, let me
   point you to Believers in the time of persecution. Look upon that face
   of Stephen, already lighted up with Heaven's own Glory while they are
   stoning him!

   Let me bring you down through the ages of the rack and the wheel, the
   times of stocks and inquisitions. Let me tell you of martyrs who
   clapped their hands in the flames and while their limbs were burning at
   the stake could yet sing a carol, as if it were Christmas Day in their
   hearts, though it was Ash Day to their bodies! How often you find those
   who are foremost in suffering, foremost in joy! When men laid iron
   chains on their arms, God put golden chains of honor on their necks.

   When men heaped reproaches on their names, God heaped comforts on their
   souls. The peace cry, like the blood cry, let it never be hushed! The
   Christian race, by our martyrs and confessors, show the wide, wide
   world that there is a joy in religion that can quench the flame, snatch
   torture from the rack, the torment from the wheel! It can sing in
   prison! It can laugh cheerfully in the stocks and make our free and
   unimprisoned hearts burst through the bars of the dungeon and fly
   upwards, chanting Psalms to our God! Behold the Consolation of Israel!

   But the infidel replies, "These are excitable moments. At such times
   persons are stimulated beyond their natural strength. Your examples are
   not fair." Come here, Unbeliever, and let me show you Christians in
   ordinary life--not martyrs, not confessors, not men with blood-red
   crowns on their brows--but common men like yourself. See that husband?
   He has just returned from the funeral of his wife. Do you mark his
   countenance? He says, "The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away,
   blessed be the name of the Lord."

   Could you do that? See that mother? Her child lies dead. And looking on
   it she says, "He has done all things well. It is hard to part with him,
   but I will resign him to my God." Could you do that, Infidel? See
   yonder merchant? Ruin has overtaken him--he is reduced to poverty. Mark
   how he lifts his hands to Heaven and cries, "Although the fig tree
   shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines. The labor of
   the olive shall fail and the fields shall yield no meat. The flock
   shall be cut off from the fold and there shall be no herd in the
   stalls, yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my
   salvation."

   Could you do the like, Infidel? No, you could not. But there is
   consolation in Jesus Christ. I am half ashamed of some of you, my
   Brethren, who do not bear trouble well because you are not an honor to
   your religion as you ought to be. You should learn, if possible, to
   say, like Job--"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him." "Alas,"
   you say, "it is easy enough for you to tell us so, but not quite so
   easy to practice." I grant yon that! But then it is the glory of the
   Gospel that makes us do things that are not easy. If it is a hard
   thing, so much the more honor to God--so much the more virtue in the
   Scriptures--that by their blessed influence and by the aid of the Holy
   Spirit, they enable us to bear trials under which others sink.

   But a little while ago I heard of an ungodly man who had a pious wife.
   They had but one daughter, a fair and lovely thing. She was laid on a
   bed of sickness--the father and mother stood beside the bed. The solemn
   moment came when she must die. The father leaned over and put his arm
   round her and wept hot tears upon his child's white brow. The mother
   stood there too, weeping her very soul away. The moment that child was
   dead, the father began to tear his hair and curse himself in his
   despair! Misery had got hold upon him. But as he looked towards the
   foot of the bed, there stood his wife. She was not raving, she was not
   cursing.

   She wiped her eyes and said, "I shall go to her, but she shall not
   return to me." The unbeliever's heart for a moment rose in anger, for
   he imagined that she was a stoic. But the tears flowed down her cheeks,
   too. He saw that though she was a weak and feeble woman, she could bear
   sorrow better than he could and he threw his arms round her neck and
   said, "Ah, Wife, I have often laughed at your religion. I will do so no
   more! There is much blessedness in this resignation. Would God that I
   had it, too!" "Yes," she might have answered, "I have the Consolation
   of Israel." There is--hear it, you despisers and wonder and
   perish!--there is consolation in Jesus Christ!

   That dear Sister, whom I mentioned at the beginning of this service,
   was one of the noblest pictures of resignation I have ever seen. When I
   went to see her I could only describe her position like this--she was
   sitting on the banks of the Jordan, singing, with her feet in the
   water, longing to cross the river. "Ah, Pastor," she said, when I came
   in, "how you have fed my soul and made my young days come over again. I
   did not think the Lord would give me such blessed seasons just before
   He took me Home. But now I must bid you good-by, for I am going up to
   my Jesus and I shall be with Him forever."

   I shall not forget how calm she looked! Ah, it is sweet to see a
   Christian die! It is the noblest thing on earth--the dismissal of a
   saint from his labor to his reward! From his conflicts to his triumphs!
   The gorgeous pageantry of princes is as nothing. The glory of the
   setting sun is not to be compared with the heavenly light which
   illumine the soul as it fades from the organs of bodily sense to be
   ushered into the august Presence of the Lord! When dear Haliburton
   died, he said, "I am afraid I shall not be able to bear another
   testimony to my Master, but in order to show you that I am peaceful and
   still resting on Christ, I will hold my hands up." And just before he
   died, he held both his hands up and clapped them together, though he
   could not speak!

   Have you ever read of the deathbed of Payson? I cannot describe it to
   you. It was like the flight of a seraph. John Knox, that brave old
   fellow, when he came to die, sat up in his bed and said, "Now the hour
   of my dissolution is come. I have longed for it many a day, and I shall
   be with my Lord in a few moments." Then he fell back on his bed and
   died. We have many others of whom I might tell you. Such as that
   blessed Janeway, who said, "O that I had lips to tell you a thousandth
   part of that which I now feel! You will never know the worth of Jesus
   till you come to your deathbed and then you will find Him a blessed
   Christ, when you need Him most."

   Unbeliever, stand where death is at work! And if you love not the
   righteous in their life, you will say, none the less, like Balaam, "Let
   me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like his."
   Such is our holy religion--a sweet and blessed consolation!

   III. And this brings us to the third point which is THE EXPLANATION OF
   THIS FACT--to show to all men and to show to you, especially, that
   there is consolation and to explain how it is.

   In the first place, there is consolation in the doctrines of the Bible.
   I like a doctrinal religion. I do not believe in the statement of some
   people that they have no creed. A man says, for instance, "I am not a
   Calvinist and I am not an Arminian. I am not a Baptist, I am not a
   Presbyterian, I am not an Independent." He says he is liberal. But this
   is only the license he claims for his own habit of disagreeing with
   everybody. He is one of that sort of people whom we generally find to
   be the most bigoted and least tolerant of others.

   He follows himself And so belongs to the smallest denomination in the
   world! I do not believe that charity consists in giving up our
   denominational distinctions. I think there is a "more excellent way."
   Even those who despise not faith, though they almost sacrifice it to
   their benevolence, will sometimes say, "Well, I don't belong to any of
   your sects and parties."' There was a body of men once who came out
   from all branches of the Christian Church with the hope that everybody
   else of true heart would follow them. The result, however, has been
   that they have only made another denomination, distinct alike in
   doctrine and discipline.

   1 believe in creeds if they are based on Scripture. They may not secure
   unity of sentiment, but on the whole they promote it, for they serve as
   landmarks and show us the points at which many turn aside. Every man
   must have a creed if he believes anything. The greater certainty he
   feels that it is true, the greater his own satisfaction. In doubts,
   darkness and distrust, there can be no consolation. The vague fancies
   of the skeptic, as he muses over images and apprehensions too shapeless
   and airy to be incorporated into any creed may please for awhile, but
   it is the pleasure of a dream.

   I believe that there is consolation for Israel in the substance of
   faith and the evidence of things not seen. Ideas are too ethereal to
   lay hold of. The anchor we have is sure and steadfast. I thank God that
   the faith I have received can be molded into a creed and can be
   explained with words so simple that the common people can understand it
   and be comforted by it. Then look at the doctrines themselves--the
   doctrines of the Bible. What well-springs of consolation they are! How
   consolatory the doctrine of election to the Israel of God! To some men
   it is repulsive. But show me the gracious soul that has come to put his
   trust under the wings of the Lord God of Israel--"Chosen in Christ,"
   will be a sweet stanza in his song of praise!

   To think that before the hills were formed, or the channels of the sea
   were scooped out, God loved me! That from everlasting to everlasting
   His mercy is upon His people! Is not that a consolation? You who do not
   believe in election, go and fish in other waters--but in this great sea
   there are mighty fishes. If you could come here, you would find rich
   consolation. Or come again to the sweet doctrine of redemption. What
   consolation is there, Beloved, to know that you are redeemed with the
   precious blood of Christ! Not the mock redemption taught by some
   people, which pretends that the ransom is paid, but the souls that are
   ransomed may, notwithstanding, be lost. No, no! A positive redemption
   which is effectual for all those for whom it is made.

   Oh, to think that Christ has so purchased you with His blood that you
   cannot be lost! Is there not consolation in that doctrine--the doctrine
   of redemption? Think, again, of the doctrine of atonement--that Christ
   Jesus has borne all your sins in His own body on the Cross--that He has
   put away your sins by the sacrifice of Himself! There is nothing like
   believing in full Atonement--that all our sins are washed away and
   carried into the depths of the sea. Is there not consolation there?
   What do you say, Worldling, if you could know yourself to be elect of
   God the Father? If you could believe yourself redeemed by His only
   begotten Son? If you knew that for your sins there was a complete
   ransom paid-- would not that be a consolation to you?

   Perhaps you answer, "No." That is because you are a natural man and do
   not discern spiritual things. The spiritual man will reply,
   "Consolation? Yes, sweet as honey to these lips! Yes, sweeter than the
   honeycomb to my heart are those precious doctrines of the Grace of
   God." Let us pass on to consolatory promises. Oh, how sweet to the soul
   in distress are the promises of Jesus! For every condition there is a
   promise! For every sorrow there is a cordial! For every wound there is
   a balm! For every disease there is a medicine. If we turn to the Bible,
   there are promises for all cases.

   Now let me appeal to you, my Friends. Have you not felt how consoling
   the promises are to you in seasons of adversity and hours of anguish?
   Do you not remember some occasion when your spirits were so broken down
   that you felt as if you never could have struggled through your woes
   and sorrows had not some sweet and precious Word of God come to your
   help? Minister of the Gospel, do you not remember how often you have
   feared that your message would be of no effect? But you have heard your
   Master whisper, "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the
   world."

   Sunday school Teacher, have not you said, "I have labored in vain and
   spent my strength for nothing"? And have you not then heard Jesus say,
   "My Word shall not return unto Me void"? Mourner, you have lost a near
   relation, have you not heard Jesus then say, "All things work together
   for good"? Softly wipe that tear away, O Widow--would not your heart
   have broken if it had not been for the assurance, "Your Maker is your
   husband"? Fatherless child, what would have become of you if you had
   not turned to the consoling promise, "Leave your fatherless children
   and let your widows trust in Me"?

   But why need I tell you, Christian, that there are consoling promises
   in the Bible? You know there are! I would not sell a leaf of the Bible
   for a world, nor would I change a promise of it for stars made of
   gold--

   "Holy Bible, book Divine, Precious treasure! You are mine." No such
   comfort can I find as what I derive from you! You are Heaven on earth
   to me, blessed Bible! Verily, if we wait for Christ, we shall find that
   in His Gospel there is consolation for Israel. Not only have we
   consolatory promises and consolatory doctrines, but we have consolatory
   influences in the ministry of the Holy Spirit. There are times, my
   Friends, when all the promises in the world are of no use to us--when
   all the doctrines in the world would be of no avail unless we had a
   hand to apply them to us.

   There lies a poor man. He has been wounded in battle. In yonder
   hospital there is a bundle of liniment. The blood is flowing. He has
   lost an arm. He has lost a leg. There are plenty at the hospital who
   can bind up his wounds and plenty of medicines for all that he now
   suffers. But what use are they? He may lie forlorn on the battlefield
   and die unless there is someone to bring the ambulance to carry him to
   the place--he cannot reach it himself. He lifts himself up on that one
   remaining arm, but he falls down faint. The blood is flowing freely and
   his strength is ebbing with it. Oh, then it is not the liniment he
   cares for! It is not the ointment--it is someone who can bring those
   things to him! Yes, and if the remedies were all put there by his side,
   it may be he is so faint and sick that he can do nothing for his own
   relief.

   Now, in the Christian religion there is something more than
   prescriptions for our comfort. There is One, even the Spirit of Truth,
   who takes of the things of Jesus and applies them to us. Think not that
   Christ has merely put joys within our reach that we may get them for
   ourselves! He comes and puts the joys inside our hearts! The poor,
   sick, way-worn pilgrim not only finds there is something to strengthen
   him to walk, but he is borne on eagles' wings! Christ does not merely
   help him to walk, but carries him and says, "I will bind up your
   wounds. I will come to you Myself."

   O poor Soul, is not this joy for you? You have been often told by your
   minister to believe in Christ, but you say you cannot. You have often
   been invited to come to Jesus, but you feel you cannot come. Yes, but
   the best of the Gospel is that when a sinner cannot come to Christ,
   Christ can come to him! When the poor soul feels that it cannot get
   near Christ, Christ will be sure to draw him. O Christian, if you are,
   tonight, laboring under deep distresses, your Father does not give you
   promises and then leave you! The promises He has written in the Word He
   will engrave on your heart. He will manifest His love to you and by His
   blessed Spirit, which blows like the wind, take away your cares and
   troubles.

   Be it known unto you, O Mourner, that it is God's prerogative to wipe
   every tear from the eyes of His people. I shall never forget hearing
   John Gough say, in his glowing manner--"Wipe away tears? That is God's
   prerogative. And yet," said he, "/ have done it when the drunkard has
   been reclaimed and the tears of a wife have been wiped from her
   cheeks."

   Beloved, it is a blessed thing to wipe others' tears away! But "Lo,
   these things works God oftentimes with men." He not only gives you the
   handkerchief, but wipes your eyes for you! He not only gives you the
   sweet wine, but holds it to your lips and pours it into your mouth!

   The good Samaritan did not say, "Here is the wine and here is the oil
   for you." What did he do? He poured in the oil and the wine. He did not
   say, "Now, mount the beast"--but he set him on it and took him to the
   inn. Glorious Gospel, that provides such things for poor lost
   ones--comes after us when we cannot come after it--brings us Grace when
   we cannot win Grace! Here is Grace in the giving as well as the gift!
   Happy people, to be thus blessed of God! Simeon "waited for the
   Consolation of Israel," and he found it. May you find it, too!

   Two short addresses to two sorts of people, and then we shall be done.
   To you, you followers of Jesus, let me speak. I have one thing to ask
   of you. With such a Father who loves you--with such a Savior who has
   given Himself for you and does give Himself to you--with such a good
   Spirit to abide with you, instruct you and comfort you--with such a
   Gospel--what now bows you down? What is meant by those wrinkled brows?
   What is meant by those flowing tears? What is meant by those aching
   hearts? What is meant by that melancholy carriage?

   "What do they mean?" you say! "Why, I have troubles." But, Brother,
   have you forgotten the exhortation of the Lord? "Cast your burden on
   the Lord. He will sustain you." "He shall never suffer the righteous to
   be moved." Do, Brethren, do try to be as glad as you can. Rejoice
   forevermore! A cheerful Christian recommends religion. We usually look
   in the window of a tradesman's shop to see what he sells. And persons
   very frequently look into our faces to ascertain what are the thoughts
   of our heart. Alas, that they should see any of us looking habitually
   sad.

   Some persons think that sour faces and somber garments are fitting
   emblems of sanctity. They would count it wicked to laugh, or if they
   were to do such a thing as smile in chapel they would think that they
   had committed an unpardonable sin, though I never saw any law against
   that yet. All that is in us should bless His holy name, from the most
   playful fancy to the most sublime reverie. You need not emulate those
   who, to appear righteous, disfigure their faces that they may appear
   unto men to fast. Let me beg of you, Christian, when you fast, to be of
   a cheerful countenance! Appear not unto men to fast. Be ever so sad,
   try and keep your sadness to yourself. Do not let people hear you
   murmur, lest they should say, "Look at that Christian, he is weak as we
   are."

   You have heard the old fiction that Jesus Christ never laughed or
   smiled. It was brought forward at a friend's, where

   1 was once staying. There was a little child in the room, who when she
   heard it, ran up to her father and said, "Papa, that gentleman did not
   tell the truth." Of course everyone looked at her and waited for her
   explanation. "I know that Jesus did, Papa," she added, "for the little
   children loved Him. And I don't think they would have loved Him if He
   had never smiled. Did not He say, 'Suffer little children to come unto
   Me,' and He took them up in His arms and gave them His blessing?"

   Do you think any good Christian could take up a little child without
   smiling? And if he did not smile, do you think the child would go to
   him? Jesus Christ did smile. A cheerful face wins honor to religion! A
   cheerful deportment glorifies God, for He has said, "Let the saints be
   joyful in glory. Let them sing aloud upon their beds: let the children
   of Zion be joyful in their King." Be joyful, Christians! Be joyful!--

   "Why should the children of a King, Go mourning all their days?"

   And now, before I close, let me appeal to those who have not this
   consolation. Men and Brethren, give heed. For Israel there is
   consolation. But for you--what is to become of some of you who have not
   this consolation at all? Worldly Men, from where do you draw your
   bliss? From the polluted ditches of a filthy world? Soon, alas, will
   they be emptied! And what will you do then? I see a Christian. There he
   is! He has been drinking all his life out of the river that makes glad
   the city of our God. And when he gets to Heaven, he goes to the same
   stream. He drinks and says, "This water is from the same fountain that
   I drank on earth. I drink the same bliss, but draw it nearer the
   fountain-head than I did before."

   But I think I see you who have been drinking out of the black, dark,
   filthy reservoirs of earth, and when you get into eternity, you say,
   "Where is the stream at which I once slaked my thirst?" You look and it
   is gone! Suppose you are a drunkard. Drunkenness was your happiness on
   earth. Will you be drunk in Hell? There it would afford you no
   gratification. Here the theater was your pastime--will you find a
   theater in Hell? The songs of foolish lasciviousness were here your
   delight--will you find such songs in eternity? Will you be able to sing
   them amidst unutterable burnings?

   Can you hum those lascivious notes when you are drinking the fearful
   gall of eternal woe? Oh, surely, no!

   The things in which you once trusted and found your peace and comfort
   will have gone forever! Oh, what is your happiness tonight, my Friends?
   Is it a happiness that will last? Is it a joy that will endure? Or are
   you holding in your hand an apple of Sodom and saying, "It is fair, it
   is passing fair," when you know that you only look on it now, but will
   have to eat it in eternity? See the man who has that apple in his
   hand--he puts it to his mouth--he has to masticate it in eternity. And
   it is ashes--ashes on his lips--ashes between his teeth--ashes in his
   jaws--ashes forever--ashes that shall go into his blood and make each
   vein a road for the hot feet of pain to travel! His heart is an abode
   of misery and his whole frame a den of loathsomeness!

   Ah, if you have not this Consolation of Israel, do you know what you
   must have? You must have eternal torment! I have often remarked that
   the most wicked men hold the doctrine that there is no torment for the
   body in Hell. Riding some time ago in a railway carriage with a man who
   seemed to have no idea of religion, he said, "I'm as cold as the
   devil," and repeated the observation several times. I said to him,
   "He's not at all cold, Sir." "I suppose you are a believer in Hell,
   then?" he replied. "Yes, I am," I said, "because I am a believer in the
   Bible." "I don't think there is any fire for the body, I don't. I think
   it is the conscience--remorse of conscience, dismay and despair and
   such like--I don't think it has anything to do with the body," he said.

   And strange enough, many other ungodly men with whom I have spoken on
   the subject all seem to be partial to the Hell that only deals with the
   conscience. The reason is this. They do not feel for their soul. They
   are natural men who have a natural care about their body, but they
   think that so long as their body gets off, they will not care for Hell
   at all. Hear this, then, you ungodly men and women! You care not for
   the torture of the soul. Hear this--and let there be no metaphor or
   figure! Hear it, for I speak God's plain language!

   For the body, too, there is a Hell. It is not merely your soul that is
   to be tortured. What do you care for conscience? What do you care for
   memory? What do you care for imagination? Hear this, then, Drunkard!
   Hear this, man of Pleasure! That body which you pamper shall lie in
   pain! It was not a figure which Christ used when He said, "In Hell he
   lifted up his eyes, being in torments and saw Abraham afar off, and
   Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy
   on me and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water
   and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame."

   It was a tongue, Sir! It was a flame, Sir. It was not a metaphorical
   tongue and it was not a metaphorical flame! It was not metaphorical
   water that he wanted. Real, positive, actual flames tormented the body
   of that rich Dives in Hell! Ah, wicked man, those very hands of yours
   that now grasp the wine cup shall grasp the cup of your damnation! The
   feet that carry you to the theater shall lie in brimstone forever! The
   eyes that look on the spectacles of lust--it is no figure, Sir-- those
   same eyes shall see murderous spectacles of misery! The same head which
   has oftentimes here throbbed with headache, shall there beat with pains
   you have not yet felt!

   Your heart, for which you care so little, shall become an emporium of
   miseries where demons shall empty the scalding boilers of woe. It is
   not fiction! Read the Bible and make a fiction of it if you can. There
   is a fire which knows no abatement, a worm which never dies, a flame
   unquenchable! As you go down those stairs, think there is a Hell. It is
   no fiction. Let the old doctrine stand out once more, that God has
   prepared Tophet of old. The pile thereof is wood and much smoke--the
   breath of the Lord, like a flame of fire, does kindle it.

   There is a Hell! O that you would flee from it! O that by Divine Grace
   you would escape it! Sodom was no figure--that was real hail of fire
   from Heaven. "Hurry," said the angel, "hurry!" and put his hand behind
   the timely-warned fugitive. Man! I am come as an angel from Heaven to
   you tonight and I would put my hand upon your shoulder and cry, "Hurry!
   Hurry! Look not behind you! Stay not in all the plain! Hurry to the
   mountain lest you be consumed!"

   If you know your need of a Savior, come and trust Him! If you feel your
   need of salvation, come and have it, for it is said, "Whoever will, let
   him come and take of the water of life freely." None are excluded but
   those who exclude themselves. None are taken in but those whom Divine
   Grace takes in through the sovereign mercy of our God. May God receive
   you in His arms! May sinners be delivered from the pit! May those find
   Him who never yet have sought the Consolation of Israel!

   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, I ask your prayers, that God may bless
   this sermon to the souls of men.

                          Light--Natural And Spiritual

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 12, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON AT
   CORNWALL ROAD CHAPEL, BAYSWATER.

   "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. And the earth
   was without form, and void. And darkness was upon the face of the deep.
   And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said,
   Let there be light and there was light And God saw the light, that it
   was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called
   the light Day and the darkness He called Night. And the evening and the
   morning were the first day."

   Genesis 1:1-5.

   THIS is, no doubt, a literal and accurate account of God's first day's
   work in the creation of the world, but the first creation is not the
   subject of this morning's discourse--we would rather direct your minds
   to the second creation of God. Every man who is saved by Divine Grace
   is a new creation. The great work which Jesus Christ is accomplishing
   in the world, by the Holy Spirit through the Word, is the making all
   things new. We believe the old creation to have been typical of the new
   and we shall so use it. May we all be taught of the Lord while so
   doing.

   Observe, dear Friends, the state of the world. It is said to have been
   "without form and void. And darkness was upon the face of the deep."
   Such is the state of every human heart till God the Holy Spirit visits
   it. So far as spiritual things are concerned, the human heart is in a
   state of chaos and disorder. There is no thought of faith, of love, of
   hope, of obedience--it is a spiritually confused mass of dead
   sinfulness in which everything is misplaced. It is void or utterly
   empty. Search the human heart through and it is true of it as Paul
   says, "In me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing."

   Over the whole, as in the old creation a thick darkness reigns,
   comparable to that of Egypt--a darkness that might be felt. This is
   true of all men--not of the ignorant in the lowest haunts of London,
   whose depraved parentage and education have prevented them from knowing
   Divine things--but this is true of those who are trained up under the
   sound of the Gospel and whose morals are good and exemplary. They are
   still darkness, naturally, until God the Holy Spirit comes to renew
   them.

   In the whole world, whether it is among kings, statesmen, or Divines,
   there is not one who has so much as a spark of spiritual light unless
   he has received it from above. And he can only have received it from
   above through Him who is "the true Light which lights every man which
   comes into the world," who is enlightened at all. Dark, dark, dark is
   the whole of humanity--it dwells in the black darkness of sin and must
   perish there unless the same Divine power which said, "Let there be
   light," of old, shall bestow spiritual light. You observe that the
   first Divine action in connection with the formation and shaping of the
   world, was this--"The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."

   The secret work of the Holy Spirit begins in the human heart--we cannot
   always say precisely when or how. "The wind blows where it wishes and
   you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell from where it comes and where
   it goes: so is everyone that is born of the Spirit." In the hearts of
   God's chosen ones this Spirit works mysteriously and silently, but most
   efficaciously. The expression translated, "moved upon," conveys in the
   original the idea of a bird brooding over its nest. The Holy Spirit
   mysteriously quickens the dead heart, excites emotions, longings,
   desires.

   It may be some of you are feeling His operations this morning. You have
   not yet received the Divine light, but there are workings of the Divine
   energy in your spirit. You are not easy in your present lost
   estate--you are discontented to be what you now are--you are desirous
   to enter into God's marvelous light. For this I thank God and take it
   as a hopeful symptom. And I pray that He may, this morning, if it is
   His gracious will, lead you farther and make you feel today that early
   operation of Divine Grace by which light is given to the darkened soul.

   I. In considering the text, we shall notice FIRST THE DIVINE FIAT. God
   said, "Let there be light," and there was light. The Lord Himself needs
   no light to enable Him to discern His creatures--

   "Darkness and light in this agree, Great God they're both alike to
   You."

   He looked upon the darkness and resolved that He would transform its
   shapeless chaos into a fair and lovely world. We shall observe that the
   work of Grace by which light enters the soul is a needed work. God's
   plan for the sustaining of vegetable and animal life rendered light
   necessary. Light is essential to life. There are few operations which
   can be carried on in the world without some degree of light and
   certainly no heart can be saved without spiritual light.

   It is light, my Brethren, which first shows us our lost estate--for we
   know nothing of it naturally. We think that we are righteous, that all
   is well with our souls. But when the Divine light comes in, we discover
   that we are fallen in Adam and are terribly undone! Naturally we think
   that we are no worse than others, that if we have offended, our
   offenses are very venial and almost deserve to be pardoned. But when
   light enters, the exceeding sinfulness of sin is discovered. This
   causes pain and anguish of heart--but that pain and anguish are
   necessary in order to bring us to lay hold on Jesus Christ--whom the
   light next displays to us.

   No man ever knows Christ till the light of God shines on the Cross. You
   may look at a picture of the bleeding Jesus. You may read the story of
   His wounds, but you have not seen Christ--so as to be saved by His
   death--unless the light of His Spirit has revealed Him to you as the
   great Substitute for sinners, the Surety of the new Covenant, and
   suffering in your place. You know Him not unless the mysterious light
   has led you to read these words as your own, "He loved me and gave
   Himself for me."

   We can see neither our state, nor our sin, nor our Savior without
   light. You who worship God but are not converted, are like the men of
   Athens who worshipped an unknown God. You do not feel Him to be a real
   existence. You do not come near to Him. You have no true love to Him.
   You cannot cry, "Abba Father." You are not made partakers of the Divine
   nature. And you can never be brought near to God unless heavenly light
   shall manifest God to you as your God who in eternal purposes chose you
   to be His, and by the gift of His dear Son has bought you to be His
   forever.

   The great truths of Heaven, Hell, and immortality are not clearly
   perceived till the light shines on them. But you receive them as matter
   of settled doctrine because you have been taught them from your youth
   up--He who brings life and immortality to light is Christ Jesus and,
   without the light, life and immortality are mere names--not real things
   to you.

   Beloved, if we could save men by the application of drops of water, or
   by giving them bread and wine to eat and drink! If we were so besotted
   as to believe that souls could be affected by physical substances and
   that the hearts of men could be renewed by external observances, there
   would be no need of light! But ours is a religion which appeals to the
   understanding, which acts upon the will, which moves the heart--where
   little can be done with men while they are in spiritual darkness. They
   must have light, or else they cannot see. And if they cannot see, they
   cannot receive--for looking to Jesus is the Gospel mode of receiving.
   So, Beloved, the making of light was absolutely necessary in the world
   and the creation of God's light in the heart of man is a most necessary
   work.

   Next observe it was a very early work. Light was created on the first
   day, not on the third, fourth, or sixth, but on the first day. And one
   of the first operations of the Spirit of God in a man's heart is to
   give light enough to see his lost estate and to perceive that he cannot
   save himself from it but must look elsewhere. Come, dear Hearer, have
   you seen the Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ? Are you resting
   upon Him as all your salvation and all your desire? Have you light
   enough to look to Him and be saved, leaving all your former boasting,
   nailing them all to His Cross and taking Him to be your All in All?

   It is a very early work of Divine Grace, I say, to show you that you
   are a sinner and to reveal to you that you have a Savior! It is the
   first day's work and I have no right to believe myself to be a new
   creature in God at all unless I have received light enough to know
   those two great and weighty facts--myself lost in Adam but saved in the
   second Adam-- undone by sin but restored by the Savior's righteousness!
   It is well for us to remember that light-giving is a Divine work. God
   said, "Let there be light," and there was light.

   O Beloved, how often have I said it and there has been no light
   whatever! These eyes have often wept over benighted souls, but my
   glistening tears could not give them a ray of light! Have I not bowed
   my knee and prayed full many a time for the conversion of men and
   though prayer has power because it links man with God, yet in itself it
   has none, for our prayers for others can do nothing whatever for them
   till Jehovah Himself says, "Let there be light." Dear Hearer, the

   Lord must come into distinct and direct contact with your spirit or
   else your darkness will become the outer darkness of eternal ruin!

   Speak of what your free will can do--of what your creature ability can
   do--alas, these can do nothing whatever for you! They will plunge you
   deeper and deeper into the blackness of darkness forever. But into the
   light of God you never can come and never will come, unless that
   eternal voice shall say, "Let there be light." Let us always remember
   this in preaching the Gospel and never depend upon man, or upon the
   Word alone, but be this our prayer, "Oh God, do Your work, for You
   alone can do so effectually." This Divine work is worked by the Word.
   God did not sit in solemn silence and create the light--He spoke. He
   said, "Light be," and light was. So the way in which we receive light
   is by the Word of God.

   Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God. Christ Himself
   is the essential Word and the preaching of Christ Jesus is the
   operative Word. We receive Christ actually when God's power goes with
   God's Word--then we have light. Therefore the necessity of continually
   preaching the Word of God! If I preach my own word, no light will go
   with it. But when it is God's Word, then I may expect that light will
   follow. Oh, to preach Christ's Cross! My Brothers, choose no ministry
   but that which savors much of God's Word and especially of the Word
   Christ Jesus! Better to preach one sermon full of Christ, than a
   thousand in which He shall be left out.

   "I, if I am lifted up, will draw all men unto Me." The great magnet and
   loadstone of Gospel attraction is Christ Himself! And if we leave Him
   out, it is as though we should expect the world to receive light
   without the Almighty Word. While light was conferred in connection with
   the mysterious operation of the Holy Spirit, it was unaided by the
   darkness itself. How could darkness assist to make itself light? No,
   the darkness never did become light. It had to give place to light, but
   darkness could not help God.

   If your understanding could resolve darkness into its elements, can you
   see anything in it which can help to bring the day? If you can, I
   cannot. Look at your own fallen nature--is there anything there which
   could assist in the great work of salvation? If you think so, you know
   not yourself. The power which saves a sinner is not the power of man.
   The power of man must die, for its only use is to stand out as far as
   it is able against the power of God. The carnal mind is enmity against
   God and is not reconciled to God--neither, indeed, can it be. You
   cannot extract out of any amount of darkness a single beam of light.
   And you cannot extract out of any amount of flesh--purify it, educate
   it, direct it, guide it as you may--you cannot extract anything like
   spiritual light! That must come from above. "You must be born again."

   Do not think Christians are made by education--they are made by
   creation. You may wash a corpse as long as ever you please, but you
   cannot wash life into it. You may deck it in flowers and robe it in
   scarlet and fine linen, but you cannot make it live--the vital spark
   must come from above. Regeneration is not of the will of man, nor of
   blood, nor of the will of the flesh, but by the power and energy of the
   Spirit of God and the Spirit of God alone.

   As this light was unassisted by darkness, so was it also unsolicited.
   There came no voice out of that thick darkness, "Oh God, enlighten us!"
   There was no cry of prayer, no note of desire that God would send
   light--the desire and the thought began with Deity, not with the
   darkness. He said, "Let there be light," and there was light. The first
   work of Divine Grace in the heart does not begin with man's desire, but
   with God's implanting the desire. Dear Hearer, if you desire to be
   saved by Grace, God gave you that desire, for you could never get so
   far as that apart from Him! Your darkness can be darkness and that is
   all it can be! It cannot long for, or aspire after light. In fact, if
   your soul longs after light it has some light already--a sincere desire
   is a part of that Divine light and life and must have come from above!

   See, then, the ruin of nature and the freeness of Grace! Void and dark,
   a chaos given up to be covered with blackness and darkness forever and,
   while as yet it is not seeking God, the light arises, and the promise
   is fulfilled, "I am found of them that sought Me not: I said, behold
   Me! Behold Me, to a people that were not a people." While we were lying
   in our blood, filthily polluted, defiled, He passed by and He said in
   the sovereignty of His love, "Live," and we live! The whole must be
   traced to Sovereign Grace--from this sacred well of discriminating,
   distinguishing Grace we must draw water this morning and we must pour
   it out, saying, "Oh Lord, I will praise Your name, for the first origin
   of my light was Your sovereign purpose and nothing in me."

   Before we leave this point I must have you notice that this light came
   instantaneously. The Hebrew suggests this far better than our
   translation--it is sublimely brief. "Light be--light was." Here let us
   observe that the work of giving spiritual light is instantaneous. No
   matter through what process you may go which you may conclude afterward
   to have been preparatory to the light, and there is such a process, the
   Spirit of God brooded over the face of the waters before the light
   came, yet the absolute flash which brings salvation is instantaneous. A
   man is saved in a moment! From death to life is not the work of years,
   it is done at once. Saul of Tarsus rides to Damascus foaming at the
   mouth with threats against God's saints--Jesus Christ appears to him
   and Saul of Tarsus becomes Paul the humble follower of Jesus--in a
   moment!

   And all conversions, though they may seem to you gradual, must be like
   this, for Paul says, "To me, first, God showed forth all long-suffering
   for a pattern to them that believe," as if Paul's salvation was the
   pattern upon which all others are cut. There must be a time in which
   you were dead and then another instant in which you were alive. So with
   darkness--there must be a period in which you have no light, and
   another period in which you have some light and that transition must be
   an instantaneous one. O that the Lord would work a great work this
   morning--it is in His power, if He wills it, to turn every one of your
   hearts to Himself!

   Let Him but speak the word and say, "Light be!" and no matter how dark
   the sinner's mind, if the Divine fiat shall go forth, "Light be," that
   depraved, foolish, drunken sinner will, in a moment, feel his heart
   begin to melt! As it is instantaneous, so it is irresistible. Darkness
   must give place when God speaks! Some ascribe Omnipotence to the will
   of man and lift man up to a sort of rivalry with God! Beloved, man has
   power to resist the ordinary motions of the Spirit, but when the Holy
   Spirit comes to effectual work and puts forth His mighty power, who
   shall stay His hand, or say unto Him, "What are you doing?"

   "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have
   compassion on whom I will have compassion," is the Divine claim of old,
   and it is true of our God to this day. Oh, how glorious is God when we
   think of Him thus! I could not worship a little God--but when I think
   of my great God as looking down upon the blackness and darkness of
   human nature and saying, "Let there be light," and light comes at
   once--then I magnify God for His Grace and bless His name!

   II. The second point is DIVINE OBSERVATION. We read in the fourth
   verse, "And God saw the light." Does He not see everything? Yes,
   Beloved, He does, but this does not refer to the general perception of
   God of all His works, but is something special. "God saw the light"--He
   looked at it with complacency, gazed upon it with pleasure.

   I received, this morning, great satisfaction in turning over those few
   words in my own mind, "God saw the light." I thought to myself--"Ah,
   the Lord looks with special observation upon His own work of Grace in
   His people." If the Lord has given you light, dear Friend, no matter
   though you may only just now have received it, God looks on that light
   with an eye with which He does not view other things. He sees all other
   things in His Omniscience, but He sees this light in you as His
   offspring, as dear to Himself, as His own handiwork--He looks upon it
   with complacency--He sees it with tender observation.

   A father looks upon a crowd of boys in a school and sees them all, but
   there is one boy whom he sees very differently from all the rest! He
   watches him with care--it is his own child and his eyes are especially
   there. Brethren, though you have come here sighing and groaning because
   of inbred sin, the Lord sees what is good in you, for He has put it
   there! Satan can see the light and he tries to quench it--God sees it
   and preserves it. The world can see that light and hates it and would,
   if possible, extinguish it. But God sees it and He restrains the world
   that it cannot utterly take from you the vital spark. Sometimes you
   cannot see the light, and I do not suppose it is in the nature of light
   to perceive itself--but God saw the light and that is better.

   It is better that God should see Grace in me than that I should see
   Grace in myself. It is very comfortable for me to know that I am one of
   God's people--I cannot have much joy and peace in believing unless I
   have the gracious assurance of this fact. But still, that fact is not
   the foundation of my hope, for, whether I know it or not, if the Lord
   knows it, I am still safe. THIS is the foundation: "The Lord knows them
   that are His."

   You and I are apt to say of someone, "What a Christian he is." Very
   likely his religion is all external show and the Lord has no regard
   unto his offering any more than He had unto the offering of Cain. We
   look at that Pharisee, standing in the Temple, with his phylacteries
   and hear him saying, "God, I thank You that I am not as other men are,"
   and we envy him and think what a noble saint he is, but the Lord knows
   him and sees no light in him! But that poor humble publican who stands
   in the corner and dares not lift so much as his eyes unto Heaven cannot
   see any light in himself, but God sees the light in him and that man
   goes down to his house justified rather than the other.

   You may be, today, going down, down into the vaults of despondency and
   even despair--ah, but if your soul has any longing towards Christ, and
   if you are still seeking to rest in Him, God sees the light and He will
   take care to discern between you and the darkness and to preserve you
   even to the day of His Son's appearing! Beloved, it is most pleasant to
   the Believer to know that God's eyes are never taken off from that work
   of Grace which He has begun. Here is a promise! "I, the Lord do keep
   it: I will water it every moment lest any hurt it: I will keep it night
   and day." Now this is--I must say again--this is a precious thought to
   those of you who have watched and guarded yourselves and felt your own
   powerlessness to do so and who are ready to give it up because you have
   thought, "Well, I cannot watch always and I fear I shall become a prey
   to temptation."

   The Lord watches you and HE sees the light. He has His eyes always
   fixed upon the work of Grace that is in your soul. It is observable
   that in the New Testament we find the Apostles mentioning the virtues
   of the saints, but very seldom that they say anything about their
   faults. Take, for instance, Abraham. His faith is extolled, but nothing
   is said about his equivocation. In the case of Rahab, her faith is
   magnified, but nothing is said about her lying. Why is that? Is it not
   because God saw the light and when He was writing this Book of the new
   creation, He said nothing of the darkness? He saw His own work and
   would not regard the devil's work and the work of fallen human nature,
   too--He had respect only to the light.

   III. We pass on to the third point and that is, DIVINE APPROBATION.
   "God saw the light, that it was good."

   Light is good in all respects. The natural light is good. Solomon says,
   "It is a pleasant thing to behold the sun." But you did not need
   Solomon to inform you upon that point. Any blind man who will tell you
   the tale of his sorrows will be quite philosopher enough to convince
   you that light is good. Gospel light is good. "Blessed are the eyes
   which see the things which you see."

   You only need to travel into heathen lands and witness the superstition
   and cruelty of the dark places of the earth to understand that Gospel
   light is good. As for spiritual light, those that have received it long
   for more of it that they may see yet more and more the Glory of
   Heaven's essential light! O God, You are of good the unmeasured Sea!
   You are of light both soul and source and center. Whether, then, we
   take natural light, Gospel light, spiritual light, or essential light,
   we may say of it, as God did, that it was good.

   But we are speaking now of spiritual light. Why is that good? Well, it
   must be so, from its Source. The light emanates from God, in whom is no
   darkness at all, and, as it comes absolutely and directly from Him, it
   must be good. As every good gift and every perfect gift is from above,
   so everything which comes from above is good and perfect. The Lord
   distributes no alloyed metal--He never gives His people that which is
   mixed and debased. Your Words, O God, are pure as silver tried in the
   furnace of earth, purified seven times! The light of the new nature is
   good when we consider its origin. It is good, again, when we consider
   its likeness.

   Light is liken to God. It is a thing so spiritual, so utterly to be
   ungrasped by the hand of flesh, that it has often been selected as the
   very type of God. Certainly the new nature in man is liken to God. It
   is, in fact, the Nature of God implanted in us! The Holy Spirit dwells
   in us and is the radix--the root of the new nature by which we become
   akin with the Most High. The Spirit of adoption by which we cry, "Abba,
   Father," is the Holy Spirit Himself working in us to will and to do of
   His own good pleasure.

   Ignatius used to call himself, Theophorus, or the God-Bearer. The title
   might seem eccentric, but the fact is true of all the saints--they bear
   God about with them. God dwells in His saints as in a temple. It is
   good, also in its effect. It is good for a man to know his danger--it
   makes him retreat from it. It is good for him to know the evil of his
   sin--it makes him avoid it and repent of it. It is good for him to know
   a Savior's love--it leads him to trust the Savior and brings him to
   pardon, to justification, and to eternal life. It is good to have the
   light which reveals the God of Love, for without Him we are aliens,
   orphans, houseless wanderers. It is good to have the light to see the
   world to come, that we may escape its agonies, that we may seek after
   its glories. It is good to have light in all respects, for otherwise,
   like blind men, we should wretchedly and miserably wander in a
   labyrinth and miss our way to glory and to God.

   Light is good in its effects. It is good, moreover, because it
   glorifies God. Where would God's Glory be in the outward universe
   without light? Could we gaze upon the landscape? Could we stand upon
   the hilltop and drink in the view and then praise the glorious Maker
   who had made these marvelous works if there were no light? I question
   whether those first-born sons of light, the angels, would have a song
   to sing before the Eternal Throne, if light were taken away. Certainly,
   Beloved, spiritual light brings glory to God! It prostrates us in the
   dust, but it lifts HIM up. Spiritual light shows us our emptiness, our
   poverty, our wretchedness--but it reveals in blessed contrast His
   fullness, His riches, His freeness of Grace.

   The more light in the soul, the more gratitude to God. The more we know
   of Christ and the Covenant of Grace and of God Himself, the louder and
   sweeter is that song which our glad hearts send up to the Eternal
   Throne. Let me say of the work of God in the soul as compared to light,
   that it is good in the widest possible sense. The new nature which God
   puts in us never sins--it cannot sin, because it is born of God.
   "What?" you say, "Does a Christian never sin?" Not with the new nature.
   The new nature never sins--the old nature sins. It is the darkness
   which is dark--the light is not darkness. The light is always light. It
   is not possible that the Christ who dwells in us could sin.

   I again repeat the words, "He cannot sin, because he is born of God."
   He keeps himself so that the Evil One touches him not. What sin there
   is in the Believer comes from the remnants of corruption. The spirit
   which is implanted never can sin, never can have communion with sin,
   any more than light can have communion with darkness. It is good--so
   good that it is the very same life which shall enter Heaven. You must
   not suppose that a Believer will have a new life granted to him when he
   gets to Heaven. Beloved, he will never die! The flesh dies, but the new
   Nature which God gives to us is as immortal as God Himself--it can
   neither be quenched here by temptation, nor there by the act of death.
   The love which is in Christ Jesus our Lord is everlasting, ever living.
   And though corruption and worms destroy this body, yet the new born
   spirit, like the light, will never see corruption.

   Jesus Christ has Himself said, "He that lives and believes in Me shall
   never die." The new Nature shall never die. Its light shall develop
   itself from dawning twilight into the splendor of noonday and shall
   abide everlastingly in fullness of glory, according to the promise,
   "Your sun shall no more go down, neither shall your moon withdraw
   itself: for the Lord shall be your everlasting light, and the days of
   your mourning shall be ended."

   IV. Now I must, by your patience, take you to the next point, which is,
   DIVINE SEPARATION. It appears that though God made light there was
   still darkness in the world. Read the fourth verse, "And God divided
   the light from the darkness." Beloved, the moment you become a
   Christian, you will begin to fight. You will be easy and comfortable
   enough, as long as you are a sinner, but as soon as you become a
   Christian, you will have no more rest. John Bunyan was no great poet,
   but sometimes he struck out great truths in his rhymes. He has this
   one--

   "A Christian man is seldom long at ease When one trouble's gone,
   another does him seize."

   This is very true, because a Believer is a double man. There are two
   principles in him. At first there was but one principle, which was
   darkness. Now light has entered and the two principles disagree. So
   observe this separation. One part of the Divine work in the soul of man
   is to make a separation in the man himself. I will put this plainly and
   it shall be a test between a child of God and the child of darkness
   this morning. Do you feel an inward contention and war going on? Can
   you read these verses and understand them--they are very strange
   verses--they are taken out of the same Psalm and follow each other. "So
   foolish was I and ignorant, I was as a beast before You. Nevertheless,
   I am continually with You. You hold me by my right hand."

   There are hundreds of people who, if you were to preach from that text
   would say, "Why the man contradicts himself. He makes himself out to be
   a beast and yet he says he dwells near to God!" Ah, none but the
   Believer knows that secret. You remember the Apostle Paul's own words
   in the seventh chapter of Romans. Many stupid people who are ignorant
   of the inner life make it out that Paul could not have been a Christian
   at all when he wrote those words, but he was an advanced Believer--and
   only advanced Believers can sympathize with him. "For that which I do I
   allow not: for what I would, that do I not. But what I hate, that do I.
   If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is
   good. Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.

   "For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh), dwells no good thing:
   for to will is present with me. But how to perform that which is good I
   find not. For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I
   would not, that I do. Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I
   that do it, but sin that dwells in me. I find then a law, that, when I
   would do good, evil is present with me. For I delight in the Law of God
   after the inward man: but I see another law in my members, warring
   against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of
   sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver
   me from the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our
   Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the Law of God; but with the
   flesh the law of sin. There is therefore now no condemnation to them
   which are in Christ Jesus."

   Permit me to put these two verses together--"O wretched man that I am,
   who shall deliver me from the body of this death? There is therefore
   now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not
   after the flesh, but after the

   Spirit." How can these two things be consistent? Ask the spiritual
   man--he will tell you! "The Lord divides between light and darkness."
   Darkness, by itself, will go on comfortably enough--but when the Lord
   sends in light, there will be a conflict--a terrible conflict, too! And
   you will find your own self divided into camps--you will find both Cain
   and Abel in your heart, Egyptians and Israelites in your soul--and if
   there is a David in your heart, there will be a Saul, too.

   Whereas there is a division inside the Christian, there is certain to
   be a division outside. So soon as ever the Lord gives to any Believer
   light, he begins to separate himself from the darkness. The world's
   religion used to satisfy him. If there was a pretty building and a good
   looking minister who could put his words together well and garnish the
   altar finely, the child of darkness did not care what he heard--whether
   the Gospel was preached or not. But as soon as ever he receives light,
   he cries, "All this is nothing to me, millinery, or anything else! I
   want light and the Truth of God and I cannot go to hear anything but
   the Gospel."

   He separates himself from the world's religion, finds out where Christ
   is preached and goes there. Then as to society, the dead, carnal
   religionist can get on very well in ordinary society, but it is not so
   when he has light. I cannot go to light company, wasting the evening,
   showing off my fine clothes and talking frivolity and nonsense. Where
   are the children of light? Very likely down in some Ragged School where
   poor men and women seek to bless the little ones. That is the place for
   the child of light. It does not matter what particular class of society
   the saints belong to, we shall seek their society. We know we have
   passed from death unto life, because we love the Brethren! The light
   gathers to itself and the darkness to itself.

   My dear Brethren, what God has divided, let us never unite. God has set
   an everlasting distance between the sheep and the goats--let us do the
   same. Christ went outside the camp, bearing His reproach--let us,
   therefore, come out from among them and be separate. Christ was holy,
   harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners--let us be nonconformists to
   the world. Let us dissent from all sin and be distinguished from the
   world, even as Jesus Christ was not of the world. This is a work of
   Grace, then, to make a wondrous separation.

   V. Next notice DIVINE NOMINATION. Things must have names. Adam named
   the beasts, but God Himself named the day and the night. Search the
   fifth verse, "And God called the light Day and the darkness called He
   Night." It is a very blessed work of Grace to teach us to call things
   by their right names. Why did He call the light, Day, and the darkness,
   Night, except for this reason--He seems to say, "Let these things be
   distinguished, let light wear its name of Day and darkness its title of
   Night." From which I gather that the good which God works in His people
   must be good always and can never be described as bad.

   The spiritual aspirations of God's people never can be evil. Carnal
   reason calls them folly, but the Lord would have us call them good.
   Here is a man who is panting after Graces which will cost him great
   sacrifices! He is panting after a spirituality which will separate him
   from men! It cannot be evil for him to seek the highest possible degree
   of Divine Grace. On the other hand, that which is darkness cannot be
   light and must not be called anything but Night. We have heard of some
   who have taken the sins of God's people and said, "These are not sins
   in these people." This is a grievous error, for darkness is darkness
   and must be called Night wherever it may be. If I find sin in my father
   or mother, dearly as I love them and desire to have them perfect, yet I
   must not make excuse for it and seek to call darkness Day. I must not
   in myself, when I discern imperfection, find a soft name for it by
   which I may take away its wickedness. I must call it what it is.

   I remember hearing of a good man--I believe he was such--who fell into
   drunkenness on one occasion. He was excommunicated from Church
   fellowship and properly so. But afterwards he became very penitent and
   he went about the streets like a man who really should die of grief and
   ashamed because of his sin. He could not find peace. A dear Brother,
   who knew something of him, took him aside one day and said, "Dear
   Brother, have you made a full confession of your sin before God?" He
   thought he had. "Now," said the other, "it is a hard thing for me to
   ask, but I should like to hear you confess this sin." So he did.

   When he came to the act of confessing his sin to God, he said, "Lord,
   You know I have indulged my appetites," and so on. He was not a bit
   better. "Now," said his friend, " My dear Brother, you had better
   unveil your whole sin and hide nothing. Then he prayed thus--"Lord, You
   know I got drunk." It was all right as soon as he brought the thing out
   and called the darkness Night and went no longer round about. The Lord
   will not hear His people if they call the darkness Day. He will not
   attend to them. He will have them call darkness Night. So, let us go
   where we may, whether in ourselves or in other people, we must learn to
   call a spade a spade, to call things by their right names!

   There is a great deal, remember, in the names which we give to things,
   because they are generally the index of our own estimation of what
   those things are. It is a work of Grace to teach us always to call the
   light Day and the darkness Night. "But," says one, "can't the right
   sometimes be wrong?" Never, never! I am asked by a man this question:
   "There is such and such a church. I am a minister there and there are
   some things I don't agree with and yet I swear I do. I swear that, ex
   animo, I agree, although I do not. If I did not swear, I should lose my
   sphere of usefulness. If I don't swear it, I shall never have an
   opportunity of doing good."

   My dear Friend, you have nothing to do with that! Whether you are doing
   good or mischief, your business is to call darkness Night, and light
   Day. Never do a bad thing, though you might hope to achieve a world of
   good by it. Right is never wrong and wrong is never right. It cannot be
   right for a man to do evil that good may come. Of those that hold such
   maxims it is written, "Their damnation is just." Let the light be
   called Day and the darkness Night.

   Observe again--this is somewhat remarkable--that we read in the next
   sentence, "And the evening and the morning were the first day." Who
   called it so? I do not find that God did, yet it is in the Book of God
   and therefore I cannot take exception to it. How is it? The evening!
   Why the evening was darkness and the morning was light. The two
   together are called by the same name that is given to the light alone!
   What then? Why Beloved, in every Believer there is darkness and there
   is light, and yet he is not to be named a sinner because there is sin
   in him, but he is to be named from the major part of him--he is to be
   named from the grander quality! He is to be named a saint because there
   is saintness in him notwithstanding all the sin.

   Now this will be a comforting thought to those of you who are mourning
   your infirmities. While I was talking about light, you said, "Yes,
   thank God I have some. I know the difference between it and darkness,
   yet for all that, darkness is my daily pest and trouble. Can I be a
   child of God while there is any darkness in me?" Dear Brothers and
   Sisters, you, like the day, take not your name from the evening, but
   from the morning! From the day you shall be called altogether, as if
   you were now perfectly what you will be soon. You shall be called the
   Child of the Light, though there is darkness in you still! You are
   named after what is the predominating quality in the sight of God which
   will one day be the only principle remaining.

   Observe that the evening is put first. We naturally have darkness first
   and it is often first in our mournful apprehension, as we have to come
   to God with, "God be merciful to me, a sinner." The place of the
   morning is second, for it only dawns because of Divine Grace. But, O
   Beloved, it is a blessed aphorism of John Bunyan that that which is
   last, lasts forever. That which is first has to give up its turn to the
   last--but nothing comes after the last. So that, though I am darkness,
   when once I am light in the Lord, there is no evening to follow--your
   sun shall no more go down. The first day in this life is an evening and
   a morning--but the second day, when we shall be with God forever--shall
   be a day with no evening, but one, sacred, high, eternal noon!

   I have thus opened up a few experimental secrets. Some of you can say,
   "I understand it, for I feel it all in my life! I trust I am a new
   creature." Dear Friends, let me congratulate you! Let me say to you,
   "Walk in the light. Live as children of the light. Be ever with your
   faces towards the sun--seek Christ--long to be made like He and never
   be content till, like the angel whom Milton speaks of, who dwells in
   the sun, you come to dwell in God, and lose yourself most blessedly by
   being swallowed up and filled with all the fullness of His Glory.

   As for others here present, and I fear there are some such who have
   said, "This is all strange to me." Dear Friend, I pray God it may not
   be long strange to you, for if you are a stranger to a new creation,
   you are a stranger to the only hope of happiness. "You must be born
   again," is the old sentence which Divine Revelation has spoken--"you
   must." It is not, "You may be"--it is, "You must." It is not, "Some
   ofyou may do without it--you are so good you do not need it."

   NO, "You must, you MUST be born again." He that sits on the Throne
   says, "Behold I make all things new." Has He made you new? The gates of
   Heaven are shut against the old creation--the floods destroyed it at
   the first--the floods of fire shall destroy it again. If you are not
   newly created you shall not outlive the general blaze. The first
   creation must be swept away. And you, if you are not newly created,
   must be swallowed up in everlasting misery! But if God has made you a
   new creature, that new creation is not to be touched by fire, nor
   flood, nor death, nor grave! You, as a part of that new creation, shall
   sing in the New Jerusalem which shall come down from Heaven as a bride
   adorned for her husband! You shall tread her golden streets, delight in
   her jasper radiance, and sing with the mighty hosts in that day when
   they shall sing a new song unto the Lord who has created all things
   new!

   The Lord grant we may be all present in the New Jerusalem which is from
   above, which is the mother of all the saints and unto God be praise,
   world without end. Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--John 1,3:18. And 1
   Thessalonians 5.
     __________________________________________________________________

                           The Great Arbitration Case

   A SERMON PREACHED BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE,
   NEWINGTON.

   "Neither is there any mediator between us, that might lay his hand upon
   us both."

   Job 9:33.

   THE Patriarch Job, when reasoning with the Lord concerning his great
   affliction, felt himself to be at a disadvantage and declined the
   controversy, saying, "He is not a man, as I am, that I should answer
   Him and we should come together in judgment." Yet feeling that his
   friends were cruelly misstating his case, he still desired to spread it
   before the Lord, but wished for a mediator, a middleman, to act as
   umpire and decide the case. In his mournful plight he sighed for an
   arbitrator who, while dealing justly for God, would, at the same time,
   deal kindly with poor flesh and blood, being able to lay his hand upon
   both. And, dear Friends, what Job desired to have the Lord has provided
   for us in the Person of His own dear Son, Jesus Christ! We cannot say
   with Job that there is no mediator who can lay his hand upon both of us
   because there is now, "one Mediator between God and man, the Man Christ
   Jesus." In Him let us rejoice, if indeed we have an interest in Him!
   And if we have not yet received Him, may almighty Grace bring us, even
   now, to accept Him as our Advocate and Friend.

   There is an old quarrel between the thrice holy God and His sinful
   subjects, the sons of Adam. Man has sinned--he has broken God's Law in
   every part of it and has wantonly cast off from him the allegiance
   which was due to his Maker and his King. There is a suit against man
   which was formally instituted at Sinai and must be pleaded in the Court
   of King's Bench before the Judge of the quick and the dead. God is the
   great Plaintiff against His sinful creatures who are the defendants. If
   that suit is carried into court, it must go against the sinner. There
   is no hope whatever that at the last tremendous day any sinner will be
   able to stand in judgment if he shall leave the matter of his debts and
   obligations towards his God unsettled until that dreadful hour.

   Sinner, it would be well for you to "agree with your adversary quickly,
   while you are in the way," for if you are once delivered up to the
   great Judge of all the earth there is not the slightest hope that your
   suit can be decided otherwise than to your eternal ruin! "Weeping and
   wailing and gnashing of teeth," will be the doom adjudged you forever,
   if your case as before the living God shall ever come to be tried at
   the fiery Throne of absolute Justice. But the infinite Grace of God
   proposes an arbitration--and I trust there are many here who are not
   anxious to have their suit carried into court--but are willing that the
   appointed Mediator should stand between them and God and lay His hand
   upon both and propose and carry out a plan of reconciliation! There is
   hope for you, bankrupt Sinner, that you may yet be at peace with God!
   There is a way by which your debts may yet be paid! That way is a
   blessed arbitration in which Jesus Christ shall stand as the Mediator!

   Let me begin by describing the essentials of an arbitrator, or
   mediator. Then let me take you into the Arbitrator's court and show you
   His proceedings. And then for a little while, if there is enough time,
   let us dwell upon the happy success of our great Daysman.

   I. First ofall, let me describe what are THE ESSENTIALS OF AN UMPIRE,
   AN ARBITRATOR, OR A DAYSMAN. The first essential is that both parties
   should be agreed to accept him. Let me come to you, you Sinner against
   whom God has laid His suit, and put the matter to you. God has accepted
   Christ Jesus to be His Umpire in His dispute. He appointed Him to the
   office and chose Him for it before He laid the foundations of the
   world. He is God's Fellow, equal with the Most High and can put His
   hand upon the Eternal Father without fear, because He is dearly beloved
   of the Father's heart. He is "very God of very God," and is in no
   respect inferior to "God over all, blessed forever."

   But He is also a man like yourself, Sinner. He once suffered, hungered,
   thirsted and knew the meaning of poverty and pain. No, He went
   farther--He was tempted as you have been--and farther still, He
   suffered the pangs of death as you, poor mortal man, will one day have
   to do! Now, what do you think? God has accepted Him--can you agree with
   God in this matter and agree to take Christ to be your Mediator, too?
   Does foolish enmity possess you, or does Grace reign and lead you to
   accept Emmanuel, "God With Us," as Umpire in this great dispute?

   Let me say to you that you will never find another so near akin to you,
   so tender, so sympathetic, and with such a heart of compassion towards
   you! Love streamed from His eyes in life and poured from His wounds in
   death. He is "the express Image" of Jehovah's Person and you know that
   Jehovah's name is "Love." "God is Love," and Christ is Love. Sinner,
   has Divine Grace brought you to your senses? Will you accept Christ?
   Are you willing that He should take this case into His hands and
   arbitrate between you and God? If God accepts Him, and you accept Him,
   too, then He has one of the first qualifications for being a mediator.

   But, in the next place, both parties must be fully agreed to leave the
   case entirely in the arbitrator's hands. If the arbitrator does not
   possess the power of settling the case, then pleading before him is
   only making an opportunity for wrangling--without any chance of coming
   to a peaceful settlement. Now God has committed "all power" into the
   hands of His Son. Jesus Christ is the Ambassador of God and has been
   invested with full ambassadorial powers. He comes commissioned by His
   Father and can say in all that He does towards sinners that His
   Father's heart is with Him. If the case is settled by Him, the Father
   is agreed.

   Now, Sinner, does Grace move your heart to do the same? Will you agree
   to put your case into the hands of Jesus Christ, the Son of God and the
   Son of Man? Will you abide by His decision? Will you have it settled
   according to His judgment, and shall the verdict which He gives stand
   absolute and fast with you? If so, then Christ has another essential of
   an arbitrator. But if not, remember, though He may make peace for
   others, He will never make peace for you! Understand this--that until
   the Grace of God has made you willing to trust the case in Jesus'
   hands, there can be no peace for you and you are willfully remaining
   God's enemy by refusing to accept His dear Son.

   Further, let us say that to make a good arbitrator or umpire, it is
   essential that he be an apt person. If the case were between a king and
   a beggar, it would not seem exactly right that another king should be
   the arbitrator, nor another beggar. But if there could be found a
   person who combined the two--who was both prince and beggar--then such
   a man could be selected by both! Our Lord Jesus Christ precisely meets
   the case! There is a very great disparity between the Plaintiff and the
   defendant, for how great is the gulf which exists between the eternal
   God and poor fallen man? How is this to be bridged? Why by none except
   by One who is God and who at the same time can become man!

   Now the only Being who can do this is Jesus Christ. He can put His hand
   on you, stooping down to all your infirmity and your sorrow--and He can
   put His other hand upon the Eternal Majesty--and claim to be co-equal
   with God and co-eternal with the Father! Do you not see, then, His
   fitness? Surely it were the path of wisdom, Sinner, to accept Him at
   once as the Arbitrator in the case! See how well He understands it! I
   should not do to be an arbitrator in legal cases because, though I
   should be anxious to do justice, yet I should know nothing of the law
   of the case. But Christ knows your case and the law concerning it
   because He has lived among men and has passed through and suffered the
   penalties of Justice. There cannot surely be a better skilled or more
   judicious Mediator than our blessed Redeemer!

   Yet there is one more essential of an umpire, and that is that he
   should be a person desirous to bring the case to a happy settlement. If
   you appoint a quarrelsome arbitrator he may delight to "set dogs by the
   ears." But if you elect one who is anxious for the good of both and
   wishes to make both friends, then he is just the very man, though, to
   be sure, he would be one man in a thousand--very precious when
   found--but very hard to discover. Oh that all lawsuits could be decided
   by such men!

   In the great case which is pending between God and the sinner, the Lord
   Jesus Christ has a sincere anxiety both for His Father's Glory and for
   the sinner's welfare--that there should be peace between the two
   contending parties. It is the life and aim of Jesus Christ to make
   peace. He delights not in the death of sinners and He knows no joy
   greater than that of receiving prodigals to His bosom and of bringing
   lost sheep back again to the fold. You cannot tell how high the
   Savior's bosom swells with an intense desire to make to Himself a great
   name as a peacemaker. Never had warrior such ambition to make war and
   to win victories as Christ has to end war and to win the bloodless
   triumphs of peace! From the heights of Heaven He came leaping like a
   young roe down to the plains of earth. From earth He leaped into the
   depths of the grave. Then up again at a bound He sprang to earth and up
   again to Heaven.

   And still He rests not, but presses on in His mighty work to ingather
   sinners and to reconcile them unto God-- making Himself a propitiation
   for their sins. You see, then, Sinner, how the case is. God has
   evidently chosen the most fitting Arbitrator. That Arbitrator is
   willing to undertake the case and you may well repose all confidence in
   Him. But if you shall live and die without accepting Him as your
   Arbitrator, and the case goes against you--you will have none to blame
   but yourself. When the everlasting damages shall be assessed against
   you in your soul and body forever, you shall have to curse only your
   own folly for having been the cause of your ruin!

   May I ask you to speak candidly? Has the Holy Spirit so turned the
   natural bent and current of your will that you have chosen Him because
   He has first chosen you? Do you feel that Christ, this day, is standing
   before God for you? He is God's Anointed--is He your elected? God's
   choice pitches upon Him--does your choice agree? Remember, where there
   is no will towards Christ, Christ as yet exercises no saving power.
   Christ saves no sinner who lives and dies unwilling. He makes unwilling
   sinners willing before He speaks a word of comfort to them. It is the
   mark of our election, as His people, that we are made willing in the
   day of God's power. Lay your hope where God has laid your help, namely,
   on Christ, mighty to save! You cannot have an Arbitrator except both
   sides are agreed. Do you say, "Yes, yes, with all my soul I choose
   Him"? Then let us proceed.

   II. And now I shall need, by your leave, to TAKE YOU INTO THE COURT
   WHERE THE TRIAL IS GOING ON

   AND SHOW YOU THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE GREAT DAYSMAN. "The Man,
   Christ Jesus," who is "God over all, blessed forever," opens His court
   by laying down the principles upon which He intends to deliver judgment
   and those principles I will now try to explain and expound.

   They are two-fold. First, strict justice. And secondly, fervent love.
   The Arbitrator has determined that, let the case go as it may, there
   shall be full justice done, justice to the very extreme--whether it is
   for or against the defendant. He intends to take the Law in its
   sternest and severest aspect and to judge according to its strictest
   letter. He will not be guilty of partiality on either side. If the Law
   says that the sinner shall die, the Arbitrator declares that He will
   judge that the sinner shall die. And if, on the other hand, the
   defendant can plead and prove that he is innocent, He intends to
   adjudge to him the award of innocence, namely ETERNAL LIFE. If the
   sinner can prove that he has fairly won it, he shall have his due.
   Either way, whether it is in favor of the Plaintiff or of the
   defendant, the condition of judgment is to be strict justice.

   But the Arbitrator also says that He will judge according to the second
   rule, that of fervent love. He loves His Father and therefore He will
   decide on nothing that may taint His honor or disgrace His crown. He so
   loves God, the Eternal One, that He will suffer Heaven and earth to
   pass away sooner than there shall be one blot upon the Character of the
   Most High. On the other hand, He so loves the poor defendant, man, that
   He will be willing to do anything rather than inflict penalty upon him
   unless Justice shall absolutely require it. He loves man with so great
   a love that nothing will delight Him more than to decide in his favor
   and He will be but too glad if He can be the means happily establishing
   peace between the Plaintiff and the defendant.

   How these principles are to meet will be seen by and by. At present He
   lays them down very positively. "He that rules among men must be just."
   An Arbitrator must be just or else He is not fit to hold the scales in
   any suit. On the other hand, He must be tender, for His name, as God,
   is Love. And His nature as Man is gentleness and mercy. Both parties
   should distinctly consent to these principles. How can they do
   otherwise? Do they not commend themselves to all of you? Let Justice
   and Love unite if they can.

   Having thus laid down the principles of judgment, the Arbitrator next
   calls upon the Plaintiff to state His case. Let us listen while the
   great Creator speaks--may God give me Grace to reverently state it in
   His name--as one poor sinner stating God's case against us all. "Hear,
   O heavens and give ear, O earth--for the Lord has spoken--I have
   nourished and brought up children and they have rebelled against Me.
   The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib--but Israel does
   not know, My people do not consider. Ah, sinful nation, a people filled
   with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters--they
   have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto
   anger, they are gone away backward."

   The Eternal God charges us, and let me confess at once, most justly and
   most truly charges us, with having broken all His Commandments--some of
   them in act, some of them in word--all of them in heart and thought and
   imagination! He says that we, against light and knowledge, have chosen
   the evil and forsaken the good! He charges that knowing what we were
   doing, we have turned aside from His most righteous Law and have gone
   astray like lost sheep, following the imaginations and devices of our
   own hearts. The great Plaintiff claims that inasmuch as we are His
   creatures we ought to have obeyed Him! That inasmuch as we owe our very
   lives to His daily care we ought to have rendered Him service instead
   of disobedience, and to have been His loyal subjects instead of turning
   traitors to His Throne.

   All this, calmly and dispassionately, according to the great Book of
   the Law, is laid to our charge before the Daysman. No exaggeration of
   sin is brought against us. It is simply declared of us that the whole
   head is sick and the whole heart is faint--that there is none that does
   good, no, not one--that we have all gone out of the way and altogether
   become unprofitable. This is God's case. He says, "I made this man.
   Curiously was he worked in the lowest parts of the earth. And all his
   members bear traces of My singular handiwork. I made him for My honor
   and he has not honored Me. I created him for My service and he has not
   served Me.

   "Twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years I have kept the breath in his
   nostrils. The bread he has eaten has been the daily portion of My
   bounty. His garments are the livery of My charity. And all this while
   he has neither thought of Me, his Creator and Preserver, nor done
   anything in My service. He has served his family, his wife and
   children, but his Maker he has despised. He has served his country, his
   neighbors, the borough in which he dwells--but I, who made him--I have
   had nothing from him. He has been an unprofitable servant unto Me."

   I think I may put the Plaintiff's case into your hands. Which of you
   would keep a horse if that horse should yield you no obedience? What
   excuse is it that though I might not use him he would carry another?
   No, the case is worse than this. Not only has man done nothing, but
   worse than nothing. Which of you would keep a dog, which, instead of
   fawning upon you, would bark at you--fly at you and tear you apart in
   his rage? Some of us have done this to God! We have perhaps cursed Him
   to His face. We have broken His Sabbaths, laughed at His Gospel and
   persecuted His saints. You would have said of such a dog, "Let it die!
   Why should I harbor in my house a dog that treats me thus?"

   Yet, hear, O heavens! And give ear, O earth! God has borne with your
   ill manners and He still cries, "mercy!" He puts the lifted thunder
   back into the arsenal of His dread artillery. I wish I could state the
   case as I ought. My lips are but clay. And these words should be like
   fire in the sinner's soul. When I meditated upon this subject alone I
   felt much sympathy with God, that He should have been so ill treated.
   And whereas some men speak of the flames of Hell as too great a
   punishment for sin, it seems ten thousand marvels that we should not
   have been thrust down there long ago!

   The Plaintiff's case having thus been stated, the defendant is called
   upon by the Daysman for his. And I think I hear him as he begins. First
   of all the trembling defendant sinner pleads--"I confess to the
   indictment, but I say I could not help it! I have sinned, it is true,
   but my nature was such that I could not well do otherwise! I must lay
   all the blame of it to my own heart--my heart was deceitful and my
   nature was evil." The Daysman at once rules that this is no excuse
   whatever, but an aggravation, for inasmuch as it is conceded that the
   man's heart, itself, is enmity against God, this is an admission of yet
   greater malice and blacker rebellion!

   It was only alleged against the offender in the first place that he had
   outwardly offended--but he acknowledges that he does it inwardly and
   confesses that his very heart is traitorous against God--fully set upon
   working the King's damage and dishonor! It is determined, therefore, by
   the Daysman that this excuse will not stand and He gives a case in
   point--a thief is brought up for stealing and he pleads that his heart
   was thievish, that he felt a constant inclination to steal and that
   therefore he could not help running off with any goods within his
   reach! The judge very properly answers, "Then I shall give you twice as
   much penalty as any other man who only fell into the fault by
   surprise--for according to your own confession, you are a thief through
   and through--what you have said is not an excuse, but an aggravation."

   Then the defendant pleads in the next place that albeit he acknowledges
   the facts alleged against him, yet he is no worse than other offenders
   and that there are many in the world who have sinned more grievously
   than he has done. He says he has been envious and angry and worldly and
   covetous, and has forgotten God--but then he never was an adulterer, or
   a thief, or a drunkard, or a blasphemer--and he pleads that his lesser
   crimes may well be winked at! But the great Daysman at once turns to
   the Statute Book and says that as He is about to give His decision by
   Law, that plea is not at all tenable, for the Law Book has it--"Cursed
   is every man that continues not in all things that are written in the
   Book of the Law to do them."

   The offense of one sinner does not excuse the offense of another. And
   the Arbitrator declares that He cannot mix up other cases with the case
   now in hand--that the present offender has, on his own confession,
   broken the Law--and that as the Law Book stands, that is the only
   question to be decided, for "the soul that sins, it shall die," and if
   the defendant has no better plea to offer, judgment must go against
   him. The sinner urges further that though he has offended and offended
   very greatly and grievously, yet he has done a great many good things.
   It is true he did not love God, but he always went to Chapel! It is
   true he did not pray, but he belonged to a singing class. It is quite
   correct that he did not love his neighbor as himself, but he always
   liked to relieve the poor.

   But the Daysman, looking the sinner full in the face, tells him that
   this plea, also is bad, for the alleged commission of some acts of
   loyalty will not make compensation for avowed acts of treason. "Those
   things," says He, "you ought to have done, but not to have left the
   others undone." And He tells the sinner, with all kindness and
   gentleness, that straining at a gnat does not exonerate him for having
   swallowed a camel. And that having tithed mint and anise and cummin is
   no justification for having devoured a widow's house. To have forgotten
   God is, in itself, a great enormity. To have lived without serving Him
   is a crime of omission so great that whatever the sinner may have done
   on the contrary, stands for nothing at all--since he has even, in that
   case, done only what he ought to have done.

   You see at once the justice of this decision. If any of you were to say
   to your grocer, or tailor, when they send in their bills, "Well, now,
   you ought not to ask for payment of that account because I did pay you
   another bill--you ought not to ask me to pay for that suit of clothes
   because I did pay you for another suit." I think the answer would be,
   "But in paying for what you had before, you only did what you ought to
   do--I still have a demand upon you for this." So all the good deeds you
   have ever done are only debts discharged which were most fully due,
   (supposing them to be good deeds, which is very questionable), and they
   leave the great debt still untouched.

   The defendant has no end of pleas, for the sinner has a thousand
   excuses. And finding that nothing else will do, he begins to appeal to
   the mercy of the Plaintiff and says that for the future he will do
   better. He confesses that he is in debt but he will run up no more
   bills at that shop. He acknowledges that he has offended but he vows he
   will not do so again. He is quite sure that the future shall be as free
   from fault as angels are from sin. Though it is true that he just now
   said his heart was bad, still, he feels inclined to think that it is
   not so very bad after all! He is conceited enough to think that he can,
   in the future, keep himself from committing sin--thereby, you
   see--admitting the worthlessness of his former plea on which he relied
   so much.

   "Now," he says, "if for life I become a teetotaler, then surely I may
   be excused for having been a drunkard! Suppose now that I am always
   honest and steady and never again say one ill word--will not that
   exonerate me from all my wrong-doings and for having blasphemed God?"
   But the Daysman rules, still with kindness and gentleness, that the
   greatest imaginable virtue in the future will be no recompense for the
   sin of the past--for He finds in the Law Book no promise whatever made
   to that effect--but the statute runs in these words, "He will by no
   means spare the guilty." "Cursed is everyone that continues not in all
   things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them."

   You would think that the defendant would now be fairly beaten, but he
   is not--he asks leave to step across the way to bring in a friend of
   his. He is allowed to do so and comes back with a gentleman dressed in
   such a strange style, that, if you had not sometimes seen the like in
   certain Puseyite churches, you would suppose him to have arrayed
   himself for the mere purpose of amusing children at a show where a
   merry Andrew is the presiding genius. The defendant seems to imagine
   that if the case is left to this gentleman in the white shirt and
   ribbons, he will settle it with ease. He has with him a little bottle
   of water by which he can turn hearts of stone into flesh--making heirs
   of wrath into "members of Christ, children of God, and inheritors of
   the kingdom of Heaven."

   He has a certain portion of mystical bread and magical wine, the
   reception with which he can work wonderful transformation, producing
   flesh and blood at his Reverence's will and pleasure! In fact, this
   gentleman trades and gets his living by the prosecution of magic. He
   has occult influences streaming from his fingers, which influences he
   derived originally from a gentleman in lawn. And he now pretends to
   have ability derived from the Apostles, most probably from Judas, by
   marvelous manipulations--how, I cannot tell you--but by a kind of
   sleight of hand to settle the case! But the Daysman, with a frown,
   hurls a thunderbolt from His hand against the impudent impostor and
   bids him take himself away and not again deceive poor sinners with his
   vain pretensions.

   He warns the defendant that the priest is an arrant knave, that
   whatever professions he may make of being a "successor of the
   Apostles," he knows nothing about Apostolic doctrine, or else he would
   not have intruded his sinful, silly self between men's souls and God.
   He bids him advise the man to dress himself like a person in his right
   mind who was about honest work and not as a sorcerer or priest of
   Baal--and give himself to preaching the Gospel--instead of propagating
   the superstitious inventions of Rome.

   What is the poor defendant to do now? He is fairly beaten this time. He
   falls down on his knees, and with many tears and lamentations he cries,
   "I see how the case stands! I have nothing to plead, but I appeal to
   the mercy of the Plaintiff! I confess that I have broken His
   Commandments. I acknowledge that I deserve His wrath--but I have heard
   that He is merciful, and I plead for free and full forgiveness." And
   now comes another scene. The Plaintiff, seeing the sinner on his knees
   with his eyes full of tears, makes this reply, "I am willing at all
   times to deal kindly and according to loving-kindness with all My
   creatures. But will the Arbitrator, for a moment suggest that I should
   damage and ruin My own perfections of truth and holiness?

   "Does He suggest that I should belie My own Word? That I should imperil
   My own Throne? Does He recommend that I should make the purity of
   immaculate Justice to be suspect and should bring down the glory of My
   unsullied holiness because this creature has offended Me and now craves
   for mercy? I cannot, I will not spare the guilty--he has offended and
   he must die! As I live, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked,
   but would rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live.
   Still, this 'would rather' must not be supreme. I am gracious and would
   spare the sinner, but I am just, and must not unsay My own Words. I
   swore with an oath, 'The soul that sins shall die.' I have laid it down
   as a matter of firm decree, 'Cursed is everyone that continues not in
   all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them.' This
   sinner is righteously cursed and he must inevitably die. And yet I love
   him. How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I make you as Admah? How
   can I set you as Zeboim? And yet, how can I put you among the children?
   Would it not be a worse calamity that I should be unjust than that
   earth should lose its inhabitants? Better all men perish than that the
   universe should lose the Justice of God as its stay and shield."

   The Arbitrator bows and says, "Even so. Justice demands that the
   offender should die and I would not have You unjust." What more does
   the Arbitrator say? He sits still and the case is in suspense. There
   stands the just and holy God, willing to forgive if it can be done
   without injury to the immutable principles of right. There sits the
   Arbitrator, looking with eyes of love upon the poor, weeping, trembling
   sinner and anxious to devise a plan to save him--but conscious that
   that plan must not infringe upon Divine Justice--for it were a worse
   cruelty to injure Divine perfections than it were to destroy the whole
   human race!

   The Arbitrator, therefore, after pausing awhile, puts it thus--"I am
   anxious that these two should be brought together. I love them both--I
   cannot, on the one hand, recommend that My Father should stain His
   honor. I cannot, on the other hand, endure that this sinner should be
   cast eternally into Hell. I will decide the case and it shall be
   thus--I will pay My Father's justice all it craves. I pledge Myself
   that in the fullness of time I will suffer in My own proper Person all
   that the weeping, trembling sinner ought to have suffered. My Father,
   will you stand to this?" The eternal God accepts the awful sacrifice!
   What do you say, Sinner, what do you say? Why, I think you cannot have
   two opinions!

   If you are sane--and may God make you sane--you will melt with
   amazement! You will say, "I could not have thought this! I never called
   in a Mediator with an expectation of this! I have sinned and He
   declares that He will suffer! I am guilty and He says that He will be
   punished for me!" Yes, Sinner and He did more than say it, for when the
   fullness of time came--but you know the story--the officers ofjustice
   served Him with the writ and He was taken from His knees in the garden
   of Gethsemane away to the court. And there He was tried and condemned.
   And you know how His back was scourged till the white bones stood like
   islands of ivory in the midst of a crimson sea of gore!

   You know how His head was crowned with thorns and His cheeks were given
   to those who plucked off the hair! Can you not see Him hounded through
   the streets of Jerusalem with the spittle of the brutal soldiery still
   upon His unwashed face and His wounds all unstanched and bleeding? Can
   you not see Him as they hurl Him down and fasten Him to the accursed
   tree? Then they lift the Cross and dash it down into its socket in the
   earth--dislocating every bone, tearing every nerve and sinew--filling
   His soul as full of agony as this earth is full of sin or the depths of
   the ocean filled with its floods? You do not know, however, what He
   suffered within. Hell held carnival within His heart! Every arrow of
   the infernal pit was discharged at Him and Heaven, itself, forsook Him!

   The thunderbolts of vengeance fell upon Him and His Father hid His face
   from Him till He cried in His agony, "My God, My God, why have You
   forsaken Me?" And so He suffered on and on and on, till, "It is
   finished," closed the scene. Here, then, is the arbitration. Christ
   Himself suffers. And now I have to put the query, "Have you accepted
   Christ?" O dear Friend, if you have, I know that God the Holy Spirit
   has made you accept Him! But if you have not, what shall I call you? I
   will not upbraid you--my heart weeps over you! How can you be so mad as
   to forego a compromise so blessed, an arbitration so Divine! Oh, kiss
   the feet of the Daysman! Love Him all your life because He has decided
   the case so blessedly!

   III. Let us now look at THE DAYSMAN'S SUCCESS. For every soul who has
   received Christ, Christ has made a full Atonement which God the Father
   has accepted. And His success in this matter is to be rejoiced in,
   first of all, because the suit has been settled conclusively. We have
   known cases go to arbitration and yet the parties have quarreled
   afterwards. They have said that the arbitrator did not rule justly, or
   something of the kind, and so the whole point has been raised again.

   But O Beloved, the case between a saved soul and God is settled once
   and forever! There is no more conscience of sin left in the Believer.
   And as for God's Book, there is not a sin recorded there against any
   soul that has received Christ! I know some of our Arminian Brethren
   rather think that the case is not settled--or they suppose that the
   case is settled for a time--but that it will one day come up again.
   Beloved, I thank God that they are mistaken! Christ has not cast His
   people's sins into the shallows where they may be washed up again! He
   has cast them into the depths of the sea where they are drowned
   forever! Our Scapegoat has not carried our sins to the borders of the
   land where they may be found again-- He has taken them away into the
   wilderness where, if they are searched for, they shall not be found!
   The case is so settled that in eternity you shall never hear of it
   again except as a case which was gloriously decided.

   Again, the case has been settled on the best principles, because, you
   see, neither party can possibly quarrel with the decision. The sinner
   cannot, for it is all mercy to him--even eternal Justice cannot--for it
   has had its due. If there had been any mitigation of the penalty we
   might yet fear that perhaps the suit might come up again. But now that
   everything has been paid, that cannot be! If my creditor takes from me,
   by a settlement in the Court of Insolvency, ten shillings in the pound,
   I know he will not disturb me again. But I cannot feel quite at ease
   about the other ten shillings. And if I am ever able, I should like to
   pay him.

   But, you see, Christ has not paid ten shillings in the pound, but He
   has paid every farthing--

   "Justice now demands no more, He has paid the dreadful score." For all
   the sins of all His people He has made such a full and satisfactory
   reconciliation that Divine justice were not Divine justice at all if it
   should ask to be paid twice for the same offense! Christ has suffered
   the Law's fullest and most severe penalty--and there is now no fear
   whatever that the case can ever be revived, by writ of error, or
   removal into another court--because it has been settled on the eternal
   and immutable principles of Justice.

   Again, the case has been so settled that both parties are well content.
   You never hear a saved soul murmur at the Substitution of the Lord
   Jesus. If ever I get to see His face, I'll fall down before Him and
   kiss the dust beneath His feet! Oh, if ever I see the Savior who has
   thus delivered me from ruin, if I have a crown I will cast it at His
   feet and never, never wear it--it must, it shall be His! I feel like
   the good woman who said that if Christ ever saved her, He should never
   hear the last of it. And I am sure He never shall for I will praise Him
   as long as immortality endures for what He has done for me. I am sure
   that every saved sinner feels the same.

   And Jehovah, on the other side, is perfectly content. He is satisfied
   with His dear Son. "Well done!" He says to Him. He has received Him to
   the Throne of Glory and made Him to sit at His right hand because He is
   perfectly content with the great work which He has accomplished. But,
   what is more and more wonderful still, both parties have gained in the
   suit. Did you ever hear of such a lawsuit as this before? No, never in
   the courts of man! The old story of the two oyster shells, you know,
   awarded to the plaintiff and defendant, while the oyster is eaten in
   court, is generally the result! But it is not so in this ease--for both
   the Plaintiff and the defendant have won by the arbitration!

   What has God gained? Why, glory to Himself and such glory as all
   creation could not give Him, such glory as the ruin of sinners, though
   so well-deserved, could not give Him. Hark how--

   "Hea ven's eternal arches ring With shouts of Sovereign Grace!" Angels,
   too, as well as those who have been redeemed, strike their harps which
   they have tuned afresh to a nobler strain, as they sing, "Worthy is the
   Lamb and blessed is the eternal God!" And, as for us, the poor
   defendants, why, what have we NOT gained? We were men before--now we
   are something more than Adam was! We were "a little lower than the
   angels" before--now we are "lifted up far above all principalities and
   powers." We were God's subjects once, but this arbitration has made us
   His children!

   We were at our very best only the possessors of a paradise on
   earth--but now we are joint-heirs with Christ of a Paradise above the
   skies! Both sides have won and both sides must therefore be blessedly
   content with their glorious Daysman. And, to conclude--through this
   Daysman both parties have come to be united in the strongest, closest,
   dearest and fondest bond of union. This lawsuit has ended in such a way
   that the Plaintiff and the defendant are friends for life--no, friends
   through death and friends in eternity! How near God is to a pardoned
   sinner--

   "So near, so very near to God,
   Nearer we cannot be.
   For in the Person of His Son,
   We are as near as He."

   What a wonderful thing is that union between God and the sinner! We
   have all been thinking a great deal lately about the Atlantic Cable. It
   is a very interesting attempt to join two worlds together. That poor
   cable, you know, has had to be sunk into the depths of the sea in the
   hope of establishing a union between the two worlds--and now we are
   disappointed again. But oh, what an infinitely greater wonder has been
   accomplished! Christ Jesus saw the two worlds divided and the great
   Atlantic of human guilt rolled between. He sank down deep into the woes
   of man till all God's waves and billows had gone over Him that He might
   be, as it were, the great telegraphic communication between God and the
   apostate race--between the Most Holy One and poor sinners!

   Let me say to you, Sinner, there was no failure in the laying down of
   that blessed cable. It went down deep. The end was well secured and it
   went down deep into the depths of our sin and shame and woe. And on the
   other side it has gone right up to the Eternal Throne and is fastened
   there eternally fast by God Himself! You may work that Telegraph today
   and you may easily understand the art of working it, too. A sigh will
   work it! A tear will work it. Say, "God be merciful to me, a sinner,"
   and along the wire the message will flash and will reach God before it
   comes from you! It is far swifter than earthly telegraphs--yes, and
   there will come an answer back much sooner than you ever dreamed of!

   It is promised--"Before they call I will answer and while they are yet
   speaking I will hear." Whoever heard of such a communication as this
   between man and man? But it really does exist between sinners and God,
   since Christ has opened up a way from the depths of our sin to the
   heights of His Glory. This is for you who are at a distance from Him.
   But He has done more for us who are saved, for He has taken us right
   across the Atlantic of our sin and set us down on the other side! He
   has taken us out of our sinful state and put us into the Father's
   bosom--and there we shall dwell forever in the heart of God as His own
   dear children!

   I would to God that some might now be led to look to the Savior--that
   some would come with weeping and with tears to Him and say--

   "Jesus, lover of my soul, Let me to Your bosom fly.
   "Take my case and arbitrate for me. I accept Your Atonement. I trust in
   Your precious blood! Only receive me and I will rejoice in You forever
   with joy unspeakable and full of glory."

   May the Lord bless you forevermore. Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON.--Isaiah 53.

                           Consolation In The Furnace

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 26, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst
   of the fire and they have no hurt. And the form of the fourth is like
   the Son of God." Daniel 3:25.

   THE narrative of the glorious boldness and marvelous deliverance of the
   three holy children, or rather champions, is well calculated to excite,
   in the minds of Believers, firmness and steadfastness in upholding the
   Truth of God in the teeth of tyranny and in the very jaws of death. Let
   young men especially, since these were young men, learn from their
   example both in matters of faith in religion and matters of integrity
   in business, never to sacrifice their consciences. Lose all rather than
   lose your integrity, and when all else is gone still hold fast to a
   clear conscience as the rarest jewel which can adorn the bosom of a
   mortal.

   It were no waste of time for the preacher to spend half-a-dozen
   mornings in insisting again and again upon the necessity of the
   Christian being obedient universally and constantly to the dictates of
   his conscience, for this is an age requiring sturdy independence and
   stern adherence to the truth. As to whether the most severe precision
   of integrity will turn out to be the best policy or not, I shall not
   care to dispute. I am talking just now, not to men guided by the
   will-o'-the-wisp of policy, but by the pole star of Divine light and I
   beseech them to follow the right at all hazards. When you see no
   present advantage, then walk by faith and not by sight.

   I do pray you, Beloved in the Lord Jesus Christ, do my God the honor to
   trust Him when it comes to matters of loss for the sake of principle.
   See whether He will be your debtor! See if He does not, even in this
   life, prove His Word that "Godliness is great gain," and that they who
   "seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, shall have all
   these things added unto them." Mark you, if in the Providence of God it
   should be the case that you are and continue to be a loser by
   conscience, you shall find that if the Lord pays you not back in the
   silver of earthly prosperity, He will discharge His promise in the gold
   of spiritually! And I would have you remember that a man's life
   consists not in the abundance of that which he possesses.

   To have a clear conscience, to wear a guileless spirit, to have a heart
   void of offense is greater riches than the mines of Ophir could yield
   or the traffic of Tyre could win. Better is a dinner of herbs where
   love is, than a stalled ox and inward contention. An ounce of heart's
   ease is worth a ton of gold. And a drop of innocence is better than a
   sea of flattery. Burn, Christian, if it comes to that--but never turn
   from the right way! Die, but never deny the Truth. Lose all to buy the
   Truth of God! Sell it not, even though the price were the treasure and
   honor of the whole world, for "what shall it profit a man if he gain
   the whole world and lose his own soul?"

   But my particular design in referring to the narrative this morning was
   not to use the whole of it as an incentive to young Christians by way
   of earnest advice, although I confess I feel much inclined to do so.
   But I have this one verse on my mind, where the astonished despot saw
   his late victims quietly surviving the flames which he intended for
   their instant destruction. I desire to use his exclamation as a
   consolation to afflicted Christians everywhere. Concentrate, then, your
   thoughts on the words before us and may the Holy Spirit be our
   Instructor.

   I. We will commence by gazing into the place WHERE GOD'S PEOPLE OFTEN
   ARE. In the text we find three of them in a burning fiery furnace, and
   singular as this may be, literally, it is no extraordinary thing
   spiritually, for, to tell the truth, it is the usual place where saints
   are found. The ancients fabled of the salamander, that it lived in the
   fire. The same can be said of the Christian without any fable whatever!

   The ancient Church, in a favorite metaphor, described itself as a ship.
   Where should the ship be, but in the sea? Now the sea is an unstable
   element, frequently vexed with storms. It is a troubled sea which
   cannot rest. And so the Christian finds this mortal life to be far from
   smooth and seldom settled. It is rather a wonder when a Christian is
   not in trial, for to wanderers in a wilderness, discomfort and need
   will naturally be the rule rather than the exception. It is through
   "much tribulation" that we inherit the kingdom. There is no life so
   joyous as that of a man bound for the Celestial City. And, on the other
   hand, there is no life which involves so much conflict as does the life
   of a pilgrim to the skies.

   The furnaces into which Christians are cast are of various sorts.
   Perhaps we may divide them into three groups. First, there is the
   furnace which men kindle. As if there were not enough misery in the
   world, men are the greatest tormentors of their fellow men. The
   elements in all their fury, wild beasts in all their ferocity, and
   famine and pestilence in all their horrors have scarcely proved such
   foes to man as men themselves have been.

   Religious animosity is always the worst of all hatreds and incites to
   the most fiendish deeds. Persecution is as unsparing as death and as
   cruel as the grave. The believer in Jesus, who is one of a people
   everywhere spoken against, must expect to be thrown into the furnace of
   persecution by his fellow men. "If the world hates you," says our Lord,
   "it hated Me before it hated you." "If you were of the world, the world
   would love its own. But because you are not of the world, but I have
   chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you." Some
   suppose that these words are out of date--old-fashioned words--words
   that refer only to Apostolic times. I answer, you are out of the
   Apostolic faith or else you would painfully find them to be still
   standing in all their force!

   At times the Christian feels the heat of the furnace of open
   persecution. What multitudes of saints have mounted to Heaven like
   Elijah in a chariot of fire? Their seraphic spirits found a safe way to
   Heaven through the flames, for they were guarded by ministering spirits
   whom God has made as flames of fire. Thousands of the precious sons of
   Zion have been left to rot in dungeons, or have been slain upon the
   mountain side, or have perished in penury and need. And to this day
   there are many that endure trials of cruel mocking and are, in various
   painful ways, made to bear the cross, for if any man will live godly in
   Christ Jesus, he must suffer persecution.

   Another furnace is that of oppression. In the iron furnace of Egypt the
   children of Israel were made to do hard bondage in brick and in mortar.
   And doubtless many of God's people are in positions where they are
   little better than slaves. Oppression is far from dead--under the most
   free form of government there is always a possibility for the heads of
   households and the masters of establishments to practice the most
   galling oppression towards those whom they dislike. And doubtless many
   choice spirits are still trod down as straw is trod for the dunghill.
   There is also the furnace of slander The ripest of fruit will be pecked
   at most by the birds. Those who have most of God's image will have most
   of the world's contempt. Expect not that the world shall speak well of
   you, for it never gave your Master a good word. "Shall the disciple be
   above his master, or the servant above his Lord?"

   Expect to be misunderstood--that is man's infirmity. Expect to be
   misrepresented--that is his willful hatred. A very strenuous effort is
   being made just now to mark our denomination with the famous "S. S."
   which was the old log of the Puritan "Sower of Sedition." This slander
   is very ancient, for in Nehemiah's day the accusation ran, "This city
   of Jerusalem of old made sedition against kings." And this is the
   charge now against our missionaries and, indeed, the whole of us, that
   we are accomplices with those who stir up the people to sedition. Sirs,
   we shall not disclaim the fact that we are ever swift to vindicate the
   liberties of all men and are little given to flatter tyrants whether in
   Jamaica, or elsewhere! On the contrary, our witness is very loud and
   clear that there is one Lord who will execute righteousness and
   judgment for all that are oppressed.

   We hate the treading down of the needy and we abhor wholesale butchery
   quite as much when perpetrated by Englishmen as when laid to the door
   of Turks or Russians. And however unfashionable it may be, we maintain
   the opinion that liberty is the birthright of every man, not only the
   liberty which permits his neck to go free from a chain, but the liberty
   which allows the exercise of the rights of manhood. Suffering humanity
   is to be aided even when it wears the ebony hue, and high-handed wrong
   is to be impeached even when the much despised Negro is its victim! It
   can never be too much lamented that the terrible passions excited by
   years of wrong should have led to a riot so fierce and cruel.

   But we must remember that oppression makes even wise men mad, and in
   justice we must lay the onus of the outbreak not alone at the door of
   those unhappy and uneducated men who were goaded to this passionate
   display of wrath, but we must give the greatest measure of blame to the
   men of standing, wealth and education who have laid grievous burdens
   upon these people and refused to hear their earnest cries and grant
   their justifiable demands. The infernal revenge taken by their enemies
   almost exonerates me from even this word of apology, for it alone is
   sufficient proof of the spirit which has dominated over the Black race
   and compelled the unhappy victims to rise against it.

   But of course it will still be insisted that the Baptists are at the
   bottom of the outbreak and so God's Church will be the scapegoat for
   offenders. We are the friends of liberty, but we never taught
   rebellion. We endeavor to implant manly principles of independence and
   freedom, but we put side-by-side the gentle precepts of the loving
   Jesus! Yet scandals of every sort we expect to receive and we count
   them no strange thing when they happen to us.

   Secondly, there is a furnace which Satan blows with three great
   bellows--some of you have been in it. It is hard to bear, for the
   Prince of the power of the air has great mastery over human spirits. He
   knows our weak places and can strike so as to cut us to the very quick.
   He fans the fire with the blast of temptation. The Evil One knows our
   besetting sins, our infirmities of temper, and how we can be most
   readily provoked. He understands how to suit his bait to his fish and
   his trap to his bird.

   At times the most earnest Christian will be compelled to cry out, "My
   steps had well near gone! My feet had well near slipped!" The Savior
   went through this furnace in the wilderness and was thrice tempted of
   the devil. And in the wilderness of this life God's people frequently
   experience temptations of the most horrible kind. Then he works the
   second bellows of accusation. He hisses into the ear, "Your sins have
   destroyed you! The Lord has quite forsaken you! Your God will be
   gracious no more!" He tells us that we are hypocrites, that our
   experience has been fancy, that our faith is mere presumption. He tells
   us that our glorying has been a boast and the very sins which, as a
   tempter, he himself incited us to commit, he brings against us when he
   assumes his favorite character of "the accuser of the brethren."

   Unless we are graciously comforted under the attacks of the roaring
   lion, we shall be almost ready to give up all hope.

   Then he will beset us with suggestions of blasphemy. While tormenting
   us with insinuations, he has a way of uttering foul things against God
   and then casting them into our hearts as if they were our own. He can
   sow the infernal seed of blasphemy in our souls and then tell us that
   these are the native plants of our own hearts! He lays his black
   offspring at our door as if they were our own home-born children. And
   this sometimes is very hard to bear, when curses against God and His
   Christ will come across our soul. And though we hate them with perfect
   hatred, yet we cannot be rid of them.

   And thirdly, there is a furnace which God Himself prepares for His
   people. There is the furnace of physical pain. How soon is the strong
   man brought low! We who rejoiced in health are in a few moments made to
   mourn and moan, not in weakness merely, but in pain and anguish. He
   only thinks little of pain who is a stranger to it. A furnace still
   worse, perhaps, is that of bereavement. The child sickens, the wife is
   gradually declining, the husband is struck down with a stroke. Friend
   after friend departs as star by star grows dim. We bitterly cry with
   Job, "Lover and friend have You put far from me and my acquaintance
   unto darkness."

   Then added to this there will crowd in upon us temporal losses and
   sufferings. The business which we thought would enrich, impoverishes.
   We build the house, but Providence plucks it down with both its hands.
   We hoist the sail and seek to make headway but we are driven far from
   the desired haven by a back wind. "Except the Lord build the house,
   they labor in vain that build it." I cannot multiply the description of
   these crosses which our heavenly Father, in His mysterious Providence
   lays upon His beloved ones. Certain is it that like the waves of the
   sea, the drops of rain, the sands of the wilderness, and the leaves of
   the forest the griefs of the Lord's people are innumerable. Into the
   central heat of the fire does the Lord cast His saints, and mark this,
   He casts them there because they are His own beloved and dearly loved
   people.

   I do not see the goldsmith putting dross into the furnace--what would
   be the good of it? It would be a waste of fuel and labor. But he
   thrusts the crucible full of gold into the hottest part of the fire and
   heaps on coals till the heat is terrible. Some of you have no
   crosses--you are like Moab, "settled on your lees"--"you are not
   emptied from vessel to vessel" because you are reprobate and God cares
   not for you! But the pure gold is put into the furnace to make it
   purer, still. As silver is purified in a furnace of earth seven times,
   simply because it is silver, so are saints afflicted because of their
   preciousness in the sight of the Lord. Men will not be at such pains to
   purify iron as they will with silver, for when iron is brought to a
   tolerable degree of purity it works well. But silver must be doubly
   refined, till no dross is left.

   Men do not cut common pebbles on the lapidary's wheel, but the diamond
   must be vexed again and again and again with sharp cuttings and even so
   must the Believer. The context reminds us that sometimes the Christian
   is exposed to very peculiar trials. The furnace was heated seven times
   hotter--it was hot enough when heated once--but I suppose that
   Nebuchadnezzar had pitch and tar and all kinds of combustibles thrown
   in to make it flame out with greater vehemence.

   Truly, at times the Lord appears to deal thus with His people. It is a
   peculiarly fierce heat which surrounds them and they cry out, "Surely I
   am the man that has seen affliction--I may take precedence of all
   others in the realm of sorrow."

   This is not so, remember, for princes have sat in the king's gate with
   their heads covered with ashes and the best of men who eat bread at
   Jehovah's table this day, have had to say, "You have filled me with
   wormwood and broken my teeth with gravel." The path of sorrow is well
   frequented, beaten down and trod by hosts of the chosen ones of God who
   have found that the path of sorrow, and that path, alone, leads to the
   place where sorrow is unknown!

   I do not want to leave this point without observing, too, that these
   holy champions were helpless when thrown into the furnace. They were
   cast in bound. And many of us have been cast in bound, too, so that we
   could not lift hand or foot to help ourselves. They fell down, it is
   said, into the midst of the furnace. And often a sort of fainting fit
   overtakes the saints of God at the beginning of their trouble--the very
   trouble in which afterwards they can rejoice--for the present fills
   them with heaviness and they fall down bound into the midst of the
   furnace.

   Pretty plight to be in! Who does not shudder at it? Certainly none of
   us would choose it. But we have not the choice and as we have said with
   David, "You shall choose my inheritance for me." If the Lord determines
   to choose it for us among the coals of fire--it is the Lord--let Him do
   what seems good to Him. Where Jehovah places His saints they are safe
   in reality, although exposed to destruction in appearance. That is the
   first point then--where God's people often are.

   II. We proceed to the second--WHAT THEY LOSE THERE. Look at the text
   and it will be clear to you that they lost something. Shadrach, Meshach
   and Abednego lost something in the fire--not their turbans, nor their
   coats, nor their shoes, nor one hair of their heads or beards--no, what
   then? Why, they lost their bonds there! Observe, "Did not we cast three
   men boundinto the midst of the fire? Lo, I see four men loose, walking
   in the midst of the fire."

   The fire did not hurt them, but it snapped their bonds. Blessed loss,
   this! A true Christian's losses are gains in another shape. Now,
   Beloved, observe this carefully--that many of God's servants never know
   the fullness of spiritual liberty till they are cast into the midst of
   the furnace. Many of them are bound and fettered till they get into the
   flame and the flame consumes the bonds in which they had been willing
   to be held captives. Like the pure gold which loses nothing but its
   dross in the fire! Like the iron which loses nothing but its rust under
   the file, so is the Christian--he loses what he is glad to lose and his
   loss is blessed gain.

   Shall I show you some of the bonds which God looses for His people when
   they are in the fire of human hatred? Sometimes He bursts the cords of
   fear of man and desire to please man. Martin Luther, I dare say, like
   other men, had some respect for his own character and some reverence
   for public opinion. He might have been willing to pay some deference to
   the learning and authority of the age--both of which lent their aid to
   the ancient system of Rome--but in a happy hour the Pope excommunicated
   the German troublemaker. All is well for Luther now! His course is
   clear and plain before his face! He must therefore never conciliate or
   dream of peace.

   Now his bonds are broken! He burns the Pope's bull and thunders out,
   "The Pope of Rome excommunicates Martin Luther and I, Martin Luther,
   excommunicate the Pope of Rome! The world hates me and there is no love
   lost between us, for I esteem it as much as it esteems me. War to the
   knife," says he! The man was never clear till the world thrust him out.
   It is a splendid thing to run the gauntlet of so much contempt that the
   soul is hardened to it under a strong consciousness that the right is
   none the more contemptible because its friend may be despised. "Why,"
   you say, "is this how I am treated for the statement of truth? I was
   inclined to conciliate and yield, but after this, never! You have
   loosed my bonds."

   When man has done his worst, as Nebuchadnezzar did in this case, why
   then Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, could say, "What more could he do?
   He has thrown us into a fiery furnace heated seven times hotter. He has
   done his worst and now what have we to fear?" When persecution rages,
   it is wonderful what liberty it gives to the child of God! Never a more
   free tongue than Luther's! Never a braver mouth than that of John Knox!
   Never bolder speech than that of John Calvin! Never a braver heart than
   that which throbbed beneath the ribs of Wicklife! Never a man who could
   more boldly confront popery than John Bradford or Hugh Latimer! But
   under God these men owed their liberty of speech and liberty of
   conscience to the fact that the world thrust them outfrom all hope of
   its favor and so loosed their bonds!

   Again, when Satan puts us in the furnace, he is often the means of
   breaking bonds. How many Christians are bound by the bonds of frames
   and feelings--by the bonds of dependence upon something within--instead
   of resting upon

   Christ the great Sacrifice? When the devil comes with his sharp
   temptations, he roars out, "You are not children of God." Why, what
   then? Why, then we go straight to Christ to look at and view the
   flowing of His precious blood and trust Him just as we did at first!
   And now what about frames and feelings? What about emotions within?
   Why, we are so satisfied with that finished work upon the Cross that we
   feel the bonds of doubt and fear no more! Now we are free, because we
   have come to live on Chrstand not on self!

   Fierce temptations may be like waves that wash the mariner on a
   rock--they may drive us nearer to Christ. It is an ill wind which blows
   no one any good. But the worst wind that Satan can send blows the
   Christian good because it hurries him nearer to his Lord! Temptation is
   a great blessing when it looses our bonds of self-confidence and
   reliance upon frames and feelings. As for the afflictions which God
   sends, do they not loose our bonds? Dear Brethren, doubts and fears are
   far more common to us in the midst of work and business than when laid
   aside by sickness. I do not know how you have found it, but so it is,
   "When I am weak, then am I strong."

   Many Believers sing most sweetly when Providence clips their wings, or
   puts them in a cage. They are very mute and their heart towards the
   Lord is very heavy till they are involved in trouble. And then their
   faith revives! Their hope returns! Their love glows and they sing God's
   praises in the fire! Have not you, dear Friends, frequently experienced
   trouble cuts the cords which bind us to earth? When the Lord takes away
   a child, there is one tie less to fasten to the world and one band more
   to draw towards Heaven. God has loosed you from the bonds of idolatry
   by removing your darling. You cannot idolize your little one any more,
   for it is taken away.

   When money vanishes and business all goes wrong, we frequent the Prayer
   Meeting more and the closet more and read the Bible more--we are driven
   by all tribulation away from earth. If everything went well with us, we
   should begin to say, "Soul, take your ease." But when things go amiss
   with us, then we want to be gone. When the tree shakes, the bird will
   not stop in the nest, but takes to its wings and mount. Happy trouble
   that looses our care of earth! Give you a few days of sharp pain on a
   bed of sickness and you will not love life so much as you now do! You
   will begin to say, "Let me be gone."

   Why, even selfishness makes you wish for that. Then you can understand
   what David meant when he said his heart and his flesh cried out after
   God. It is hard to make the flesh cry out after God--but if you nip it
   well, turn the screw a little further, just stretch it on the rack a
   little more--the dumb, earth-born flesh will begin to cry out that it
   may be gone and leave the pain and sickness behind it! Thus, I think, I
   have shown you, though very briefly, for time fails us, that the saints
   lose something in the furnace which they are glad to lose--they are
   cast in bound, but amid the glowing coals they are set at liberty!

   III. In the third place, WHAT SAINTS DO THERE. "Lo, I see four men
   loose, walking in the midst of the fire." Walking! See those gardens so
   delightfully laid out with varying landscape? They have rippling
   fountains, blushing flowers and odoriferous herbs. There are quiet
   arbors here and there and soft reclining seats--and there with the
   voice of glee--young men and maidens walk. See that fair prospect! Turn
   here--a blazing furnace, so fiercely heated that the eyes feel as if
   scorched from their sockets as they look upon it. And the fervent heat
   comes pouring forth as though old Sol had found a house on earth! Yet
   there are four men walking in that furnace-- walkingin their ease!

   And there is greater joy as they walk among those sulfuric flames,
   greater mirth in their spirits than in those young men and maidens who
   walk among the flowers! They are walking--a symbol of joy, of ease, of
   peace, of rest--not flitting like unquiet ghosts, as if they were
   disembodied spirits traversing the flame. No, they are walking with
   real footsteps, treading on hot coals as though they were roses and
   smelling the sulfuric flames as though they yielded nothing but
   aromatic perfume! Enoch "walked with God." It is the Christian's pace,
   it is his general pace--he does sometimes run--but his general pace is
   walking with God, walkingin the Spirit.

   And you notice that these good men did not quicken their pace and they
   did not slacken it--they continued to walk as they usually did. They
   had the same holy calm and peace of mind which they enjoyed elsewhere.
   Their walking shows not only their liberty and their ease and their
   pleasure and their calm, but it shows their strength! Their sinews were
   not snapped, they were walking. Sometimes God's people, as Jacob at the
   brook Jabbok, halt on their thigh--but I think it is only a small
   trouble that lames Believers--a greater trial will set them right
   again. A stream of trouble may almost overturn a Believer--but a flood
   of trials will make him rise as the ark rose, nearer to Heaven. These
   men had no limping gait--they were walking--walking in the midst of the
   fire!

   Now, for the explanation of all this, turn to the biographies of any of
   God's saints. There is an old Scotch volume entitled "Napthali"--it is
   the lives of those people of God who hazarded their lives unto death in
   the high places of the field. Now, if you read "Napthali," you will
   find that the greatest joy that ever could have been known in this
   mortal life was enjoyed by Covenanters among the mosses and banks and
   on the hillsides of Scotland. There is another blessed old book which
   used to be chained in the churches side by side with the Bible--I mean
   "Foxe's Book of Martyrs." Every family ought to have a copy of it,
   illustrated with pictures for the children to look at. And if you read
   "Foxe's Book of Martyrs," you will see clearly that there was more joy
   in old Bonner's coal-hole and in the Lollard's tower, than palaces
   kings have known!

   The martyrs felt a Heaven of joy while they were suffering a Hell of
   pain! One Samuel was kept starving for weeks, having bread and water
   given him alternately--three or four mouthfuls of bread one day and no
   water. And the next day a few spoonfuls of water and no bread. After he
   had been a little time in such a state as that, he fell into a perfect
   Elysium of delight! He thought he heard an angel say to him, "Samuel,
   you have suffered thus painfully, and fasted for the sake of your Lord.
   You shall soon feast with Him above--meanwhile you shall feast with Him
   below in your soul." Many and many a child of God has had an experience
   manifesting as clearly the loving-kindness of the Lord! Yes, they were
   walking in the midst of the furnace!

   See Paul and Silas with their feet in the stocks and their poor
   bleeding backs on the stone damp floor of the Roman dungeon at
   Philippi, and yet they sing and the prisoners hear them! Why, I think I
   would as soon have been with Paul and Silas as with Peter when he was
   on the mountain. At any rate, the three holy children might have said
   to the fourth, who was their Comforter and Companion, what Peter said
   to his Lord--"Lord, it is good to be here! Let us build three
   tabernacles and dwell under the fiery roof of these boughs of flame,
   for it is happy to be where You are, though it be in Nebuchadnezzar's
   furnace."

   IV. In the fourth place, WHAT THEY DID NOTLOSE THERE? The text says,
   "And they have no hurt." They did not lose anything there. But we may
   say of them, first, their bodies were not hurt. The child of God loses
   in the furnace nothing of himself that is worth keeping. He does not
   lose his spiritual life--that is immortal. He does not lose his Divine
   Graces--he gets them refined and multiplied and the glitter of them is
   best seen by furnace light. The gifts to the Christian of God the Holy
   Spirit are not taken away by the fiery hands of flame. The Christian
   does not lose his garments there. You see their hats and their shoes
   and their coats were not singed, nor was there the smell of fire upon
   them.

   And so with the Christian--his garment is the beauteous dress which
   Christ Himself worked out in His life and which He dyed in the purple
   of His own blood. This is wrapped about the Christian as his
   imperishable mantle of glory and of beauty--

   "This sacred robe the same endures
   When ruined nature sinks in years.
   No age can change its glorious hue,
   The robe of Christ is ever new."

   As it is not hurt by age, nor moth, nor worm, nor mildew, so neither
   can it be touched by fire. When the saint shall come up to Heaven,
   wearing Christ's righteousness and the question is asked, "Who are
   these?" as the spirits gather round them, there shall be no traces upon
   them whatever of any of the persecution or suffering through which they
   have been made to pass. The Christian never loses a grain of his
   treasure when he passes through the furnace--in fact, to sum up in a
   word--he loses nothing.

   The empress threatened to banish Chrysostom. "That you can not do,"
   said he, "for my country is in every clime." "But I will take away your
   goods." "No," said he, "that you can not do, for I am a poor minister
   of Christ, and I have none." "Then," said she, "I will take away your
   liberty." "That you cannot do, for iron bars cannot confine a free
   spirit." "I will take away your life," said she. "That you may do,"
   said he, "in one sense, but I have a life eternal which you cannot
   touch." The empress thought she had better leave the man alone--she
   could do him no harm! So is it better for the enemy to leave the child
   of God alone, for he that kicks against God's people, only kicks with
   naked feet against the pricks. And as the ox smitten with the goad only
   hurts himself when he kicks against it, so shall it be with all who
   touch the saints of the living God. They are not hurt and they never
   shall be.

   Now, it is hard for some of you to think that this will be the case,
   but thus it will be with all of you who truly put your trust in Jesus
   Christ. My Brethren, I know you dread that furnace--who would not? But
   courage, courage, courage! The Lord, who permits that furnace to be
   heated, will preserve you in it, therefore be not dismayed! You would
   wish so to live as to have some tale to tell when you shall mount to
   Heaven--you would not be silent there! Coming to Glory without any
   adventure to narrate before the throne? Now, you cannot be illustrious
   without conflict--you cannot be a conqueror without fighting! You
   cannot by any possibility have anything to witness to the Glory of God
   unless you test and try the promises and the faithfulness of the Most
   High. And where can you do this except in the furnace of woe? Be of
   good courage, then--

   "The flames shall not hurt you,
   I only design your dross to consume And your gold to refine."

   V. The last, and perhaps the most pleasing part of the text is, WHO WAS
   WITH THEM IN THE FURNACE? There was a fourth and He was so bright and
   glorious that even the heathen eyes of Nebuchadnezzar could discern a
   supernatural luster about Him! "The fourth," he said, "is like the Son
   of God." What appearance Christ had put on which was recognizable by
   that heathen monarch, I cannot tell, but I suppose that He appeared in
   a degree of that Glory in which He showed Himself to His servant John
   in the Apocalypse. Such was the excessive splendor and brightness--the
   God-like air that was about Him, the flash of His eyes and the splendor
   of His gait as He walked the fire with the other three--that even
   Nebuchadnezzar could not help saying He was like the Son of God!

   Beloved, you must go into the furnace if you would have the nearest and
   dearest dealings with Christ Jesus! Whenever the Lord appears, it is to
   His people when they are in a militant posture. Moses saw God at Horeb,
   but it was in a burning bush. Joshua saw Him, but it was with a drawn
   sword in his hand, to show that His people are still a militant people.
   And here where the saints saw their Savior, it was as Himself in the
   furnace. The richest thought that a Christian, perhaps, can live upon
   is this--Christ is in the furnace with him! When you suffer, Christ
   suffers. No member of the body can be pained without the head enduring
   its portion.

   And so you, a member of Christ's body, in every pain you feel, pain the
   head Christ Jesus. As Baxter says, "Christ takes us through no darker
   rooms than He went through before." And one could improve upon it and
   say, "He takes us through no rooms so dark but what He is, Himself,
   there in the darkness and makes that darkness by His Presence light,
   cheering and gladdening our hearts." I know that to the worldling this
   seems a very poor comfort, but then if you have never drank this wine
   you cannot judge its flavor. If the King has never taken you into His
   banqueting house and His banner over you has never been love. If He has
   never kissed you with the kisses of His mouth. If He has never said
   unto you, "I am yours and you are Mine," why, you cannot be expected to
   know what you have not experienced!

   But he who has once drunk of the well of Bethlehem would hazard his
   life that he might get a draught of it again! He would be willing to go
   through the furnace though it were heated seventy thousand times
   hotter, that he might be able once more to see that Son of God, the
   fourth bright One who trod the glowing coals! The Presence of Christ is
   the brightest joy beneath the stars! Oh, Christian, seek it! Do not be
   content without it and you shall have it!

   A very unhappy thought starts up and claims expression before we close
   our discourse. I do not like to close with it and yet faithfulness
   requires me to utter it--what must it be to be cast into that fiery
   furnace without Christ in it! What must it be to dwell with everlasting
   burnings! One's heart beats high at the thought of the three poor men
   being thrown into that furnace of Nebuchadnezzar's, with its flaming
   pitch and flames reaching upwards as though it would set the heavens on
   a blaze! Yet that fire could not touch the three children--it was not a
   consuming fire. But, my Hearers, be warned, there is One who is "a
   consuming fire," and once let Him flame forth in anger and none can
   deliver you!

   "Our God," we are told, "our God is a consuming fire." The day comes
   which shall burn as an oven and the proud and they that do wickedly
   shall be as stubble and every soul on earth that believes not in Christ
   Jesus shall be cast into that furnace of fire--this is the second
   death. Beware, you that forget God, lest the eternal fires of Tophet
   kindle upon you--for their flame searches the joints and marrow and
   sets the soul upon a blaze with torment! For you, my Hearers, who have
   listened to the Gospel often, but heard it in vain--for you the furnace
   of Divine wrath shall be heated seven times hotter and you shall fall
   down bound into the midst of it, never to be loosed.

   And instead of having Christ, then, to be with you and to comfort you,
   you shall see Him sitting on His Throne and His glance of lightning
   shall perpetually make that flame burn more terrible and yet more
   terrible! If you were thrown into Nebuchadnezzar's furnace, it would be
   all over in a moment, not even your bones would be found! But the soul
   never dies. The punishment of the wicked is of the same duration as the
   reward of the righteous. Justice will ever exist in the Divine mind and
   will ever have objects upon which to display itself. If the soul died,
   Hell would not be Hell, for there would then be hope. And so the most
   terrible element of hopelessness would be removed.

   Sinner, dream not of being annihilated, but dread the fire which never
   shall be quenched, the worm which never dies! It is written in God's
   Word that He "is able to destroy both body and soul in Hell," a
   destruction which amounts not to annihilation, a destruction of
   everything that is true life, but which leaves existence still
   untouched--

   " What? To be banished for my life, To linger in eternal pain And yet
   forbid to die-- And yet forever die!"

   Dreadful, indeed, is such a doom! There is a second death which will
   pass on all the ungodly, but it is not annihilation! As death does not
   annihilate the body so does not the spiritual death annihilate the
   soul--you shall lose life but never existence! You shall linger in
   perpetual death!

   But there stands the Savior and as He was with His people in the
   furnace, so He is near youthis day in mercy, to deliver you from your
   sins! He calls to you to leave your sins and look to Him and then you
   shall never die and neither upon you shall the flame of wrath kindle
   because its power was spent on Him! He felt the furnace of Divine wrath
   and trod the glowing coals for every soul that believes in Him. God
   give His blessing for Jesus' sake. Amen.

     __________________________________________________________________

                  Walking In The Light And Washed In The Blood

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 3, 1865,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship
   one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us
   from all sin." 1 John 1:7.

   THERE are two great powers in conflict in this world. One is the power
   of good, of which God is the King and the other is the power of evil,
   which is represented by the Prince of the power of the air, Satan. The
   first principle is set forth by John under the figure of light. God
   himself is essential Light and everything which is good in the world is
   an emanation from Himself. "Every good gift and every perfect gift is
   from above and comes down from the Father of Lights, with whom is no
   variableness, neither shadow of turning."

   The light is the evident emblem of the Truth of God. Darkness is the
   symbol of error. Light represents holiness. Darkness is the appropriate
   figure for sin. Light represents knowledge, especially of spiritual
   things, since light reveals. Darkness is the fit token of the ignorance
   under which the natural mind labors perpetually. By nature we are all
   born under the dominion of darkness--we grope our way like blind men
   and when we knew God by the light of His works, we glorified Him not as
   God, neither were thankful, but became vain in our imaginations and our
   foolish heart was darkened.

   Naturally, spiritual things are not discernible by man--they are
   spiritual and spiritually discerned and the carnal mind cannot perceive
   them--for it walks in darkness. The guilt of sin is a thing too high
   for the carnal mind to understand. The glory of the eternal sacrifice
   it cannot perceive. The excellence of God, the faithfulness of His
   promise and the validity of His Covenant--all such things as these are
   swathed in mist--the carnal mind sees them not. As soon as ever the
   Grace of God comes into the heart, it makes as great a difference as
   did the eternal fiat of Jehovah, when He said, "Let there be light,"
   and there was light.

   As soon as God the Holy Spirit begins to work upon the soul of man to
   illuminate him, he perceives at once his own sinfulness. He abhors that
   sinfulness, he labors to escape from it, he cries out for a remedy--he
   finds it in Christ-- therefore he no longer loves sin, he is not guided
   any longer by the darkness of policy and selfishness and error, but he
   walks after the light of the Truth of God, of righteousness, of
   holiness, of true knowledge. God has brought him into light--he sees
   now what he never saw before! He knows, feels, believes, recognizes
   what he never had known anything of before--he is in the light.

   Therefore you constantly find the Christian called a child of light and
   he is warned that he is of the light and of the day. He is told, "You
   are not of the night nor of darkness." "You were sometime darkness, but
   now are you light in the Lord: walk as children of light." You perceive
   in the text, then, that the Christian is spoken of as a man who is in
   the light. But there is something more said of him than this. He is
   practically in the light, "if we walk in the light." It is of no use to
   pretend to have light in the brain--so as to comprehend all knowledge,
   so as to be sound and orthodox in one's doctrinal opinions--this will
   be of no vital service so far as the great point of salvation is
   concerned.

   A man may think he has much light, but if it is only notional and
   doctrinal and is not the light which enlightens his nature and develops
   itself in his practical walk, he lies when he talks of being in the
   light, for he is in darkness altogether. Nor is it truthful to pretend
   or profess that we have light within in the form of experience if we do
   not walk in it, for where the light is true, it is quite certain to
   show itself abroad.

   If there is a candle within the lantern, its light will stream forth
   into the surrounding darkness and those who have eyes will be able to
   see it. I have no right to say I have light unless I walk in it. The
   Apostle is very peremptory with those who so speak. He says, "He that
   says I know Him and keeps not His Commandments is a liar and the truth
   is not in him." The Christian, then, is in the light and he is
   practically in it--his walk and conversation are regulated by the Truth
   of

   God, by holiness--and by that Divine knowledge which God has been
   pleased to bestow upon him. He walks in the light of faith, in another
   path than that which is trod by men who have nothing but the light of
   sense. He sees Him who is invisible and the sight of the invisible God
   operates upon his soul.

   He looks into eternity, he marks the dread reward of sin and the
   blessed gift of God to those who trust in Jesus and eternal realities
   have an effect upon his whole manner and conversation--from now on he
   is a man in the light, walking in that light. There is a very strong
   description given here--"If we walk in the light as He is in the
   light." Beloved, the thought of that dazzles me! I have tried to look
   it in the face, but I cannot endure it. If we walk in the light as God
   is in the light! Can we ever attain to this? Shall poor flesh and blood
   ever be able to walk as clearly in the light as He is whom we call "Our
   Father," of whom it is written, "God is light and in Him is no darkness
   at all"?

   Let us say this much and then commend this wonderful expression to your
   meditations. Certainly this is the model which is set before us, for
   the Savior Himself said, "Be you perfect, even as your Father who is in
   Heaven is perfect." And if we take anything short of absolute
   perfection as our model of life we shall certainly, even if we should
   attain to our ideal, fall short of the Glory of God! Beloved, when a
   schoolmaster writes the copy at the head of the page, he does not
   expect that the boy will come up to the copy--but then, if the copy is
   not a perfect one, it is not fit to be imitated by a child.

   And so our God gives us Himself as the pattern and copy, "Be you
   imitators of God as dear children," for nothing short of Himself would
   be a worthy model. Though we, as life sculptors, may feel that we can
   never rival the perfection of God, yet we are to seek after it and
   never to be satisfied until we attain it. The youthful artist, as he
   grasps his early pencil, can hardly hope to equal Raphael or
   Michelangelo! But still, if he did not have a noble ideal before his
   mind, he would only attain to something very mean and ordinary.
   Heavenly fingers point us to the Lord Jesus as the great Exemplar of
   His people and the Holy Spirit works in us a likeness to Him.

   But what does it mean that the Christian is to walk in light as God is
   in the light? We conceive it to import likeness, but not degree. We are
   as truly in the light. We are as heartily in the light. We are as
   sincerely in the light, as honestly in the light, though we cannot be
   there in the same degree. I cannot dwell in the sun--it is too bright a
   place for my residence--unless I shall be transformed, like Uriel,
   Milton's angel who could dwell in the midst of the blaze of its
   excessive glory. But I can walk in the light of the sun though I cannot
   dwell in it. And so God is the Light, He is Himself the Sun and I can
   walk in the light as He is in the light, though I cannot attain to the
   same degree of perfection and excellence and purity and truth in which
   the Lord, Himself, resides.

   Trapp is always giving us the Truth of God in a way in which we can
   remember it--so he says we are to be in the light as God is in the
   light for quality, but not for equality. We are to have the same light
   and as truly to have it and walk in it as God does, though as for
   equality with God in His holiness and perfection--that must be left
   until we cross the Jordan and enter into the perfection of the Most
   High.

   Having thus briefly sketched the character of the genuine Christian,
   observe, Beloved, that he is the possessor of two privileges. The first
   is fellowship with God. "We have fellowship one with another." And the
   second is complete cleansing from sin--"and the blood of Jesus Christ,
   His Son, cleanses us from all sin." The first privilege we will have
   but a word upon--it is fellowship with God. As you read this verse in
   our translation, it looks very much as if all that was meant was
   fellowship with your brother Christians. But this, according to able
   critics, would not convey the sense of the original.

   The Arabic version renders it, "God with us and we with Him," and
   several copies read, "we have fellowship with Him." Our version almost
   compels you to think of fellowship with other Believers, but such is
   not the intention of the Spirit. "We have mutual fellowship--between
   God and our souls there is communion." This is the sense of the
   passage. God is Light--we walk in light--we agree. "Can two walk
   together unless they are agreed?" It is clear we are agreed as to the
   principles which we shall advance--God is the champion of Truth, so are
   we. God is the promoter of holiness, so are we. God seeks that love may
   reign instead of selfishness, so does the Christian. God hates error
   and spares no arrows to destroy it. The Christian also contends
   earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.

   God is pure, and the pure in heart shall see God. God is holiness and
   those who are holy are attracted to God from an affinity of nature,
   even as the needle is attracted to its pole. If the Lord has visited
   you and made you to walk in light, you shall surely have fellowship
   with God your Father. He that is in darkness cannot have fellowship
   with God. Veiled in ignorance, guided by passion, controlled by error,
   led astray by falsehood--how can you aspire to talk with your God? Your
   prayer is but a chattering sound! Your song is the clang of a sounding
   brass, the noise of a tinkling cymbal! Your devotion bears you no
   further than the letter which kills!

   But oh, poor Soul, if God should take you out of your darkness and make
   you to see yourself, to see Him and follow after Truth and
   righteousness and holiness, why then your prayer would be heard in
   Heaven, your song would mingle with the sweet notes of celestial harps
   and even your groans and tears would reach your Father's heart, for you
   would enjoy fellowship with Him! If we walk with God as God is in the
   light, the secret of God is with us and our secret is with God. He
   opens His heart to us and we open our heart to Him--we become friends!
   We are bound and knit together so that being made partakers of the
   Divine Nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world
   through lust, we live like Enoch, having our conversation above the
   skies.

   Upon the second privilege we intend to dwell. I have been driven to
   this text and yet I have been afraid of it. This text has been handled,
   the latter part of it, I mean, very often out of its context. Yet it
   has had such a comforting influence on many souls that I have been half
   afraid to discourse upon it in its true context. And yet I have felt,
   "Well, if anything I should say should take away any comfort from any
   seeking soul, I shall be very sorry, but I cannot help it." I do feel
   that it is essential to the Christian ministry not to pick passages out
   of God's Word and rend them away from the context, but to take them as
   they stand.

   As this text stands, it does not seem to me to gleam with the
   particular ray of comfort which others see in it, but it has another
   beam of joy even more radiant! God's Word must be taken as God speaks
   it--we have no right to divide the living child of Divine Truth, or
   wrest it to make it mean other than it does. According to the text,
   special pardon of sin is the peculiar privilege of those who walk in
   the light as God is in the light and it is not the privilege of anyone
   else. Only those who have been brought by Divine Grace from a state of
   nature into a state of Grace and walk in the light may claim the
   possession of perfect cleansing through the blood of Jesus Christ.

   In dwelling upon this latter part of the verse, there seemed to me to
   be seven things in it which any thoughtful reader would be struck with.
   Considered as the privilege of every man who, however limpingly, is
   walking in the light, this word, which tells of pardon bought with
   blood, is very precious--a crown set with jewels! To seven choice
   pearls I invite your loving gaze.

   1. The first thing that struck me was THE GREATNESS of everything in
   the text. In some places everything is little. You talk with some
   men--their thoughts, their ideas are all little. Almost everything is
   drawn to a scale and aspiring minds generally draw their matters to as
   great a scale as they can find, but that is necessarily a little one.
   See to what a magnificent scale everything is drawn in our text! Think,
   Beloved, how great the sin of God's people is! Will you try and get
   that thought into your minds? How great is your own sin--your sin
   before conversion--think that over! Your sin while seeking the Lord in
   putting confidence in your own works and looking after refuges of lies.
   Your sins since conversion--turn them over.

   Beloved, one sin towers up like an Alp! But we have many sins heaped
   upon each other, as in the old fable of the giants who piled Pelion
   upon Ossa, mountain upon mountain! O God, what an aggregate of sin is
   there in the life of one of Your most pure and most sanctified
   children! Multiply this. All the sin of one child of God--multiply it
   by the number of those contained in that word "us." "Cleanses us from
   all sin! How many are God's children? God's Word shall answer. "A
   multitude that no man can number, out of all kindreds and peoples and
   tongues, stood before the Throne." Can you imagine--deep as Hell's
   bottomless pit! High as Heaven's own Glory--for sin sought to pluck
   even God out of His Throne! Wide as the east is from the west! Long as
   eternity is this great mass of the guilt of the people for whom Christ
   shed His blood! And yet all this is taken away! "The blood of Jesus
   Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all sin."

   Then observe the greatness of the Atonement offered. Will you inwardly
   digest those words, "the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son"? Blood is at
   all times precious, but this is no blood of a mere man--it is the blood
   of an innocent Man! Better still, it is the blood of Man in union with
   Deity--"His Son!" God's Son! Why, angels cast their crowns before Him!
   All the choral symphonies of Heaven surround His glorious Throne. "God
   over all, blessed forever. Amen." And yet He yields His blood! He takes
   upon Himself the form of a servant and then is scourged and pierced,
   bruised and torn and at last slain--for nothing but the blood of Deity
   could make atonement for human sin!

   The Atonement must be no man, merely--He must be the God-Man Mediator,
   the Fellow of Jehovah, co-equal and co-eternal with Him--He must bear
   the pangs and bitterness of Divine wrath which was due to sin. Think of
   this--a sacrifice which no human mind can ever properly estimate in the
   infinity of its value! Here, indeed, we have greatness-- great sin, but
   a great Atonement! Think again--we have here great love which provided
   such a Sacrifice. Oh, how He must have loved, to have descended from
   Heaven to earth and from earth to the grave! How He must have loved, to
   have chosen us, when we were hating Him--when we were enemies! He has
   reconciled us unto God by His own death!

   Dead in trespasses and sins, corrupt--wrapped up in the cerements of
   evil habits, hateful and hating one another, full of sin and every
   abomination--yet He loved us so as to yield up His soul unto death for
   us. We are dealing with great things here, indeed, and we must not
   forget the greatness of the influence which such an Atonement, the
   result of such love, must have upon the Christian's heart. Oh, the
   greatness of the peace which passes all understanding, which flows from
   this great Atonement! Oh, the greatness of the gratitude which must
   blaze forth from such a sacred fire as this! Oh, the greatness of the
   hatred of sin, of the revenge against iniquity which must spring from a
   sense of such love, when it is shed abroad in the heart!

   You are citizens enjoying no mean privilege, oh, you blood-bought
   citizens of a blood-bought city! God has loved you. You cannot, though
   I should allot you a whole lifetime--you cannot get to the depth of
   that love God has loved you and to prove His love He has died in the
   Person of man for you. He loves you and has overcome the dread result
   of all your fearful sin! And now, by the love which God has manifested,
   we do pray you let your holiness, your truthfulness and your zeal prove
   that you understand the greatness of those things. If your heart can
   really conceive the greatness of the things here revealed--the great
   sin, the great Savior offering Himself out of great love that He might
   make you to be greatly privileged--I am sure your hearts will rejoice!

   2. The next thing which sparkles in the text is its SIMPLE
   SOLITARINESS--"We have fellowship one with another." And then it is
   added as a simple, gloriously simple statement, "the blood of Jesus
   Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all sin." Observe there is nothing
   said about rites and ceremonies. It does not begin by saying, "and the
   waters of Baptism, together with the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son,
   cleanses us." Not a word, whether it shall be the sprinkling in
   infancy, or immersion of Believers--nothing is said about it--it is the
   blood, the blood only, without a drop of baptismal water!

   Nothing is here said about sacraments--what some call "the blessed
   Eucharist," is not dragged in here--nothing about eating bread and
   drinking wine! It is the blood, nothing but the blood--"the blood of
   Jesus Christ, His Son." And if nothing is said of rites that God has
   given, rites that man has invented are equally excluded. Not a syllable
   is uttered concerning celibacy or monasticism! Not a breath about vows
   of perpetual chastity and poverty! Not a hint about confession to a
   priest and human absolution! Not an allusion to penance or extreme
   unction! "The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all
   sin."

   It was well done by a poor woman who, as she lay sick, heard for the
   first time the precious Gospel of her salvation. She was told that the
   blood alone cleansed from sin. She believed, and then, putting her hand
   into her bosom, she took out a little crucifix which she had always
   worn, hanging from a chain about her neck, and said to the preacher,
   "Then I don't want this, Sir." Ah, truly so! And so may we say of
   everything that man has devised as a consolation to a poor wounded
   spirit. "I have found Jesus and I do not want that, Sir." You who want
   it, keep it--but as for us, if we walk in the light as He is in the
   light--the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, so completely purges us from
   all sin that we dare not look to anything else lest we come into the
   bondage of the beggarly elements of this world!

   You will perceive, too, that nothing is said about Christian experience
   as a means of cleansing. "What?" says one. "Does not the first
   sentences of the verse imply that?" Assuredly not, for you perceive
   that the first sentence of the verse does not interfere, though it is
   linked, with the other. If I walk in the light as God is in the light,
   what then? Does my walking in the light take away my sins? Not at all!
   I am as much a sinner in the light as in the darkness if it were
   possible for me to be in the light without being washed in the blood.

   Well, but we have fellowship with God, and does not having fellowship
   with God take away sin? Beloved, do not misunderstand me! No man can
   have fellowship with God unless sin is taken away--but his fellowship
   with God and his walking in light, does not take away his sin--not at
   all. The whole process of the removal of sin is here, "And the blood of
   Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all sin." I beg to repeat
   it--the text does not say that our walking in the light cleanses us
   from sin! It does not say that our having fellowship with God cleanses
   us from sin--these are the result of cleansing, but they have no
   connection as cause--it is the blood and the blood alone which purges
   us from sin!

   The dying thief looked to Christ and sin was taken away by the blood.
   And there is a Brother in Christ here who has had such an experience of
   Christ's love for sixty years that his heart is now like a shock of
   corn, ripe for Heaven. He lives in his Master's Presence, he spends the
   most of his time in his Master's service! But, Beloved, there is not a
   single atom of difference between him and the dying thief so far as the
   cleansing away of sin is concerned! The blood cleansed the thief and
   the same blood washes this advanced and full-grown Christian, or
   otherwise he is still unclean.

   Observe, yet again, that in the verse there is no hint given of any
   emotions, feelings, or attainments as co-operating with the blood to
   take away sin. Christ took the sins of His people and was punished for
   those sins as if He had been Himself a sinner, and so sin is taken away
   from us. But in no sense, degree, shape or form is sin removed by
   attainments, emotions, feelings or experiences! The blood is the only
   Atonement--the blood, without any mixture of anything else, completes
   and finishes the work! "For you are complete in Him."

   Now I could enlarge for a very long time on this point, but I do not
   think I shall. I will rather throw in a sentence or two and observe
   that whereas there are some who urge you to look to your doctrinal
   intelligence as a ground of comfort. I beseech you Beloved, look only
   to the blood! Whereas there are others who would set up a standard of
   Christian experience and urge that this is to be the channel of your
   consolation. I pray you, while you prize both doctrine and experience,
   rest not your soul's weight but in the precious blood! Some would lead
   you to high degrees of fellowship-- follow them, but not when they
   would lead you away from the simple position of a sinner resting upon
   the blood! There are those who could teach you mysticism and would have
   you rejoice in the light within. Follow them as far as they have the
   warrant of God's Word, but never take your foot from that Rock of Ages
   where the only safe standing can be found!

   Certain of my Brethren are very fond of preaching Christ in His Second
   Coming--I rejoice that they preach the truth concerning Christ
   Glorified, but, my Beloved, I do beseech you do not place your hope on
   Christ Glorified, nor on Christ to come, but on "Christ Crucified."
   Remember that in the matter of taking away sin, the first thing is not
   the Throne, but the Cross--not the reigning Savior--but the bleeding
   Savior! Not the King in His Glory, but the Redeemer in His shame. Care
   not to be studying dates of prophecies if burdened with sin, but seek
   your chief, your best comfort in the blood of Jesus Christ which
   cleanses us from all sin--here is the pole star of your salvation--sail
   by it and you shall reach the port of peace.

   3. A third brilliant flash in the light, viz., THE COMPLETENESS of the
   cleansing. "The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all
   sin"--not from some sin, but "from all sin." Beloved, I cannot tell you
   the exceeding sweetness of this Word, but I pray God the Holy Spirit to
   give you a taste of it. There is original sin, by which we fell in Adam
   before we were born, and there is inherited sin through which we were
   born in sin and shapen in iniquity. There is actual sin--the sin of my
   youth and my former transgressions, the sins of my riper years, the
   sins which defile the hoary head and make that which should be a crown
   of Glory to be a crown of grief--and all these sins, original and
   actual, are all gone! All gone!

   Sins against the Law, though it is exceedingly broad so that it makes
   me a sinner in thought, in word, in deed, in heart--they are all gone!
   Sins against the Gospel when I kicked against the pricks, when I
   stifled conscience, when I resisted the Holy Spirit as did also my
   fathers--when I hated the Truth of God and would not have it because my
   deeds were evil and I would not come to the light lest my deeds might
   be reproved. Sins when I would regard none of the sweet invitations of
   the Gospel--all cleansed away! Sins against Christ Jesus since my
   conversion when I have backslidden and my heart has been cold towards
   Him! Sins against the Holy Spirit when I have followed my own impulses
   instead of the indwelling Deity--all gone!

   The Roman Catholic divides sin into venial sins and mortal sins. Be it
   so--the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin, mortal or
   venial, deadly or pardonable. Sins of commission--here is a long
   catalogue--think it over! Sins of omission--that is still a larger
   list! The things which we have left undone which we ought to have done
   are probably more numerous than the things which we have done which we
   ought not to have done--all are gone! Some sins are greater than
   others. There is no doubt whatever that adultery, fornication, murder,
   blasphemy and such like are greater than the sins of daily life--but
   whether they are great sins or little sins--they are all gone! That
   same God who took away the plague of flies from Egypt also took away
   the plague of thunder and of lightning. All are gone--gone at once!

   Pharaoh's chariot is drowned in the Red Sea and the mean Egyptian is
   drowned in the same way. The depths have covered them. There is not one
   of them left. There are sins against God--how many there are! Sins of
   breaking His Day and despising His Word--profaning His name, forgetting
   Him and not loving Him--but He blots out all! Sins against my friends
   and my enemies, against my neighbor, against my father, my child, my
   wife--sins in all relationships--yet all are gone! Then, too, remember
   there are sins of presumption and sins of ignorance--sins done
   willfully and unknown sins--the blood cleanses us from ALL sin!

   Shall I go on? Surely I need not! But you see the purging is complete.
   Whether the bill is little or the bill is great, the same receipt can
   discharge one as the other. The blood of Jesus Christ is as blessed and
   Divine a payment for the sin of blaspheming Peter as it is for the sin
   of loving John! Our iniquity is gone, all gone at once and all gone
   forever. Blessed completeness! What a sweet theme to dwell upon!

   4. The next gem that studs the text is the thought of PRESENTNESS.
   "Cleanses" says the text--not, "shall cleanse." There are multitudes
   who think that as a dying hope they may look forward to pardon, and
   perhaps within a few hours of their dissolution they may be able to
   say, "My sins are pardoned." Such can never have read God's Word, or,
   if they have read it, they have read it with unbelieving eyes. Beloved,
   I would not give the snap of my finger for the bare possibility of
   cleansing when I come to die!

   Oh how infinitely better to have cleansing now! Some imagine that a
   sense of pardon is an attainment after many years of Christian
   experience. For a young Christian to say, "My sins are forgiven," seems
   to them to be an untimely fig, ripe too soon. But, Beloved, it is not
   so. The moment a sinner trusts Jesus, that sinner is as fully forgiven
   as he will be when the light of the Glory of God shall shine upon his
   resurrection countenance. Beloved, forgiveness of sin is a present
   thing--a privilege for this day, a joy for this very hour! And whoever
   walks in the light as God is in the light has fellowship with God and
   has at this moment the perfect pardon of sin.

   You perceive that it is written in the present tense as if to indicate
   continuance--it will always be so with you, Christian. It was so
   yesterday--it was "cleanses" yesterday, it is "cleanses" today--it will
   be "cleanses" tomorrow. It will be "cleanses" until you cross the
   river--every day you may come to this fountain for it "cleanses!" Every
   hour you may stand by its brim, for it "cleanses." I think there is
   sanctification here as well as justification. I am inclined to believe
   that this text has been too much limited in its interpretation and that
   it signifies that the blood of Jesus is constantly operating upon the
   man who walks in the light so as to cleanse him from the indwelling
   power of sin.

   And the Spirit of God applies the doctrine of the Atonement to the
   production of purity till the soul becomes completely pure from sin at
   the last. I desire to feel every day the constantly purifying effect of
   the sacrifice of my Lord and Master. Look at the foot of the Cross and
   I am sure you will feel that the precious drops cleanse from all sin.

   5. Now in the fifth place, the text presents to us very blessedly the
   thought of CERTAINTY. It is not, "perhaps the blood of Jesus Christ
   cleanses from sin." The text speaks of it as a fact not to be
   disputed--it does do so. To the Believer this is matter of certainty,
   for the Spirit of God bears witness with our spirits that we are born
   of God. Our spirit in the joy and peace which it receives through
   believing becomes assured of its being cleansed, and then the Spirit of
   God comes in as a second Witness and bears witness with our spirit that
   we are born of God!

   My being cleansed from all sin today is to me as much a matter of
   consciousness as my being better in health. I was conscious of pain
   when I lay on my sick bed and so, when I was living in sin, as soon as
   God gave me spiritual life I was conscious that guilt lay heavily upon
   me. I am conscious now of pain removed and so I am equally conscious of
   sin removed--I do not hesitate to say it here, that my consciousness of
   pardoned sin is at this moment as clear and as distinct as my
   consciousness of removed pain while I look at Jesus Christ, my Lord, by
   faith.

   So is it often with the Christian. It is frequently with him a matter
   of consciousness most positive and infallible that he is truly and
   really cleansed from all sin by the blood of Jesus Christ! It is not
   merely a matter of consciousness, but if you think of it, it is a
   matter of reasoning. If Jesus Christ did, indeed, take the sins of all
   who believe, then it follows, necessarily, that I, trusting in Christ,
   have no longer any sin--for if Christ took my sin--sin cannot be in two
   places at once! If Christ bears it, then I do not bear it. And if
   Christ was punished for it, then the punishment of my sin has been
   endured and I cannot be punished for the sin for which Jesus has been
   punished--unless God should sovereignly punish men--which would be such
   an insult to the honesty and justice of God that it must not be
   tolerated for a moment in our thoughts!

   If Jesus Christ has paid the debt it is paid and--

   "Justice can demand no more,
   Christ has paid the dreadful score."

   So the Christian's being cleansed from sin becomes to him a matter of
   spiritual argument--he can see it clearly and manifestly. Yet more, he
   is so certain of it that it begins to operate upon him in blessed
   effect. He is so sure that there is no sin laid to his door that he
   draws nearer to God than a sinner, defiled with sin, may do. He enters
   into that which is within the veil--he talks with God as his Father--he
   claims familiar communion with the Most High God! And though God is so
   great that the Heaven of heavens cannot contain Him, yet he believes
   that that same God lives in his heart as in a temple! Now this he could
   not feel if he did not know that sin is put away. Beloved, no man is
   capable of virtue in the highest sense of the term till it is a matter
   of certainty to him that his sin is cleansed.

   You say, "That is a strong assertion," but I do assert it--all of you
   who are doing good works with the view to saving yourselves are missing
   the mark of pure virtue. You say, "Why?" The goodness of an action
   depends upon its motive. Your motive is to save yourselves--that is
   selfish--your action is selfish and the virtue of it has evaporated.
   But the Christian, when he performs good works, does not perform them
   with any view whatever of merit or self-salvation. "I am saved," he
   says--"perfectly saved. I have not a sin in God's Book against me--I am
   clean. Great God, before Your bar I am clean through Jesus Christ--

   'Loved of my God, for Him again
   With love intense I burn.'

   What can I do to prove to all mankind how much, how truly I love my
   God?" You see, then, that this must be a matter of certainty or else it
   will never have its right effect upon you. And I pray God that you may
   suck the certainty out of this text and taste its sweetness to your own
   soul's inward contentment and be able to say, "Yes, without a doubt,
   the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all sin."

   6. I hope I shall not weary you, but a few words upon the sixth gem
   which adorns the text, namely, the DIVINITY of it. "Where?" asks one.
   Does not divinity gleam in this text? Does it not strike you that the
   verse is written in a God-like style? The God-like style is very
   peculiar. You can tell the style of Milton from the style of
   Wordsworth, or the style of Byron. Read a verse and an educated person
   knows the author by the ring of the sentences. The God-like style is
   unique in its excellence. You need never put the name at the bottom
   when the writing is of the Lord. You know it by the very style of it.
   "Light be! Light was."

   Who speaks like that but Deity? Now there is a Divine ring about this
   sentence--"The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all
   sin." Why, if man were talking of so great an Atonement he would fetch
   a compass! He would have to go round about! We cannot afford to say
   such great things as these in a few words. We must adopt some form of
   speech that would allow us to extol the truth and indicate its
   beauties. God seems to put away His pearls as if they were but common
   pebbles. "The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all
   sin"--as if it were as much a matter of every-day work as for a man to
   wash his hands!

   Notice the simplicity of the whole process. It does not seem to take
   weeks or months--it is done at once! Slowly and by degrees is man's
   action--we must lay the thing to soak, to fetch the color from it,
   subject it to many processes and expose it to the wind and rain and
   frost and sun before it can be cleansed. But here God speaks and it is
   done! The blood comes into contact with the guilty conscience and it is
   all over with sin. As if it were but a handful that moves a mountain of
   sin, He takes up the isles as a very little thing. He counts great
   oceans of our sin as though they were but a drop in a bucket. Believing
   in Christ in a moment, by the Divine and majestic process which God has
   ordained, we get the perfect cleansing of sin.

   7. In the last place, just a hint upon the WISDOM of the text. What a
   wise way of cleansing from sin the text speaks of! Beloved, suppose God
   had devised a plan for pardoning sin which did not turn the sinner's
   face to God? Then you would have a very singular spectacle--you would
   have a sinner pardoned by a process which enabled him to do without his
   God--and it strikes me he would be worse off than he was before! But
   here, before ever the sinner can receive pardon he must say, "I will
   arise and go unto my Father." And he must come closer into contact with
   God than he ever came before. He must see God in the flesh of Christ
   and must look to Him if he would be saved.

   I do bless God that I have not to turn my face to Hell to get pardon,
   but I have to turn my face towards Heaven! That seems to me to be the
   wise way, for while it takes away the sin which was like a disease, it
   takes away the distance from

   God which was the true root of that disease. It turns the sinner's face
   in the direction of holiness and bliss. Observe the benefit of this
   plan of salvation in the fact that it makes the sinner feel the evil of
   sin. If we were pardoned in a way which did not involve pain to
   someone, we should say, "Oh, it is easy for God to forgive it." But
   when I see the streaming veins of Jesus and mark the sweat of His blood
   fall to the ground and hear Him cry, "They have pierced My hands and My
   feet," then I understand that sin is a dreadful evil!

   If a man should be pardoned without being made to feel that sin is
   bitter, I do not know that he would be really any the better
   off--perhaps better unpardoned than pardoned--unless he is led to hate
   sin. Our gracious God has also chosen this plan of salvation with the
   wise design of making man glorify God. I cannot see sin pardoned by the
   substitutionary Atonement of the Lord Jesus without dedicating myself
   to the praise and glory of the great God of redeeming love. It would be
   a pity if man could be pardoned and afterwards could live a selfish,
   thankless life, would it not? If God had devised a scheme by which sin
   could be pardoned and yet the sinner live to himself, I do not know
   that the world or the man would be advantaged.

   But here are many birds killed with one stone, as the Proverb puts it.
   Now therefore, at the foot of the Cross, the bands which bound our soul
   to earth are loosened. We are strangers in the land and therefore, "God
   forbid that we should glory, save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto us and we are crucified to
   the world."

   I leave this text with the Believer, only adding, if any of you would
   have it, and joy in it, you must walk in the light. I pray God the Holy
   Spirit to bring you to see the light of the Glory of God in the face of
   Jesus Christ! Then you will trust Him and then you shall have
   fellowship with Him! And by His blood you shall be cleansed from all
   sin. God bless you for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                                 Early And Late

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 10, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For the kingdom of Hea ven is like a landowner who went out early in
   the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard... And he went out about
   the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace... Again
   he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour and did likewise. And
   about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and
   said to them, 'Why have you been standing here idle all day?'"

   Matthew 20:1,3, 5, 6.

   WE have frequently observed that we do not think it right to neglect
   the context of Scripture. We have no right to tear passages of
   Scripture from their context and make them to mean what they were not
   intended to teach. And therefore I have, in the reading given you,
   according to my ability, what I think to be the immediate design of the
   present parable. It is a rebuke to those who fall into a legal spirit
   and begin calculating as to what their reward ought to be in a kingdom
   where the legal spirit is entirely out of place since its reward is not
   of debt, but of Divine Grace. I think I may now, without any violation
   of propriety, dwell upon one very distinct fact in connection with the
   parable. It is not right to violate the drift of the parable, but
   having already observed it and made it as clear as we can, we believe
   that we are now authorized to make use of one of the main circumstances
   mentioned in it.

   This morning I intend to call your attention to the fact that the
   laborers were hired at different periods of the day, by which doubtless
   we are taught that God sends His servants into His vineyard at
   different times and seasons. Some are called in early youth and others
   are not led to enter into the service of the Master until declining
   years have brought them almost to the eventide of life. I must,
   however, ask you to remember that they were all called--by the mention
   of which the Savior would teach us that no man comes into the kingdom
   of Heaven of himself. Without exception, every laborer for Jesus has
   been called in one sense or another and he would not have come without
   being so called. They are all called.

   Were a man what he should be, he would need no pressing and invitation
   to come to the Gospel of Christ. But since human nature is perverted
   and men put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter, darkness for light
   and light for darkness, man needs to be called by the outward word. He
   needs to be invited, persuaded and entreated. He needs, to use the
   strong expression of the Apostle Paul, to be told that as though God
   did beseech him by us, we should pray him, in Christ's place, to be
   reconciled to God. No, further than this, although some men come to
   work in a legal spirit in the vineyard through this common call of the
   Gospel, yet no man in spirit and in truth comes to Christ without a
   further call, namely, the effectual call of God's Holy Spirit.

   The general call is given by the minister--it is all that he can give.
   If the preacher attempts to give the particular call as some of my
   hyper-Calvinistic Brethren do--confining the Gospel command to a
   certain character and trying to be, themselves, the discoverers of
   God's elect and to make that particular which is always universal--if
   the preacher acts thus and virtually endeavors to give the particular
   call--he makes a sorry mess of it and usually fails altogether to
   preach the Gospel of glad tidings to the sons of men.

   But when man is content to do what he can do, namely, preach the
   commandment, "that we believe on the Lord Jesus Christ," and that, "God
   commands all men everywhere to repent," then there comes with the
   general call to the chosen of God a particular and special call which
   none hut the Holy Spirit can give, but which He gives so effectually
   that all who hear it become willing in the day of God's power and turn
   with full purpose of heart unto the Lord! In what sense is it true that
   many are called but few chosen if none are to be called by the
   preaching of the Word but those who are chosen? There are two
   callings--the one is general to all who hear of Jesus and many who are
   thus called are not chosen. The other is personal and peculiar to the
   elect--"for whom He did predestinate, them He also called."

   To return to our point. All in the vineyard are in some sense called.
   There is not a solitary exception to this rule in the entire Christian
   Church. The doctrine of freewill has not a single specimen to show to
   prove itself. There is not a sheep in all the flock that came back to
   the shepherd unsought. There is not a single piece of money which
   leaped again into the woman's purse--she swept the house to find
   it--no, I will go further and say there is not even a single prodigal
   son in the entire family who did ever say, "I will arise and go unto my
   Father," till first the Father's Grace, veiling itself in the
   afflicting Providence of a mighty famine, had taught the prodigal the
   miserable results of sin as he fed the swine and gladly would have
   filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat, but could not
   do so.

   I want you to notice another fact before I come to the subject now in
   hand, and that is that all those who are called are said to have been
   hired. Of course in a parable no word is to be construed harshly--we
   are to give the meaning according to the drift. But still, I think we
   may say that there is this likeness between hiring a servant and the
   engagement of a soul to Christ--a man hired has no right to serve
   another--he serves the master who has hired him. When a soul is called
   by Grace into the service of the Lord Jesus Christ, he cries, "O Lord,
   other lords have had dominion over me, but now You only will I serve."
   He plucks off the yoke of sin, its pleasure, its custom, and he puts
   upon him that yoke of which the Master says it is easy, and he bears
   that burden which Jesus tells us is light.

   A hired servant must not work for another--he works for his master. And
   so a man who is called by Grace lives not for any sinister object or
   motive, but to his Master only. A hired servant, again, does not work
   on his own account--he is not his own master. And, "you are not your
   own, you are bought with a price." Henceforth, though he calls no man
   "Master" on earth, yet he remembers that one is his Master in Heaven,
   to whom all his service is due. There is a compact between the hired
   man and his master and there is a solemn compact of spirit between the
   true Believer and his Lord. We have devoted ourselves to His service.
   We have given up all liberty of self-will, and therefore our will is at
   the government of our Lord and all our powers and passions are to be,
   we hope will be, through God's Grace, obedient to Him who has hired us
   into the vineyard.

   Now the word "hired" was used in order to bring in the idea of reward.
   It was used to suit Peter's view of the case. It was used in order that
   his legal question of, "What shall we have, therefore?" might be
   clearly brought out and its folly shown in the light of that Sovereign
   Grace which does as it wills with His own. Yet for all that, Believers
   are hired in an evangelical sense--they do not serve God for
   nothing--they shall not work without a reward. "The wages of sin is
   death, but the gift of God is eternal life." We shall have our reward
   for what we do for the Master and though it is not wages in the sense
   of debt, yet verily I say unto you there shall not be a single
   true-hearted worker for God who shall not receive of his Master most
   blessed wages of Grace in the day when He comes to take account of His
   servants.

   Now to the point--the master calls these hired servants of his at
   different hours of the day. And, in the second place, distinguishing
   Grace shines forth in each case and is illustrated and made more
   manifest in its varieties of glorious compassion and loving-kindness by
   the different hours at which the chosen ones are called.

   I. ALL ARE NOT CALLED BY GRACE AT THE SAME TIME. Some, according to the
   parable, are called early in the morning. Thrice happy are these! The
   earliest period at which a child may be called by Divine Grace would be
   difficult for us positively to define. Because children are not all the
   same age mentally, though their physical age may be the same, we dare
   not limit the Holy One of Israel as to the chosen period of operation.
   As far as our observation, Grace works upon some little ones at the
   very dawn of moral consciousness. There are, no doubt, precocious
   children whose intellect and affections are very much developed and
   very deeply sanctified even so early as two or three years of age.

   Such children usually are intended by the Master to be taken Home at
   once. There are interesting biographies extant, which prove that
   holiness may bloom and ripen in the youngest heart and many anecdotes
   are treasured up in such collections as "Janeway's Token for Children,"
   of children whom I might call infants with strict propriety, out of
   whose mouth God ordained praise and did, through them, quiet the enemy
   and the avenger.

   Little prattlers, whose tongues it would have been supposed could only
   have talked of toys, have been able to speak with an apparent
   profundity of knowledge of spiritual, and especially of heavenly
   things. It is certain that some have worked their day's work for the
   Master in their mother's arms. They have spoken of the Savior in tones
   which have melted a mother's heart and gone to a father's conscience
   and then they have been taken home. "Whom the gods love die young,"
   said the heathen, and doubtless it is no small privilege to be so soon
   admitted into Glory. Only shown on earth and then snatched away to
   Heaven--too precious to be left below!

   Precious child, how dear were you to the good God who sent you here and
   then took you Home! Fair rose bud, yet in the perfection of your young
   beauty taken to be worn by the Savior on His bosom! How can we mourn
   your translation to the skies?--

   "No bitter tears for you are shed,
   Blossom of being seen and gone!
   With flowers alone we strew your bed,
   O blest departed one!
   Whose all of life, a rosy ray,
   Blushed into da wn and passed away."

   "Early in the morning," would also include those who have passed the
   first hour of the day, but who have not yet wasted the second opening
   hour. I mean those hopeful lads and girls who, perhaps, would rather I
   should call them youths--those who have reached their teens--have
   overleaped infancy and childhood and are growing up in the heyday and
   vigor of youth. Youngsters still more at home in the playground than in
   the work field--fitter, as Satan tells them--to be sporting in the
   marketplace than busy in the vineyard. Such as these, to the praise of
   Divine love, are often hired by the landowner.

   It is worth while to warn some of our Brethren who seem to be
   exceedingly dubious of boyish and girlish piety--to warn them against
   indulging harsh and suspicious doubts. We have remarked, and I think
   those who have watched our membership carefully will have remarked it,
   too, that among all the slips and falls which have caused us sorrow, we
   have had but little sorrow from those who were added to us as boys and
   girls. There are those preaching the Gospel this day with acceptance
   and power whom these hands baptized into Jesus Christ very early in
   their boyhood, and there are among us honored servants of God who have
   served this Church well, who, while they were yet at school, were
   joyful followers of the Lord Jesus Christ!

   With our earliest intellects some of us got an understanding of the
   things of the Kingdom of God. Our Bible was our child's primer, our
   spelling book--the guide of our youth and the joy of our earliest
   years. We thank God that there are Timothys still among us and those
   not few and far between! And young Samuels, who, being brought as
   infants to the Lord's House, have from that day forth worn the linen
   ephod and served, after their fashion, as priests unto God, serving Him
   with all their hearts! Happy those who are called early in the morning!
   They have peculiar reasons for blessing and praising God--

   "Grace is a plant, wherever it grows, Of pure and heavenly root. But
   fairest in the youngest shows, And yields the sweetest fruit."

   Let us spend a minute in thinking of their happy case who are saved in
   boyhood. Early in the morning the dew still twinkles on the leaves, the
   maiden blush of dawn remains and reveals an opening beauty which is
   lost to those who rise not to see the birth of day. There is a beauty
   about early piety which is indescribably charming and unutterably
   lovely in freshness and radiance. We remark in childhood an artless
   simplicity, a child-like confidence which is seen nowhere else. There
   may be less of knowing, but there is more of loving. There may be less
   of reasoning, but there is more of simply believing upon the authority
   of Revelation. There may be less of deep-rootedness, but there is
   certainly more of perfume, beauty and emerald verdure!

   If I must choose that part of the Christian life in which there is the
   most joy, next to the land Beulah, which I must set first and foremost
   by reason of its lying so near to Canaan, I think I would prefer that
   tract of Christian experience which lies toward the rising sun which is
   sown with orient pearls of love and cheered with the delicious music of
   the birds of hope. Early in the morning, when we have just risen from
   slumber, work is easy. Our occupation in the vineyard is a cheerful
   exercise rather than a toil such as those find who bear the burden and
   heat of the day. The young Christian is not oppressed with the cares
   and troubles of the world as others are--he has nothing else to do but
   to serve his God.

   He is free from the embarrassments which surround so many of us and
   prevent our doing good when we would consecrate ourselves wholly to it.
   The lad has nothing to think of but his Lord. There are his books and
   his lessons, but he can be fervent of spirit in the midst of them.
   There are the companions of his childhood, but in guilelessness and
   simplicity he may be of service to them and to God through them. Give
   me, I say, if I would have an auspicious time to work for Jesus--give
   me the blessed morning hours when my heart is bounding lightest and
   joy's pure sunbeams tremble on my path--when my glowing breast lacks no
   ardor and my happy spirit wears no chain of care!

   One would prefer early conversion because such persons have not learned
   to stand idle in the marketplace. A fellow, you know, who has been for
   hours standing with his hands in his pockets, talking with drunken men
   and so on, is not worth much at the eleventh hour! No, even by the
   middle of the day it has become so natural to him to prop the walls
   that he is not likely to take to work very readily. Begin early with
   your souls! Break in the colts while they are young and they are likely
   to take well to the collar. There are no workers like those who
   commenced work while they were yet children.

   What a promise of a long day there is for young Believers! The sun has
   just risen and he has to travel to his zenith and to descend again.
   There is ample room and time enough, though none to spare. If God, in
   His Providence, permits it so to happen, that youngster yonder has
   twelve hours' work before him--what may he not accomplish? For a grand
   and glorious life, early piety, if not essential, is certainly a very
   great advantage! To give those first days to Jesus will spare us many
   sad regrets, prevent us acquiring many evil habits, and enable us to
   achieve good success through the Holy Spirit's blessing. It is well to
   begin to fly while yet the wings are strong, for if we live long in sin
   the wings may be broken and then they will flap wearily through the
   rest of our days, even when Divine Grace shall call us.

   Let it be the desire of parents here to have their children converted
   as children! And oh, may God cast that desire into the hearts of some
   of you young people that are here this morning--that before you reach
   one-and-twenty, before you are called men--you may be perfect men in
   Christ Jesus--that while you are yet children you may be children of
   God! May you, as "newborn babes, receive the sincere milk of the Word,"
   and the Lord grant that you may "grow thereby." Happy, happy, happy
   souls, whom the Master, thus by distinguishing Grace, brings "early in
   the morning!"

   The landowner went out again at the third hour. This may represent the
   period in which we have mounted above being children and youths and are
   entitled to be called men. Suppose we settle the first hour as
   extending over the earliest seven or eight years of age? Then the
   second hour runs on from that to twenty-one or thereabouts. And then we
   have a good length of time between twenty and thirty and onwards to
   reckon as the third and fourth and fifth hours. There are some whom
   Divine Grace renews at the third hour. This is late! One-and-twenty is
   grievously late, when you consider how much of early joy is now
   impossible--how much of sinful habit has now been acquired--how many
   opportunities for usefulness are now gone past recall.

   A quarter of the day has flown away forever when we reach the third
   hour. It is the best quarter of the day, too, that has gone past
   recall. The first meal of the day is over--that blessed breaking of the
   fast with Christ is no more possible. A very precious meal is that,
   when the Savior gives us the morning portion, the manna which melts
   when the sun is up. Blessed is the child's feeding upon Jesus--truly, I
   remember when I was awakened like Elijah from under the juniper tree
   and fed on such dainty fare that to this day the flavor abides with me!
   The man of one-and-twenty has lost that first meal, breakfast is all
   over. Christ will say to him as He will to some others, "Come and
   dine," and that is precious--but the daintiest meal is over, the first
   early enjoyment--the first early rapture can never be known.

   I have no doubt there are many here who think that to be converted at
   one-and-twenty is very soon--but why one-and-twenty years given to
   Satan? Why a fourth of man's existence devoted to evil? Besides, it may
   not be a fourth--it may be one half--no, in how many cases it is the
   whole of life! The sun goes down before it is yet noon and the idler in
   the marketplace has no hope of ever being a worker in the vineyard!
   Death, who comes when God wills, and gives us no notice, may cut down
   the flower before it has fully opened.

   "In the morning it is like grass that grows up, in the evening it is
   cut down and withers." It is late, it is sadly late! It is a sad thing
   to have lost those bright days in which the mind was least engaged, in
   which it was the most susceptible of forming godly habits. It is a sad
   thing to have learned so much of sin as one may have learned by
   one-and-twenty! It is a sad thing to have seen so much of iniquity, to
   have treasured up in one's memory so much defilement. Twenty years with
   God--one might have been in such a time a good scholar in the kingdom!
   But twenty years in the world one begins to be like scarlet that has
   been lying in the dye till it is stained through and through. It is
   late, but we thank God that it is not too late. No, it is not too late
   even for the grandest of purposes.

   Not only is this period of life not too late for salvation, but it is
   not too late to do much for Jesus Christ! Some of us, when we were
   one-and-twenty, had finished five years of Christian ministry and had
   been the means of bringing many souls to the Cross of Christ. But if
   others are led by Grace to begin then, why there is a good period still
   remaining if God, in Providence, spares our lives. The young man is now
   in all his strength and vigor, his bones are full of marrow and his
   heart is full of fire. We ought to have acquired a good degree of
   education and be prepared to acquire more. Now he is just in the time
   when he should work.

   His plans of life are not settled as yet. He is probably not married.
   As yet there are no children about him to have been injured by his ill
   example. He has an opportunity of rearing up a household in the fear of
   God. He is commencing business. He has an opportunity of so conducting
   that business that there may never need to be a time when he shall have
   to tack about and steer another course. He may, if called by God's
   Grace at twenty-one, begin an honorable career in which there needs not
   be an angle or a curve. He may go straight to the harbor's mouth! He
   may steer and mark upon the sea of life one shining furrow which shall
   reach in a direct line, from the present moment, straight to the lights
   of Heaven! He may reach it with his sail full and a priceless cargo on
   board to the praise of the glory of Divine Grace! It is late--it is
   very late in some respects--but oh, it is not too late to serve the
   Master well and to win a crown of great reward, the gift of Divine
   love.

   There is abundance of work to do for us who are in this third, fourth,
   and fifth hour of the day. In fact, I suppose the Church must look to
   us for its most active work. After this period and the next, a man
   frequently becomes rather a recipient from the Church than a donor to
   it in the matter of activity. Its fresh blood, its energy, its warmth
   of heart, its ready action, must, to a great extent, come from the
   young men who are converted. Oh, you of twenty-one, I would to God that
   you were all born from Heaven! You maidens, in your early beauty--may
   the Master in His infinite mercy bring you in! Oh, could you know the
   sweetness of His love you would not need persuading! Could you
   understand the joy of true religion you would not want entreating!
   There is more hallowed mirth enjoyed in secret with the Lord Jesus
   Christ than in all the merriment the world can yield.

   One ounce of Christ's love is better than a ton of the world's
   flatteries. The world offers bubbles with fair hues, bright to look
   upon, but vanishing at a breath. But Christ gives real treasure,
   enduring as eternity. The world's gold is all base money--it glitters,
   but it is not precious. There may be less glitter about the things of
   God, but there is a "solid joy and lasting pleasure," which, "none but
   Zion's children know." May the Master come this morning to your hearts
   and by my simple words may He call you at the third hour of the day
   into the vineyard!

   The landowner's kindness was not exhausted, and therefore he went out
   at the sixth hour. We find him going into the market at high noon. Half
   the day was over. Who is going to employ a man and give him a whole
   day's wages when twelve o'clock has come? He will not do too much if
   you hire him at six--what will he do if you engage him at twelve? Half
   a day's work! That is a poor thing to seek or to offer. The Master,
   however, seeks and accepts it. He promises, "Whatever is right, I will
   give you." And there are some found who at the sixth hour enter into
   the vineyard and, being saved by Grace, begin their work for Jesus.

   This may represent the period of life in which man is supposed to be in
   his prime--when he is past forty and onward. This is sadly late, very
   sadly late. Sadly late in a great many respects--not only because there
   is so little time left, but because so very much of energy and zeal and
   force--which should have been given to God, has been wasted. It has, to
   some extent, been used to fight against God. Forty years of hardness of
   heart! That is a long time for Divine patience. Forty years of sin!
   That is a long season for conscience to mourn over. "Forty years long
   was I grieved with this generation," said God. In the wilderness they
   hardened their hearts all that time. And He swore in His wrath that
   they should not enter into His rest.

   What a blessing for you of forty and unconverted, that He has not sworn
   so terrible an oath concerning you--that still His long-suffering
   lingers, still His patience bears with you, still does He say to
   you--"Go, work, My son. Go work this day in My vineyard." It is sadly
   late, because it has become more than natural to you to walk in the way
   of sin. You will have so much to contend with in the future as the
   result of the past. Putting the ship of the soul about is not such easy
   work as turning a vessel by her helm--only a Divine hand can steer a
   soul upon the tack of Divine Grace. You will need much Grace to conquer
   those corruptions which have had forty years to take root in you! You
   have a tenant in your house who is in possession, and you will find
   that possession to be nine points of the law--it will be a hard
   ejectment for you to effect--so hard, indeed, that only a "stronger
   than he" can cast him out.

   To your dying day the recollection of evil things which you heard
   during these forty years of unregeneracy will stick to you. You will
   hear the echoes of an old song just when you are trying to pray. Some
   deed which you regret and mourn over will come to check you just when
   you are about to say, "Abba, Father," with an unstammering tongue. It
   is late, it is very, very late, this sixth hour, but it is not too
   late! It is not too late for some of the richest enjoyments--you can
   yet dine with Jesus! He can yet manifest Himself to you as He does not
   to the world. You may have yet much time to serve Him.

   It is not too late to be distinguished among His servants. Take John
   Newton--he was called in the middle of the day, but John Newton left
   his mark in God's vineyard--a mark that will never be forgotten! I
   suppose Paul could not have been much less than of that age when he was
   called by Sovereign Grace. No, the most of the Apostles were probably
   very little short of this age when Mercy met with them--still they did
   a glorious day's work. If saved by Grace in middle life, my Brother,
   you must work harder! You must let the time past suffice you to have
   worked the will of the flesh and now you must redeem the time, because
   the days are evil. Why, a man converted at forty should go double quick
   march to Heaven--there should not be a moment lost!

   Work the engine at high pressure and give two strokes for every one
   that might be given by younger men and younger minds. Seek, in Divine
   strength, to do twice as much in the time, since you have only half the
   time to do a life's work. I know you wish to win crowns for Christ.
   Then be up and doing, Beloved. You are saved by Grace and by Grace
   alone. You pant to honor Christ because of His free love to you--cannot
   you endeavor to honor Him as much in the remnant which remains as
   others do in the whole length of their life? You may, by zeal and
   prudence, and discretion and perfect consecration yet serve the Master
   well.

   The landowner went out at the ninth hour, at three o'clock in the
   afternoon. Nobody thinks of engaging day-laborers at three o'clock in
   the afternoon! A day's work to be done from three till six! It shows
   you that this Gospel hiring is nothing like a legal hiring--it must be
   all of Grace--or a man would not think of doing such a thing. Well now,
   three o'clock in the afternoon, that is from sixty to seventy. The
   prime of life has gone. It is late, it is sadly late, very sadly late.
   It is late because all the powers of the man are now weak. His memory
   begins to fail. He thinks his judgment better than ever it was, but
   probably that is only his own opinion. Most of the faculties lose their
   edge in old age. He has acquired experience, but still there is no fool
   like an old fool.

   A man who has not been taught by Divine Grace learns very little of any
   value in the school of Providence. Sixty thousand years would not make
   a man wise if Divine Grace did not teach him. Now think of it, is it
   not late? Here is the man--if he is converted now--what is there left
   of him? He is just a candle end. He may give a little light, but it is
   almost like a snuff burning in the socket. All those sixty years,
   seventy years--have been spent--where? Cover it all up. Let us go
   backward as Noah's sons did and cover it all up. And oh, may almighty
   Grace cover it, too! The fact is terribly appalling--sixty, seventy
   years spent in the service of Satan! Oh what good the man might have
   done! Had he but served his God as he served the world, what good he
   might have done!

   He has made a fortune, has he? How rich he might have been in faith by
   this time. He has built a house! Yes, but how he might have helped to
   build the Church. The man has been playing at card-houses. He has been
   like boys by the seashore building castles of sand which must all come
   down, and must come down very soon, too, for I hear the surges of the
   dread tide of Death--it is rolling in even now! Those teeth which have
   fallen out, those pains and rheumatics and so on, all show that this is
   not his rest. The tabernacle is beginning to crumble about the man and
   the warning is loud which reminds him that he must soon be gone and
   leave his wealth and his house!

   And so, if this is all, in the end it will turn out that he has done
   nothing--he has piled up shadows, heaped together thick clay and that
   is all he has done--when he might, if he had believed in Jesus, have
   done so much for God and for the souls of men! What evil habits he has
   acquired! What can you ever make of this man? If he is saved, it will
   be so as by fire. He is called and he shall enter Heaven, but oh, how
   little can he do for the Master, and what strong corruptions will he
   have to wrestle with, and what an inward conflict even till he gets to
   Heaven! It is late, it is very late, but oh, blessed be God! It is not
   too late!

   We have had within these walls persons who have long passed the prime
   of their days who have come forward and said, "We will cast in our lot
   with you because the Lord is with you." We have heard their joyous
   story of how the old man has become a babe, and how he that was hoary
   with years has been born again into the kingdom of Christ! It is not
   too late! Did the devil say so? The gate is shutting--I can hear it
   grating on the hinges--but it is not shut! The sun is going down, but
   he is not lost beneath the horizon yet. And if the Master calls you,
   only run faster because it is so! And when you are saved, serve Him
   with all your might amid strength because you have so little time to
   glorify Him here on earth and short space in which to show your sense
   of deep indebtedness to His surpassing love.

   The day is nearly over, it has come to the eleventh hour, five o'clock!
   The men have been looking at their watches to see whether it will not
   soon be six. They are longing to hear the clock strike. They hope the
   day's work will soon close. Look! The landlord goes out into the
   marketplace among those hulking fellows who are still loitering there
   and he pitches upon some and asks them, "Why have you been standing
   here idle all day? Go and work! And whatever is right I will give you."

   At the eleventh hour they come in--half-ashamed to come--hardly liking
   the others to see them. They are ashamed to begin work so late. Still
   they did steal in somewhere. And there were generous laborers who
   looked over the tops of the vines and said to them, "Glad to see you,
   Friends! Glad to see you, however late." There were a few, I dare say,
   among the laborers, at least there are if this is the vineyard, who
   would even stop their work and begin to sing and praise God to think
   that their fellows had been brought in at the eleventh hour! Now the
   eleventh hour must be looked upon as any period of life which is past
   threescore years and ten--how late it may extend I cannot tell.

   There is an authentic instance of a man converted to God at the age of
   a hundred and four, during the last Irish revival, who walked some
   distance to make a confession of his faith in Jesus Christ. And I
   recollect a case of one converted in America by a sermon which he had
   heard, I think, eighty-one years previously! He was fifteen when he
   heard Mr. Flavell at the end of a discourse, instead of pronouncing the
   blessing, say, "I cannot bless you. How can I bless those who do not
   love the Lord Jesus Christ? 'If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ
   let him be Anathema Maranatha.' " And eighty-one years or more
   afterwards that solemn sentence came to the man's recollection when he
   was living in America and God blessed it to his conversion!

   There have been some to whom the eleventh hour has been the very hour
   of death. Some, I say, but how many or how few is not for me to know.
   There is one instance we know in Scripture, it was the dying thief.
   There is but one. God, however, in His abundant mercy can do as He
   wills to the praise of the glory of His Grace and at the eleventh hour
   He can call His chosen. It is very late, it is very very, very late, it
   is sorrowfully late, it is dolefully late--but it is not too late-- and
   if the Master calls you, come! Though an hundred years of sin should
   make your feet heavy so that your steps are painfully limping--if He
   calls you it is late but not too late, and therefore come!

   Have you ever thought of how the thief worked for his Lord? It was not
   a fine place for working, hanging on a cross, dying, just at the
   eleventh hour. But he did a deal of work in the few minutes. Observe
   what he did. First, he confessed Christ--he acknowledged Him to be
   Lord, confessed Him before men. In the second place, he justified
   Christ--"This Man has done nothing amiss." In the next place he
   worshipped the Lord Jesus, calling Him, "Lord." He even began to
   preach, for he rebuked his fellow sinner! He told him that he should
   not revile One who was so unrighteously condemned. He offered a
   petition which has become a very model of prayer--"Lord, remember me
   when You come into Your kingdom."

   At any rate, I wish I could say of myself what I can say of the
   thief--he did all he could. I cannot say that of myself. I am afraid I
   cannot say it of any of you. I do not know anything the thief could
   have done on the cross which he did not do. As soon as ever he was
   called, he seems to have worked in the vineyard to the utmost extent of
   his ability. And so let me say to you, if you should be called at the
   eleventh hour, my dear Hearer, though you are well-stricken in years
   and aged, yet for Jesus Christ's sake out of great love for all the
   great things which He has done for you, go your way and praise Him with
   all your might!

   II. My time has gone and I wanted to have shown that DISTINGUISHING
   GRACE SHONE RESPLENDENTLY IN EVERY INSTANCE. Those called in the early
   morning have delightful reason for admiring Sovereign Grace, for they
   are spared the ills and sins of life. I must content myself, however,
   by repeating concerning them the lines of Ralph Erskine--

   "In hea venly choirs a question rose,
   That stirred-up strife will never close--
   What rank of all the ransomed race,
   Owes highest praise to Sovereign Grace?
   Babes there caught from womb and breast,
   Claimed right to sing above the rest;
   Because they found the happy shore,
   They never saw nor sought before."

   What distinguishing Grace is that which called us when we were young!
   Here is electing love! "When Ephraim was a child, then I loved him and
   called My son out of Egypt." Some of us, in time and in eternity, will
   have to utter a special song of thankfulness to the love which took us
   in our days of folly and simplicity and conducted us into the family of
   God. It was not because we were better disposed children than others,
   or because there was naturally anything good about us--we were willful,
   heady and high-minded, proud, wayward and disobedient as other children
   are--and yet Mercy separated us from the rest and we shall never cease
   to adore its sovereignty!

   Look at the Grace which calls the man at the age of twenty, when the
   passions are hot, when there is strong temptation to plunge into the
   vices and the so-called pleasures of life. To be delivered from the
   charms of sin when the world's cheek is ruddy, when it wears its best
   attire and to be taught to prefer the reproach of Christ to all the
   riches of Egypt--this is mighty Grace for which God shall have our
   sweetest song!

   To be called of the Lord at forty, in the prime of life! This is a
   wonderful instance of Divine power for worldliness is hard to overcome
   and worldliness is the sin of middle age. With a family about you, with
   much business, with the world eating into you as does a canker, it is a
   wonder that God should, in His mercy, have visited you then and made
   you a regenerate soul! You are a miracle of Divine Grace and you will
   have to feel it and to praise God for it in time and eternity!

   Sixty, again. "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his
   spots? If so, then you who are accustomed to do evil may learn to do
   well." And yet you have learned--you have had a blessed Schoolmaster
   who sweetly taught you and you have learned to do well. Though your
   vessel had begun to rot in the waters of the Black Sea of sin, you have
   got a new Owner and you will run up a new flag and you will sail round
   the Cape of Good Hope to the islands of the Blessed, in the Land of the
   Hereafter!

   But what shall I say of you that are called when you are aged? Ah, you
   will have to love much, for you have had much forgiven. I do not know
   that you may be in thankfulness a whit behind those of us who are
   called in our early youth. We have much to bless God for and so have
   you. We are at one extreme and you are at the other. We would love much
   because we have been spared much sinning and you must love much because
   you have been delivered from much sinning. Not to go through the fire
   is a theme for song--but to traverse the flame and not be burned!--to
   walk the furnace and to be delivered from its vehement fire! Oh, how
   you should find words with which to express your gratitude!

   Called early or called late. Called at midday or called at early noon,
   let us together, since we have been called by Grace alone, ascribe it
   all to the Lord Jesus! And moved by the mighty constraints of His love,
   let us work with body, soul and spirit--work for Him till we can work
   no longer--and then praise Him in the rest of Glory! I pray you,
   Brethren, suffer no idleness to creep over you. If you have sought to
   extend the Redeemer's kingdom, do it more. Give more, talk more of
   Christ, pray more, labor more!

   I often receive the kind advice, "Do less." I cannot do less. Do less?
   Why, better rot altogether than live the inglorious life of doing less
   than our utmost for God! We shall, none of us, I am afraid, kill
   ourselves with working too hard for Jesus--it were such a blessed act
   of suicide that if there is a sin that is venial, it would certainly be
   that! I am not afraid that you are likely to perpetrate such an
   enormity! Work for the Master! Labor for the Master! We must spend and
   be spent, and wear ourselves out for Him! Make no reserve for the flesh
   to fulfill the lusts of it! And oh, how happy shall we be if we may be
   privileged to finish the work and hear Him say, "Well done, good and
   faithful servant, enter into the joy of your Lord."

   May the Lord bless you for Christ's sake. Amen.

                           Open House For All Comers

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 17, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "This Man receives sinners and eats with them." Luke 15:2.

   IT is not very unusual that the Pharisees could not understand the
   Savior's mode of action--not only because self-righteousness and
   bigotry had blinded their eyes and callousness of heart to the interest
   of others and had bound them up in the darkness of
   self-righteousness--but also because the Savior's mode of acting was
   contrary to the general current of the dispensation to which the
   Pharisee had been accustomed. The dispensation of the old Covenant was
   that of distance. When God appeared to His servant Moses, it was, "Draw
   not near here: put off your shoes from off your feet." And when He
   manifested Himself upon Mount Sinai to His own chosen and separated
   people, one of the first commands was, "You shall set bounds about the
   mount and if so much as a beast touches the mountain it shall be stoned
   or thrust through with a dart."

   In the sacred worship of the tabernacle and the temple the thought of
   distance must always have been prominent to the devout mind. The mass
   of the people did not even enter the outer court. Into the inner court
   none but the priests could ever dare to come. And into the innermost
   place, or the holy of holies, once a year one person only ever entered!
   A thick costly veil hung before the manifestation of Jehovah's Presence
   and upon the Shekinah no mortal eye ever gazed, except that eye which,
   once a year, alone, dared to look upon its splendor through the mist of
   the smoking incense when the blood of atonement was sprinkled on the
   Mercy Seat.

   The Lord seemed ever to be saying to the whole of His people, with but
   a few exceptions, "Come not near here." It was the dispensation of
   distance--as if the Lord in those early ages would teach man that sin
   was so utterly loathsome to Him that He must treat men as lepers put
   outside the camp. And when He came nearest to them, yet He made them
   feel the width of the separation between a holy God and the impure
   sinner.

   But Jesus Christ came on quite another footing. The word, "Go," was now
   exchanged for, "Come," and distance was made to give place to nearness!
   Partitions were broken down, middle walls of separation became like
   tottering fences, and we, who sometime were afar off, were made near by
   the blood of Jesus Christ. Therefore, Incarnate Deity has no wall of
   fire about it. Christ was surrounded with that Divinity which does
   hedge about a king, but it was only as a hedge of thorns to Himself and
   not as a hedge of briars to keep off the approach of the mean of
   mankind.

   "Come unto Me all you that labor and are heavy laden and I will give
   you rest"--that is the joyful proclamation of God as He appears in
   human flesh! Not now does He teach the leper his leprosy by setting him
   at a distance, but by suffering the penalty of man's defilement. Not
   now does He teach man that the disease is naturally incurable--He now
   shows him the heavenly cure by revealing the fact that God, without
   sullying His purity, can come into contact with impurity in order to
   its removal and without receiving contagion from the arch-leper. The
   devil can grapple with Him in the human heart--He can lay hold upon His
   adversary that He may bind him hand and foot and cast him away from
   men--no more to oppress our race!

   Jesus ushered in the dispensation of nearness, which, as you all know
   is to be followed by one of greater nearness still, for, as God is very
   near to us spiritually, the day draws near--oh, hasten it, good
   Lord!--when the angels shall sing, "The tabernacle of God is with men
   and He does dwell among them!" We shall need no temple in which Deity
   can be enshrined, for the Lord God and the Lamb shall be the Temple of
   universal manhood and we shall see Him face to face and days of
   distance and of mourning shall be ended.

   I do not wonder then that Pharisees, who had drunk very deep into the
   separating spirit of the Law, should have been perfectly astounded that
   a Person claiming to be the Messiah and professing to be that Adonai
   who sits at the right hand of Jehovah till His enemies are made His
   footstool--should, as they thought--act so inconsistently with His own
   professions and allow constantly a mob of the dross and scum and raff
   of the population to be associated with Him! They therefore said, "This
   Man receives sinners," and worse still, He breaks through all rules of
   caste and all degrees of separateness and makes Himself so familiar
   that He actually eats with them!

   Now, this fact, which so startled them, has become very familiar to
   those of us who have been received and have eaten with Him. But still,
   the sinner, trembling under a sense of sin, feels the spirit of the old
   Law like a black cloud hovering over him and he can hardly venture to
   believe, much less to understand in all its richness of mercy, that
   Jesus still receives sinners! He fosters the notion that Jesus will
   look for some good thing in him and demand at least some redeeming
   trait in character, some act of penitence, some holy resolution,
   something or other which may mitigate guilt and conciliate regard. But
   the abstract truth that this Man receives sinners as such and eats with
   them needs to be proclaimed again and again and again--that the ears of
   unbelieving, mistrustful men may at last receive it--and that their
   hearts may feel its power!

   May God the Holy Spirit bless our attempt this morning and His shall be
   the praise. Now, first of all, Jesus receiving sinners. And secondly,
   Jesus eating with them.

   I. First, then, JESUS RECEIVING SINNERS. This was and is a great
   fact--our Lord received and still receives sinners! He permits them to
   form a part of His congregation and even to draw near to hear Him. A
   philosopher wrote over the door of his academy, "He that is not
   learned, let him not enter here." But Jesus speaks by Wisdom in the
   Proverbs and says, "Whoever is simple, let him turn in here: as for him
   that lacks understanding, let him eat of My bread and drink of the wine
   which I have mingled" (Prov. 9:4, 5).

   He bids the simple come and learn at His feet. Moral teachers have
   always been choice in the selection of their followers and have thought
   it a degradation and a casting of pearls before swine to throw their
   useful maxims, their invaluable dogmas as they dream them to be, before
   the vulgar herd, the sinful crowd. But this Man receives sinners!
   Whatever other men may do, this Man, this One, this One alone, if no
   other with Him--this One beyond all other teachers, however gentle and
   compassionate--this Man receives sinners! He will speak and tell of His
   mysteries, too, even when sinful ears are listening, for He receives
   sinners as His disciples, as well as His hearers.

   If they come casually into the throng, His eyes glance upon them and He
   has a word of gentle rebuke and wooing love. But if they will come and
   join the class who cluster constantly about Him, they shall be
   thoroughly welcome and the deeper and higher Truths reserved for
   disciples shall be revealed to them, and they shall know the mystery of
   the kingdom! When He has cleansed sinners, He receives them not only as
   disciples, but as companions. This Man permits the guilty, the once
   profane, the lately debauched and formerly dissolute, to associate
   themselves with Him--to wear His name, to sit in His house--to be
   written in the same Book of Life with Himself!

   He makes them here partakers with Him in His affliction, and hereafter
   they shall be partakers with Him in His Glory. This Man receives
   pardoned sinners into companionship. No, more, He receives them into
   friendship. The head that leaned upon His bosom was a sinner's head,
   and those who sat at the table with Him, to whom He said, "Henceforth I
   call you not servants, but Friends," were all of them, sinners, as they
   felt themselves to be. She who bore Him. She who ministered to Him of
   her substance. She who washed His feet with tears. She who was first at
   His empty sepulcher--all these were sinners and some of them
   emphatically sinners!

   Into His heart's love He receives sinners, takes them from the dunghill
   and wears them as jewels in His crown. He plucks them as brands from
   the burning and preserves them as precious monuments of His mercy. And
   none are so precious in His sight as the sinners for whom He died. When
   Jesus receives sinners, He has not some outside reception place where
   He charitably entertains them for a time, as great men may do passing
   beggars. No! He opens the big golden gates of His own heart and He
   takes the sinner right into Himself--yes, He admits the sinner into
   personal union with Himself and makes the sinner a member of His
   body--of His flesh and of His bones. There was never such a reception
   as this! This fact is still the same--He is still receiving sinners!

   This fact must not excite your unbelief because of its strangeness. I
   know the world, sinful as it is, does not receive sinners. When her
   character is gone, the fallen woman is pointed at in the streets and no
   decent society will entertain her. But this Man receives harlots when
   their good name and fame has long since become a thing of the past.
   When the man has played the rogue and the prison has confined him,
   there are few among his fellows who will speak with or own him. But
   this Man receives thieves! A dying thief went with Him into Paradise!
   Some men who run well for a season, who suddenly fall from their high
   estate, are banished and excluded, proscribed and shut out. And I
   suppose, while society is what it is, this must always be the case.

   In Christ's Church discipline requires that the offender should be put
   forth from us. It is painful, but it must be done. But there is no
   "must" of this sort pressing with dire necessity upon the tender heart
   of the Savior! He can receive without pollution--yes, even receive into
   His heart without injury to His purity. "This Man receives sinners."
   Contrary to the maxims and customs and ways of the world, Jesus keeps
   open house for outcasts! When all other doors are shut, this Man's door
   is open. When everyone else has bid you go your way as an unclean
   thing, not fit to be looked upon, this Man still stands crying, "Come
   unto Me! Come unto Me and I will give you rest!"

   Blessed fact! May you prove its truthfulness, dear Friends, by going to
   Jesus yourself, even though you are in the worst sense a sinner. "This
   man receives sinners"--not, however, that they may remain sinners, but
   to pardon their sins, to justify their persons, to cleanse their hearts
   by the Holy Spirit--to preserve their souls by the indwelling of the
   Holy Spirit, to lead them on from strength to strength, to enable them
   to serve Him and to show forth His praise, to have communion with Him
   and to enjoy His love. "This Man receives sinners," at last, to reign
   with Him in Glory everlasting when the world and sin shall have passed
   away. Thus much we have noticed with regard to the fact. O blessed
   Spirit, give poor troubled consciences power to rest in this sweet
   Truth!

   I want your attention to another thought, namely, the consistency of
   this fact. It is a most consistent and proper thing that this Man
   should receive sinners. If the Pharisees had not been rendered useless
   by their prejudice and would have considered the matter a little while,
   they might have thought so, too. Consider His Person--who was this Man?
   He claimed to be, and even they, themselves, must have acknowledged Him
   to have been by descent, the Son of David. It was most natural that the
   Son of David should receive sinners! It is what David did--you expect
   to see the Son of David doing what His father did before Him.

   Do you not remember when David fled to the hold, in the cave of
   Adullam, that it is written, "Everyone that was in distress and
   everyone that was in debt and everyone that was discontented gathered
   themselves unto him and he became a captain unto them"? The very first
   band of men that ever served under David were most disreputable
   characters in the eye of Saul and his government. They had escaped from
   their country partly impoverished through the tyrannical conduct of
   Saul, and probably being knee-deep in treason against him, they escaped
   to put themselves under the leadership of that captain of bandits
   called David. It seemed but natural that the Son of David should
   receive just such a company when He began to establish His spiritual
   monarchy.

   The New Jerusalem is founded upon Christ Jesus who is pure and perfect,
   but its first stones are hewn out of the quarries of sin. Our Lord
   Jesus, like Solomon, builds the temple of the Church, but the materials
   come from among those Tyrian sinners who are strangers and aliens by
   birth. The Savior takes, as His father, David, did before Him,
   discontented bankrupts and distressed traitors that they may make up
   His band. If they had thought of that circumstance, they might have
   seen that it was not quite so strange that the Son of David received
   sinners! If you and I reflect awhile, we shall remember that the types
   which were set forth concerning Christ all seem to teach us that He
   must receive sinners.

   One of the earliest types of the Savior was Noah's ark, by which a
   certain company, not only of men, but also of the lowest animals, were
   preserved from perishing by water and were floated out of the old world
   into the new. See, going up the hill on which the ark is built, not
   only the fleet gazelle, the timid sheep, the patient ox, the noble
   horse, the generous dog and the fair creatures that you would wish to
   spare--but here comes the lion, his jaws all stained with blood! Here
   is the fierce tiger and the wild hyena, the filthy swine and the stupid
   ass--creatures of all kinds come here and find shelter!

   Who complains? I hear no voice lifting up its veto and crying, "There
   is no room for the swine here. There is no room for the fierce tiger
   here." The ark was ordained on purpose to save some of every kind. And
   just so, our Savior, Jesus, receives all sorts of people into Himself.
   It is no marvel if this Man receives sinners! Fly here, you loving and
   tender doves! Come here, you sweet birds of purest song! But ho, you
   ravens, eagles, vultures, and birds of evil name, you hurry here, also,
   for the Ark receives all who come!

   A very prominent type under the Levitical dispensation was the City of
   Refuge. If a man had slain another, he fled from the pursuer of blood
   with hot haste and swift foot. And he ran at once into the City of
   Refuge and the gates were shut and he was preserved. Now, Brethren, you
   would not have thought it a strange thing if you had seen a man-slayer
   flying to the city! You would have thought it far more singular if any
   came there but man-slayers! "Why," you say, "this city has been set up
   and ordained on purpose that men who have been men-slayers might find
   refuge within its walls, and therefore it is natural to find the
   red-handed man come fleeing here."

   Beloved, Jesus Christ is the City of Refuge! Who should fly to Him but
   the sinner wanting refuge? And who should need shelter but those
   requiring sanctuary from the avenger of blood? When you see the guilty
   hastening to Jesus, you say, "It is in keeping with the type, and it is
   no marvel whatever that He receives them." The scapegoat, again, was a
   very manifest type of the Messiah. They laid the sins of the people
   upon the scapegoat's head and then it took all their iniquities away
   into the wilderness. Now, suppose some objecting critic had said, "This
   goat which is set apart in the worship of God actually bears sins upon
   its head and here are sinful people coming to put their sins there."
   Who else should come? What was the meaning of the scapegoat, if there
   were no sin among the people of Israel? Come here today, not you
   righteous--for you need no scapegoat--but you sinful ones!

   Here is the Sin-Bearer in type before you, set apart to bear the
   iniquity of the people. He is about to be driven into the wilderness to
   take sin away! Come here and put your sins upon him, for unless you
   come, the ceremony will have no meaning whatever! Look through any of
   the types, and with very few exceptions, the thought of sin is
   prominent and the doctrine that Christ is to come into the world to
   save sinners is clearly written upon the front of the whole set of
   types of the Old Testament.

   Let us remark again that the metaphors which Christ has used to set
   Himself forth, many, if not all of them, imply that He receives
   sinners. What is written concerning Him? "There shall be a fountain
   opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for
   sin and for uncleanness." In our hymns, over and over and over again we
   delight to sing--

   "There is a fountain filled with blood"

   and yet again,

   "The fountain of Christ, Lord help us to sing."

   Now what is the fountain for but for the cleansing of the filthy?
   Cleanse the already clean? Absurd! Why do they need it? If they are
   already pure, why do they need to wash? But the fact that there is
   provision made for great washing implies great filthiness and that the
   fountain is furnished with a purifying element of wondrous power,
   namely, precious blood, seems to indicate that it was meant for great
   sin, unheard-of sin--sin which to the uttermost has polluted and
   defiled the frame of manhood.

   The Savior also describes Himself as a feast in many of His parables. A
   great king makes a supper, and oxen and fatlings are killed. Now for
   whom is a feast prepared but for the hungry? In the parables the feast
   is set not merely for hungry persons, but the blind, the halt and the
   lame are called and compelled to enter. The Savior would not have
   delighted to set Himself forth as waters except for the sake of thirsty
   ones, or as meat, had there been no famishing souls. "Ho, everyone that
   thirsts," He says, "come to the waters. And he that has no money, let
   him come buy wine and milk, without money and without price." Why all
   this to persons who have no needs? Sinners are those who have these
   needs, these hunger and thirst. And they are bid to come to Christ as
   the Gospel Feast!

   Moreover, the Master has been pleased to take to Himself one or two
   titles which imply that He came to receive sinners. He takes the title
   of Physician, but as He told these very Pharisees a little while
   before, "The whole have no need of a physician, but they that are
   sick." There is no practice for the physician in a neighborhood where
   every man is well. There must be sickness to involve the necessity for
   a physician. Why his art? Why his skill in pharmacy if men are safe and
   sound without it? And why Christ the Savior--the Pardoner--if none to
   save or forgive? There is no supererogation in the Bible, nothing
   superfluous--why Christ a Physician, unless for the sick? He styles
   Himself very frequently the Redeemer, and saints in the olden times
   delighted to speak of Him as their Redeemer.

   But a Redeemer for whom? Who wants redeeming but a slave? Who needs to
   be purchased into liberty but the man who is in hopeless bondage and
   cannot free himself from the chain? A redeemer for men already
   free--how can it be? He sets free not free men, but captives! He looses
   real and irksome fetters! He snaps not fictitious chains which fancy
   binds about fretful, frivolous persons--He breaks iron chains and
   snatches real yokes from off the necks of the thoroughly bound. There
   can be no Redeemer in the fullness of the title unless the persons are
   enslaved and His office must relate to such. I think I may distinctly
   say that if all the titles of the Savior do not involve or suppose the
   existence of sins, most do, and that either directly, or indirectly,
   they would furnish an argument to me to show that this Man came into
   the world to receive sinners.

   If more evidence were wanted, I would point you to the Savior's
   miracles. The miracles which the Savior performed were very few of them
   miracles of judgment. They were almost all miracles of mercy. They were
   performed upon the sick, symbolical of His spiritual miracles upon the
   morally sick. They were performed upon persons possessed of devils, as
   if to show at once that even the devilish element which enters into
   man's rebellion is not too strong for the Savior to conquer, or too
   foul for Him to touch. His miracles were sometimes worked on the dead
   and those, as you will remember, in different stages of corruption. The
   young child in Jairus' chamber was yet sweet of flesh as though she had
   just fallen asleep--He quickened her. The young man at the gates of
   Nain was taken out to be buried--already there were tokens which made
   the mother say, "Let us bury our dead out of our sight." But the
   Almighty voice quickened him!

   As for Lazarus, he had been dead four days already, and his sister
   said, "By this time he stinks." And as if to betoken that Jesus Christ
   can deliver not only from incipient sin, but from sin in its foulest
   stage of corruption and putridity, He spoke to Lazarus and said,
   "Lazarus, come forth." These miracles must have had some meaning and
   some teaching. If He thus touched men and healed their natural
   infirmities, how can you think He will not, whose mission is mainly
   spiritual, heal spiritual infirmities?

   He might have said, and said truly, "Though I heal you, that is not the
   grand design of My mission--My kingdom is not of this world, nor are my
   healings intended to be of this world, either, in their grandest
   development. I descended from Heaven to heal sick souls, to raise the
   spiritually dead and conquer disease in the realm of spirit, rather
   than in the physical world." This day every miracle of the Savior seems
   to cry to me, to you, "Diseased souls, look to Jesus Christ and be
   saved!" Did you ever observe how many of His parables, also, are to the
   same effect--how, time after time, as in the three memorable parables
   of the chapter before us, it is the sinner that He is teaching and it
   is God's love in forgiving sin that He is endeavoring to set forth
   before the eyes which self-righteousness has made, alas, so dim and
   blind?

   He is constantly telling us of a vainglorious Pharisee whose prayer is
   a mass of reeking pride. And of a penitent Publican whose humble cry
   brings justification from on high. He speaks of two debtors who had
   nothing to pay, frankly forgiven--and of the one who loved most,
   because he had most forgiven. He talks of a barren fig tree, spared to
   be dug about and fertilized, of a wounded man, pitied and succored by a
   good Samaritan. He tells us of loiterers admitted to the vineyard at
   the eleventh hour. And of poor, and halt, and lame entertained at a
   banquet of love.

   I need not continue longer in this strain, for I think the consistency
   of the fact is evident to you all. I can well picture before me Jesus
   Christ receiving sinners, but I cannot imagine Him, I cannot, with the
   utmost stretch of the imagination, picture Him as rejecting sinners. I
   cannot read of the rest of His life and then think of Him as saying,
   "Stand back you unclean." I cannot suppose Him with a crowd before Him,
   crying, "Far from Me, you ungodly! Keep a distance from this pure and
   sacred Being who condescends to look upon you!" And I cannot--I will
   not try, either--I cannot fancy it possible that He will reject you, my
   dear Friend, if you go this morning into His Presence and humbly seek
   His face. It would be altogether a departure from His constant mode of
   action, and there can be no such departure for He is the same
   yesterday, today and forever!

   Thus, I think, we have shown the consistency of the fact with the
   Person and work of Christ. Observe the condescension of this fact. This
   Man, who towers above all other men holy, harmless, undefiled and
   separate from sinners--this Man receives sinners! This Man, who is none
   other than the eternal God before whom angels veil their faces--this
   Man receives sinners! It needs an angel's tongue to describe this
   mighty stoop of love! That any of us should be willing to seek after
   the lost seed of the house of Adam is nothing wonderful--they are of
   our own race! But that He, the offended God against whom the
   transgression had been committed--that HE should take upon Himself the
   form of a servant and bear the sins of many, and should then, as Man,
   be willing to receive the vilest of the vile and blot out their
   transgressions and iniquities--this is marvelous!

   It is only rendered believable at all by the fact that God Himself
   declares it and that abundant witnesses testify to it. I do think that
   if, for the first time, any but God had told the angels of this, they
   could not have conceived it as true! And I do not wonder that sometimes
   sinners under a sense of sin cry out, "It is too good to be true!" It
   were, indeed, too good if it were looked at from our side of the
   question, but viewed as coming from God, the infinite Fountain of all
   bounty and mercy, it is believable--it is joyfully certain! It is the
   greatest wonder in Heaven, or earth, or even in Hell! There is no
   marvel like the Truth of God that, "The Word was made flesh and dwelt
   among us"--that He who ever lives bowed His head to die for
   sinners--and having made atonement for sin, now receives the very chief
   of sinners into His heart's love and makes them His companions and His
   friends!

   Oh, will you kick against such condescension as this? Will your hearts
   be like iron when you think of such favor as this manifested to sinful
   men? Sinners, when God stoops, will you not stoop? When from the
   highest Heaven He seeks you, will you not seek Him? When you thus see
   His love so infinitely revealed, are there no drawings of heart, are
   there no meltings of penitence towards the bleeding Savior? Surely cold
   drops of horror might stand even upon marble, or ooze forth from
   granite at the sound of Calvary's groans! And are there no tears in
   your eyes, no thoughts of melting, moving penitence when you mark such
   mercy and compassion manifested towards you? Jesus condescends to
   receive sinners and yet they stand out against Him! Be astonished, O
   heavens! Be ashamed, O earth!

   We do but touch that point and now let us notice the certainty of this
   fact. That "this Man receives sinners" is undeniable. Sometimes when
   the sinner comes, Jesus is standing on the doorstep and before he
   begins to knock, he is safe in the Savior's arms and finds himself
   forgiven before he has time to make a complete confession. At other
   times men have to knock, but the very first knock opens the door. Some
   of us stood knocking four or five years, unbelievingly knocking, but
   still knocking anxiously, craving mercy and not finding it. Ah, but we
   did find it after all! It does not say that He will show you that He
   has received you in the next minute or two--that He will pour peace
   into your spirit the first moment He receives you--but He will receive
   you!

   If He tarries, wait for Him! Knock and knock, and knock again, for
   there never yet was a soul that could say, "I was a sinner--I went to
   this Man and He did not receive me." You are growing weary, are you,
   young man? These three or four months that you have been watching and
   praying have tried your patience. Ah, dear Brother, don't you see the
   Cross and the Savior hanging on it? If you look to Him, your time of
   suspense will doubtless be over at once! You have made a
   mistake--darkness has been over your eyes! You have been looking in the
   wrong places--to your feelings, your penitence, your faith--rather than
   to Him! Or, if it is true that He has kept you waiting, yet wait on!
   Hope on, hope always! While the lamp holds out to burn, despair must
   not trample down your soul. Jesus must receive you--He did receive
   sinners once, and again, I bid you, remember that He is the same
   yesterday, today and forever! He must receive you--cast yourself on Him
   and you shall find that He will receive you!

   There is a great multitude of people here this morning and yet among us
   all there is not one who can say, "We sought the Lord and He would not
   receive us." But there are many hundreds here, who, though they had a
   sorry time of it in the season of conviction, yet can clap their hands
   and say, "Truly, truly, the Master does manifest Himself to all who cry
   to Him in truth. Try Him, then, and you will find it true with you,
   too!

   I shall want you now, dear Friends, for a moment, to permit me to show
   the adaptation of this fact to many who are now present. "This Man
   receives sinners," is an announcement well adapted to many of this
   congregation. It is so very plain. If it were a sentence which needed
   much explanation, it might not suit the multitude. There would be some
   who would think it over and say, "Alas! Such a text hardly meets my
   case. It is a mystery! I cannot get at the bottom of it." But this is
   so simple, "This Man receives sinners." You know what it is to be
   received into a house? You go, you knock, the door opens, you are
   received. This is all you have to do in the matter of salvation, too!
   You go as you are to Christ. You knock. You are received.

   It is a blessed sentence from its plainness. It is very blessed, too,
   from its personality. I can see my name in it. You will say, "How?"
   Well, dear Friends, I wish you may be able to see yours. "This Man
   receives sinners." It does not say He receives John, Hannah, Sarah,
   Mary or Thomas--it says much better than that--it says, "This man
   receives SINNERS." Now there may be a mistake about my name being
   Charles. And if I found it written in God's Word that He received a
   person of my name, I should always be excessively anxious about the
   registration. I should be afraid lest I should not really be the person
   described. But when it says, He "receives sinners," I am very clear
   about this meaning me, for I know I am a sinner.

   The devil himself, liar as he is, dares not say I am not a sinner! No,
   he oftentimes does me very good service by telling me how very clearly
   that is my name. And I never thank him for anything but that--that he
   does sometimes help one to read his title clear by enabling one to see
   distinctly that he is a sinner! Well, you are a sinner--then the text
   means you-- and, "This man receives sinners." If you were in some
   country, say in the center of Africa, wandering about at night amidst a
   crowd of huts, wondering where you could find lodging for the night. If
   you saw a board put up very legibly printed with these words, "This
   person receives white men," why you would say to yourself, "That is
   it." You would not care that it did not say, "This person receives John
   Smith or Tom Brown." It would be quite enough for you, "He receives
   white men."

   You are a white man and you would say, "He receives me." Now, this Man
   receives sinners, you are a sinner--then He will receive you. Suppose
   we reverse it, and there were put up a notice in one of our streets,
   "At this house they receive black men." Now, I cannot conceive any
   black man saying, "They will not receive me because I am so very black.
   Why," he would say, "It says they will receive me and the more black I
   am the more certainly is this invitation meant for me. If I am a
   jet-black man, then I am very black and they will, with less hesitation
   receive me." I cannot suppose a half-caste man saying, "Well, I have a
   little white in me, therefore I feel sure they will take me." He might
   feel proud of it, but then there would come afterwards the thought, "I
   am not so clear that this is meant for me, if I am not all black."

   So if there are any of you who are a little self-righteous and say, "I
   do not know whether I am such a sinner as some people are," you may
   doubt whether you are a sinner. But you who know you are sinners right
   through to the backbone--sinners everywhere and every way--there cannot
   be any doubt about you, your name is as clearly there as possible!
   There is plainness and there is personality. But there is presentness,
   too. "This Man receives sinners." Sometimes on the doorsteps of
   workhouses you may see a very sorry sight late at night--a company of
   men, women and boys crowding on the doorstep to spend the night there
   because they came too late. There must be an hour when the workhouse
   must be shut and the refuge for the night closed, but they arrived too
   late and outside they must be kept.

   But you never saw a soul shivering outside Christ's door on the
   doorstep of eternal ruin because it came too late in this life! There
   was the thief--he had a hard run for it, but he just reached the door
   in time. Without doubt it is written on the top of my Master's door,
   "This Man receives--at all times and at all seasons--this Man receives
   sinners." It will be a dolorous day for you, some of you, if you die as
   you now are, when this sentence will be blotted out and you will see
   written over the door of Mercy, "This Man received sinners." Then it
   will be the Hell of your hells that He did receive sinners once, but
   that you never came! That when it was said, "He receives sinners," you
   passed by carelessly and proudly and would not enter. And now mercy is
   a thing of the past and you are shut up where hope can never come, in
   the flames of Hell!

   But as long as life lasts, dear Hearers, that inscription stands in all
   its glorious presentness, "This Man receives sinners." Do observe the
   unqualified sense in which the sentence is put, "This Man receives
   sinners." But how? What sort of sinners? How are they to feel? How are
   they to come? Not a word is said about their coming, or their
   preparation, but simply, "This Man receives sinners." Some sinners came
   to Christ walking. Others came to Christ limping on crutches, having
   lost a leg--He never turned any away because they came on crutches. One
   man came on his bed--indeed, he did not come, but was brought by other
   people. Jesus received him all the same for that. There were some who
   did not seek the Lord at all, but Christ Jesus came to them and
   received them by a blessed victory of Divine Grace. He receives sinners
   and the only stipulation that is put in at all is, "whoever will, let
   him take the water of life freely." If you will, take! If you have a
   will to Christ--if God has given you a will towards Christ Jesus--and
   if you have nothing beyond that will--no feelings, no emotions, no
   works, no experience which could qualify you for Him. If you do but
   will--"Whoever will, let him take of the water of life freely"--"This
   man receives sinners."

   Sometimes if you want to get a child into an Orphan Asylum, you might
   just as well keep the child yourself as go through the expense and
   trouble of working to get the child in--there are so many difficulties
   to be encountered in effecting your design. If you want to get to Jesus
   Christ, there is no trouble, no expense. Going to Jesus Christ is
   coming to an open door of mercy. The city of the New Jerusalem, you
   remember, had four gates and we are told none of them are ever shut,
   "they are not shut at all by day and there is no night there." So that
   come as we may, "This Man receives sinners just as they come to Him."

   II. Now, I wanted to speak upon the second head, but I had not
   sufficient forethought to store up the time, so we must only say of
   that just this--Jesus Christ, having once received sinners, enters into
   the most familiar and endearing communion with them that is possible.
   HE FEASTS WITH THEM--their joys are His joys--their work for God is His
   work for God. He feasts with them at their table and they with Him at
   His table--and He does this wherever the table is spread. It may be in
   a attic, or in a cellar--in a wilderness, or on a mountain--He still
   eats with them.

   He does this now in the ordinances and means of Grace by His Spirit.
   And this He will do in the fullness of Glory when He takes these
   sinners up to dwell with Him. Sinners are not merely permitted the
   parings of mercy, but the very marrow and fatness! They are not only
   allowed to sit and dip their feet in the margin of the stream, but they
   may wade in and find it a river to swim in--they shall not, in Heaven,
   sit in the outer circle--they shall draw near the Throne and reign with
   Jesus! There is nothing which Christ will not give to sinners. They
   shall be crowned. They shall have harps of gold. They shall dwell in
   the many mansions near to God Himself!

   There is no second and lower party, as it were--He does not receive
   sinners and put them at the lower end of the table, below the salt. He
   receives sinners and eats with them! He receives them into the soul and
   flower of Christian life and Christian privilege among all the favored
   saints of the celestial courts! I would to God I had time to plead this
   matter home with some who are here this morning and who are not
   Believers in Jesus. Oh, Sinner, trust my Master and you shall be saved!
   May the Spirit of God make you trust Him now! I know your sense of
   unworthiness. I know you feel you are not fit to come. But He says
   nothing about fitness, so why should you say it? Christ lays down no
   conditions, so why do you make conditions? "This Man receives sinners."

   Why, says Bunyan, "I felt myself such a sinner once that I could do
   nothing but fly to Christ. And if He had had a drawn sword in His hand,
   the terrors of Hell were so dreadful that I could have borne the
   terrors of that drawn sword to escape from the wrath of God." But here,
   instead of the drawn sword is the warm loving heart! Fly to it, Sinner!
   God help you to fly now, that you may be saved! If He should reject
   you, come and tell me. I would not knowingly preach a lying Gospel--and
   if you can prove to me that He does not receive sinners, we will have a
   Sunday service and preach that the Gospel has failed, for we will
   preach the truth of Him and not speak falsely for God. When you find He
   rejects a coming sinner, let us hear it, that our hopes may no longer
   be as bright and high as they are now!

   Try the Lord Jesus, Sinner! Taste and see that the Lord is good! Come
   to Jesus now! Come as you are! Come now to Him! You need not stop to
   get to your houses to bend your knees to pray. One cry, one tear, one
   LOOK with the believing eye will do it. "Look unto Me and be you saved,
   all you ends of the earth." While we thus preach, may the Master enter
   into your hearts by His Spirit and may you be led to Him, and we will
   praise Him together, world without end. Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Luke 15
     __________________________________________________________________

                            Holy Work For Christmas

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 24, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was
   told them concerning this Child. And all they that heard it wondered at
   those things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all
   these things and pondered them in her heart. And the shepherds
   returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had
   heard and seen, as it was told unto them." Luke 2:17-20.

   EVERY season has its own proper fruit--apples for autumn, holly berries
   for Christmas. The earth brings forth according to the period of the
   year and with man there is a time for every purpose under Heaven. At
   this season the world is engaged in congratulating itself and in
   expressing its complimentary wishes for the good of its citizens. Let
   me suggest extra and more solid work for Christians. As we think,
   today, of the birth of the Savior, let us aspire after a fresh birth of
   the Savior in our hearts--that as He is already "formed in us the hope
   of glory," we may be "renewed in the spirit of our minds"--that we may
   go again to the Bethlehem of our spiritual nativity and do our first
   works, enjoy our first loves and feast with Jesus as we did in the
   holy, happy, heavenly days of our espousals.

   Let us go to Jesus with something of that youthful freshness and
   excessive delight which was so manifest in us when we looked to Him at
   first. Let Him be crowned anew by us, for He is still adorned with the
   dew of His youth and remains "the same yesterday, today and forever."
   The citizens of Durham, though they dwell not far from the Scotch
   border, and consequently in the olden times were frequently liable to
   be attacked, were exempted from the toils of war because there was a
   cathedral within their walls and they were set aside to the bishop's
   service, being called in the olden times by the name of "holy
   work-folk."

   Now, we citizens of the New Jerusalem, having the Lord Jesus in our
   midst, may well excuse ourselves from the ordinary ways of celebrating
   this season. And considering ourselves to be "holy work-folk," we may
   keep it, after a different sort from other men, in holy contemplation
   and in blessed service of that gracious God whose unspeakable gift the
   new-born King is to us.

   I selected this text this morning because it seemed to indicate to me
   four ways of serving God, four methods of executing holy work and
   exercising Christian thought. Each of the verses sets before us a
   different way of sacred service. Some, it appears, published abroad the
   news, told to others what they had seen and heard. Some wondered with a
   holy marveling and astonishment. One, at least, according to the third
   verse, pondered, meditated, thought upon these things. And others, in
   the fourth place, glorified God and gave Him praise. I know not which
   of these four did God the best service, but I think if we could combine
   all these mental emotions and outward exercises we should be sure to
   praise God after a most godly and acceptable fashion.

   I. To begin then, in the first place, we find that some celebrated the
   Savior's birth by PUBLISHING ABROAD what they had heard and seen. And
   truly we may say of them that they had something to rehearse in men's
   ears well worth the telling! That for which Prophets and kings had
   waited long had at last arrived and arrived to them! They had found out
   the answer to the perpetual riddle. They might have run through the
   streets with the ancient philosopher, crying, "Eureka! Eureka!" for
   their discovery was far superior to his.

   They had found out no solution to a mechanical problem or metaphysical
   dilemma. Their discovery was second to none ever made by men in real
   value, since it has been like the leaves of the Tree of Life to heal
   the nations and a river of Water of Life to make glad the city of God!
   They had seen angels! They had heard them sing a song all strange and
   new. They had seen more than angels--they had beheld the angel's King,
   the Angel of the Covenant whom we delight in! They had heard the music
   of Heaven, and when near that manger, the ear of their faith had heard
   the music of earth's hope, a mystic harmony which should ring all down
   the ages--the sweet melody of hearts attuned to praise the Lord and the
   glorious swell of the holy joy of God and man rejoicing in glad accord.

   They had seen God Incarnate--such a sight that he who gazes on it must
   feel his tongue unloosed--unless, indeed, an unspeakable astonishment
   should make him dumb! Be silent when their eyes had seen such a vision?
   Impossible! To the first person they met outside that lowly stable door
   they began to tell their matchless tale and they wearied not till
   nightfall, crying, "Come and worship! Come and worship Christ, the
   new-born King!" As for us, Beloved, have we also not something to
   relate which demands utterance? If we talk of Jesus, who can blame us?
   This, indeed, might make the tongue of him that sleeps to move--the
   mystery of God Incarnate, for our sake bleeding and dying--that we
   might neither bleed nor die! God Incarnate descending that we might
   ascend! Wrapped in swaddling cloths that we might be unwrapped of the
   grave clothes of corruption!

   Here is such a story, so profitable to all hearers that he who repeats
   it the most often does best, and he who speaks the least has most
   reason to accuse himself for sinful silence. They had something to tell
   and that something had in it the inimitable blending which is the
   secret sign and royal march of Divine authorship--a peerless marrying
   of sublimity and simplicity! Angels singing--singing to shepherds!
   Heaven bright with glory! Bright at midnight! God! A Babe!! The
   Infinite! An Infant of a span long!! The Ancient of Days! Born of a
   woman!! What more simple than the inn, the manger, a carpenter, a
   carpenter's wife, a child?

   What more sublime than a "multitude of the heavenly host" waking the
   midnight with their joyous song and God Himself in human flesh made
   manifest? A child is but an ordinary sight--but what a marvel to see
   that Word which was "in the beginning with God, tabernacling among us
   that we might behold His Glory"--the Glory as of the only Begotten of
   the Father, full of Grace and Truth? Brethren, we have a tale to tell,
   as simple as sublime. What simpler?-- "Believe and live." What more
   sublime?--"Was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself!" A system
   of salvation so wonderful that angelic minds cannot but adore as they
   meditate upon it. And yet so simple that the children in the temple may
   fitly hymn its virtues as they sing. "Hosanna! Blessed is He that comes
   in the name of the Lord."

   What a splendid combining of the sublime and the simple have we in the
   great Atonement offered by the Incarnate Savior! Oh make known to all
   men this saving Truth of God! The shepherds need no excuse for making
   everywhere the announcement of the Savior's birth, for what they told
   they first received from Heaven! Their news was not muttered in their
   ears by Sybilline oracles, nor brought to light by philosophic
   research. It was not conceived in poetry nor found as treasure trove
   among the volumes of the ancient. It was revealed to them by that
   notable Gospel preacher who led the angelic host and testified, "Unto
   you is born this day, in the city of David, a Savior, which is Christ
   the Lord."

   When Heaven entrusts a man with a merciful Revelation, he is bound to
   deliver the good tidings to others. What? Keep that a secret whose
   utterance Eternal Mercy makes to charm the midnight air? To what
   purpose were angels sent if the message were not to be spread abroad?
   According to the teaching of our own beloved Lord we must not be
   silent, for He bids us, "What you hear in secret, that reveal you in
   public. And what I tell you in the ear in closets, that proclaim you
   upon the housetops." Beloved, you have heard a voice from Heaven--you
   twice-born men, begotten again unto a lively hope--you have heard the
   Spirit of God bearing witness of God's Truth with you and teaching you
   of heavenly things. You, then, must keep this Christmas by telling to
   your fellow men what God's own holy Spirit has seen fit to reveal to
   you!

   But though the shepherds told what they heard from Heaven, remember
   that they spoke of what they had seen below. They had, by observation,
   made those Truths of God most surely their own which had first been
   spoken to them by Revelation. No man can speak of the things of God
   with any success until the doctrine which he finds in the Bible, he
   finds, also, in his heart. We must bring down the mystery and make it
   plain by knowing, and by the teaching of the Holy Spirit its practical
   power on the heart and conscience. My Brethren, the Gospel which we
   preach is most surely revealed to us by the Lord. But, moreover, our
   hearts have tried and proved, have grasped, have felt, have realized
   its truth and power!

   If we have not been able to understand its heights and depths, yet we
   have felt its mystic power upon our heart and spirit. It has revealed
   sin to us plainly. It has revealed to us our pardon. It has killed the
   reigning power of sin. It has given us Christ to reign over us and the
   Holy Spirit to dwell within our bodies as in a temple. Now we must
   speak! I do not urge any of you to speak of Jesus who merely know the
   Word as you find it in the Bible--your teaching can have but little
   power. But I do speak earnestly to you who know its mighty influence
   upon the heart, who have not only heard of the Babe but have seen Him
   in the manger.

   I speak to those who have taken Him up in your arms and received Him as
   being born to you, a Savior to you-- Christ the Anointed--Jesus, the
   Savior from sin, for you. Beloved, can you do otherwise than speak of
   the things which you have seen and heard? God has made you to taste and
   to handle of this good Word of Life and you must not, you dare not hold
   your peace! You must tell friends and neighbors what you have felt
   within.

   These were shepherds, unlettered men. I will warrant you they could not
   read in a book. There is no probability that they even knew a single
   letter. They were shepherds, but they preached right well. And, my
   Brethren, whatever some may think, preaching is not to be confined to
   those learned gentlemen who have taken their degrees at Oxford or at
   Cambridge, or at any college or university. It is true that learning
   need not be an impediment to Grace and may be a fitting weapon in a
   gracious hand. But often the Grace of God has glorified itself by the
   plain clear way in which unlettered men have understood the Gospel and
   have proclaimed it.

   I would not mind asking the whole world to find a Master of Arts now
   living who has brought more souls to Christ Jesus than Richard Weaver.
   If the whole bench of bishops have done a tenth as much in the way of
   soul-winning as that one man, it is more than most of us give them
   credit for. Let us give to our God all the Glory, but still let us not
   deny the fact that this sinner saved, with the brogue of the coal miner
   still about him, fresh from the coal pit, tells the story of the Cross,
   by God's Grace, in such a way that Right Reverend Fathers in God might
   humbly sit at his feet to learn the way to reach the heart and melt the
   stubborn soul!

   It is true an uneducated Brother is not fitted for all work--he has his
   own sphere--but he is quite able to tell of what he has seen and heard.
   And so it strikes me, is every man in a measure. If you have seen Jesus
   and heard His saving voice. If you have received Truth as from the
   Lord. If you have felt its tremendous power as coming from God to you,
   and if you have experienced its might upon your own spirit--why you can
   surely tell out what God has written within! If you cannot get beyond
   that into the deeper mysteries, into the more knotty points, well,
   well, there are some who can, and so you need not be uneasy. But you
   can at least reveal the first and foundational Truths and they are by
   far the most important!

   If you cannot speak in the pulpit. If as yet your cheek would mantle
   with a blush and your tongue would refuse to do her office in the
   presence of many, there are your children! You are not ashamed to speak
   before them! There is the little cluster round the hearth on Christmas
   night. There is the little congregation in the workshop. There is a
   little audience somewhere to whom you might tell out of Jesus' love to
   lost ones. Do not get beyond what you know. Do not plunge into what you
   have not experienced--for if you do, you will be out of your depth--and
   then very soon you will be floundering and making confusion worse
   confounded. Go as far as you know. And since you know yourself to be a
   sinner--and Jesus a Savior, and a great one, too--talk about those two
   matters and good will come of it! Beloved, each one, in his own
   position, tell what you have heard and seen! Publish that abroad among
   the sons of men.

   But were the shepherds authorized? It is a great thing to be
   authorized! Unauthorized ministers are most shameful intruders!
   Unordained men who are not in the Apostolic succession entering the
   pulpit--very horrible--very horrible indeed! The Puseyite mind utterly
   fails to fathom the depth of horror which is contained in the idea of
   an unauthorized man preaching and a man out of the Apostolic succession
   daring to teach the way of salvation! To me this horror seems very much
   like a schoolboy's fright at a hobgoblin which his fears had conjured
   up. I think if I saw a man slip through the ice into a cold grave and I
   could rescue him from drowning it would not be so very horrible to me
   to be the means of saving him, though I may not be employed by the
   Royal Humane Society.

   I imagine if I saw a fire and heard a poor woman scream at an upper
   window and likely to be burned alive, if I should wheel the fire escape
   up to the window and preserve her life, it would not be so very
   dreadful a matter though I might not belong to the regular Fire
   Brigade. If a company of brave volunteers should chase an enemy out of
   their own county, I do not know that it would be anything so shocking
   although a whole army of mercenaries might be neglecting their work in
   obedience to some venerable military rubric which rendered them
   incapable of effective service. But mark you, the shepherds and others
   like them are in the Apostolic succession and they are authorized by
   Divine ordinance--for every man who hears the Gospel is authorized to
   tell it to others.

   Do you want authority? Here it is in strong confirmation from Holy
   Writ--"Let him that hears say, Come"--that is, let every man who truly
   hears the Gospel bid others come to drink of the Water of Life. This is
   all the warrant you require for preaching the Gospel according to your
   ability. It is not every man who has ability to preach the Word. And it
   is not every man that we should like to hear preach it in the great
   congregation, for if all were mouth, what a great vacuum the Church
   would be! Yet every Christian in some method should deliver the glad
   tidings. Our wise God takes care that liberty of prophesying shall not
   run to riot, for He does not give efficient pastoral and ministerial
   gifts to every many. Yet every man, according to his gifts, let him
   minister! Every one of you, though not in the pulpit, yet in the pew,
   in the workshop--somewhere, anywhere, everywhere--make known the savor
   of the Lord Jesus. And let this be your authority--"Let him that hears,
   say, Come."

   I never thought of asking any authority for crying, "Fire!" When I saw
   a house burning, I never dreamed of seeking any authority for doing my
   best to rescue a poor perishing fellow man. Nor do I mean to seek it
   now! All the authority you want, any of you, is not the authority which
   can stream from prelates decorated with long sleeves--but the authority
   which comes directly from the great Head of the Church who gives
   authority to every one of those who hear the Gospel to teach every man,
   his fellow, saying, "Know the Lord." Here, dear Brethren, is one way
   for you to keep a right holy, and in some sense, a right merry
   Christmas!

   Imitate these humble men, of whom it is said, "When they had seen it
   they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this
   Child."

   II. We set before you, now, another mode of keeping Christmas by HOLY
   WONDER, ADMIRATION, AND ADORATION. "And all they that heard it wondered
   at those things which were told them by the shepherds." We shall have
   little to say of those persons who merely wondered and did nothing
   more. Many are set a wondering by the Gospel. They are content to hear
   it, pleased to hear it--though not, to them, in itself something
   new--yet there are new ways of putting it and they are glad to be
   refreshed with the variety. The preacher's voice is to them as the
   sound of one that gives a goodly tune upon an instrument. They are glad
   to listen.

   They are not skeptics. They do not cavil. They raise no difficulties.
   They just say to themselves, "It is an excellent Gospel. It is a
   wonderful plan of salvation. Here is most astonishing love, most
   extraordinary condescension." Sometimes they marvel that these things
   should be told them by shepherds. They can hardly understand how
   unlearned and ignorant men should speak of these things! And they
   marvel how such things should ever get into these shepherds'
   heads--where they learned them, how it is that they seem so earnest
   about them--what kind of operation they must have passed through to be
   able to speak as they do!

   But after holding up their hands and opening their mouths for about
   nine days, the wonder subsides and they go their way and think no more
   about it. There are many of you who are set to wondering whenever you
   see a work of God in your district. You hear of somebody converted who
   was a very extraordinary sinner and you say, "It is very wonderful!"
   There is a revival. You happen to be present at one of the meetings
   when the Spirit of God is working gloriously--you say, "Well, this is a
   singular thing! Very astonishing!" Even the newspapers can afford a
   corner, at times, for very great and extraordinary works of God the
   Holy Spirit! But then all emotion ends--it is all wondering and nothing
   more.

   Now, I trust it will not be so with any of us--that we shall not think
   of the Savior and of the doctrines of the Gospel which He came to
   preach simply with amazement and astonishment--for this will work us
   but little good. On the other hand, there is another mode of wondering
   which is akin to adoration, if it is not adoration, itself. I think it
   would be very difficult to draw a line between holy wonder and real
   worship. When the soul is overwhelmed with the majesty of God's Glory,
   though it may not express itself in song, or even utter its voice with
   bowed head in humble prayer, yet it silently adores.

   I am inclined to think that the astonishment which sometimes seizes
   upon the human intellect at the remembrance of God's greatness and
   goodness is, perhaps, the purest form of adoration which ever rises
   from mortal men to the Throne of the Most High. This kind of wonder I
   recommend to those of you who, from the quietness and solitariness of
   your lives, are scarcely able to imitate the shepherds in telling out
   the tale to others--you can at least fill up the circle of the
   worshippers before the Throne by wondering at what God has done! Let me
   suggest to you that holy wonder at what God has done should be very
   natural to you. That God should consider His fallen creature, man--and
   instead of sweeping him away with the besom of destruction--should
   devise a wonderful scheme for his redemption and that He should,
   Himself, undertake to be man's Redeemer and to pay his ransom price,
   is, indeed, marvelous!

   Probably it is most marvelous to you in its relation to yourself, that
   you should be redeemed by blood! That God should forsake the thrones
   and royalties above to suffer ignominiously below for you! If you know
   yourself you can never see any adequate motive or reason in your own
   flesh for such a deed as this. "Why such love to me?" you will say.
   What should you and I say, if David, sitting in his house, could only
   say, "Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that You have brought
   me up to now?"

   Had we been the most meritorious of individuals and had unceasingly
   kept the Lord's commands we could not have deserved such a priceless
   gift as Incarnation! But, Sinners, offenders who revolted and went from
   God further and further, what shall we say of this Incarnate God dying
   for us? "Herein is love, not that we loved God but that God loved us."
   Let your soul lose itself in wonder, for wonder, dear Friends, is in
   this way a very practical emotion! Holy wonder will lead you to
   grateful worship! Being astonished at what God has done, you will pour
   out your soul with astonishment at the foot of the golden Throne with
   the song, "Blessing and honor and glory and majesty and power and
   dominion and might be unto Him who sits on the Throne and does these
   great things for me."

   Filled with this wonder it will cause you a godly watchfulness. You
   will be afraid to sin against such love as this! Feeling the Presence
   of the mighty God in the gift of His dear Son, you will take off your
   shoes because the place where you stand is holy ground. You will be
   moved at the same time to a glorious hope! If Jesus has given Himself
   to you. If He has done this marvelous thing on your behalf, you will
   feel that Heaven itself is not too great for your expectation and that
   the rivers of pleasure at God's right hand are not too sweet or too
   deep for you to drink! Who can be astonished at anything when he has
   once been astonished at the Manger and the Cross?

   What is there wonderful left after one has seen the Savior? The nine
   wonders of the world? Why, you may put them all into a nutcracker and a
   child's art can excel them all! This one wonder is not the wonder of
   earth only, but of Heaven and earth and even Hell itself! It is not the
   wonder of the olden time, but the wonder of ALL time and the wonder of
   eternity. They who see human wonders a few times finally cease to be
   astonished. The noblest pile that architect ever raised finally fails
   to impress the onlooker--but not so this marvelous temple of Incarnate
   Deity! The more we look the more we are astonished! The more we become
   accustomed to it, the more we have a sense of its surpassing splendor
   of love and Grace!

   There is more of God, let us say, to be seen in the Manger and the
   Cross, than in the sparkling stars above, the rolling deep below, the
   towering mountain, the teeming valleys, the abodes of life, or the
   abyss of death! Let us, then, spend some choice hours of this festive
   season in holy wonder--such as will produce gratitude, worship, love
   and confidence.

   III. A third manner of holy work, namely, HER HEART PONDERING AND
   PRESERVING, you will find in the next verse. One at least and let us
   hope there were others, or at any rate let us ourselves be the
   others--one kept all these things and pondered them in her heart. She
   wondered--she did more--she pondered. You will observe there was an
   exercise on the part of this blessed woman of the three great parts of
   her being--her memory--she kept all these things. Her affections--she
   kept them in her heart. Her intellect--she pondered them, considered
   them, weighed them, turned them over--so that memory, affection and
   understanding were all exercised about these things.

   We delight to see this in Mary, but we are not at all surprised when we
   recollect that she was, in some sense, the most concerned of all on
   earth--for it was of her that Jesus Christ had been born. Those who
   come nearest to Jesus and enter the most closely into fellowship with
   Him will be sure to be the most engrossed with Him. Certain persons are
   best esteemed at a distance, but not the Savior! When you shall have
   known Him to the very fullest, then shall you love Him with the love
   which passes knowledge. You shall comprehend the heights and depths and
   lengths and breadths of His love. And when you shall do so, then your
   own love shall swell beyond all length and breadth, all height and
   depth.

   The birth most concerned Mary and therefore she was the most impressed
   with it. Note the way in which her concern was shown--she was a woman
   and the Divine Grace which shines best in the female is not
   boldness--that belongs to the masculine mind. Affectionate modesty is a
   feminine beauty, and from now we do not read so much of her telling
   abroad as pondering within. No doubt she had her circle and her word to
   speak in it, but for the most part she, like another Mary, sat still in
   the house. She worked, but her work was most directly for Him, her
   heart's joy and delight.

   Like other children, the holy Child needed care, which only a mother's
   hand and heart could exercise. She was, therefore, engrossed with Him.
   O blessed engrossment! Sweet engagement! Count not that to be
   unacceptable service which occupies itself rather with Jesus than with
   His disciples or His wandering sheep. That woman who broke the
   alabaster box and poured the ointment upon our Jesus Himself was
   faulted by Judas. And even the rest of the disciples thought that the
   poor had lost a benefit, but "she has worked a good work on Me" was the
   Savior's answer. I desire to bring you to this thought--if during this
   season you retiring, quiet ones, cannot speak to others, or have no
   desirable opportunity or suitable gift for that work--you may sit still
   with Jesus and honor Him in peace.

   Mary took the Lord in her arms. Oh that you may bear Him in yours! She
   executed works directly for His Person-- imitate her! You can love Him,
   bless Him, praise Him, study Him, ponder Him, comprehend His Character,
   study the types that set Him forth and imitate His life! And in this
   way, though your worship will not blaze forth among the sons of men and
   scarcely benefit them as some other forms of work, yet it will both
   benefit you and be acceptable to your Lord. Beloved, remember what you
   have heard of Christ and what He has done for you! Make your heart the
   golden cup to hold the rich remembrances of His past loving-kindness!
   Make it a pot of manna to preserve the heavenly bread on which saints
   have fed in days gone by!

   Let your memory treasure up everything about Christ which you have
   either heard, or felt, or known! And then let your fond affections hold
   Him fast forevermore. Love Him! Pour out that alabaster box of your
   heart, and let all the precious ointment of your affections come
   streaming on His feet. If you cannot do it with joy, do it sorrowfully!
   Wash His feet with tears, wipe them with the hairs of your head--but do
   love Him--love the blessed Son of God, your ever tender Friend. Let
   your intellect be exercised concerning the Lord Jesus. Turn over and
   over by meditation what you read. Do not be loiter men--do not stop at
   the surface--dive into the depths!

   Be not as the swallow which touches the brook with her wing, but as the
   fish which penetrates the lowest wave. Drink deep draughts of love! Do
   not sip and away--but dwell at the well as Isaac did at the well
   Lahai-roi. Abide with your Lord--let Him not be to you as a wayfaring
   man that tarries for a night, but constrain Him, saying, "Abide with
   us, for the day is far spent." Hold Him and do not let Him go! The word
   "ponder," as you know, means to weigh. Make ready the scales of
   judgment. Oh, but where are the scales that can weigh the Lord Christ?
   "He takes up the isles as a very little thing"--who shall take Him up?
   "He weighs the mountains in scales." In what scales shall we weigh Him?

   Be it so, if your understanding cannot comprehend, let your affections
   apprehend. And if your spirit cannot compass the Lord Jesus in the arms
   of its understanding, let it embrace Him in the arms of your affection.
   Oh, Beloved, here is blessed Christmas work for you, if, like Mary, you
   lay up all these things in your heart and ponder upon them!

   IV. The last piece of holy Christmas work is to come. "The shepherds
   returned," we read in the twentieth verse,

   "GLORIFYING AND PRAISING GOD for all the things that they had heard and
   seen, as it was told unto them."

   Returned to what? Returned to business to look after the lambs and
   sheep again! Then if we desire to glorify God we need not give up our
   business. Some people get the notion into their heads that the only way
   in which they can live for God is by becoming ministers, missionaries,
   or Bible women.

   Alas, how many of us would be shut out from any opportunity of
   magnifying the Most High if this were the case? The shepherds went back
   to the sheep pens glorifying and praising God! Beloved, it is not
   office, it is earnestness! It is not position, it is Divine Grace which
   will enable us to glorify God! God is most surely glorified in that
   cobbler's stall where the godly worker, as he plies the awl, sings of
   the Savior's lovel Yes, glorified far more than in many a cathedral
   where official religiousness performs its scanty duties.

   The name of Jesus is glorified by yonder carter as he drives his horse
   and blesses his God, or speaks to his fellow laborer by the roadside as
   much as by yonder Divine who, throughout the country like Boanerges, is
   thundering out the Gospel! God is glorified by our abiding in our
   vocation. Take care you do not fall out of the path of duty by leaving
   your calling, and take care you do not dishonor your profession while
   in it! Think not much of yourselves, but do not think too little of
   your callings. There is no trade which is not sanctified by the Gospel.
   If you turn to the Bible, you will find the most menial forms of labor
   have been in some way or other connected either with the most daring
   deeds of faith, or else with persons whose lives have been otherwise
   illustrious.

   Keep to your calling, Brother, keep to your calling! Whatever God has
   made you, when He calls you, abide in that, unless you are quite
   sure--mind that--unless you are quite sure that He calls you to
   something else. The shepherds glorified God though they went to their
   trade. They glorified God though they were shepherds. As we remarked,
   they were not men of learning. So far from having an extensive library
   full of books, it is probable they could not read a word. Yet they
   glorified God. This takes away all excuse for you good people who say,
   "I am no scholar. I never had any education. I never went even to a
   Sunday school." Ah, but if your heart is right, you can glorify God!

   Never mind, Sarah. Do not be cast down because you know so little.
   Learn more if you can, but make good use of what you do know. Never
   mind, John! It is, indeed, a pity that you should have had to toil so
   early, as not to have acquired even the rudiments of knowledge--but do
   not think that you cannot glorify God! If you would praise God, live a
   holy life! You can do that by His Grace, at any rate, without
   scholarship. If you would do good to others, be good yourself. And that
   is a way which is as open to the most illiterate as it is to the best
   taught! Be of good courage! Shepherds glorified God and so may you!

   Remember there is one thing in which they had a preference over the
   wise men. The wise men wanted a star to lead them. The shepherds did
   not. The wise men went wrong even with a star--they stumbled into
   Jerusalem. The shepherds went straight away to Bethlehem. Simple minds
   sometimes find a glorified Christ where learned heads, much puzzled
   with their lore, miss Him. A good doctor used to say, "Lo, these
   simpletons have entered into the kingdom, while we learned men have
   been fumbling for the latch." It is often so. And so, you simple minds,
   be comforted and glad!

   The way in which these shepherds honored God is worth noticing. They
   did it by praising Him. Let us think more of sacred song than we
   sometimes do. When the song is bursting in full chorus from the
   thousands in this house, it is but a noise in the ear of some men--but
   inasmuch as many true hearts, touched with the love of Jesus, are
   keeping pace with their tongues--it is not a mere noise in God's
   esteem! There is a sweet music in it that makes glad His ear. What is
   the great ultimatum of all Christian effort? When I stood here the
   other morning preaching the Gospel, my mind was fully exercised with
   the winning of souls. But I seemed, while preaching, to get beyond
   that. I thought, Well, that is not the chief end after all--the chief
   end is to glorify God and even the saving of sinners is sought by the
   right-minded as the means to that end!

   Then it struck me all of a sudden, "If in Psalm singing and hymn
   singing we do really glorify God, we are doing more than in the
   preaching because we are not then in the means--we are close upon the
   great end itself." If we praise God with heart and tongue we glorify
   Him in the surest possible manner--we are really glorifying Him then!
   "Whoever offers praise glorifies Me," says the Lord. Sing, then, my
   Brethren! Sing not only when you are together, but sing alone! Cheer
   your labor with Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. Make glad the
   family with sacred music! We sing too little, I am sure, yet the
   revival of religion has always been attended with the revival of
   Christian Psalmody.

   Luther's translations of the Psalms were of as much service as Luther's
   discussions and controversies. And the hymns of Charles Wesley and
   Cennick and Toplady and Newton and Cowper aided as much in the
   quickening of spiritual life in England as the preaching of John Wesley
   and George Whitefield. We need more singing! Sing more and murmur less!
   Sing more and slander less! Sing more and cavil less! Sing more and
   mourn less! God grant us today, as these shepherds did, to glorify God
   by praising Him.

   I have not quite done with them. What was the subject of their praise?
   It appears that they praised God for what they had heard. If we think
   of it, there is good reason for blessing God every time we hear a
   Gospel sermon. What would souls in Hell give if they could hear the
   Gospel once more and be on terms in which salvation Grace might come to
   them? What would dying men give whose tune is all but over if they
   could once more come to the House of God and have another warning and
   another invitation? My Brethren, what would you give, sometimes, when
   you are shut up by sickness and cannot meet with the great
   congregation--when your heart and your flesh cry out for the living
   God?

   Well, praise God for what you have heard! You have heard the faults of
   the preacher--let him mourn them. You have heard his Master's message!
   Do you bless God for that? Scarcely will you ever hear a sermon which
   may not make you sing if you are in a right frame of mind. George
   Herbert says, "Praying is the end of preaching." So it is, but praising
   is its end, too. Praise God that you hear there is a Savior! Praise God
   that you hear that the plan of salvation is very simple! Praise God
   that you have a Savior for your own soul! Praise God that you are
   pardoned, that you are saved! Praise Him for what you have heard!

   But observe, they also praised God for what they had seen. Look at the
   twentieth verse--"heard and seen." There is the sweetest music--what we
   have experienced, what we have felt within, what we have made our
   own--the things that we have made touching the King! Mere hearing may
   make some music, but the soul of song must come from seeing with the
   eye of faith! And, dear Friends, you who have seen with that God-given
   eyesight--I pray you, let not your tongues be steeped in sinful
   silence! Speak loudly to the praise of Sovereign Grace!

   One point for which they praised God was the agreement between what
   they had heard and what they had seen. Observe the last sentence. "As
   it was told unto them." Have you not found the Gospel to be in
   yourselves just what the Bible said it would be? Jesus said He would
   give you Grace--have you not had it? He promised you rest--have you not
   received it? He said that you should have joy and comfort and life
   through believing in Him--have you not had all these? Are not His ways
   ways of pleasantness and His paths, paths of peace? Surely you can say
   with the queen of Sheba, "The half has not been told me."

   I have found Christ more sweet than His servants could set Him forth as
   being. I looked upon the likeness as they painted it, but it was a mere
   daub as compared with Himself--the King in His beauty! I have heard of
   the goodly land, but oh, it flows with milk and honey more richly and
   sweetly than men were ever able to tell me in their best trim for
   speech. Surely what we have seen keeps pace with what we have heard!
   Let us, then, glorify and praise God for what He has done.

   This word to those who are not yet converted and I have done. I do not
   think you can begin at the seventeenth verse, but I wish you would
   begin at the eighteenth. You cannot begin at the seventeenth--you
   cannot tell to others what you have not felt. Do not try it. Neither
   teach in the Sunday school, nor attempt to preach if you are not
   converted. Unto the wicked, God says, "What have you to do to declare
   My statutes?" But I would to God you would begin with the eighteenth
   verse--wondering! Wondering that you are spared--wondering that you are
   out of Hell--wondering that still does His good Spirit strive with the
   chief of sinners! Wonder that this morning the Gospel should have a
   word for you after all your rejections of it and sins against God!

   I should like you to begin there because then I should have good hope
   that you would go on to the next verse and change the first letter and
   so go from wondering to pondering. Oh Sinner, I wish you would ponder
   the doctrines of the Cross. Think of your sin, God's wrath, judgment,
   Hell, your Savior's blood, God's love, forgiveness, acceptance,
   Heaven--think on these things! Go from wondering to pondering!

   And then I would to God you could go on to the next verse, from
   pondering to glorifying. Take Christ! Look to Him! Trust Him! Then
   sing, "I am forgiven," and go your way a believing sinner and therefore
   a saved sinner, washed in the blood, and clean! Then go back, after
   that, to the seventeenth verse and begin to tell others.

   But as for you Christians who are saved, I want you to begin this very
   afternoon at the seventeenth--

   "Then will I tell to sinners round What a dear Savior I have found!
   I'll point to Your redeeming blood, And say--'Behold, the way to God!'"
   Then when the day is over, get up to your chambers and wonder, admire
   and adore! Spend half an hour also like Mary in pondering and
   treasuring up the day's work and the day's hearing in your hearts and
   then close all with that which never must close--go on tonight,
   tomorrow and all the days of your life, glorifying and praising God for
   all the things that you have seen and heard!

   May the Master bless you for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

                                  Last Things

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 31, 1865, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "At the last." Proverbs 5:11

   THE wise man saw the young and simple straying into the house of the
   strange woman. The house seemed so completely different from what he
   knew it to be that he desired to shed a light upon it, that the young
   man might not sin in the dark, but might understand the nature of his
   deeds. The wise man looked abroad and he saw but one lamp suitable to
   his purpose. It was named, "At the last." So, snatching this, he held
   it up in the midst of the strange woman's den of infamy and everything
   was changed from what it had been before--the truth had come to light
   and the deceptive had vanished.

   The young man dreamed of pleasure. In wanton dalliance he hoped to find
   delight. But when the lamp of "At the last" began to shine, he saw
   rottenness in his bones, filthiness in his flesh. He saw pains and
   griefs and sorrows as the necessary consequence of sin and, wisely
   guided, wisely taught, the simple-minded started back and listened to
   the admonitions of the teacher, "Come not near the door of her house,
   for her gates lead down to the chambers of death."

   Now if this lamp of "At the last" was found so useful in this one
   particular case, I think it must be equally useful everywhere else! And
   it may help us all to understand the truth of matters if we will look
   at them in the light which this wonderful lamp yields. I can only
   compare my text in its matchless power to Ithuriel's spear with which,
   according to Milton, he touched the toad and straightway Satan appeared
   in his true colors. If I can apply my text to certain things today,
   they will come out in their true light. "At the last," shall be the rod
   in my hand with which I shall touch tinsel and it shall disappear, and
   you will see it is not gold. I will touch varnish and paint and
   graining and you shall understand that they are really what they are
   and not what they profess to be--the light of "At the last" shall be
   the light of Truth--the light of Wisdom to our souls.

   It seems to me a fitting occasion for holding up this light this
   morning, when we have come to the end of the year and shall, in a few
   short hours, be at the beginning of another. This period, like Janus,
   has two faces looking back on the year that is past and looking forward
   on the year that is to come. And my four-sided lamp will, perhaps,
   gleam afar. I wish that, in the light of the beams of this lamp, "At
   the last," you may have courage enough to look down the vista of the
   years that you have already lived and think of everything that you have
   thought and spoken and done. And then I hope you will have holy daring
   enough to let the same light shine forward on the years yet to come,
   when your hair shall be gray and the teeth shall fail, and they that
   look out of the windows shall be darkened.

   We will, then, examine the past and the future of life in the light of,
   "At the last." May it teach us wisdom and make us walk in the fear of
   God. I have said that my lamp has four sides to it and so it has--we
   will look at it first in the light which streams from death.

   I. DEATH is at the last. In some sense it is the last of this mortal
   life. It is the last of our period of trial here below. It is the last
   of the days of Divine Grace. It is the last of the days of mortal sin.
   The tree falls when we die and it sprouts not again. The house is
   washed from the foundations and it is built no more if it has been
   founded on sin. Death is the end of this present life. And how certain
   is it to all of us! This year we have had many tokens of its certainty.
   One might almost compose an almanac for the year 1865 and put down the
   name of someone of note at least to every month--and I should scarcely
   exaggerate if I said to every week in the year.

   All ranks and classes have been made to feel the arrow of the
   insatiable Archer. From royalty down to poverty the grave has been
   glutted with its prey. Not late in the year there fell one whose
   benevolence mingled with wisdom had blessed our land and who, being
   dead, is still remembered by the needy because he cheapened their bread
   and broke down the laws which, while they might have fattened the rich,
   certainly would have impoverished the poor. His wisdom could not spare
   him, and though he is embalmed in the hearts of thousands, yet to the
   dust he has returned.

   Swiftly after him there fell one who ruled a mighty people in the flush
   of victory, when what threatened to be a disruption and a separation
   had ended in triumph to one side and the nation seemed as if it were
   about to start on a fresh course of prosperity. By the assassin's hand
   he fell. Whatever question there might have been about him in his life,
   all men conspired to honor him in his death. The ruler of a nation who
   could subdue a gallant and a mighty foe, could not subdue that old
   foeman who conquers whom he wills. Abraham Lincoln died as well as
   Cobden!

   And there was he who had saved many precious lives by warning mariners
   of the approaching storm and thus many a ship had remained in harbor
   and been delivered from the merciless jaws of the deep. But he could
   not forecast or escape himself the last dread storm. He, too, must go
   down into that fathomless deep which swallows all mankind. Then, when
   the year was ripe and the flowers were all in bloom--fit season for his
   going--there was taken away the man who has garnished our nation with
   objects of beauty and of joy. A man who loved the flowers and sleeps
   beneath them now. Like flowers, he withered as all of us must do--Sir
   Joseph Paxton died.

   Then in the month of September, when the year began to wane, three men,
   at least, who had walked with their staff to Heaven and read the
   spheres--astronomers who predicted eclipses and told of comets, men of
   fame and name--three fell at once! They might tell the eclipse, but
   they, themselves, must be eclipsed. And they might foretell the track
   of the comet, but they, themselves, are gone from us just as those
   meteoric stars are gone. Then you will remember well, when the year had
   waned, grown old, it is but a day or two ago, that all were startled by
   the death of that young old man who had ruled our nation so long and on
   the whole so well.

   We shall not forget that he was taken away from us, who was, in some
   respects, a king throughout our land. Wisdom, cheerfulness, youthful
   strength such as he possessed could not avert the time of death. And
   then, as if the muster roll were not complete--as if Death could not be
   satisfied till the year had yielded up yet another grave--we heard that
   the oldest of monarchs had been taken away. And though his goodness and
   his wisdom had guided well the little nation over which he ruled and
   given him an influence far more extensive than his own sphere, yet
   death spared him not and Leopold must die.

   It has been a year of dying rather than of living and you may look upon
   yourselves and wonder that you are here! Some greener than we are have
   been cut down. You that are ripe, are you ready? It is marvelous that
   although so ripe you should have been spared so long. Now in the light
   of all these deaths, I want you to look upon mortal sins. They
   sculpture angels upon gravestones sometimes. Then let each angel from
   the gravestone speak to us this morning and we will listen to his
   words, for wise and solemn they will surely be and worthy of our
   notice, as if he had risen from the dead. Let me take you upstairs to
   your own dying chamber, for there, perhaps, the lamp will burn best for
   you.

   Look at actions which you have thought to be great and upon which you
   have prided yourself--how will they look at the last? You made money.
   You made money fast. You did the thing very cleverly. You praised
   yourself for it, just as others have praised themselves for conquering
   nations, or forcing their way to fame, or lifting themselves into
   eminence. Now you are dying and what do you think of all that? Is it so
   great as it seemed to be? Oh, how you leaped up to it, how you strained
   yourself to reach it and you have got it and you are dying! What do you
   think of it now? The greatest of human actions will appear to be
   insignificant when we come to die and especially those upon which men
   most pride themselves--these will yield them the bitterest humiliation.

   We shall then say what madmen we must have been to have wasted so much
   time and energy upon such paltry things. When we shall discover that
   they were not real, that they were but mere bubbles, mere pretences, we
   shall then look upon ourselves as demented to have spent the whole of
   our life and of our energy upon them. Let us look at our selfish
   actions in that light. A man says, "I know how to make money, and I
   know how to keep it, too--and he prides himself that he is not such a
   fool as to be generous, nor such a simpleton as to give either to God
   or to the poor. Now, there he lies.

   Ah, do you know how to keep it now? Can you take it with you? Can you
   bear so much as a single farthing of it across the river of death? You
   are come to the water's side--how much of it will you carry through? Ah
   Fool! How much wiser had you been if you had laid up your treasure in
   Heaven, where neither moth nor rust does corrupt! You called such men
   fools when you were living. What do you think of them now, that you are
   dying? Who is the fool--he that sent his goods beforehand--or he that
   stored them up here to leave them everlastingly? Everything that is
   selfish will look beggarly when we come to die! But everything which,
   in the sight of God we have done for Christ's sake--that has been
   generous and self-denying and noble--will even amidst the vaults of
   death sparkle with celestial splendor!

   Some of you have been, during this week, giving to the cause of God
   right generously, for which I thank you--I think I may also do it in my
   Master's name--and when I have thought of it, I have said to myself,
   "Surely, when they come to die, they shall, none of them, regret that
   they have served the cause of God. Ah, if they have even given to the
   pinching of themselves, it shall be no source of sorrow when they come
   to the dying bed that they did it unto one of the least of God's little
   ones."

   Look at your actions in the light of death and the selfish ones shall
   soon pass. I would also, dear Friends, that some of you would look at
   your self-righteousness in the light of death. You have been very good
   people, very upright, honest, moral, amiable, generous and so on. And
   you are resting on what you are. Do you think this will bear your
   weight when you come to die? When you are in good health any form of
   religion may satisfy, but a dying soul wants more than sand to rest on.
   You will want the Rock of Ages. Then let me assure you that in the
   light of the grave, all confidence, except confidence in the blood and
   righteousness of Jesus Christ, is a clear delusion! Fly from it, I
   beseech you. Why will you repose beneath a Jonah's gourd that will die
   before the worm? Seek a better shelter--cling to the Rock of Ages! Find
   the shadow of a great Rock in a weary land.

   The same, I may say, of all confidence in the efficacy of ceremonies
   and sacraments. When we are in good health it seems a sufficiently
   satisfactory thing to have been baptized and to have taken the
   sacrament and to go to church and read prayers and all that--and one
   can get some little water out of those wells while one is strong and
   joyous. But when you come to be sick and to die, let me tell you,
   sacraments will be nothing to you! Baptism and the Lord's Supper, will,
   alike deceive you if you rest on them! When you come to die you will
   find them to be supports too frail to bear the weight of an immortal
   soul's eternal interests. It will be in vain when you lie dying, if God
   gives you a quickened conscience, to say, "I went to church or to
   meetings so many times a day." You will find it a poor bandage to your
   soul's wounds to be able to say, "I made a profession of godliness."

   Oh your shams will all be torn away from you by the rough hand of the
   skeleton, Death! You will need a real Savior, vital godliness, true
   regeneration--not baptismal regeneration! You will need Christ, not
   sacraments! And nothing short of this will do "at the last." And, dear
   Friends, let me ask as I hold up the light, How will sin appear when we
   come to die? It is pleasant now and we can excuse it, calling it a
   peccadillo, a little trivial mistake, a juvenile error and imprudence
   and so on. But how will sin appear when you come to die? The grim
   ghosts of our iniquities, if they have not been laid in the grave of
   Christ Jesus, will haunt our dying bed. That ghastly chamberlain, with
   fingers bloody and red, will draw the curtain round about us!

   What a horrid prospect, to be shut in with our sins forever! To be
   dying with no comrades about the bed to comfort, but with the
   remembrances of the past to terrify and to alarm! Think, I pray you,
   not only upon the root and principle of evil, but upon the fruit of it!
   Remember that the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal
   life! Do not consider what the thing looks like today, but what will it
   be in the end? You warm the viper in your bosom, but how will you bear
   its sting when you shall come to lie upon your last bed? The sea, I
   know, is smooth and calm to you for a moment--but remember, there are
   storms, there are hurricanes that sweep it--and what will your poor
   boat do without Christ for its Pilot when the dread storm of Death
   shall come?

   I wish I could, in imagination, take you down, down, down to the waters
   of death where you shall feel your feet sinking in the dread sand of
   uncertainty and hear the booming of the distant sea and your spirit
   shall begin to ask, "What is that ocean that I hear?" And there shall
   come back an answer, "You hear the breaking of the everlasting waves.
   The bottomless sea of eternity is that to which you are descending."
   You shall feel its chill floods as they come from the ankles to the
   knees and from the knees to the loins. And you will find it, (if you
   are without Christ), not a river to swim in, but an ocean to be drowned
   in forever, forever, FOREVER!

   Oh, may God help you to look at present joys and actions and thoughts
   and doings in the light of death! What a contrast there is often
   between the life of man and his death! You would praise some men if you
   only saw their lives, but, when you see their deaths, you change your
   mind. There is Moses--he may be the King of Egypt, but he gives up
   royalty and all its tempting joys. On the mount it is offered to him to
   be made the founder of a mighty race--a desire always prominent in the
   Eastern mind. But, instead of desiring himself to be made a great
   nation, he, unselfishly, desires even to be blotted out of the Book of
   Life if God will but spare his people Israel! And what does Moses get
   for it all? His only earthly reward is to be the leader of a crew of
   slaves who are perpetually rebelling against him and vexing the Holy
   Spirit.

   Now there is Balaam, on the other hand. He has visitations from God.
   And when Balak, the son of Zippor, begs him to curse Israel, he cannot,
   though he is quite willing to go as far as he can. He is compelled, by
   the inward Holy Spirit, to bless the people! But, after he has done
   that, for gain and for reward, he plots a plan against Israel by which
   they were cursed--he bids them send out the women of Moab to lead
   astray the children of Israel. Now there he goes, with his treasures of
   silver and gold, back to his own house! The shrewd and busy worldly man
   says, "That is the man for me--do not tell me about your meek Moses
   that is afraid of doing this and that and will not look after the main
   chance. He has thrown away a kingdom and now he has thrown away the
   chance of being the head of a nation!

   "That is the man to make money--Balaam--he will be a common counselor,
   or an alderman, or lord mayor one day! A man must not stick too much at
   things--he must go ahead and make hay while the sun shines--

   'There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which, taken at the flood,
   leads on to fortune.' That is the man for me who knows when to launch
   out on the waters and who does not ask if they are dirty or clean if
   they only waft him onward to wealth and success." Ah, but they come to
   die and Balaam dies--where? He had prayed, "Let my last end be like
   his"--like the righteous--and he died in battle, fighting against the
   righteous and against the God of the righteous. And hard by that very
   spot Moses also died and you know how?--With visions of Canaan upon his
   eyes melting into visions of the Canaan which is above--the New
   Jerusalem, which is the mother of us all!

   In that death, who would not be Moses? Let who will, be Balaam in life.
   Be it yours and mine to aspire to be like Moses, both living and dying.
   "At the last!" Think of that and whenever you are tempted by sin, or
   tempted by gain-- look at it--"At the last," "At the last." God help
   you to judge righteous judgment.

   II. And now we will turn to the second side of our lantern. The second
   of these last things is JUDGMENT. After death the judgment. When we
   die, we die not. When a man dies, shall he live again? Yes, that he
   shall--for his spirit never dies. God has made us such strange wondrous
   beings, with such wide reaching hopes and such far darting aspirations,
   that it is not possible we should die and become extinct! The beast has
   no longing for immortality. You never hear it sigh for celestial
   regions--it has no dread of judgment, because there is no second
   life--no judgment for the beast that perishes.

   But the God who gives to man the dread of things to come and makes him
   feel and long after something better than this small globe affords
   us--cannot have mocked us, cannot have made us more wretched than the
   beast that perishes-- by giving us passions and desires never to be
   gratified. We are immortal, every one of us! And when the stars go out
   and Sol's great furnace is extinguished for want of fuel, and, like a
   vesture, God's wide universe shall be rolled up, we shall still be
   living a life as eternal as the Eternal God Himself! Oh, when we leave
   this world we are told that after death there comes a judgment to us. I
   do not know how it is with you--you may be more accustomed to courts of
   justice than I am-- but there always creeps a solemnity over me, even
   in a common court of justice among men and especially when a man is
   being tried for his life.

   Laughter seems hushed there and everything is solemn. How much more
   dread will be that Court where men shall be tried for their eternal
   lives--where their souls--rather than their bodies, shall be at stake?
   The judgment of one's fellows is not to be despised. A bold good man
   can afford to laugh at the world's opinion, but still it is trying to
   him, for one's fellows may be right. Multitudes of men, if they have
   really thought upon the matter, may not all be wrong. It is not easy to
   stand at the bar of public opinion and receive the verdict of
   condemnation. But what will it be to stand at the bar of God, who is
   greater than all, and to receive from Him the sentence of damnation?
   God save us from that!

   Let us think of this judgment a moment. We shall rise from the dead. We
   shall be there in body as well as spirit. These very bodies will stand
   upon the earth at the last day when Christ shall come and the trumpet
   shall sound. His people shall rise at the first resurrection, and the
   wicked shall rise, also. And in their flesh shall they see God. Let me
   think of all that I have done, then, in the light of that. There will
   be present every man who has ever lived on earth. How shall I like to
   have all my doings published there?

   My very thoughts! How shall I feel when they are read aloud? What I
   whispered in the ear in the closet--how shall I like to have that
   proclaimed with the sound of a trumpet? And what I did in the dark--how
   shall I care to have that revealed in the light? And yet these things
   must be made known before the assembled universe. There will be present
   there my enemies. If I have treated them ill, if I have been a
   backbiter, a slanderer, it will be then declared--if I have been a
   hypocrite and a dissembler and made others think me true when I have
   been false, then I shall be unmasked.

   Those I have injured will be there. With what alarm will the debauchee
   see those whom he has seduced stand with fiery eyes to accuse him! With
   what horror will the oppressor see the widow and the fatherless, whom
   he drove to poverty, stand there as swift witnesses against him to
   condemnation! If I have spread false doctrine, a moral pestilence
   destroying human souls--my victims shall be there to gather round me in
   a circle and, like dogs that bay the stag--will, each of them, demand
   my blood! They shall all be there, friends and foes!

   More solemn still, "He" shall be there--the Man of men, the grandest
   among men--God, as well as Man--and if I have despised and rejected His
   salvation, I shall then see Him in another fashion and after another
   sort--

   "The Lord shall come! But not the same As once in lowliness He came, A
   silent Lamb before His foes, A weary Man and full of woes. The Lord
   shall come! A dreadful form, With rainbow-wreath and robes of storm, On
   cherub wings and wings of wind, Appointed Judge of all mankind!" How
   will you face Him, you that have despised Him? You who have doubted His
   Deity, how will you bear the blaze of it? You rejected and trampled on
   His precious blood, how will you bear the weight of His almighty arm?
   When on the Cross you would not receive Him, and when on the Throne you
   shall not escape from Him. That silver scepter which He stretches out
   now to you, if you refuse to touch it, shall be laid aside and He will
   take one of another metal--a rod of iron--and He shall break you in
   pieces. Yes, He shall dash you in pieces like potters' vessels.

   And God shall be there, manifestly there--that God who is here this
   morning, on the last day of this year--and who sees your thoughts and
   reads your minds at this moment, but who is so invisible that you
   forget that He fills this place and fills all places! You shall not be
   able to forget Him, then. Your eyes shall see Him in that day. You
   shall understand His Presence. You will try to hide from Him--would
   desire Hell itself and think it a place of shelter--if you could escape
   from Him! But everywhere His fire shall encircle you, shall consume
   you, for "our God is a consuming fire." You shall no more be able to
   escape from yourself than from God. You shall find Him as present with
   you as your own soul will be and you shall feel His hand of fire
   searching for the chords of your soul and sweeping with a doleful
   Miserere all the heart strings of your spirit. Misery unspeakable must
   be yours when the voice of the God-Man, shall say, "Depart, you cursed,
   into everlasting fire in Hell."

   I would to God that you would look at all your actions in the light of
   the Day of Judgment. Our secret thoughts, let us turn them over this
   morning. They have been lying by till they are moldy--let us bring them
   forth today. My Thoughts, how will you look in the light of judgment?
   My professions, my imaginations, my conceptions, how will they all be
   when the Judgment Day shall gleam upon them? My profession, how does
   that look? I have been baptized in Christ professedly. I wear a
   Christian name, I preach the Gospel, I am a Church officer or a Church
   member--how will all this bear the light of that tremendous day?

   When I am put in the scales and weighed, shall I be the weight that I
   am labeled? In that dreadful day shall I see the handwriting on the
   wall, "Mene, Tekel, Upharsin"--"you are weighed in the balances and
   found wanting"? Or shall I hear the gracious sentence which shall
   pronounce me saved in Jesus Christ? As to my Graces, what must they be
   in the light of judgment? My own salvation, all the matters of
   experience and knowledge--how do they all look in that light? I think I
   have believed--I think I love the Savior--I sometimes hope that I am
   His--but am I so? Shall I be found to be a true Believer at the last?
   Will my love be mere cant or true affection? Will my Graces be mere
   talk, or will they be found to be the work of God the Holy Spirit?

   Am I vitally united to Christ or not? Am I a mere pretender, or a true
   possessor of the things eternal? Oh, my Soul, set these questions in
   the light of that tremendous day! I would to God we could now go
   forward to the Day of

   Judgment, in thought at any rate. And since I feel myself quite unable
   to lead you there, let me adopt my Savior's words--He says that the day
   comes when He shall separate the righteous from the wicked as the
   shepherd divides the sheep from the goats. There shall be some on His
   left hand to whom He shall say, "I was hungry and you gave Me no meat.
   I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink. Sick and in prison, and you
   visited Me not. Depart, you cursed." Will He say that to you and to me?

   There will be some on His right hand to whom He will say, "Come, you
   blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from before
   the foundation of the world." Shall He say that to you and to me? The
   one or the other it must be. As I stand here this morning, I seem to
   feel, on my own account, and I wish you all did on yours, what a
   certain man in court once felt. Sentence was about to be given in his
   case, or, at least he thought the case would be called on immediately
   and he rushed to his solicitor and he said, "Is there one thing left
   undone? Are you sure? For if I lose this case I am a ruined man." His
   face was white with anxiety. And so it is with you. Is there one thing
   left undone? For if you lose this case at God's Judgment Seat you are a
   ruined man!

   Come Hearer, have you believed on Christ Jesus, or is faith left
   undone? Have you given up self-righteousness? Have you left your sin?
   Have you given your heart to the Savior? Is regeneration still
   unaccomplished? Are you born again? Are you in Christ? Are you saved?
   If your case is lost you are a ruined man! A man ruined here may still
   retrieve his fortunes. The bankrupt may start again and yet be rich.
   The captain who has lost a battle may renew the fight and win the next
   victory and begin the campaign anew. But lose the battle of life and
   the fight shall be no more. Make bankruptcy in this life's business and
   you have no more trading. This is the business of eternity!

   Soul, is there anything left undone? Brother, Sister, is there anything
   left undone? For if you lose this case, you are ruined and that to all
   eternity. I pray you to look at this day and at all your days, past and
   the future, in the light of the Day of Judgment.

   III. But my lamp--this matchless lamp--has a third side to it, bright,
   gleaming like a cluster of stars! The third of the last things is
   HEAVEN, the portion, I trust, of many of us. We hope, when days and
   years have passed, that full many of us will meet to part no more on
   the other side of Jordan, in Heaven. Now, let us see if we can cast a
   little light from Heaven upon the things present and the things past.

   You have been toiling--toiling very hard, and wiping the sweat from
   your brow and saying, "My lot is not a desirable one. Oh how weary I
   am! I cannot bear it." Courage, Brother! Courage, Sister! There is rest
   for the weary. There is eternal rest for the beloved of the Lord and
   when you shall arrive in Heaven, how little, how utterly insignificant
   your toil will seem, even if it shall have lasted threescore years and
   ten! You are pained much. Even now pain shoots through your body. You
   do not often know what it is to have an easy hour and you half murmur,
   "Why am I thus? Why did God deal so harshly with me?"

   Think of Heaven, where the inhabitants shall no more say, "I am sick"!
   Where there are no groans to mingle with the songs that warble from
   immortal tongues. Courage, tried One! It will soon be over! It is but a
   pin's prick or a moment's pang and then eternal Glory! Be of good cheer
   and let your patience not fail you. And so you have been slandered. On
   your face, for Christ's dear name, shame and reproach have been cast
   and you are ready to give up. Come, Man, look before you! Can you not
   hear the acclamations of the angels as the conquerors receive, one by
   one, their eternal crowns? What? Will you not fight when there is so
   much to be won? Must you be carried to the skies on flowery beds of
   ease? You must fight if you would reign!

   Gird up the loins of your mind and have respect to the recompense of
   reward. In the light of Heaven the shame of earth will seem to be less
   than nothing and vanity! And so you have had many losses and
   crosses--you were once well-to-do--but you are now poor. You will have
   to go home today to a very poor abode and to a scanty meal. Oh, but
   Beloved, you will not be there long. "In My Father's house are many
   mansions." It is but an inn you are tarrying at awhile and, if the
   accommodation is rough, you are gone tomorrow--so complain not! I would
   to God we could look upon all our actions in the light of Heaven--I
   mean those who are Believers in Jesus Christ. If we could have regrets
   hereafter, I think it would be that we did not do more than we did for
   Christ here below.

   In Heaven they cannot feed Christ's poor, cannot teach the ignorant.
   They can extol Him with songs of praise, but there are some things in
   which we have the preference over them--they cannot clothe the naked,
   or visit the sick, or speak words of cheer to those that are
   disconsolate. If there is anything that can give joy in Heaven, surely
   it will be in looking back on the Divine Grace which enabled us to
   serve the Master! Oh, if I can win souls to Christ I shall be a gainer
   as well as you! I shall have another Heaven in their Heaven, another
   joy, as it were, in their life and another happiness in their souls'
   happiness. And, dear Brothers and Sisters, if in your Sunday school
   teaching, or visiting, or talking to others you can bring any to Glory,
   you will, if it is possible, multiply your Heaven and make it all the
   more glad and joyful!

   Now, look at the life of some Christians. They come here and if I
   preach what they call a good sermon, they like it and drink it in. They
   are willing to eat the fat and drink the sweet, but what do they do for
   Christ? Nothing! What do they give for Christ? Hardly anything. There
   are a few such among us and these are generally the most miserable
   people you meet with--neither a comfort to others, nor any joy to
   themselves. Now, even in Heaven, I think, though no sorrow should be
   there, it will be only God's wiping it away that will keep them from
   regretting that they did not do what they might have done on earth!

   We are saved by Grace, blessed be God--by Grace alone--but, being
   saved, we do desire to make known the savor of Christ in every place,
   and we believe in Heaven we shall have joy in having made this known
   among the sons of men. Look at your joy in the light of Heaven and you
   will make it other than it now looks.

   IV. We now turn to the fourth of the four last things and that is, let
   us look at all things in the light of HELL, that dread and dismal
   light, the glare of the fiery abyss. Bring that lantern here. Here is a
   young man very merry. "Ho! Ho!" he sings, "Christians are fools." Hold
   my light up. There you are without God, without hope, with the great
   iron gate of Death shut upon you and barred forever, your body in the
   flames of Tophet and your soul in the yet more horrible flames of the
   wrath of God.

   Who is the fool now? Oh, when your spirits are damned, as they must be
   if you live without a Savior, you will think laughing a poor thing.
   Laugh now, Sir! Scoff now! For a few minutes' merriment you sold
   eternal joys. You had a mess of pottage and you ate it in haste and you
   sold your birthright. What do you think of it now? It is an awful thing
   that men should be content--for a few short hours of silly mirth--to
   fling away their souls! Look at merriment in the glare of the flames of
   Hell.

   Mark that man in agony down in the vault of Hell. He made money by sin
   and there he is. He gained the whole world and lost his own soul. How
   does it look now? "I would give thirty thousand pounds," said an
   English gentleman when he lay dying, "if any man would prove to me to a
   demonstration, that there is no Hell." Yes, but if he had given thirty
   thousand worlds that could not be proved and now, with pangs
   unutterable, he knows it is so. What would you give, when once you are
   lost, if you could throw back your gains? If lost spirits could return
   here, surely they would do what Judas did--throw down the thirty pieces
   of silver in the temple and curse themselves that they ever took the
   gain of this world and destroyed their souls.

   And how will unbelief look in the flames of Hell? There are no infidels
   anywhere but on earth--there are none in Heaven and there are none in
   Hell. Atheism is a strange thing. Even the devils never fell into that
   vice, for, "the devils believe and tremble." And there are some of the
   devil's children that have gone beyond their father in sin, but how
   will it look when they are forever lost? When God's foot crushes them,
   they will not be able to doubt His existence. When He tears them in
   pieces and there is none to deliver, then their sophistical syllogisms,
   their empty logic, their brags and bravadoes will be of no avail! Oh,
   that they had been wise and had not darkened their foolish hearts, but
   had turned unto the living God!

   And, my dear Hearers, I have another thought which will come home to
   some of your spirits with peculiar power. How will procrastination seem
   when once you get there? Some of you have been attending this place a
   long time--you have often had impressions, but you have always said,
   "By and by." "By and by." You have been aroused and aroused again, but
   still it has been, "Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow." How will tomorrow
   ring in your ears when once you are lost? What would you not give for
   another day of mercy, another hour of Divine Grace?

   I feel, this morning, as if I would do with you what the Roman
   Ambassadors did with Antiochus. They met him and asked him whether he
   meant war or peace. He said he must see. And one of them, taking his
   staff, made a circle round him where he stood and said, "You must
   answer before you leave that spot. If you step out of that it is war.
   Now, war or peace?" And I, too, would draw a secret circle round you in
   the pew this morning and say to you, "Which shall it be, sin or
   holiness, self or Christ? Shall it be Grace or enmity, Heaven or Hell?"

   And I pray you answer that question in the light of Hell. It is a dread
   light, but it is a revealing one. It is a fire that will devour the
   scales that are about your blind eyes. God grant that it may scorch
   those scales away, that you may see now how dreadful a thing it is to
   be an enemy to God and be led by His Holy Spirit to apply to Jesus
   Christ even now. Ah, how will the Gospel seem in the light of Hell and
   how will your indifference to it seem? When I was thinking of preaching
   this morning, I wished that I could preach as in that light. To think
   that there are some to whom I have spoken again and again, who during
   this year have passed away from the world of hope, we fear, into the
   land of despair is a dreadful thought!

   Persons that occupied these pews, sat in these aisles, stood far away
   there and listened and heard the Gospel--and they are gone! Did I warn
   them fairly, truly? If not--"If you warn them not they shall perish,
   but their blood will I require at your hands." My God, by the blood of
   the Savior, set me free from these men! Oh deliver me from that solemn
   condemnation! But with those of you that still live, I would be clear
   of you. Dear Hearers, do you not feel that you are mortal? Have not you
   within you a sense that you are dying? It is a thought that is always
   with me. Life seems so short. It was not so always with me--but the
   shortness of life now seems to hang over my mind perpetually and I
   suppose it must do so over those of you who are thirty, forty, fifty,
   or sixty and who frequently see your friends taken away.

   Now, since you must soon be gone. Since there is a world to come and
   you believe there is, how can some of you play with these things? How
   is it that while you are attentive to your business, you leave your
   soul's business neglected? What are you waiting for, my Hearer? Are you
   waiting for another season? Does not God say, "Now is the accepted
   time. Now is the day of salvation"? What are you waiting for? Does not
   the time past suffice?

   Oh that you were wise and would think of your latter end and seek after
   God! I conjure you, by the shortness of life, by the certainty of
   death, by the terrors ofjudgment, by the glories of Heaven, by the
   pains of Hell--seek after the right way and walk in it. Christ Jesus
   came into the world to save sinners. This is the Gospel, "Whoever
   believes is not condemned." To believe is to trust. Oh that you may
   have Divine Grace to trust your souls with the Lord Jesus now and
   forever and then we shall not need to fear those words, "At the last,"
   nor the light of the four last things, Death and Judgment, Heaven and
   Hell.

   God bless you, for His name's sake.

   "Soon the whole, like a parched scroll, Shall before my amazed sight
   unroll, And without a screen at one burst be seen, The presence wherein
   I have ever been."
