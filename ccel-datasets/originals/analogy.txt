  PREFIXED TO THE FIRST EDITION.

   IF the reader should meet here with any thing which he had not before
   attended to, it will not be in the observations upon the constitution
   and course of nature, these being all obvious; but in the application
   of them: in which, though there is nothing but what appears to me of
   some real weight, and therefore of great importance; yet he will
   observe several things, which will appear to him of very little, if he
   can think things to be of little importance, which are of any real
   weight at all, upon such a subject as religion. However, the proper
   force of the following Treatise lies in the whole general analogy
   considered together.

   It is come, I know not how, to be taken for granted, by many persons,
   that Christianity is not so much as a subject of inquiry; but that it
   is, now at length, discovered to be fictitious. And accordingly they
   treat it, as if, in the present age, this were an agreed point among
   all people of discernment; and nothing remained, but to set it up as a
   principal subject of mirth and ridicule, as it were by way of
   reprisals, for its having so long interrupted the pleasures of the
   world. On the contrary, thus much, at least, will be here found, not
   taken for granted, but proved, that any reasonable man, who will
   thoroughly consider the matter, may be as much assured, as he is of his
   own being, that it is not, however, so clear a case, that there is
   nothing in it. There is, I think, strong evidence of its truth; but it
   is certain no one can, upon principles of reason, be satisfied of the
   contrary. And the practical consequence to be drawn from this is not
   attended to by every one who is concerned in it.

DR THOMAS BALGUY,

   DEAR SIR,

   I TRUST you will excuse the liberty I have taken of prefixing your name
   to the following sheets; the latter part of which, I am confident, will
   not be thought undeserving of your approbation; and of the former part
   you will commend the intention at least, if not the execution. In
   vindicating the character of Bishop Butler from the aspersions thrown
   upon it since his death, I have but discharged a common duty of
   humanity, which survivors owe to those who have deserved well of
   mankind by their lives or writings, when they are past the power of
   appearing in their own defence. And if what I have added, by way of
   opening the general design of the Works of this great Prelate, be of
   use in exciting the younger class of Students in our Universities to
   read, and so to read as to understand, the Two Volumes prepared and
   published by the Author himself; I flatter myself I shall have done no
   inconsiderable service to Morality and Religion. Your time and studies
   have been long successfully devoted to the support of the same great
   cause: and in what you have lately given to the world, both as an
   Author and an Editor, you have largely contributed to the defence of
   our common Christianity, and of what was esteemed by One, who was
   perfectly competent to judge, its best Establishment, the Church of
   England. In the present publication I consider myself as a
   fellow-labourer with you in the same design, and tracing the path you
   have trod before, but at great distance, and with unequal paces. When,
   by His Majesty's goodness, I was raised to that state of eminence in
   the Church, to which you had been first names, and which on account of
   the infirmity of your health, you had desired to decline; it was honour
   enough for me on such an occasion to have been thought of next to you:
   and I know of no better rule by which to govern my conduct, so as not
   to discredit the Royal Hand which conferred on me so signal and
   unmerited a favour, than in cases of difficulty to put the question to
   myself, How you would probably have acted in the same situation. You
   see, Sir, I still look up to you, as I have been wont, both as my
   Superior and my Example. That I may long reap the benefit of your
   advice and friendship; and that such a measure of health and strength
   may be continued to you, as my enable you to pass the evening of your
   days with comfort, and enjoy the blessings of the life you love; is the
   cordial wish of,

   Dear Sir.

   Your very affectionate

   and faithful Servant,

   S. GLOUCESTER.

PREFACE BY THE EDITOR

   "When I consider how light a matter very often subjects the best
   established characters to the suspicions of posterity, posterity often
   as malignant to virtue as the age that saw it was envious of its glory;
   and how ready a remote age is to catch at a low revived slander, which
   the times that brought it forth saw despised and forgotten almost in
   its birth; I cannot but think it a matter that deserves
   attention."--Letter to the Editor of the Letters on the Spirit of
   Patriotism, &c., by Bishop Warburton. See his Works, vol. vii. p. 547.

   THE Charge to the Clergy of the Diocese of Durham was printed and
   published in the year 1751, by the learned Prelate whose name it bears;
   and, together with the Sermons and Analogy of the same writer, both too
   well known to need a more particular description, completes the
   collection of his Works. It has long been considered as a matter of
   curiosity, on account of its scarceness; and it is equally curious on
   other accounts--its subject, and the calumny to which it gave occasion,
   of representing the Author as addicted to superstition, as inclined to
   popery, and as dying in the communion of the Church of Rome. The
   improved edition of the Biographia Britannica, published under the care
   of Dr Kippis, having unavoidably brought this calumny again into
   notice, it may not be unseasonable to offer a few reflections in this
   place, by way of obviating any impressions that may hence arise to the
   disadvantage of so great a character as that of the late Bishop Butler;
   referring those who desire a more particular account of his life, to
   the third volume of the same entertaining work, printed in 1784. art.
   BUTLER (Joseph). [1]

   I. The principal design of the Bishop in his Charge is, to exhort his
   Clergy to "do their part towards reviving a practical sense of religion
   amongst the people committed to their care;" and, as one way of
   effecting this, to "instruct them in the Importance of External
   Religion," or the usefulness of outward observances in promoting inward
   piety. Now, from the compound nature of man, consisting of two parts,
   the body and the mind, together with the influence which these are
   found to have on one another, it follows, that the religious regards of
   such a creature ought to be so framed, as to be in some way properly
   accommodated to both. A religion which is purely spiritual, stripped of
   every thing that may affect the senses, and considered only as a divine
   philosophy of the mind, if it do not mount up into enthusiasm, as has
   frequently been the case, often sinks, after a few short fervours, into
   indifference: an abstracted invisible object, like that which natural
   religion offers, ceases to move or interest the heart; and something
   further is wanting to bring it nearer, and render it more present to
   our view, than merely an intellectual contemplation. On the other hand,
   when, in order to remedy this inconvenience, recourse is had to
   instituted forms and ritual injunctions, there. is always danger lest
   men be tempted to rest entirely on these, and persuade themselves that
   a painful attention to such observances will atone for the want of
   genuine piety and virtue. Yet surely there is a way of steering safely
   between these two extremes; of so consulting both the parts of our
   constitution, that the body and the mind may concur in rendering our
   religious services acceptable to God, and at the same time useful to
   ourselves. And what way can this be, but precisely that which is
   recommended in the Charge; such a cultivation of outward as well as
   inward religion, that from both may result, what is the point chiefly
   to be laboured, and at all events to be secured, a correspondent temper
   and behaviour; or, in other words; such an application of the forms of
   godliness, as may be subservient in promoting the power and spirit of
   it? No man, who believes the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament,
   and understands what he believes, but must know, that external religion
   is as much enjoined, and constitutes as real a part of revelation, as
   that which is internal. The many ceremonies in use among the Jews, in
   consequence of a divine command; the baptism of water, as an emblem of
   moral purity; the eating and drinking of bread and wine, as symbols and
   representations of the body and blood of Christ, required of
   Christians, are proofs of this. On comparing these two parts of
   religion together, one, it is immediately seen, is of much greater
   importance than the other; and, whenever they happen to interfere, is
   always to be preferred: but does it follow from hence, that therefore
   that other is of little or no importance, and, in cases where there is
   no competition, may entirely be neglected? Or rather is not the
   legitimate conclusion directly the reverse, that nothing is to be
   looked upon as of little importance, which is of any use at all in
   preserving upon our minds a sense of the Divine authority, which
   recalls to our remembrance the obligations we are under, and helps to
   keep us, as the Scripture expresses it, "in the fear of the Lord all
   the day long?" [2] If, to adopt the instance mentioned in the Charge,
   the sight of a church should remind a man of some sentiment of piety;
   if, from the view of a material building dedicated to the service of
   God, he should be led to regard himself, his own body, as a living
   "temple of the Holy Ghost," [3] and therefore no more than the other to
   be profaned or desecrated by any thing that defileth or is impure;
   could it be truly said of such a one, that he was superstitious, or
   mistook the means of religion for the end? If, to use another, and what
   has been thought a more obnoxious instance, taken from the Bishop's
   practice, a cross, erected in a place of public worship, [4] should
   cause us to reflect on Him who died on a cross for our salvation, and
   on the necessity of our "own dying to sin," [5] and of "crucifying the
   flesh with its affection and lusts;" [6] would any worse consequences
   follow from such sentiments so excited, than if the same sentiments had
   been excited by the view of a picture, of the crucifixion suppose, such
   as is commonly placed, and with this very design, in foreign churches,
   and indeed in many of our own? Both the instances here adduced, it is
   very possible, may be far from being approved, even by those who are
   under the most sincere convictions of the importance of true religion:
   and it is easy to conceive how open to scorn and censure they must be
   from others, who think they have a talent for ridicule, and have
   accustomed themselves to regard all pretensions to piety as
   hypocritical or superstitious. But "Wisdom is justified of her
   children." [7] Religion is what it is, "whether men will hear, or
   whether they will forbear;"Ezek. ii. 5 and whatever in the smallest
   degree promotes its interests, and assists us in performing its
   commands, whether that assistance be derived from the medium of the
   body or the mind, ought to be esteemed of great weight, and deserving
   of our most serious attention.

   However, be the danger of superstition what it may, no one was more
   sensible of that danger, or more in earnest in maintaining, that
   external acts of themselves are nothing, and that moral holiness, as
   distinguished from bodily observances of every kind, is that which
   constitutes the essence of religion, than Bishop Butler. Not only the
   Charge itself, the whole intention of which is plainly nothing more
   than to enforce the necessity of practical religion, the reality as
   well as form, is a demonstration of this, but many passages besides to
   the same purpose, selected from his other writings. Take the two
   following as specimens. In his Analogy he observes thus: "Though
   mankind have, in all ages, been greatly prone to place their religion
   in peculiar positive rites, by way of equivalent for obedience to moral
   precepts; yet, without making any comparison at all between. them, and
   consequently without determining which is to have the preference, the
   nature of the thing abundantly shows all notions of that kind to be
   utterly subversive of true religion: as they are, moreover, contrary to
   the whole tenor of Scripture; and likewise to the most express
   particular declarations of it, that nothing can render us accepted of
   God, without moral virtue." [8] And to the same purpose in his Sermon,
   preached before the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, in
   February, 1738-9. "Indeed, amongst creatures naturally formed for
   religion, yet so much under the power of imagination as men are,
   superstition is an evil, which can never be out of sight. But even
   against this, true religion is a great security, and the only one. True
   religion, takes up that place in the mind, which superstition would
   usurp, and so leaves little room for at; and likewise lays us under the
   strongest obligations to oppose it. On the contrary, the danger of
   superstition cannot but be increased by the prevalence of irreligion;
   and, by its general prevalence, the evil will be unavoidable. For the
   common people, wanting a religion, will of course take up with almost
   any superstition which is thrown in their way: and in process of time,
   amidst the infinite vicissitudes of the political world, the leaders of
   parties will certainly be able to serve themselves of that
   superstition, whatever it be, which is getting ground; and will not
   fail to carry it to the utmost length their occasions require. The
   general nature of the thing shows this; and history and fact confirm
   it. It is therefore wonderful, those people who seem to think there is
   but one evil in life, that of superstition, should not see that atheism
   and profaneness must be the introduction of it." [9]

   He who can think and write in such a manner, can never be said to
   mistake the nature of real religion: and he, who, after such proofs to
   the contrary, can persist in asserting of so discreet and learned a
   person, that he was addicted to superstition, must himself be much a
   stranger both to truth and charity.

   And here it may be worth our while to observe, that the same excellent
   Prelate, who by one set of men was suspected of superstition, on
   account of his Charge, has by another been represented as leaning to
   the opposite extreme of enthusiasm, on account of his two discourses On
   the Love of God. But both opinions are equally without foundation. He
   was neither superstitious, nor an enthusiast: his mind was much too
   strong, and his habits of thinking and reasoning much too strict and
   severe, to suffer him to descend to the weaknesses of either character.
   His piety was at once fervent and rational. When impressed with a
   generous concern for the declining cause of religion, he laboured to
   revive its dying interests; nothing he judged would be more effectual
   to that end, among creatures so much engaged with bodily things, and so
   apt to be affected with whatever strongly solicits the senses, as men
   are, than a religion of such a frame as should in its exercise require
   the joint exertions of the body and the mind. On the other hand, when
   penetrated with the dignity and importance of "the first and great
   commandment," [10] love to God, he set himself to inquire, what those
   movements of the heart are, which are due to Him, the Author and Cause
   of all things; he found, in the coolest way of consideration, that God
   is the natural object of the same affections of gratitude, reverence,
   fear, desire of approbation, trust, and dependence, the same affections
   in kind, though doubtless in a very disproportionate degree, which any
   one would feel from contemplating a perfect character in a creature, in
   which goodness, with wisdom and power, are supposed to be the
   predominant qualities, with the further circumstance, that this
   creature was also his governor and friend. This subject is manifestly a
   real one; there is nothing in it fanciful or unreasonable: this way of
   being affected towards God is piety, in the strictest sense: this is
   religion, considered as a habit of mind; a religion, suited to the
   nature and condition of man. [11]

   II. From superstition to Popery, the transition is easy: no wonder
   then, that, in the progress of detraction, the simple imputation of the
   former of these, with which the attack on the character of our Author
   was opened, should be followed by the more aggravated imputation of the
   latter. Nothing, I think, can fairly be gathered in support of such a
   suggestion from the Charge, in which Popery is barely mentioned, and
   occasionally only, and in a sentence or two; yet even there, it should
   be remarked, the Bishop takes care to describe the peculiar observances
   required by it, "some as in themselves wrong and, superstitious, and
   others of them as being made subservient to the purposes of
   superstition." With respect to his other writings, any one at all
   conversant with them needs not to be told, that the matters treated of
   both in his Sermons and his Analogy did none of them directly lead him
   to consider, and much less to combat, the opinions, whether relating to
   faith or worship, which are peculiar to the Church of Rome: it might
   therefore have happened, yet without any just conclusion arising from
   thence, of being himself inclined to favour those opinions, that he had
   never mentioned, so much as incidentally, the subject of Popery at all.
   But fortunately for the reputation of the Bishop, and to the eternal
   disgrace of his calumniators, even this poor resource is wanting. to
   support their malevolence. In his Sermon at St Bride's before the Lord
   Mayor in 1740, after having said that "our laws and whole constitution
   go more upon supposition of an equality amongst mankind, than the
   constitution and laws of other countries;" he goes on to observe, that
   "this plainly requires, that more particular regard should be had to
   the education of the lower people here, than in places where they are
   born slaves of power, and to be made slaves of superstition: [12]
   meaning evidently in this place, by the general term superstition, the
   particular errors of the Romanists. This is something: but we have a
   still plainer indication what his sentiments concerning Popery really
   were, from another of his additional Sermons, I mean that before the
   House of Lords on June the 11th, 1747, the anniversary of his late
   Majesty's accession. The passage alluded to is as follows; and my
   readers will not be displeased that I give it them at length. "The
   value of our religious Establishment ought to be very much heightened
   in our esteem, by considering what it is a security from; I mean that
   great corruption of Christianity, Popery, which is ever hard at work to
   bring us again under its yoke. Whoever will consider the Popish claims,
   to the disposal of the whole earth, as of divine right, to dispense
   with the most sacred engagements, the claims to supreme absolute
   authority in religion; in short, the general claims which the Canonists
   express by the words, plenitude of power--whoever, I say, will consider
   Popery as it is professed at Rome, may see, that it is manifest, open
   usurpation of all human and divine authority. But even in those Roman
   Catholic countries where these monstrous claims are not admitted, and
   the civil power does, in many respects, restrain the papal; yet
   persecution is professed, as it is absolutely enjoined by what is
   acknowledged to be their highest authority, a general council, so
   called, with the Pope at the head of it; and is practised in all of
   them, I think, without exception, where it can be done safely. Thus
   they go on to substitute force instead of argument; and external
   profession made by force, instead of reasonable conviction. And thus
   corruptions of the grossest sort have been in vogue, for many
   generations, in many parts of Christendom; and are so still, even where
   Popery obtains in its least absurd form: and their antiquity and wide
   extent are insisted upon as proofs of their truth; a kind of proof,
   which at best can only be presumptive, but which loses all its little
   weight, in pro.. portion as the long and large prevalence of such
   corruptions have been obtained by force." [13] In another part of the
   same Sermon, where he is again speaking of our ecclesiastical
   constitution, he reminds his audience that it is to be valued, "not
   because it leaves us at liberty to have as little religion as we
   please, without being accountable to human judicatories; but because it
   exhibits to our view, and enforces upon our consciences, genuine
   Christianity, free from the superstitions with which it is defiled in
   other countries; which superstitions, he observes, "naturally tend to
   abate its force." The date of this Sermon should here be attended to.
   It was preached in June, 1747; that is, four years before the delivery
   and publication of the Charge, which was in the year 1751; and exactly
   five years before the Author died, which was in June, 1752. We have
   then, in the passages now laid before the reader, a clear and
   unequivocal proof, brought down to within a few years of Bishop
   Butler's death, that Popery was held by him in the utmost abhorrence,
   and that he regarded it in no other light, than as the great corruption
   of Christianity, and a manifest, open usurpation of all human and
   divine authority. The argument is decisive; nor will any thing be of
   force to invalidate it, unless from some after-act during the short
   remainder of the Bishop's life, besides that of delivering and printing
   his Charge (which, after what I have said here, and in the Notes added
   to this Preface and to the Charge I must have leave to consider as
   affording no evidence at all of his inclination to Papistical doctrines
   or ceremonies), the contrary shall incontrovertibly appear.

   III. One such after-act, however, has been alleged, which would
   effectually demolish all that we have urged in behalf of our Prelate,
   were it true, as is pretended, that he died in the communion of the
   Church of Rome. Had a story of this sort been invented and propagated
   by Papists, the wonder might have been less:

   Hoc Ithacus velit, et magno mercentur Atridæ.

   But to the reproach of Protestantism, the fabrication of this calumny,
   for such we shall find it, originated from among ourselves. It is
   pretty remarkable, that a circumstance so extraordinary should never
   have been divulged till the year 1767, fifteen years after the Bishop's
   decease. At that time Dr Thomas Secker was Archbishop of Canterbury;
   who of all others was the most likely to know the truth or falsehood of
   the fact asserted, having been educated with our Author in his early
   youth, and having lived in a constant habit of intimacy with him to the
   very time of his death. The good Archbishop was not silent on this
   occasion: with a virtuous indignation he stood forth to protect the
   posthumous character of his friend; and in a public newspaper, under
   the signature of Misopseudes, called upon his accuser to support what
   he had advanced, by whatever proofs he could. No proof, however, nor
   any thing like a proof, appeared in reply; and every man of sense and
   candour at that time was perfectly convinced the assertion was entirely
   groundless. [14] As a further confirmation of the rectitude of this
   judgment, it may not be amiss to mention, there is yet in existence a
   strong presumptive argument at least in its favour, drawn from the
   testimony of those who attended our Author in the sickness of which he
   died. The last days of this excellent Prelate were passed at Bath; Dr
   Nathanael Forster, his chaplain, being continually with him; and for
   one day, and at the very end of his illness, Dr Martin Benson also, the
   then Bishop of Gloucester, who shortened his own life in his pious
   haste to visit his dying friend. Both these persons constantly wrote
   letters to Dr Secker, then Bishop of Oxford, containing accounts of
   Bishop Butler's declining health, and of the symptoms and progress of
   his disorder, which, as was conjectured, soon terminated in his death.
   These letters, which are still preserved in the Lambeth library, [15] I
   have read; and not the slenderest argument can be collected from them,
   in justification of the ridiculous slander we are here considering. If
   at that awful season the Bishop was not known to have expressed any
   opinion tending to show his dislike to Popery, neither was he known to
   have said any thing, that could at all be construed in approbation of
   it; and the natural presumption is that whatever sentiments he had
   formerly entertained concerning that corrupt system of religion, he
   continued to entertain them to the last. The truth is, neither the word
   nor the idea of Popery seems once to have occurred either to the Bishop
   himself, or to those who watched his parting moments: their thoughts
   were otherwise engaged. His disorder had reduced him to such debility,
   as to render him incapable of speaking much or long on any subject: the
   few bright intervals that occurred were passed in a state of the utmost
   tranquillity and composure; and in that composure he expired. "Mark the
   perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace."
   [16] "Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be
   like his!" [17]

   Out of pure respect for the virtues of a man, whom I had never the
   happiness of knowing, or even of seeing, but from whose writings I have
   received the greatest benefit and illumination, and which I have reason
   to be thankful to Providence for having early thrown in my way, I have
   adventured, in what I have now offered to the public, to step forth in
   his defence, and to vindicate his honest fame from the attacks of
   those, who, with the vain hope of bringing down superior characters to
   their own level, are for ever at work in detracting from their just
   praise. For the literary reputation of Bishop Butler, it stands too
   high in the opinion of the world, to incur the danger of any
   diminution: but this in truth is the least of his excellences. He was
   more than a good writer, he was a good man; and what is an addition
   even to this eulogy, he was a sincere Christian. His whole study was
   directed to the knowledge and practice of sound morality and true
   religion: these he adorned by his life, and has recommended to future
   ages in his writings; in which, if my judgment be of any avail, he has
   done essential service to both, as much, perhaps, as any single person,
   since the extraordinary gifts of "the word of wisdom and the word of
   knowledge" [18] have been withdrawn.

   In what follows I propose to give a short account of the Bishop's moral
   and religious systems, as these are collected from his Works.

   I. His way of treating the subject of morals is to be gathered from the
   volume of his Sermons, and particularly from the three first, and from
   the preface to that volume.

   "There is," as our Author with singular sagacity has observed, "a much
   more exact correspondence between the natural and moral world, than we
   are apt to take notice of." [19] The inward frame of man answers to his
   outward condition; the several propensities, passions, and affections,
   implanted in our hearts by the Author of nature, are in a peculiar
   manner adapted to the circumstances of life in which he hath placed us.
   This general observation, properly pursued, leads to several important
   conclusions. The original internal constitution of man, compared with
   his external condition, enables us to discern what course of action and
   behaviour that constitution leads to, what is our duty respecting that
   condition, and furnishes us besides with the most powerful arguments to
   the practice of it.

   What the inward frame and constitution of man is, is a question of
   fact; to be determined, as other facts are, from experience, from our
   internal feelings and external senses, and from the testimony of
   others. Whether human nature, and the circumstances in which it is
   placed, might not have been ordered otherwise, is foreign to our
   inquiry, and none of our concern: our province is, taking both of these
   as they are, and viewing the connexion between them, from that
   connexion to discover if we can, what course of action is fitted to
   that nature and those circumstances. From contemplating the bodily
   senses, and the organs or instruments adapted to them, we learn that
   the eye was given to see with, the ear to hear with. In like manner,
   from considering our inward perceptions and the final causes of then,
   we collect that the feeling of shame, for instance, was given to
   prevent the doing of things shameful; compassion, to carry us to
   relieve others in distress; anger, to resist sudden violence offered to
   ourselves. if, continuing our inquiries in this way, it should at
   length appear, that the nature, the whole nature, of man leads him to
   and is fitted for that particular course of behaviour which we usually
   distinguish by the name of virtue, we are authorized to conclude, that
   virtue is the law we are born under, that it was so intended by the
   Author of our being; and we are bound by the most intimate of all
   obligations, a regard to our own highest interest and happiness, to
   conform to it in all situations and events.

   Human nature is not simple and uniform, but made up of several parts;
   and we can have no just idea of it as a system or constitution, unless
   we take into our view the respects and relations which these parts have
   to each other. As the body is not one member, but many; so our inward
   structure consists of various instincts, appetites, and propensions.
   Thus far there is no difference between human creatures and brutes. But
   besides these common passions and affections, there is another
   principle, peculiar to mankind, that of conscience, moral sense,
   reflection, call it what you please, by which they are enabled to
   review their whole conduct, to approve of some actions in themselves,
   and to disapprove of others. That this principle will of course have
   some influence on our behaviour, at least at times, will hardly be
   disputed: but the particular influence which it ought to have, the
   precise degree of power in the regulating of our internal frame that is
   assigned it by Him who placed it there, is a point of the utmost
   consequence in itself, and on the determination of which the very hinge
   of our Author's Moral System turns. If the faculty here spoken of be,
   indeed, what it is asserted to be, in nature and kind superior to every
   other passion and affection; if it be given, not merely that it may
   exert its force occasionally, or as our present humour or fancy may
   dispose us, but that it may at all times exercise an uncontrollable
   authority and government over all the rest; it will then follow, that,
   in order to complete the idea of human nature, as a system, we must not
   only take in each particular bias, propension, instinct, which are seen
   to belong to it, but we must add besides the principle of conscience,
   together with the subjection that is due to it from all the other
   appetites and passions: just as the idea of a civil constitution is
   formed, not barely from enumerating the several members and ranks of
   which it is composed, but from these considered as acting in various
   degrees of subordination to each other, and all under the direction of
   the same supreme authority, whether that authority be vested in one
   person or more.

   The view here given of the internal constitution of man, and of the
   supremacy of conscience, agreeably to the conceptions of Bishop Butler,
   enables us to comprehend the force of that expression, common to him
   and the ancient moralists, that virtue consists in following nature.
   The meaning cannot be, that it consists in acting agreeably to that
   propensity of our nature which happens to be the strongest; or which
   propels us towards certain objects, without any regard to the methods
   by which they are to be obtained: but the meaning must be, twat virtue
   consists in the due regulation and subjection of all the other
   appetites and affections to the superior faculty of conscience; from a
   conformity to which alone our actions are properly natural, or
   correspondent to the nature, to the whole nature, of such an agent as
   man. From hence too it appears, that the author of our frame is by no
   means indifferent to virtue and vice, or has left us at liberty to act
   at random, as humour or appetite may prompt us; but that every man has
   the rule of right within him; a rule attended in the very notion of it
   with authority, and such as has the force of a direction and a command
   from Him who made us what we are, what course of behaviour is suited to
   our nature, and which he expects that we should follow. This moral
   faculty implies also a presentiment and apprehension, that the judgment
   which it passes on our actions, considered as of good or ill desert,
   will hereafter be confirmed by the unerring judgment of God; when
   virtue and happiness, vice and misery, whose ideas are now so closely
   connected, shall be indissolubly united, and the divine government be
   found to correspond in the most exact proportion to the nature he has
   given us. Lastly, this just prerogative or supremacy of conscience it
   is, which Mr Pope has described in his Universal Prayer, though perhaps
   he may have expressed it rather too strongly where he says,


     "What conscience dictates to be done,

     Or warns me not to do,

     This teach me more than hell to shun,

     That more than heaven pursue."

   The reader will observe, that this way of treating the subject of
   morals, by an appeal to facts, does not at all interfere with that
   other way, adopted by Dr Samuel Clarke and others, which begins with
   inquiring into the relations and fitnesses of things, but rather
   illustrates and confirms it. That there are essential differences in
   the qualities of human actions, established by nature, and that this
   natural difference of things, prior to and independent of all will,
   creates a natural fitness in the agent to act agreeably to it, seems as
   little to be denied, as that there. is the moral difference before
   explained, from which we approve and feel a pleasure in what is right,
   and conceive a distaste to what is wrong. Still, however, when we are
   endeavouring to establish either this moral or that natural difference,
   it ought never to be forgotten, or rather it will require to be
   distinctly shown, that both of these, when traced up to their source,
   suppose an intelligent Author of nature and moral Ruler of the world;
   who originally appointed these differences, and by such an appointment
   has signified his will that we should conform to them, as the only
   effectual method of securing our happiness on the whole under his
   government. [20] And of this consideration our Prelate himself was not
   unmindful; as may be collected from many expressions in different parts
   of his writings, and particularly from the following passages in his
   eleventh Sermon. "It may be allowed, without any prejudice to the cause
   of virtue and religion, that our ideas of happiness and misery are of
   all our ideas the nearest and most important to us; that they will, nay
   if you please, they ought to prevail over those of order, and beauty,
   and harmony, and proportion, if there should ever be, as it is
   impossible there ever should be, any inconsistence between them." And
   again, "Though virtue or moral rectitude does indeed consist in
   affection to and pursuit of what is right and good, as such; yet, when
   we sit down in a cool hour, we can neither justify to ourselves this or
   any other pursuit, till we are convinced that it will be for our
   happiness, or at least not contrary to it." [21]

   Besides the general system of morality opened above, our Author in his
   volume of Sermons has stated with accuracy the difference between
   self-love and benevolence; in opposition to those who, on the one hand,
   make the whole of virtue to consist in benevolence, [22] and to those
   who, on the other, assert that every particular affection and action is
   resolvable into self-love. In combating these opinions, he has shown, I
   think unanswerably, that there are the same kind of indications in
   human nature, that we were made to promote the happiness of others, as
   that we were made to promote our own: that it is no just objection to
   this, that we have dispositions to do evil to others as well as good;
   for we have also dispositions to do evil as well as good to ourselves,
   to our own most important interests even in this life, for the sake of
   gratifying a present passion: that the thing to be lamented is, not
   that men have too great a regard to their own real good, but that they
   have not enough: that benevolence is not more at variance with or
   unfriendly to self-love, than any other particular affection is: and
   that by consulting the happiness of others a man is so far from
   lessening his own, that the very endeavour to do so, though he should
   fail in the accomplishment, is a source of the highest satisfaction and
   peace of mind. [23] He has also, in passing, animadverted on the
   philosopher of Malmsbury, who, in his book "Of Human Nature," has
   advanced, as discoveries in moral science, that benevolence is only the
   love of power, and compassion the fear of future calamity to ourselves.
   And this our Author has done, not so much with the design of exposing
   the false reasoning of Mr Hobbes, but because on so perverse an account
   of human nature he has raised a system, subversive of all justice and
   honesty. [24]

   II. The religious system of Bishop Butler is chiefly to be collected
   from the treatise, entitled, "The Analogy of Religion, Natural and
   Revealed, to the Constitution and Course of Nature."

   "All things are double one against another, and God hath made nothing
   imperfect."." [25] On this single observation of the son of Sirach, the
   whole fabric of our Prelate's defence of religion, in his Analogy, is
   raised. Instead of indulging in idle speculations, how the world might
   possibly have been better than it is; or, forgetful of the difference
   between hypothesis and fact, attempting to explain the divine economy
   with respect to intelligent creatures, from preconceived notions of his
   own; he first inquires what the constitution of nature, as made known
   to us in the way of experiment, actually is; and from this, now seen
   and acknowledged, he endeavours to form a judgment of that larger
   constitution, which religion discovers to us. If the dispensation of
   Providence we are now under, considered as inhabitants of this world,
   and having a temporal interest to secure in it, be found, on
   examination, to be analogous to, and of a piece with, that further
   dispensation, which relates to us as designed for another world, in
   which we have an eternal interest, depending on our behaviour here; if
   both may be traced up to the same general laws, and appear to be
   carried on according to the same plan of administration; the fair
   presumption is, that both proceed from one and the same Author. And if
   the principal parts objected to in this latter dispensation be similar
   to and of the same kind with what we. certainly experience under the
   former; the objections, being clearly inconclusive in one case, because
   contradicted by plain fact, must, in all reason, be allowed to be
   inconclusive also in the other.

   This way of arguing from what is acknowledged to what is disputed, from
   things known to other things that resemble them, from that part of the
   divine establishment which is exposed to our view to that more
   important one which lies beyond it, is on all hands confessed to be
   just. By this method Sir Isaac Newton has unfolded the system of
   nature; by the same method Bishop Butler has explained the system of
   grace; and thus, An use the words of a writer, whom I quote with
   pleasure, "has formed and concluded a happy alliance between faith and
   philosophy." [26]

   And although the argument from analogy be allowed to be imperfect, and
   by no means sufficient to solve all difficulties respecting the
   government of God, and the designs of his Providence with regard to
   mankind (a degree of knowledge, which we are not furnished with
   faculties for attaining, at least in the present state); yet surely it
   is of importance to learn from it, that the natural and moral world are
   intimately connected, and parts of one stupendous whole or system; and
   that the chief objections which are brought against religion may be
   urged with equal force against the constitution and course of nature,
   where they are certainly false in fact. And this information we may
   derive from the work before us; the proper design of which, it may be
   of use to observe, is not to prove the truth of religion, either
   natural or revealed, but to confirm that proof, already known, by
   considerations from analogy.

   After this account of the method of reasoning employed by our Author,
   let us now advert to his manner of applying it, first to the subject of
   Natural Religion, and secondly to that of Revealed.

   1. The foundation of all our hopes and fears is a future life; and with
   this the treatise begins. Neither the reason of the thing, nor the
   analogy of nature, according to Bishop Butler, give ground for
   imagining, that the unknown event, death, will be our destruction. The
   states in which we have formerly existed, in the womb and in infancy,
   are not more different from each other than from that of mature age in
   which we now exist: therefore, that we shall continue to exist
   hereafter, in a state as different from the present as the present is
   from those through which we have passed already, is a presumption
   favoured by the analogy of nature. All that we know from reason
   concerning death, is the effects it has upon animal bodies: and the
   frequent instances among men of the intellectual powers continuing in
   high health and vigour, at the very time when a mortal disease is on
   the point of putting an end to all the powers of sensation, induce us
   to hope that it may have no effect at all on the human soul, not even
   so much as to suspend the exercise of its faculties; though, if it
   have, the suspension of a power by no means implies its extinction, as
   sleep or a swoon may convince us. [27]

   The probability of a future state once granted, an important question
   arises, How best to secure our interest in that state. We find from
   what passes daily before us, that the constitution of nature admits of
   misery as well as happiness; that both of these are the consequences of
   our own actions; and these consequences we are enabled to foresee.
   Therefore, that our happiness or misery in a future world may depend on
   our own actions also, and that rewards or punishments hereafter may
   follow our good or ill behaviour here, is but an appointment of the
   same sort with what we experience under the divine government,
   according to the regular course of nature. [28]

   This supposition is confirmed from another circumstance, that the
   natural government of God, under which we now live, is also moral; in
   which rewards and punishments are the consequences of actions,
   considered as virtuous and vicious. Not that every man is rewarded or
   punished here in exact proportion to his desert; for the essential
   tendencies of virtue and vice, to produce happiness and the contrary,
   are often hindered from taking effect from accidental causes. However,
   there are plainly the rudiments and beginnings of a righteous
   administration to be discerned in the constitution of nature: from
   whence we are led to expect, that these accidental hindrances will one
   day be removed, and the rule of distributive justice obtain completely
   in a more perfect state. [29]

   The moral government of God, thus established, implies in the notion of
   it some sort of trial, or a moral possibility of acting wrong as well
   as right, in those who are the subjects of it. And the doctrine of
   religion, that the present life is in fact a state of probation for a
   future one, is rendered credible, from its being analogous throughout
   to the general conduct of Providence towards us with respect to this
   world; in which prudence is necessary to secure our temporal interest,
   just as we are taught that virtue is necessary to secure our eternal
   interest; and both are trusted to ourselves. [30]

   But the present life is not merely a state of probation, implying in it
   difficulties and danger; it is also a state of discipline and
   improvement; and that both in our temporal and religious capacity. Thus
   childhood is a state of discipline for youth; youth for manhood; and
   that for old age. Strength of body, and maturity of understanding, are
   acquired by degrees; and neither of them without continual exercise and
   attention on our part, not only in the beginning of life, but through
   the whole course of it. So again with respect to our religious
   concerns, the present world is fitted to be, and to good men is in
   event, a state of discipline and improvement for a future one. The
   several passions and propensions implanted in our hearts incline us, in
   a multitude of instances, to forbidden pleasures: this inward infirmity
   is increased by various snares and temptations, perpetually occurring
   from without: hence arises the necessity of recollection and
   self-government; of withstanding the calls of appetite, and forming our
   minds to habits of piety and virtue; habits, of which we are capable,
   and which, to creatures in a state of moral imperfection, and fallen
   from their original integrity, must be of the greatest use, as an
   additional security, over and above the principle of conscience, from
   the dangers to which we are exposed. [31]

   Nor is the credibility here given, by the analogy of nature, to the
   general doctrine of religion, destroyed or weakened by any notions
   concerning necessity. Of itself it is a mere word, the sign of an
   abstract idea; and as much requires an agent, that is, a necessary
   agent, in order to effect any thing, as freedom requires a free agent.
   Admitting it to be speculatively true, if considered as influencing
   practice, it is the same as false: for it is matter of experience,
   that, with regard to our present interest, and as inhabitants of this
   world, we are treated as if we were free; and therefore the analogy of
   nature leads us to conclude, that, with regard to our future interest,
   and as designed for another world, we shall be treated as free also.
   Nor does the opinion of necessity, supposing it possible, at all affect
   either the general proof of religion, or its external evidence. [32]

   Still objections may be made against the wisdom and goodness of the
   divine government, to which analogy, which can only show the truth or
   credibility of facts, affords no answer. Yet even here analogy is of
   use, if it suggest that the divine government is a scheme or system,
   and not a number of unconnected acts, and that this system is also
   above our comprehension. Now the government of the natural world
   appears to be a system of this kind; with parts, related to each other,
   and together composing a whole: in which system ends are brought about
   by the use of means, many of which means, before experience, would have
   been suspected to have had a quite contrary tendency; which is carried
   on by general laws, similar causes uniformly producing similar effects:
   the utility of which general laws, and the inconveniences which would
   probably arise from the occasional or even secret suspension of them,
   we are in some sort enabled to discern; [33] but of the whole we are
   incompetent judges, because of the small part which comes within our
   view. Reasoning then from what we know, it is highly credible, that the
   government of the moral world is a system also, carried on by general
   laws, and in which ends are accomplished by the intervention of means;
   and that both constitutions, the natural and the moral, are so
   connected, as to form together but one scheme. But of this scheme, as
   of that of the natural world taken alone, we are not qualified to
   judge, on account of the mutual respect of the several parts to each
   other and to the whole, and our own incapacity to survey the whole, or,
   with accuracy, any single part. All objections therefore to the wisdom
   and goodness of the divine government may be founded merely on our
   ignorance; [34] and to such objections our ignorance is the proper, and
   a satisfactory answer. [35]

   2. The chief difficulties concerning Natural Religion being now
   removed, our Author proceeds, in the next place, to that which is
   Revealed; and as an Introduction to an inquiry into the Credibility of
   Christianity, begins with the consideration of its Importance.

   The importance of Christianity appears in two respects. First, in its
   being a republication of Natural Religion, in its native simplicity,
   with authority, and with circumstances of advantage; ascertaining in
   many instances of moment, what before was only probable, and
   particularly confirming the doctrine of a future state of rewards and
   punishments. [36] Secondly, as revealing a new dispensation of
   Providence, originating from the pure love and mercy of God, and
   conducted by the mediation of his Son, and the guidance of his Spirit
   for the recovery and salvation of mankind, represented in a state of
   apostasy and ruin. This account of Christianity being admitted to be
   just, and the distinct offices of these three divine Persons being once
   discovered to us, we are as much obliged in point of duty to
   acknowledge the relations we stand in to the Son and Holy Ghost, as our
   Mediator and Sanctifier, as we are obliged in point of duty to
   acknowledge the relation we stand in to God the Father; although the
   two former of these relations be learnt from Revelation only, and in
   the last we are instructed by the light of nature; the obligation in
   either case arising from the offices themselves, and not at all
   depending on the manner in which they are made known to us. [37]

   The presumptions against Revelation in general are, that it is not
   discoverable by reason, that it is unlike to what is so discovered, and
   that it was introduced and supported by miracles. But in a scheme so
   large as that of the universe, unbounded in extent and everlasting in
   duration, there must of necessity be numberless circumstances which are
   beyond the reach of our faculties to discern, and which can only be
   known by divine illumination. And both in the natural and moral
   government of the world, under which we live, we find many things
   unlike one to another, and therefore ought not to wonder if the same
   unlikeness obtain between things visible and invisible; although it be
   far from true, that revealed religion is entirely unlike the
   constitution of nature, as analogy may teach us. Nor is there any thing
   incredible in Revelation, considered as miraculous; whether miracles be
   supposed to have been performed at the beginning of the world, or after
   a course of nature has been established. Not at the beginning of the
   world; for then there was either no course of nature at all, or a power
   must have been exerted totally different from what that course is at
   present: all men and animals cannot have been born, as they are now;
   but a pair of each sort must have been produced at first, in a way
   altogether unlike to that in which they have been since produced;
   unless we affirm, that men and animals have existed from eternity in an
   endless succession; one miracle therefore at least there must have been
   at the beginning of the world, or at the time of man's creation. Not
   after the settlement of a course of nature, on account of miracles
   being contrary to that course, or, in other words, contrary to
   experience; for, in order to know whether miracles, worked in
   attestation of a divine religion, be contrary to experience or not, we
   ought to be acquainted with other cases, similar or parallel to those,
   in which miracles are alleged to have been wrought. But where shall we
   find such similar or parallel cases? The world which we inhabit affords
   none: we know of no extraordinary revelations from God to man, but
   those recorded in the Old and New Testament; all of which were
   established by miracles; it cannot therefore be said, that miracles are
   incredible, because contrary to experience, when all the experience we
   have is in favour of miracles, and on the side of religion. [38]
   Besides, in reasoning concerning miracles, they ought not to be
   compared with common natural events, but with uncommon appearances,
   such as comets, magnetism, electricity; which, to one acquainted only
   with the usual phenomena of nature, and the common powers of matter,
   must, before proof of their actual existence, be thought incredible.
   [39]

   The presumption against Revelation in general being dispatched,
   objections against the Christian Revelation in particular, against the
   scheme of it, as distinguished from objections against its evidence,
   are considered next. Now supposing a revelation to be really given, it
   is highly probable beforehand, that it must contain many things
   appearing to us liable to objections. The acknowledged dispensation of
   nature is very different from what we should have expected: reasoning
   then from analogy, the revealed dispensation, it is credible, would be
   also different. Nor are we in any sort judges at what time, or in what
   degree, or manner, it is fit or expedient for God to instruct us, in
   things confessedly of the greatest use, either by natural reason, or by
   supernatural information. Thus, arguing on speculation only, and
   without experience, it would seem very unlikely that so important a
   remedy as that provided by Christianity, for the recovery of mankind
   from ruin, should have been for so many ages withheld; and, when at
   last vouchsafed, should be imparted to so few; and, after it has been
   imparted, should be attended with obscurity and doubt. And just so we
   might have argued, before experience, concerning the remedies provided
   in nature for bodily diseases, to which by nature we are exposed: for
   many of these were unknown to mankind for a number of ages; are known
   but to few now; some important ones probably not discovered yet; and
   those which are, neither certain in their application, nor universal in
   their use: and the same mode of reasoning that would lead us to expect
   they should have been so, would lead us to expect that the necessity of
   them should have been superseded, by there being no diseases; as the
   necessity of the Christian scheme, it may be thought, might also have
   been superseded, by preventing the fall of man, so that he should not
   have stood in need of a Redeemer at all. [40]

   As to objections against the wisdom and goodness of Christianity, the
   same answer may be applied to them as was to the like objections
   against the constitution of nature. For here also, Christianity is a
   scheme or economy, composed of various parts, forming a whole; in which
   scheme means are used for the accomplishing of ends; and which is
   conducted by general laws, of all of which we know as little as we do
   of the constitution of nature. And the seeming want of wisdom or
   goodness in this system is to be ascribed to the same cause, as the
   like appearances of defects in the natural system; our inability to
   discern the whole scheme, and our ignorance of the relation of those
   parts which are discernible to others beyond our view.

   The objections against Christianity as a matter of fact, and against
   the wisdom and goodness of it, having been obviated together, the chief
   of them are now to be considered distinctly. One of these, which is
   levelled against the entire system itself, is of this sort: the
   restoration of mankind, represented in Scripture as the great design of
   the Gospel, is described as requiring a long series of means, and
   persons, and dispensations, before it can be brought to its completion;
   whereas the whole ought to have been effected at once. Now every thing
   we see in the course of nature shows the folly of this objection. For
   in the natural course of Providence, ends are brought about by means,
   not operating immediately and at once, but deliberately, and in a way
   of progression; one thing being subservient to another, this to
   somewhat further. The change of seasons, the ripening of fruits, the
   growth of vegetable and animal bodies, are instances of this. And
   therefore, that the same progressive method should be followed in the
   dispensation of Christianity, as is observed in the common dispensation
   of Providence, is a reasonable expectation, justified by the analogy of
   nature. [41]

   Another circumstance objected to in the Christian scheme is the
   appointment of a Mediator, and the saving of the world through him. But
   the visible government of God being actually administered in this way,
   or by the mediation and instrumentality of others, there can be no
   general presumption against an appointment of this kind, against his
   invisible government being exercised in the same manner. We have seen
   already, that with regard to ourselves this visible government is
   carried on by rewards and punishments; for happiness and misery are the
   consequences of our own actions, considered as virtuous and vicious;
   and these consequences we are enabled to foresee. It might have been
   imagined, before consulting experience, that after we had rendered
   ourselves liable to misery by our own ill conduct, sorrow for what was
   past, and behaving well for the future, would, alone and of themselves,
   have exempted us from deserved punishment, and restored us to the
   divine favour. But the fact is otherwise; and real reformation is often
   found to be of no avail, so as to secure the criminal from poverty,
   sickness, infamy, and death, the never-failing attendants on vice and
   extravagance, exceeding a certain degree. By the course of nature then
   it appears, God does not always pardon a sinner on his repentance. Yet
   there is provision made, even in nature, that the miseries, which men
   bring on themselves by unlawful indulgences, may in many cases be
   mitigated, and in some removed; partly by extraordinary exertions of
   the offender himself, but more especially and frequently by the
   intervention of others, who voluntarily, and from motives of
   compassion, submit to labour and sorrow, such as produce long and
   lasting inconveniences to themselves, as the means of rescuing another
   from the wretched effects of former imprudences. Vicarious punishment,
   therefore, or one person's sufferings contributing to the relief of
   another, is a providential disposition in the economy of nature: [42]
   and it ought not to be matter of surprise, if by a method analogous to
   this we be redeemed from sin and misery, in the economy of grace. That
   mankind at present are in a state of degradation, different from that
   in which they were originally created, is the very ground of the
   Christian revelation, as contained in the Scriptures. Whether we
   acquiesce in the account, that our being placed in such a state is
   owing to the crime of our first parents, or choose to ascribe it to any
   other cause, it makes no difference as to our condition: the vice and
   unhappiness of the world are still there, notwithstanding all our
   suppositions: nor is it Christianity that hath put us into this state.
   We learn also from the same Scriptures, what experience and the use of
   expiatory sacrifices from the most early times might have taught us,
   that repentance alone is not sufficient to prevent the fatal
   consequences of past transgressions: but that still there is room for
   mercy, and that repentance shall be available, though not of itself,
   yet through the mediation of a divine Person, the Messiah; who, from
   the sublimest principles of compassion, when we were dead in trespasses
   and sins, [43] suffered and died, the innocent for the guilty, the just
   for the unjust, [44] that we might have redemption through his blood,
   even the forgiveness of sins. [45] In what way the death of Christ was
   of that efficacy it is said to be, in procuring the reconciliation of
   sinners, the Scriptures have not explained; it is enough that the
   doctrine is revealed; that it is not contrary to any truths which
   reason and experience teach us; and that it accords in perfect harmony
   with the usual method of the divine conduct in the government of the
   world. [46]

   Again, it hath been said, that if the Christian revelation were true,
   it must have been universal, and could. not have been left upon
   doubtful evidence. But God, in his natural providence, dispenses his
   gifts in great variety, not only among creatures of the same species,
   itut to the same individuals also at different times. Had the Christian
   revelation been universal at first, yet, from the diversity of men's
   abilities, both of mind and body, their various means of improvement,
   and other external advantages, some persons must soon have been in a
   situation, with respect to religious knowledge, much superior to that
   of others, as much perhaps as they are at present: and all men will be
   equitably dealt with at last; and to whom little is given, of him
   little will be required. Then as to the evidence for religion being
   left doubtful, difficulties of this sort, like difficulties in
   practice, afford scope and opportunity for a virtuous exercise of the
   understanding, and dispose the mind to acquiesce and rest satisfied
   with any evidence that is real. In the daily commerce of life, men are
   obliged to act upon great un certainties, with regard to success in
   their temporal pursuits: and the case with regard to religion is
   parallel. However, though religion be not intuitively true, the proofs
   of it which we have are amply sufficient in reason to induce us to
   embrace it; and dissatisfaction with those proofs may possibly be men's
   own fault. [47]

   Nothing remains but to attend to the positive evidence there is for the
   truth of Christianity. Now, besides its direct and fundamental proofs,
   which are miracles and prophecies, there are many collateral
   circumstances, which may be united into one view, and all together may
   be considered as making up one argument. In this way oi treating the
   subject, the revelation, whether real or otherwise, may be supposed to
   be wholly historical: the design of which appears to be, to give an
   account of the condition of religion, and its professors, with a
   concise narration of the political state of things, as far as religion
   is affected by it, during a great length of time, near six thousand
   years of which are already past. More particularly it comprehends an
   account of God's entering into covenant with one nation, the Jews, that
   he would be their God, and that they should be his people; of his often
   interposing in their affairs; giving them the promise, and afterwards
   the possession, of a flourishing country; assuring them of the greatest
   national prosperity, in case of their obedience, and threatening the
   severest national punishment, in case they forsook him, and joined in
   the idolatry of their Pagan neighbours. It contains also a prediction
   of a particular person to appear in the fulness of time, in whom all
   the promises of God to the Jews were to be fulfilled: and it relates,
   that, at the time expected, a person did actually appear, assuming to
   be the Saviour foretold; that he worked various miracles among them, in
   confirmation of his divine authority; and, as was foretold also, was
   rejected and put to death by the very people who had long desired and
   waited for his coming; but that his religion, in spite of all
   opposition, was established in the world by his disciples, invested
   with supernatural powers for that purpose; of the fate and fortunes of
   which religion there is a prophetical description, carried down to the
   end of time. Let any one now, after reading the above history, and not
   knowing whether the whole were not a fiction, be supposed to ask,
   Whether all that is here related be true? and instead of a direct
   answer, let him be informed of the several acknowledged facts, which
   are found to correspond to it in real life; and then let him compare
   the history and facts together, and observe the astonishing coincidence
   of both: such a joint review must appear to him of very great weight,
   and to amount to evidence somewhat more than human. And unless the
   whole series, and every particular circumstance contained in it, can be
   thought to have arisen from accident, the truth of Christianity is
   proved. [48]

   The view here given of the moral and religious systems of Bishop
   Butler, it will immediately be perceived, is chiefly intended for
   younger students, especially for students in Divinity; to whom it is
   hoped it may be of use, so as to encourage them to peruse, with proper
   diligence, the original works of the Author himself. For it may be
   necessary to observe, that neither of the volumes of this excellent
   Prelate are addressed to those who read for amusement, or curiosity, or
   to get rid of time. All subjects are not to be comprehended with the
   same ease; and morality and religion, when treated as sciences, each
   accompanied with difficulties of its own, can neither of them be
   understood as they ought without a very peculiar attention. But
   morality and religion are not merely to be studied as sciences, or as
   being speculatively true; they are to be regarded in another and higher
   light, as the rule of life and manners, as containing authoritative
   directions by which to regulate our faith and practice. And in this
   view, the infinite importance of them, considered, it can never be an
   indifferent matter whether they be received or rejected. For both claim
   to be the voice of God; and whether they be so or not, cannot. be
   known, till their claims be impartially examined. If they indeed come
   from Him, we are bound to conform to them at our peril; nor is it left
   to our choice, whether we will submit to the obligations they impose
   upon us or not; for submit to them we must, in such a sense, as to
   incur the punishments denounced by both against wilful disobedience to
   their injunctions.

   [4] Dr Butler, when Bishop of Bristol, put up a cross, a plain piece of
   marble inlaid, in the chapel of his episcopal house. This, which was
   intended by the blameless Prelate merely as a sign or memorial, that
   true Christians are to bear their cross, and not to be ashamed of
   following a crucified Master, was considered as affording a presumption
   that he was secretly inclined to Popish forms and ceremonies, and had
   no great dislike to popery itself. And, on account of the offence it

   [13] Serm. xx.

   [14] When the first edition of this Preface was published, I had in
   vain endeavoured to procure a sight of the papers, in which Bishop
   Butler was accused of having died a Papist, and Archbishop Secker's
   replies to them; though I well remembered to have read both, when they
   first appeared in the public prints. But a learned Professor ill the
   University of Oxford has furnished me with the whole controversy in its
   original form; a brief history of which it may not be unacceptable to
   offer here to the curious reader. The attack was opened in the year
   1767, in an anonymous pamphlet, entitled, The Root of Protestant Errors
   examined;" in which the author asserted, that, "by an anecdote lately
   given him, that same Prelate" (who at the bottom of the page is called
   B--p of D--m) "is said to have died in the communion of a Church, that
   makes much use of saints, saints' days, and all the trumpery of saint
   worship." When this remarkable fact, now first divulged, came to be
   generally known, it occasioned, as might be expected, no little alarm;
   and intelligence of it was no sooner conveyed to Archbishop Secker,
   than in a short letter, signed Misopseudes, and printed in the St
   James's Chronicle of May 9, he called upon the writer to produce his
   authority for publishing "so gross and scandalous a falsehood." To this
   challenge an immediate answer was returned by the author of the
   pamphlet, who, now assuming the name of Phileleutheros, informed
   Misopseudes, through the channel of the same paper, that "such anecdote
   had been given him; and that he was yet of opinion, that there was
   nothing improbable in it; when it is considered that the same Prelate
   put up the Popish insignia of the cross in his chapel, when at Bristol;
   and in his last Episcopal Charge has squinted very much towards that
   superstition." Here we find the accusation not only repeated, but
   supported by reasons, such as they are, of which it seemed necessary
   that some notice should be taken: nor did the Archbishop conceive it
   unbecoming his own dignity to stand up on this occasion, as the
   vindicator of innocence against the calumniator of the helpless dead.
   Accordingly, in a second letter in the same newspaper of May 23, and
   subscribed Misopseudes as before, after reciting from Bishop Butler's
   Sermon before the Lords the very passage here printed in the Preface,
   and observing, that "there are, in the same Sermon, declarations as
   strong as can be. made against temporal punishments for heresy, schism,
   or even for idolatry;" His Grace expresses himself thus: "Now he
   (Bishop Butler) was universally esteemed throughout his life, a man of
   strict piety and honesty, as well as uncommon abilities. He gave all
   the proofs, public and private, which his station led him to give, and
   they were decisive and daily, of his continuing to the last a. sincere
   member of the Church of England. Nor had ever any of his acquaintance,
   or most intimate friends, nor have they to this day, the least doubt of
   it." As to putting up a cross in his chapel, the Archbishop frankly
   owns, that for himself he wishes he had not; and thinks that in so
   doing the Bishop did amiss. But then he asks, "Call that be opposed, as
   any proof of Popery, to all the evidence on the other side; or even to
   the single evidence of the above-mentioned Sermon? Most of our churches
   have crosses upon them: are they therefore Popish churches? The
   Lutherans have more than crosses in theirs: are the Lutherans therefore
   Papists?" And as to the Charge, no Papist, his Grace remarks, would
   have spoken as Bishop Butler there does, of the observances peculiar to
   Roman Catholics, some of which he expressly censures as wrong and
   superstitious, and others, as made subservient to the purposes of
   superstition, and, on these accounts, abolished at the Reformation.
   After the publication of this letter Phileleutheros replied in a short
   defence of his own conduct, but without producing any thing new in
   confirmation of what he had advanced. And here the controversy, so far
   as the two principals were concerned, seems to have ended.. But the
   dispute was not suffered to die away quite so soon. For in the same
   year. and in the same newspaper of July 21, another letter appeared; in
   which the author not only contended that the cross in the Episcopal
   chapel at Bristol, and the Charge to the Clergy of Durham in 1751,
   amount to full proof of a strong attachment to the idolatrous communion
   of the Church of Rome, but, with the reader's leave, he would fain
   account for the Bishop's "tendency this way." And this he attempted to
   do, "from the natural melancholy and gloominess of Dr Butler's
   disposition; from his great fondness for the lives of Romish saints,
   and their books of mystic piety; from his drawing his notions of
   teaching men religion, not from the New Testament, but from
   philosophical and political opinions of his own; and above all, from
   his transition from a strict Dissenter amongst the Presbyterians to a
   rigid Churchman, and his sudden and unexpected elevation to great
   wealth and dignity in the Church." The attack, thus renewed, excited
   the Archbishop's attention a second time, and drew from him a fresh
   answer, subscribed also Misopseudes, in the St James's Chronicle of
   August 4. In this letter, our excellent Metropolitan, first of all
   obliquely hinting, at the unfairness of sitting in judgment on the
   character of a man who had been dead fifteen years; and then reminding
   his correspondent, that "full proof had been already published, that
   Bishop Butler abhorred Popery as a vile corruption of Christianity, and
   that it might be proved, if needful, that he held the Pope to be
   Antichrist;" (to which decisive testimonies of undoubted aversion from
   the Romish Church, another is also added in the Postscript, his taking,
   when promoted to the see of Durham, for his domestic Chaplain, Dr Nath.
   Forster, who had published, not four years before, a Sermon, entitled,
   Popery destructive of the Evidence of Christianity;) proceeds to
   observe, "that the natural melancholy of the Bishop's temper would
   rather have fixed him amongst his first friends, than prompted him to
   the change he made: that he read books of all sorts, as well as books
   of mystic piety, and knew how to pick the good that was in them out of
   the bad: that his opinions were exposed without reserve in his Analogy
   and his Sermons, and if the doctrine of either be Popish or
   unscriptural, the learned world hath mistaken strangely in admiring
   both: that, instead of being a strict Dissenter, he never was a
   communicant in any Dissenting assembly; on the contrary, that he went
   occasionally, from his early years, to the established worship, and
   became a constant conformist to it when he was barely of age, and
   entered himself, in 1714, of Oriel College: that his elevation to great
   dignity in the Church, far from being sudden and unexpected, was a
   gradual and natural rise, through a variety of preferments, and a
   period of thirty-two years: that, as Bishop of Durham, he had very
   little authority beyond his brethren, and in ecclesiastical matters,
   had none beyond them; a larger income than most of them h3 had; but
   this he employed, not, as was insinuated, in augmenting the pomp of
   worship in his cathedral, where indeed it is no greater than in others,
   but for the purposes of clarity, and in the repairing of his houses."
   After these remarks, the letter closes with the following words: "Upon
   the whole, few accusations, so entirely groundless, have been so
   pertinaciously, I am unwilling to say maliciously, carried on, as the
   present: and surely it is high time for the authors and abettors of it,
   in mere common prudence, to show some regard, if not to truth, at least
   to shame." It only remains to be mentioned, that the above letters of
   Archbishop Secker had such an effect on a writer, who signed himself in
   the St. James's Chronicle of August 25, A Dissenting Minister, that he
   declared it as his opinion, that "the author of the pamphlet, called,
   The Root of Protestant Errors examined,' and his friends, were obliged
   in candour, in justice, and in honour to retract their charge, unless
   they could establish it on much better grounds than had hitherto
   appeared: and he expressed his "hopes, that it would be understood that
   the Dissenters in general had no hand in the accusation, and that it
   had only been the act of two or three mistaken men." Another person
   also, "a foreigner by birth," as he says of himself, who had been long
   an admirer of Bishop Butler, and had perused with great attention all
   that had been written on both sides in the present controversy,
   confesses he had been "wonderfully pleased with observing, with what
   candour amid temper, as well as clearness and solidity, he was
   vindicated from the aspersions laid against him." All the adversaries
   of our Prelate, however, had not the virtue or sense to be thus
   convinced; some of whom still continued, under the signatures of Old
   Martin, Latimer, An Impartial Protestant, Paulinus, Misonothos, to
   repeat their confuted falsehoods in the public prints; as if the curse
   of calumniators had fallen upon them, and their memory, by being long a
   traitor to truth, had taken at last a severe revenge, and compelled
   them to credit their own lie. The first of these gentlemen, Old Martin,
   who dates from Newcastle, May 29, from the rancour and malignity with
   which his letter abounds, and from the particular virulence he
   discovers towards the characters of Bishop Butler and his defender, I
   conjecture to be no other than the very person who had already figured
   in this dispute, so early as the year 1752; of whose work, entitled, "A
   Serious Inquiry into the Use and Importance of External Religion," the
   reader will find some account in the notes subjoined to the Bishop's
   Charge in the volume of Sermons.

   [15] The letters, with a sight of which I was indulged by the favour of
   our present most worthy Metropolitan, are all, as I remember, wrapped
   together under one cover; on the back of which is written, in
   Archbishop Secker's own hand, the following words, or words to this
   effect: "Presumptive Arguments that Bishop Butler d not die a Papist."

   [20] "Far be it from me," says the excellent Dr T. Balguy (Discourse
   ix.) "to dispute the reality of a moral principle in the human heart. I
   feel its existence: I clearly discern its use and importance. But in no
   respect is it more important, than as it suggests the idea of a moral
   Governor. Let this idea be once effaced, and the principle of
   conscience will soon be found weak and ineffectual. Its influence on
   men's conduct has, indeed, been too much undervalued by some
   philosophical inquirers. But be that influence, while it lasts, more or
   less, it is not a steady and permanent principle of action. Unhappily
   we always have it in our power to lay it asleep.--Neglect alone will
   suppress and stifle it, and bring it almost into a state of
   stupefaction. Nor can any thing, less than the terrors of religion,
   awaken our minds from this dangerous and deadly sleep. It can never be
   a matter of indifference to a thinking man, whether he is to be happy
   or miserable beyond the grave."

   [34] The ignorance of man, is a favorite doctrine with Bishop Butler.
   It occurs in the Second Part of the Analogy; it makes the subject of
   his Fifteenth Sermon; and we meet with it again in his Charge. Whether
   sometimes it be not carried to a length which is excessive, may admit
   of doubt.

   [35] Part I. chap. vii.

   [36] Admirable to this purpose are the words of Dr T. Balguy, in the
   Ninth of his Discourses already referred to, p. xxv. "The doctrine of a
   life to come, some persons will say, is a doctrine of natural religion;
   and can never therefore be properly alleged to show the importance of
   revelation. They judge perhaps from the frame of the world, that the
   present system is imperfect; they see designs in it, not yet completed;
   and they think they have grounds for expecting another state, in which
   these designs shall be farther carried on, and brought to a conclusion,
   worthy of infinite wisdom. I am not concerned to dispute the justness
   of this reasoning; nor do I wish to dispute it. But how far will it
   reach? Will it lead us to the Christian doctrine of a judgment to come?
   Will it give us the prospect of an eternity of happiness? Nothing of
   all this. It shows us only, that death is not the end of our being;
   that we are likely to pass hereafter into other systems, more
   favourable than the present to the great ends of God's providence, the
   virtue and the happiness of his intelligent creatures. But into what
   systems we are to be removed; what new scenes are to be presented to
   us, either of pleasure or pain; what new parts we shall have to act,
   and to what trials and temptations we may yet be exposed; on all these
   subjects we know just nothing. That our happiness for ever depends on
   our conduct here, is a most important proposition, which we learn only
   form revelation."

   [37] Part II. chap. i.

   [38] "In the common affairs of life, common experience is sufficient to
   direct us. But will common experience serve to guide our judgment
   concerning the fall and redemption of mankind? From what we see every
   day, can we explain the commencement, or foretell the dissolution of
   the world? To judge of events like these, we should be conversant in
   the history of other planets; should be distinctly informed of God's
   various dispensations to all the different orders of rational beings.
   Instead then of grounding our religious opinions on what we call
   experience, let us apply to a more certain guide, let us hearken to the
   testimony of God himself. The credibility of human testimony, and the
   conduct of human agents, are subjects perfectly within the reach of our
   natural faculties; and we ought to desire no firmer foundation for our
   belief of religion, than for the judgments we form in the common
   affairs of life where we see a little plain testimony easily outweighs
   the most specious conjectures, and not seldom even strong
   probabilities." Dr Balguy's Fourth Charge. See also an excellent
   pamphlet, entitled, "Remarks on Mr Hume's Essay on the Natural History

   chapters the fifth and sixth,) opposes what is here advanced by Bishop
   Butler; quoting his words, but without mentioning his name. If what is
   said above be not thought a sufficient answer to the objections of this
   author, the reader may do well to consult a Charge "On the Use and
   Abuse of Philosophy in the Study of Religion," by the late Dr Powell;

   Author observes, consciousness makes only personality, or is necessary
   to the idea of a person, i. e. a thinking intelligent being, but
   presupposes, and therefore cannot constitute, personal identity: just
   as knowledge presupposes truth, but does not constitute it.
   Consciousness of past actions does indeed show us the identity of
   ourselves, or gives us a certain assurance that we are the same persons
   or living agents now, which we were at the time to which our
   remembrance can look back: but still we should be the same persons as
   we were, though this consciousness of what is past were wanting, though
   all that had been done by us formerly were forgotten; unless it be
   true, that no person has existed a single moment beyond what he can
   remember. The other Dissertation is On the Nature of Virtue, which
   properly belongs to the moral system of our Author, already explained.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE LIFE OF DR BUTLER.

   DR JOSEPH BUTLER, a Prelate of the most distinguished character and
   abilities, was born at Wantage, in Berkshire, in the year 1692. His
   father, Mr Thomas Butler, who was a substantial and reputable
   shopkeeper in that town, observing in his son Joseph [49] an excellent
   genius and inclination for learning, determined to educate him for the
   ministry, among the Protestant Dissenters of the Presbyterian
   denomination. For this purpose, after he had gone through a proper
   course of grammatical literature, at the free grammar school of his
   native place, under the care of the Rev. Mr Philip Barton, a Clergyman
   of the Church of England, he was sent to a Dissenting academy, then
   kept at Gloucester, but which was soon afterwards removed to
   Tewkesbury. The principal tutor of this academy was Mr Jones, a man of
   uncommon abilities and knowledge, who had the honour of training up
   several scholars, who became of great eminence, both in the Established
   Church and among the Dissenters. At Tewkesbury Mr Butler made an
   extraordinary progress in the study of Divinity; of which he gave a
   remarkable proof, in the letters addressed by him, while he resided at
   Tewkesbury, to Dr Samuel Clarke, laying before him the doubts that had
   arisen in his mind, concerning the conclusiveness of some arguments in
   the Doctor's demonstration of the being and attributes of God. The
   first of these letters was dated the 4th of November, 1713; and the
   sagacity and depth of thought displayed in it, immediately excited Dr
   Clarke's particular notice. This condescension encouraged Mr Butler to
   address the Doctor again upon the same subject, which likewise was
   answered by him; and the correspondence being carried on in three other
   letters, the whole was annexed to the celebrated treatise before
   mentioned, and the collection has been retained in all the subsequent
   editions of that work. The management of this correspondence was
   entrusted by Mr Butler to his friend and fellow-pupil, Mr Secker, who,
   in order to conceal the affair, undertook to convey the letters to the
   post-office at Gloucester, and to bring back Dr Clarke's answers. When
   Mr Butler's name was discovered to the Doctor, the candour, modesty,
   and good sense, with which he had written, immediately procured him the
   friendship of that eminent and excellent man. Our young student was
   not, however, during his continuance at Tewkesbury, solely employed in
   metaphysical speculations and inquiries. Another subject of his serious
   consideration was, the propriety of his becoming a Dissenting minister.
   Accordingly, he entered into an examination of the principles of
   non-conformity; the result of which was, such a dissatisfaction with
   them, as determined him to conform to the Established Church. This
   intention was, at first, disagreeable to his father, who endeavoured to
   divert him from his purpose; and, with that view, called in the
   assistance of some eminent Presbyterian Divines; but finding his son's
   resolution to be fixed, he at length suffered him to be removed to
   Oxford, where he was admitted a commoner of Oriel College, on the 17th
   of March, 1714. At what time he took Orders doth not appear, nor who
   the Bishop was by whom he was ordained; but it is certain that he
   entered into the Church soon after his admission at Oxford, if it be
   true, as is asserted, that he sometimes assisted Mr Edward Talbot in
   the divine service, at his living of Hendred, near Wantage. With this
   gentleman, who was the second son of Dr William Talbot, successively
   Bishop of Oxford, Salisbury, and Durham, Mr Butler formed an intimate
   friendship at Oriel College; which friendship laid. the foundation of
   all his subsequent preferments, and procured for him a very honourable
   situation, when he was only twenty-six years of age. For it was in 1718
   that, at the recommendation of Mr Talbot, in conjunction with that of
   Dr Clarke, he was appointed by Sir Joseph Jekyll to be preacher at the
   Rolls. This was three years before he had taken any degree at the
   University, where he did not go out Bachelor of Law till the 10th of
   June, 1721, which, however, was as soon as that degree could suitably
   be conferred upon him. Dr Butler continued at the Rolls till 1726; in
   the beginning of which year he published, in one volume, octavo,
   "Fifteen Sermons preached at that Chapel." In the mean while, by the
   patronage of Dr Talbot, Bishop of Durham, to whose notice he had been
   recommended (together with Mr Benson and Mr Secker) by Mr Edward
   Talbot, on his death-bed, our Author had been presented first to the
   rectory of Haughton, near Darlington, and afterwards to that of
   Stanhope, in the same diocese. The benefice of Haughton was given to
   him in 1722, and that of Stanhope in 1725. At Haughton there was a
   necessity for rebuilding a great part of the parsonage-house, and Mr
   Butler had neither money nor talents for that work. Mr Secker,
   therefore, who had always the interest of his friends at heart, and had
   acquired a very considerable influence with Bishop Talbot, persuaded
   that Prelate to give Mr Butler, in exchange for Haughton, the rectory
   of Stanhope, which was not only free from any such incumbrance, but was
   likewise of much superior value, being indeed one of the richest
   parsonages in England. Whilst our Author continued preacher at the
   Rolls Chapel, he divided his time between his duty in town and country;
   but when he quitted the Rolls, he resided during seven years, wholly at
   Stanhope, in the conscientious discharge of every obligation
   appertaining to a good parish priest. This retirement, however, was too
   solitary for his disposition, which had in it a natural cast of
   gloominess. And though his recluse hours were by no means lost, either
   to private improvement or public utility, yet he felt at times, very
   painfully, the want of that select society of friends to which he had
   been accustomed, and which could inspire him with the greatest
   cheerfulness. Mr Secker, therefore, who knew this, was extremely
   anxious to draw him out into a more active and conspicuous scene, and
   omitted no opportunity of expressing this desire to such as he thought
   capable of promoting it. Having himself been appointed King's Chaplain
   in 1732, he took occasion, in a conversation which he had the honour of
   holding with Queen Caroline, to mention to her his friend Mr Butler.
   The Queen said she thought he had been dead. Mr Secker assured her he
   was not. Yet her Majesty afterwards asked Archbishop Blackburn, if he
   was not dead: his answer was, "No, madam; but he is buried." Mr Seeker
   continuing his purpose of endeavouring to bring his friend out of his
   retirement, found means, upon Mr Charles Talbot's being made Lord
   Chancellor, to have Mr Butler recommended to him for his Chaplain. His
   Lordship accepted, and sent for him; and this promotion calling him to
   Town, he took Oxford in his way, and was admitted there to the degree
   of Doctor of Law, on the 8th of December, 1733. The Lord Chancellor,
   who gave him also a prebend in the church of Rochester, had consented
   that he should reside at his parish of Stanhope one half of the year.

   Dr Butler being thus brought back into the world, his merit and his
   talents soon introduced him to particular notice, and paved the way for
   his rising to those high dignities which he afterwards enjoyed. In 1736
   he was appointed Clerk of the Closet to Queen Caroline; and, in the
   same year, he presented to her Majesty a copy of his excellent
   Treatise, entitled, "The Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to
   the Constitution and Course of Nature." His attendance upon his Royal
   Mistress, by her especial command, was from seven to nine in the
   evening every day: and though this particular relation to that
   excellent and learned Queen was soon determined by her death, in 1737,
   yet he had been so effectually recommended by her, as well as by the
   late Lord Chancellor Talbot, to his Majesty's favour, that in the next
   year he was raised to the highest order of the Church, by a nomination
   to the bishopric of Bristol; to which see he was consecrated on the 3d
   of December 1738. King George II. not being satisfied with this proof
   of his regard to Dr Butler, promoted him, in 1740, to the Deanery of St
   Paul's, London, into which he was installed on the 24th of May in that
   year. Finding the demands of this dignity to be incompatible with his
   parish duty at, Stanhope, he immediately resigned that rich benefice.
   Besides our Prelate's unremitted attention to his peculiar obligations,
   he was called upon to preach several discourses on public occasions,
   which were afterwards separately printed, and have since been annexed
   to the latter editions of the Sermons at the Rolls Chapel. In 1746,
   upon the death of Dr Egerton, Bishop of Hereford, Dr Butler was made
   Clerk of the Closet to the King; and, on the 16th of October 1750, he
   received another distinguished mark of his Majesty's favour, by being
   translated to the see of Durham. This was on the 16th of October in
   that year, upon the decease of Dr Edward Chandler. Our Prelate being
   thus appointed to preside over a diocese with which he had long been
   connected, delivered his first, and indeed his last Charge to his
   Clergy, at his primary visitation in 1751. The principal object of it
   was "External Religion." The Bishop having observed, with deep concern,
   the great and growing neglect of serious piety in the kingdom, insisted
   strongly on the usefulness of outward forms and institutions, in fixing
   and preserving a sense of devotion and duty in the minds of men. In
   doing this, he was thought by several persons to speak too favourably
   of Pagan and Popish ceremonies, and to countenance, in a certain
   degree, the cause of superstition. Under that apprehension, an able and
   spirited writer, who was understood to be a Clergyman of the Church of
   England, published, in 1752, a pamphlet, entitled, "A Serious Inquiry
   into the Use and Importance of External Religion; occasioned by some
   Passages in the Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of Durham's Charge to the
   Clergy of that Diocese;--Humbly addressed to his Lordship." Many
   persons, however, and we believe the greater part of the Clergy of the
   diocese, did not think our Prelate's Charge so exceptionable as it
   appeared to this author. The Charge, being printed at Durham, and
   having never been annexed to any of Dr Butler's other works, is now
   become extremely scarce; and it is observable, that it is the only one
   of his publications which ever produced him a direct literary
   antagonist.

   By this promotion, our worthy Bishop was furnished with ample means of
   exerting the virtue of charity; a virtue which eminently abounded in
   him, and the exercise of which was his highest delight. But this
   gratification he did not long enjoy. He had been but a short time
   seated in his new bishopric, when his health began visibly to decline;
   and having been complimented, during his indisposition, upon account of
   his great resignation to the Divine will, he is said to have expressed
   some regret, that he should be taken from the present world so soon
   after he had been rendered capable of becoming much more useful in it.
   In his illness he was carried to Bristol, to try the waters of that
   place; but these proving ineffectual, he removed to Bath, where, being
   past recovery, he died on the 16th of June, 1752. His corpse was
   conveyed to Bristol, and interred in the cathedral there, where a
   monument, with an inscription, is erected to his memory.

   On the greatness of Bishop Butler's character we need not enlarge; for
   his profound knowledge, and the prodigious strength of his mind, are
   amply displayed in his incomparable writings. His piety was of the most
   serious and fervent, and, perhaps, somewhat of the ascetic kind. His
   benevolence was warm, generous, and diffusive. Whilst he was Bishop of
   Bristol, he expended, in repairing and improving the episcopal palace,
   four thousand pounds, which is said to have been more than the whole
   revenues of the bishopric amounted to, during his continuance in that
   see. Besides his private benefactions, he was a contributor to the
   infirmary at Bristol, and a subscriber to three of the hospitals at
   London. He was likewise a principal promoter, though not the first
   founder, of the infirmary at Newcastle, in Northumberland. In
   supporting the hospitality and dignity of the rich and powerful diocese
   of Durham, he was desirous of imitating the spirit of his patron,
   Bishop Talbot. In this spirit he set apart three days every week for
   the reception and entertainment of the principal gentry of the country.
   Nor were even the Clergy who had the poorest benefices neglected by
   him. He not only occasionally invited them to dine with him, but
   condescended to visit them at their respective parishes. By his will he
   left five hundred pounds to the Society for propagating the Gospel in
   Foreign Parts, and some legacies to his friends and domestics. His
   executor and residuary legatee was his chaplain, the Rev. Dr Nathanael
   Forster, a divine of distinguished literature. Bishop Butler was never
   married. Soon after his decease, the following lines, by way of
   epitaph, were written concerning him; and were printed first, if we
   recollect aright, in the London Magazine.


   Beneath this marble Butler lies entomb'd,

   Who, with a soul inflamed by love divine,

   His life in presence of his God consumed,

   Like the bright lamps before the holy shrine.

   His aspect pleasing, mind with learning fraught

   His eloquence was like a chain of gold,

   That the wild passions of mankind controll'd;

   Merit, wherever to be found, he sought.

   Desire of transient riches he had none;

   These he, with bounteous hand, did well dispense:

   Bent to fulfill the ends of Providence;

   His heart still fix'd on an immortal crown.

   His heart a mirror was, of purest kind,

   Where the bright image of his Maker shined;

   Reflecting faithful to the throne above,

   Th' irradiant glories of the Mystic Dove.

   THE following Epitaph, said to be written by Dr Nathanael Forster, is
   inscribed on a flat marble stone, in the cathedral church of Bristol,
   placed over the spot where the remains of Bishop Butler are deposited;
   and which, as it is now almost obliterated, it may be worth while here
   to preserve.

                                 INTRODUCTION.

   PROBABLE evidence is essentially distinguished from demonstrative by
   this, that it admits of degrees; and of all variety of them, from the
   highest moral certainty, to the very lowest presumption. We cannot
   indeed say a thing is probably true upon one very slight presumption
   for it; because, as there may be probabilities on both sides of a
   question, there may be some against it; and though there be not, yet a
   slight presumption does not beget that degree of conviction, which is
   implied in saying a thing is probably true. But that the slightest
   possible presumption is of the nature of a probability, appears from
   hence; that such low presumption often repeated, will amount even to
   moral certainty. Thus a man's having observed the ebb and flow of the
   tide to-day, affords some sort of presumption, though the lowest
   imaginable, that it may happen again to-morrow: but the observation of
   this event for so many days, and months, and ages together, as it has
   been observed by mankind, gives us a full assurance that it will.

   That which chiefly constitutes Probability is expressed in the word
   Likely, i. e. like some truth, [50] or true event; like it, in itself,
   in its evidence, in some more or fewer of its circumstances. For when
   we determine a thing to be probably true, suppose that an event has or
   will come to pass, it is from the mind's remarking in it a likeness to
   some other event, which we have observed has come to pass. And this
   observation forms, in numberless daily instances, a presumption,
   opinion, or full conviction, that such event has or will come to pass;
   according as the observation is, that the like event has sometimes,
   most commonly, or always, so far as our observation reaches, come to
   pass at like distances of time, or place, or upon like occasions. Hence
   arises the belief, that a child if it lives twenty years, will grow up
   to the stature and strength of a man; that food will contribute to the
   preservation of its life, and the want of it for such a number of days,
   be its certain destruction. So likewise the rule and measure of our
   hopes and fears concerning the success of our pursuits; our
   expectations that others will act so and so in such circumstances; and
   our judgment that such actions proceed from such principles; all these
   rely upon our having observed the like to what we hope, fear, expect,
   judge; I say, upon our having observed the like, either with respect to
   others or ourselves. And thus, whereas the prince [51] who had always
   lived in a warm climate, naturally concluded in the way of analogy,
   that there was no such thing as water's becoming hard, because he had
   always observed it to be fluid and yielding: we, on the contrary, from
   analogy conclude, that there is no presumption at all against this:
   that it is supposable there may be frost in England any given day in
   January next; probable that there will on some day of the month; and
   that there is a moral certainty, i. e. ground for an expectation
   without any doubt of it, in some part or other of the winter.

   Probable evidence, in its very nature, affords but an imperfect kind of
   information; and is to be considered as relative only to beings of
   limited capacities. For nothing which is the possible object of
   knowledge, whether past, present, or future, can be probable to an
   infinite Intelligence; since it cannot but be discerned absolutely as
   it is in itself, certainly true, or certainly false. But to us,
   probability is the very guide of life.

   From these things it follows, that in questions of difficulty, or such
   as are thought so, where more satisfactory evidence cannot be had, or
   is not seen; if the result of examination be, that there appears upon
   the whole, any the lowest presumption on one side, and none on the
   other, ox a greater presumption on one side, though in the lowest
   degree greater; this determines the question, even in matters of
   speculation; and in matters of practice, will lay us under an absolute
   and formal obligation, in point of prudence and of interest, to act
   upon that presumption or low probability, though it be so low as to
   leave the mind in very great doubt which is the truth. For surely a man
   is as really bound in prudence to do what upon the whole appears,
   according to the best of his judgment, to be for his happiness, as what
   he certainly knows to be so. Nay further, in questions of great
   consequence, a reasonable man will think it concerns him to remark
   lower probabilities and presumptions than these; such as amount to no
   more than showing one side of a question to be as supposable and
   credible as the other: nay, such as but amount to much less even than
   this. For numberless instances might be mentioned respecting the common
   pursuits of life, where a man would be thought, in a literal sense,
   distracted, who would not act, and with great application too, not only
   upon an even chance, but upon much less, and where the probability or
   chance was greatly against his succeeding. [52]

   It is not my design to inquire further into the nature, the foundation,
   and measure of probability; or whence it proceeds that likeness should
   beget that presumption, opinion, and full conviction, which the human
   mind is formed to receive from it, and which it does necessarily
   produce in every one; or to guard against the errors, to which
   reasoning from analogy is liable. This belongs to the subject of Logic;
   and is a part of that subject which has not yet been thoroughly
   considered. Indeed I shall not take upon me to say, how far the extent,
   compass, and force, of analogical reasoning, can be reduced to general
   heads and rules; and the whole be formed into a system. But though so
   little in this way has been attempted by those who have treated of our
   intellectual powers, and the exercise of them; this does not hinder but
   that we may be, as we unquestionably are, assured, that analogy is of
   weight, in various degrees, towards determining our judgment and our
   practice. Nor does it in any wise cease to be of weight in those cases,
   because persons, either giver to dispute, or who require things to be
   stated with greater exactness than our faculties appear to admit of in
   practical matters, may find other cases in. which it is not easy to
   say, whether it be, or be not, of any weight; or instances of seeming
   analogies, which are really of none. It is enough to the present
   purpose to observe, that this general way of arguing is evidently
   natural, just, and conclusive. For there is no man can make a question
   but that the sun will rise tomorrow and be seen, where it is seen at
   all, in the figure of a circle, and not in that of a square.

   Hence, namely from analogical reasoning, Origen [53] has with singular
   sagacity observed, that he who believes the Scripture to have proceeded
   from him who is the Author of Nature, may well expect to find the same
   sort of difficulties in it, as are found in the constitution of Nature.
   And in a like way of reflection it may be added, that he who denies the
   Scripture to have been from God upon account of these difficulties,
   may, for the very same reason deny the world to have been formed by
   him. On the other hand, if there be an analogy or likeness between that
   system of things and dispensation of Providence, which Revelation
   informs us of, and that system of things and dispensation of
   Providence, which Experience together with Reason. informs us of, i. e.
   the known course of Nature; this is a presumption, that they have both
   the same author and cause; at least so far as to answer objections
   against the former's being from God, drawn from any thing which is
   analogical or similar to what is in the latter, which is acknowledged
   to be from him; for an Author of Nature is here supposed.

   Forming our notions of the constitution and government of the world
   upon reasoning, without foundation for the principles which we assume,
   whether from the attributes of God, or any thing else, is building a
   world upon hypothesis, like Des Cartes. Forming our notions upon
   reasoning from principles which are certain, but applied to cases to
   which we have no ground to apply them (like those who explain the
   structure of the human body, and the nature of diseases and medicines
   from mere mathematics without sufficient data,) is an error much akin
   to the former: since what is assumed in order to make the reasoning
   applicable, is Hypothesis. But it must be allowed just, to join
   abstract reasonings with the observation of facts, and argue from such
   facts as are known, to others that are like them; from that part of the
   Divine government over intelligent creatures which comes under our
   view, to that larger and more general government over them which is
   beyond it; and from what is present, to collect what is likely,
   credible, or not incredible, will be hereafter.

   This method then of concluding and determining being practical, and
   what, if we will act at all, we cannot but act upon in the common
   pursuits of life; being evidently conclusive, in various degrees,
   proportionable to the degree and exactness of the whole analogy or
   likeness; and having so great authority for its introduction into the
   subject of religion, even revealed religion; my design is to apply it
   to that subject in general, both natural and revealed: taking for
   proved, that there is an intelligent Author of Nature, and natural
   Governor of the world. For as there is no presumption against this
   prior to the proof of it: so it has been often proved with accumulated
   evidence; from this argument of analogy and final causes; from abstract
   reasonings; from the most ancient tradition and testimony; and from the
   general consent of mankind. Nor does it appear, so far as I can find,
   to be denied by the generality of those who profess themselves
   dissatisfied with the evidence of religion.

   As there are some, who, instead of thus attending to what is in fact
   the constitution of Nature, form their notions of God's government upon
   hypothesis: so there are others, who indulge themselves in vain and
   idle speculations, how the world might possibly have been framed
   otherwise than it is; and upon supposition that things might, in
   imagining that they should, have been disposed and carried on after a
   better model, than what appears in the present disposition and conduct
   of them. Suppose now a person of such a turn of mind, to go on with his
   reveries, till he had at length fixed upon some particular plan of
   Nature, as appearing to him the best--One shall scarce be thought
   guilty of detraction against human understanding, if one should say,
   even beforehand, that the plan which this speculative person wouid fix
   upon, though he were the wisest of the sons of mei, probably would not
   be the very best, even according to his own notions of best; whether he
   thought that to be so, which afforded occasions and motives for the
   exercise of the greatest virtue, or which was productive of the
   greatest happiness, or that these two were necessarily connected, and
   run up into one and the same plan. However, it may not be amiss, once
   for all, to see what would be the amount of these emendations and
   imaginary improvements upon the system of nature, or how far they would
   mislead us. And it seems there could be no stopping, till we came to
   some such conclusions as these: that all creatures should at first be
   made as perfect and as happy as they were capable of ever being: that
   nothing, to be sure, of hazard or danger should be put upon them to do;
   some indolent persons would perhaps think nothing at all: or certainly,
   that effectual care should be taken, that they should, whether
   necessarily or not, yet eventually and in fact, always do what was
   right and most conducive to happiness, which would be thought easy for
   infinite power to effect; either by not giving them any principles
   which would endanger their going wrong; or by laying the right motive
   of action in every instance before their minds continually in so strong
   a manner, as would never fail of inducing them to act conformably to
   it: and that the whole method of government by punishments should be
   rejected as absurd; as an awkward round-about method of carrying things
   on; nay, as contrary to a principal purpose, for which it would be
   supposed creatures were made, namely, happiness.

   Now, without considering what is to be said in particular to the
   several parts of this train of folly and extravagance; what has been
   above intimated, is a full direct general answer to it, namely, that we
   may see beforehand that we have not faculties for this kind of
   speculation. For though it be admitted that, from the first principles
   of our nature, we unavoidably judge or determine some ends to be
   absolutely in themselves preferable to others, and that the ends now
   mentioned, or if they run up into one, that this one is absolutely the
   best; and consequently that we must conclude the ultimate end designed,
   in the constitution of Nature and conduct of Providence, is the most
   virtue and happiness possible; yet we are far from being able to judge
   what particular disposition of things would be most friendly and
   assistant to virtue; or what means might be absolutely necessary to
   produce the most happiness in a system of such extent as our own world
   may be, taking in all that is past and to come, though we should
   suppose it detached from the whole of things. Indeed we are so far from
   being able to judge of this, that we are not judges what may be the
   necessary means of raising and conducting one person to the highest
   perfection and happiness of his nature. Nay, even in the little affairs
   of the present life, we find men of different educations and ranks are
   not competent judges of the conduct of each other. Our whole nature
   leads us to ascribe all moral perfection to God, and to deny all
   imperfection of him. And this will for ever be a practical proof of his
   moral character, to such as will consider what a practical proof is;
   because it is the voice of God speaking in us. And from hence we
   conclude, that virtue must be the happiness, and vice the misery, of
   every creature; and that regularity and order and right cannot but
   prevail finally in a universe under his government. But we are in no
   sort judges, what are the necessary means of accomplishing this end.

   Let us then, instead of that idle and not very innocent employment of
   forming imaginary models of a world, and schemes of governing it, turn
   our thoughts to what we experience to be the conduct of Nature with
   respect to intelligent creatures; which may be resolved into general
   laws or rules of administration, in the same way as many of the laws of
   Nature respecting inanimate matter may be collected from experiments.
   And let us compare the known constitution and course of things with
   what is said to be the moral system of Nature; the acknowledged
   dispensations of Providence, or that government which we find ourselves
   under, with what religion teaches us to believe and expect; and see
   whether they are not analogous and of a piece. And upon such a
   comparison it will, I think, be found that they are very much so: that
   both may be traced up to the same general laws, and resolved into the
   same principles of divine conduct.

   The analogy here proposed to be considered is of pretty large extent,
   and consists of several parts; in some more, in others less exact. In
   some few instances perhaps it may amount to a real practical proof; in
   others not so. Yet in these it is a confirmation of what is proved
   otherwise. It will undeniably show, what too many want to have shown
   them, that the system of Religion, both natural and revealed,
   considered only as a system, and prior to the proof of it, is not a
   subject of ridicule, unless that of Nature be so too. And it will
   afford an answer to almost all objections against the system both of
   natural and revealed Religion; though not perhaps an answer in so great
   a degree, yet in a very considerable degree an answer to the objections
   against the evidence of it: for objections against a proof, and
   objections against what is said to be proved, the reader will observe
   are different things.

   Now the divine government of the world, implied in the notion of
   religion in general and of Christianity, contains in it; that mankind
   is appointed to live in a future state; [54] that there every one shall
   be rewarded or punished; [55] rewarded or punished respectively for all
   that behaviour here, which we comprehend under the words, virtuous or
   vicious, morally good or evil: [56] that our present life is a
   probation, a state of trial, [57] and of discipline, [58] for that
   future one; notwithstanding the objections, which men may fancy they
   have, from notions of Necessity, against there being any such moral
   plan as this at all; [59] and whatever objections may appear to lie
   against the wisdom and goodness of it, as it stands so imperfectly made
   known to us at present: [60] that this world being in a state of
   apostasy and wickedness, and consequently of ruin, and the sense both
   of their condition and duty being greatly corrupted amongst men, this
   gave occasion for an additional dispensation of Providence; of the
   utmost importance; [61] proved by miracles; [62] but containing in it
   many things appearing to us strange, and not to have been expected;
   [63] a dispensation of Providence, which is a scheme or system of
   things; [64] carried on by the mediation of a divine person, the
   Messiah, in order to the recovery of the world; [65] yet not revealed
   to all men, nor proved with the strongest possible evidence to all
   those to whom it is revealed; but only to such a part of mankind, and
   with such particular evidence, as the wisdom of God thought fit. [66]
   The design then of the following Treatise will be to show, that the
   several parts principally objected against in this moral and Christian
   dispensation, including its scheme, its publication, and the proof
   which God has afforded us of its truth; that the particular parts
   principally objected against in this whole dispensation, are analogous
   to what is experienced in the constitution and course of Nature, or
   Providence; that the thief objections themselves which are alleged
   against the former, are no other than what may be alleged with like
   justness against the latter, where they are found in fact to be
   inconclusive; and that this argument from analogy is in general
   unanswerable, and undoubtedly of weight on the side of religion, [67]
   notwithstanding the Objections which may seem to lie against it, and
   the real ground which there may be for difference of opinion, as to the
   particular degree of weight which is to be laid upon it. This is a
   general account of what may be looked for in the following Treatise.
   And I shall begin it with that which is the foundation of all our hopes
   and of all our fears; all our hopes and fears, which are of any
   consideration; I mean a Future Life.

  CHAP. I.

  OF A FUTURE LIFE.

   STRANGE difficulties have been raised by some concerning personal
   identity, or the sameness of living agents, implied in the notion of
   our existing now and hereafter, or in any two successive moments; which
   whoever thinks it worth while, may see considered in the first
   Dissertation at the end of this Treatise. But without regard to any of
   them here, let us consider what the analogy of nature, and the several
   changes which we have undergone, and those which we know we may undergo
   without being destroyed, suggest, as to the effect which death may, or
   may not, have upon us; and whether it be not from thence probable, that
   we may survive this change, and exist in a future state of life and
   perception.

   I. From our being born into the present world in the helpless imperfect
   state of infancy, and having arrived from thence to mature age, we find
   it to be a general law of nature in our own species, that the same
   creatures, the same individuals, should exist in degrees of life and
   perception, with capacities of action, of enjoyment and suffering, in
   one period of their being, greatly different from those appointed them
   in another period of it. And in other creatures the same law holds. For
   the difference of their capacities and states of life at their birth
   (to go no higher) and in maturity; the change of worms into flies, and
   the vast enlargement of their locomotive powers by such change: and
   birds and insects bursting the shell If their habitation, and by this
   means entering into a new world, furnished with new accommodations for
   them, and finding a new sphere of action assigned them; these are
   instances of this general law of nature. Thus all the various and
   wonderful transformations of animals are to be taken into consideration
   here. But the states of life in which we ourselves existed formerly in
   the womb and in our infancy, are almost as different from our present
   in mature age, as it is possible to conceive any two states or degrees
   of life can be. Therefore that we are to exist hereafter, in a state as
   different (suppose) from our present, as this is from our former, is
   but according to the analogy of nature; according to a natural order or
   appointment of the very same kind, with what we have already
   experienced.

   II. We know we are endued with capacities of action, of happiness and
   misery: for we are conscious of acting, of enjoying pleasure and
   suffering pain. Now that we have these powers and capacities before
   death, is a presumption that we shall retain them through and after
   death; indeed a probability of it abundantly sufficient to act upon,
   unless there be some positive reason to think that death is the
   destruction of those living powers: because there is in every case a
   probability, that all things will continue as we experience they are,
   in all respects, except those in which we have some reason to think
   they will be altered. This is that kind [68] of presumption or
   probability from analogy, expressed in the very word continuance, which
   seems our only natural reason for believing the course of the world
   will continue to-morrow, as it has done so far as our experience or
   knowledge of history can carry us back. Nay it seems our only reason
   for believing, that any one substance now existing will continue to
   exist a moment longer; the self-existent substance only excepted. Thus
   if men were assured that the unknown event, death, was not the
   destruction of our faculties of perception and of action, there would
   be no apprehension, that any other power or event, unconnected with
   this of death, would destroy these faculties just at the instant of
   each creature's death; and therefore no doubt but that they would
   remain after it; which shows the high probability that our living
   powers will continue after death, unless there be some ground to think
   that death is their destruction. [69] For, if it would be. in a manner
   certain that we should survive death, provided it were certain that
   death would not be our destruction, it must be highly probable we shall
   survive it, if there be no ground to think death will be our
   destruction.

   Now, though I think it must be acknowledged, that prior to the natural
   and moral proofs of a future life commonly insisted upon, there would
   arise a general confused suspicion, that in the great shock and
   alteration which we shall undergo by death, we, i. e. our living
   powers, might be wholly destroyed; yet even prior to those proofs,
   there is really no particular distinct ground or reason for this
   apprehension at all, so far as I can find. If there be, it must arise
   either from the reason of the thing, or from the analogy of nature.

   But we cannot argue from the reason of the thing, that death is the
   destruction of living agents, because we know not at all what death is
   in itself; but only some of its effects, such as the dissolution of
   flesh, skin, and bones. And these effects do in. no wise appear to
   imply the destruction of a living agent. And besides, as we are greatly
   in the dark, upon what the exercise of our living powers depends, so we
   are wholly ignorant what the powers themselves depend upon; the powers
   themselves as distinguished, not only from their actual exercise, but
   also from the present capacity of exercising them; and as opposed to
   their destruction: for sleep, or however a swoon, shows us, not only
   that these powers exist when they are not exercised, as the passive
   power of motion does in inanimate matter; but shows also that they
   exist, when there is no present capacity of exercising them: or that
   the capacities of exercising them for the present, as well as the
   actual exercise of them, may be suspended, and yet the powers
   themselves remain undestroyed. Since then we know not at all upon what
   the existence of our living powers depends, this shows further, there
   can no probability be collected from the reason of the thing, that
   death will be their destruction: because their existence may depend
   upon somewhat in no degree affected by death; upon somewhat quite out
   of the reach of this king of terrors. So that there is nothing more
   certain, than that the reason of the thing shows us no connexion
   between death and the destruction of living agents. Nor can we find any
   thing throughout the whole analogy of nature, to afford us even the
   slightest presumption, that animals ever lose their living powers; much
   less if it were possible, that they lose them by death: for we have no
   faculties wherewith to trace any beyond or through it, so as to see
   what becomes of them. This event removes them from our view. It
   destroys the sensible proof, which we had before their death, of their
   being possessed of living powers, but does not appear to afford the
   least reason to believe that they are, then, or by that event,
   deprived, of them.

   And our knowing, that they were possessed of these powers, up to the
   very period to which we have faculties capable of tracing them, is
   itself a probability of their retaining them beyond it. And this is
   confirmed, and a sensible credibility is given to it, by observing the
   very great and astonishing changes which we have experienced; so great,
   that our existence in another state of life, of perception and of
   action, will be but according to a method of providential conduct, the
   like to which has been already exercised even with regard to ourselves;
   according to a course of nature, the like to which we have already gone
   through.

   However, as one cannot but be greatly sensible, how difficult it is to
   silence imagination enough to make the voice of reason even distinctly
   heard in this case; as we are accustomed, from our youth up, to indulge
   that forward, delusive faculty, ever obtruding beyond its sphere; of
   some assistance indeed to apprehension, but the author of all error: as
   we plainly lose ourselves in gross and crude conceptions of things,
   taking for granted that we are acquainted with what indeed we are
   wholly ignorant of: it may be proper to consider the imaginary
   presumptions, that death will be our destruction, arising from these
   kinds of early and lasting prejudices; and to show how little they can
   really amount to, even though we cannot wholly divest ourselves of
   them. And,

   I. All presumption of death's being the destruction of living beings,
   must go upon supposition that they are compounded; and so,
   discerptible. But since consciousness is a single and indivisible
   power, it should seem that the subject in which it resides must be so
   too. For were the motion of any particle of matter absolutely one and
   indivisible, so as that it should imply a contradiction to suppose part
   of this motion to exist, and part not to exist, i. e. part of this
   matter to move, and part to be at rest; then its power of motion would
   be indivisible; and so also would the subject in which the power
   inheres, namely, the particle of matter: for if this could be divided
   into two, one part might be moved and the other at rest, which is
   contrary to the supposition. In like manner it has been argued, [70]
   and, for any thing appearing to the contrary, justly, that since the
   perception or consciousness, which we have of our own existence, is
   indivisible, so as that it is a contradiction to suppose one part of it
   should be here and the other there; the perceptive power, or the power
   of consciousness, is indivisible too: and consequently the subject in
   which it resides; i. e. the conscious Being. Now upon supposition that
   living agent each man calls himself, is thus a single being, which
   there is at least no more difficulty in conceiving than in conceiving
   it to be a compound, and of which there is the proof now mentioned; it
   follows, that our organized bodies are no more ourselves or part of
   ourselves, than any other matter around us. And, it is as easy to
   conceive, how matter, which is no part of ourselves, may be
   appropriated to us in the manner which our present bodies are; as how
   we can receive impressions from, and have power over, any matter. It is
   as easy to conceive, that we may exist out of bodies, as in them; that
   we might have animated bodies of any other organs and senses wholly
   different from these now given us, and that we may hereafter animate
   these same or new bodies variously modified and organized; as to
   conceive how we can animate such bodies as our present. And lastly, the
   dissolution of all these several organized bodies, supposing ourselves
   to have successively animated them, would have no more conceivable
   tendency to destroy the living beings ourselves, or deprive us of
   living faculties, the faculties of perception and of action, than the
   dissolution of any foreign matter, which we are capable of receiving
   impressions from, and making use of, for the common occasions of life.

   II. The simplicity and absolute oneness of a living agent cannot
   indeed, from the nature of the thing, be properly proved by
   experimental observations. But as these fall in with the supposition of
   its unity, so they plainly lead us to conclude certainly, that our
   gross organized bodies, with which we perceive the objects of sense,
   and with which we act, are no part of ourselves; and therefore show us,
   that we have no reason to believe their destruction to be ours: even
   without determining whether our living substances be material or
   immaterial. For we see by experience, that men may lose their limbs,
   their organs of sense, and even the greatest part of these bodies, and
   yet remain the same living agents. And persons can trace up the
   existence of themselves to a time, when the bulk of their bodies was
   extremely small, in comparison of what it is in mature age: and we
   cannot but think, that they might then have lost a considerable part of
   that small body, and yet have remained the same living agents; as they
   may now lose great part of their present body, and remain so. And it is
   certain, that the bodies of all animals are in a constant flux, from
   that never-ceasing attrition, which there is in every part of them. Now
   things of this kind unavoidably teach us to distinguish, between these
   living agents ourselves, and large quantities of matter, in which we
   are very nearly interested: since these may be alienated, and actually
   are in a daily course of succession, and changing their owners; whilst
   we are assured, that each living agent remains one and the same
   permanent being. [71] And this general observation leads us on to the
   following ones.

   First, That we have no way of determining by experience, what is the
   certain bulk of the living being each man calls himself: and yet, till
   it be determined that it is larger in bulk than the solid elementary
   particles of matter, which there is no ground to think any natural
   power can dissolve, there is no sort of reason to think death to be the
   dissolution of it, of the living being, even though it should not be
   absolutely indiscerptible.

   Secondly, From our being so nearly related to and interested in certain
   systems of matter, suppose our flesh and bones, and afterwards ceasing
   to be at all related to them, the living agents ourselves remaining all
   this while undestroyed notwithstanding such alienation; and
   consequently these systems of matter not being ourselves: it follows
   further, that we have no ground to conclude any other, suppose internal
   systems of matter, to be the living agents ourselves; because we can
   have no ground to conclude this, but from our relation to and interest
   in such other systems of matter: and therefore we can have no reason to
   conclude, what befalls those systems of matter at death, to be the
   destruction of the living agents. We have already several times over
   lost a great part or perhaps the whole of our body, according to
   certain common established laws of nature; yet we remain the same
   living agents: when we shall lose as great a part, or the whole, by
   another common established law of nature, death; why may we not also
   remain the same? That the alienation has been gradual in one case, and
   in the other will be more at once, does not prove any thing to the
   contrary. We have passed undestroyed through those many and great
   revolutions of matter, so peculiarly appropriated to us ourselves; why
   should we imagine death will be so fatal to us? Nor can it be objected,
   that what is thus alienated or lost, is no part of our original solid
   body, but only adventitious matter; because we may lose entire limbs,
   which must have contained many solid parts and vessels of the original
   body; or if this be not admitted, we have no proof, that any of these
   solid parts are dissolved or alienated by death. Though, by the way, we
   are very nearly related to that extraneous or adventitious matter,
   whilst it continues united to and distending the several parts of our
   solid body. But after all; the relation a person bears to those parts
   of his body, to which he is the most nearly related; what does it
   appear to amount to but this, that the living agent, and those parts of
   the body, mutually affect each other? And the same thing, the same
   thing in kind though not in degree, may be said of all foreign matter,
   which gives us ideas, and which we have any power over. From these
   observations the whole ground of the imagination is removed, that the
   dissolution of any matter, is the destruction of a living agent, from
   the interest he once had in such matter.

   Thirdly, If we consider our body somewhat more distinctly, as made up
   of organs and instruments of perception and of motion, it will bring us
   to the same conclusion, Thus the common optical experiments show, and
   even the observation how sight is assisted by glasses shows, that we
   see with our eyes in the same sense as we see with glasses. Nor is
   there any reason to believe, that we see with them in any other sense;
   any other, I mean, which would lead us to think the eye itself a
   percipient. The like is to be said of hearing and our feeling distant
   solid matter by means of somewhat in our hand seems an instance of the
   like kind. as to the subject we are considering. All these are
   instances of foreign matter, or such as is no part of our body, being
   instrumental in preparing objects for, and conveying them to, the
   perceiving power, in a manner similar or like to the manner in which
   our organs of sense prepare and convey them. Both are in a like way
   instruments of our receiving such ideas from external objects, as the
   Author of nature appointed those external objects to be the occasions
   of exciting in us. However, glasses are evidently instances of this;
   namely of matter which is no part of our body, preparing objects for
   and conveying them towards the perceiving power, in like manner as our
   bodily organs do. And if we see with our eyes only in the same manner
   as we do with glasses, the like may justly be concluded, from analogy,
   of all our other senses. It is not intended, by any thing here said, to
   affirm, that the whole apparatus of vision, or of perception by any
   other of our senses; can be traced through all its steps, quite up to
   the living power of seeing, or perceiving: but that so far as it can be
   traced by experimental observations, so far it appears, that our organs
   of sense prepare and convey on objects, in order to their being
   perceived, in like manner as foreign matter does, without affording any
   shadow of appearance, that they themselves perceive. And that we have
   no reason to think our organs of sense percipients, is confirmed by
   instances of persons losing some of them, the living beings themselves,
   their former occupiers, remaining unimpaired. It is confirmed also by
   the experience of dreams; by which we find we are at present possessed
   of a latent, and what would otherwise be, an unimagined unknown power
   of perceiving sensible objects, in as strong and lively a manner
   without our external organs of sense as with them.

   So also with regard to our power of moving, or directing motion by will
   and choice; upon the destruction of a limb, this active power remains,
   as it evidently seems, unlessened; so as that the living being, who has
   suffered this loss, would be capable of moving as before, if it had
   another limb to move with. It can walk by the help of an artificial
   leg; just as it can make use of a pole or a lever, to reach towards
   itself and to move things, beyond the length and the power of its
   natural arm; and this last it does in the same manner as it reaches and
   moves, with its natural arm, things nearer and of less weight. Nor is
   there so much as any appearance of our limbs being endued with a power
   of moving or directing themselves; though they are adapted; like the
   several parts; of a machine, to be the instruments of motion to each
   other; and some parts of the same limb, to be instruments of motion to
   other parts of it.

   Thus a man determines, that he will look at such an object through a
   microscope; or being lame suppose, that he will walk to such a place
   with a staff a week hence. His eyes and his feet no more determine in
   these cases, than the microscope and the staff. Nor is there any ground
   to think they any more put the determination in practice; or that his
   eyes are the seers or his feet the movers, in any other sense than as
   the microscope and the staff are. Upon the whole then, our organs of
   sense and our limbs are certainly instruments, which the living persons
   ourselves make use of to perceive and move with: there is not any
   probability, that they are any more; nor consequently, that we have any
   other kind of relation to them, than what we have to any other foreign
   matter formed into instruments of perception and motion, suppose into a
   microscope or a staff (I say any other kind of relation, for I am not
   speaking of the degree of it); nor consequently is there any
   probability, that the alienation or dissolution of these instruments is
   the destruction of the perceiving and moving agent.

   And thus our finding, that the dissolution of matter, in which living
   beings were most nearly interested, is not their dissolution; and that
   the destruction of several of the organs and instruments of perception
   and of motion belonging to them, is not their destruction; shows
   demonstratively, that there is no ground to think that the dissolution
   of any other matter, or destruction of any other organs and
   instruments, will be the dissolution or destruction of living agents,
   from the like kind of relation. And we have no reason to think we stand
   in any other kind of relation to any thing which we find dissolved by
   death.

   But it is said these observations are equally applicable to brutes: and
   it is thought an insuperable difficulty, that they should be immortal,
   and by consequence capable of everlasting happiness. Now this manner of
   expression is both invidious and weak: but the thing intended by it, is
   really no difficulty at all, either in the way of natural or moral
   consideration. For 1st, Suppose the invidious thing, designed in such a
   manner of expression, were really implied, as it is not in the least,
   in the natural immortality of brutes: namely, that they must arrive at
   great attainments, and become rational and moral agents; even this
   would be no difficulty: since we know not what latent powers and
   capacities they may be endued with. There was once, prior to
   experience, as great presumption against human creatures as there is
   against the brute creatures, arriving at that degree of understanding,
   which we have in mature age. For we can trace up our own existence to
   the same original with theirs. And we find it to be a general law of
   nature, that creatures endued with capacities of virtue and religion
   should be placed in a condition of being, in which they are altogether
   without the use of them, for a considerable length of their duration;
   as in infancy and childhood. And great part of the human species go out
   of the present world, before they come to the exercise of these
   capacities in any degree at all. But then, 2dly, the natural
   immortality of brutes does not in the least imply, that they are endued
   with any latent capacities of a rational or moral nature. And the
   economy of the universe might require, that there should be living
   creatures without any capacities of this kind. And all difficulties as
   to the manner how they are to be disposed of are so apparently and
   wholly founded in our ignorance, that it is wonderful they should be
   insisted upon by any, but such as are weak enough to think they are
   acquainted with the whole system of things. There is then absolutely
   nothing at all in this objection, which is so rhetorically urged,
   against the greatest part of the natural proofs or presumptions of the
   immortality of human minds; I say the greatest part; for it is less
   applicable to the following observation, which is more peculiar to
   mankind:

   III. That as it is evident our present powers and capacities of reason,
   memory, and affection, do not depend upon our gross body in the mariner
   in which perception by our organs of sense does; so they do not appear
   to depend upon it at all in any such manner, as to give ground to
   think, that the dissolution of this body will be the destruction of
   these our present powers of reflection, as it will of our powers of
   sensation; or to give ground to conclude, even that it will be so much
   as a suspension of the former.

   Human creatures exist at present in two states of life and perception,
   greatly different from each other; each of which has its own peculiar
   laws and its own peculiar enjoyments and sufferings. When any of our
   senses are affected or appetites gratified with the objects of them, we
   may be said to exist or live in a state of sensation. When none of our
   senses are affected or appetites gratified, and yet we perceive, and
   reason, and act; we may be said to exist or live in a state of
   reflection. Now it is by no means certain, that any thing which is
   dissolved by death, is any way necessary to the living being in this
   its state of reflection, after ideas are gained. For, though, from our
   present constitution and condition of being, our external organs of
   sense are necessary for conveying in ideas to our reflecting powers, as
   carriages, and levers, and scaffolds are in architecture: yet when
   these ideas are brought in, we are capable of reflecting in the most
   intense degree, and of enjoying the greatest pleasure, and feeling the
   greatest pain, by means of that reflection, without any assistance from
   our senses; and without any at all, which we know of, from that body.
   which will be dissolved by death. It does not appear then, that the
   relation of this gross body to the reflecting being is, in any degree,
   necessary to thinking; to our intellectual enjoyments or sufferings:
   nor, consequently, that the dissolution or alienation of the former by
   death, will be the destruction of those present powers, which render us
   capable of this state of reflection. Further, there are instances of
   mortal diseases, which do not at all affect our present intellectual
   powers; and this affords a presumption, that those diseases will not
   destroy these present powers. Indeed, from the observations made above,
   [72] it appears, that there is no presumption, from their mutually
   affecting each other, that the dissolution of the body is the
   destruction of the living agent. And by the same reasoning, it must
   appear too, that there is no presumption, from their mutually affecting
   each other, that the dissolution of the body is the destruction of our
   present reflecting powers: but instances of their not affecting each
   other, afford a presumption of the contrary. Instances of mortal
   diseases not impairing our present reflecting powers,. evidently turn
   our thoughts even from imagining such diseases to be the destruction of
   them. Several things indeed greatly affect all our living powers, and
   at length suspend the exercise of them; as for instance drowsiness,
   increasing till it ends in sound sleep: and from hence we might have
   imagined it would destroy them, till we found by experience the
   weakness of this way of judging. But in the diseases now mentioned,
   there is not so much as this shadow of probability, to lead us to any
   such conclusion, as to the reflecting powers which we have at present.
   For in those diseases, persons the moment before death appear to be in
   the highest vigour of life. They discover apprehension, memory, reason,
   all entire; with the utmost force of affection; sense of a character,
   of shame and honour; and the highest mental enjoyments and sufferings,
   even to the last gasp: and these surely prove even greater vigour of
   life than bodily strength does. Now what pretence is there for
   thinking, that a progressive disease when arrived to such a degree, I
   mean that degree which is mortal, will destroy those powers, which were
   not impaired, which were not affected by it, during its whole progress
   quite up to that degree? And if death by diseases of this kind is not
   the destruction of our present reflecting powers, it will scarce be
   thought that death by any other means is.

   It is obvious that this general observation may be carried on further:
   and there appears so little connexion between our bodily powers of
   sensation, and our present powers of reflection, that there is no
   reason to conclude, that death, which destroys the former, does so much
   as suspend, the exercise of the latter, or interrupt our continuing to
   exist in the like state of reflection which we do now For suspension of
   reason, memory, and the affections which they excite, is no part of the
   idea of death, nor is implied in our notion of it. And our daily
   experiencing these powers to be exercised, without any assistance, that
   we know of, from those bodies, which will be dissolved by death; and
   our finding often, that the exercise of them is so lively to the last;
   these things afford a sensible apprehension, that death may not perhaps
   be so much as a discontinuance of the exercise of these powers, nor of
   the enjoyments and sufferings which it implies. [73] So that our
   posthumous life, whatever there may be in it additional to our present,
   yet may not be entirely beginning anew; but going on. Death may, in
   some sort and in some respects, answer to our birth; which is not a
   suspension of the faculties which we had before it, or a total change
   of the state of life in which we existed when in the womb; but a
   continuation of both, with such and such great alterations.

   Nay, for ought we know of ourselves, of our present life and of death;
   death may immediately, in the natural course of things, put us into a
   higher and more enlarged state of life, as our birth does; [74] a state
   in which our capacities, and sphere of perception and of action, may be
   much greater than at present. For as our relation to our external
   organs of sense, renders us capable of existing in our present state of
   sensation; so it may be the only natural hinderance to our existing,
   immediately, and of course, in a higher state of reflection. The truth
   is, reason does not at all show us, in what state death naturally
   leaves us. But were we sure, that it would suspend all our perceptive
   and active powers; yet the suspension of a power and the destruction of
   it, are effects so totally different in kind, as we experience from
   sleep and a swoon, that we cannot in any wise argue from one to the
   other; or conclude even to the lowest degree of probability, that the
   same kind of force which is sufficient to suspend our faculties, though
   it be increased ever so much, will be sufficient to destroy them.

   These observations together may be sufficient to show, how little
   presumption there is, that death is the destruction of human creatures.
   However, there is the shadow of an analogy, which may lead us to
   imagine it is the supposed likeness which is observed between the decay
   of vegetables, and of living creatures. And this likeness is indeed
   sufficient to afford the poets very apt allusions to the flowers of the
   field, in their pictures of the frailty of our present life. But in
   reason, the analogy is so far from holding, that there appears no
   ground even for the comparison, as to the present question; because one
   of the two subjects compared is wholly void of that, which is the
   principal and chief thing in the other, the power of perception and of
   action; and which is the only thing we are inquiring about the
   continuance of. So that the destruction of a vegetable, is an event not
   similar or analogous to the destruction of a living agent.

   But if, as was above intimated, leaving off the delusive custom of
   substituting imagination in the room of experience, we would confine
   ourselves to what we do know and understand; if we would argue only
   from that, and from that form our expectations; it would appear at
   first sight, that as no probability of living beings ever ceasing to be
   so, can be concluded from the reason of the thing; so none can be
   collected from the analogy of Nature; because we cannot trace any
   living beings beyond death. But as we are conscious that we are endued
   with capacities of perception and of action, and are living persons;
   what we are to go upon is, that we shall continue so, till we foresee
   some accident or event, which will endanger those capacities, or be
   likely to destroy us: which death does in no wise appear to be.

   And thus, when we go out of this world, we may pass into new scenes,
   and a new state of life and action, just as naturally as we came into
   the present. And this new state may naturally be a social one. And the
   advantages of it, advantages of every kind, may naturally be bestowed,
   according to some fixed general laws of wisdom, upon every one in
   proportion to the degrees of his virtue. And though the advantages of
   that future natural state should not be bestowed, as these of the
   present in some measure are, by the will of the society; but entirely
   by his more immediate action, upon whom the whole frame of nature
   depends: yet this distribution may be just as natural, as their being
   distributed here by the instrumentality of men. And indeed, though one
   were to allow any confused undetermined sense, which people please to
   put upon the word natural, it would be a shortness of thought scarce
   credible, to imagine, that no system or course of things can be so, but
   only what we see at present: [75] especially whilst the probability of
   a future life, or the natural immortality of the soul, is admitted upon
   the evidence of reason; because this is really both admitting and
   denying at once, a state of being different from the present to be
   natural. But the only distinct meaning of that word is, stated, fixed,
   or settled: since what is natural as much requires and presupposes an
   intelligent agent to render it so, i. e. to effect it continually, or
   at stated times; as what is supernatural or miraculous does to effect
   it for once. And from hence it must follow, that persons' notion of
   what is natural, will be enlarged in proportion to their greater
   knowledge of the works of God, and the dispensations of his Providence.
   Nor is there any absurdity in supposing, that there may be beings in
   the universe, whose capacities, and knowledge, and views, may be so
   extensive, as that the whole Christian dispensation may to them appear
   natural, i. e. analogous or conformable to God's dealings with other
   parts of his creation; as natural as the visible known course of things
   appears to us. For there seems scarce any other possible sense to be
   put upon the word, but that only in which it is here used; similar,
   stated, or uniform.

   This credibility of a future life, which has been here insisted upon,
   how little soever it may satisfy our curiosity, seems to answer all the
   purposes of religion, in like manner as a demonstrative proof would.
   Indeed a proof, even a demonstrative one, of a future life, would not
   be a proof of religion. For, that we are to live hereafter, is just as
   reconcilable with the scheme of atheism, and as well to be accounted
   for by it, as that we are now alive is: and therefore nothing can be
   more absurd than to argue from that scheme, that there can be no future
   state. But as religion implies a future state, any presumption against
   such a state, is a presumption against religion. And the foregoing
   observations remove all presumptions of that sort, and prove, to a very
   considerable degree of probability, one fundamental doctrine of
   religion; which, if believed, would greatly open and dispose the mind
   seriously to attend to the general evidence of the whole.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [68] I say kind of presumption or probability; for I do not mean to
   affirm that there is the same degree of conviction, that our living
   powers will continue after death, as there is, that our substances
   will.

   [69] Destruction of living powers, is a manner of expression
   unavoidably ambiguous; and may signify either the destruction of a
   living being, so as that the same living being shall be uncapable of
   ever perceiving or acting again at all; or the destruction of those
   means and instruments by which it is capable of its present life, of
   its present state of perception and of action. It is here used in the
   former sense. When it is used in the latter, the epithet present is
   added. The loss of a man's eye is a destruction of living powers in the
   latter sense. But we have no reason to think the destruction of living
   powers, in the former sense, to be possible We have no more reason to
   think a being endued with living powers, ever loses them during its
   whole existence, than to believe that a stone ever acquires them.

   [72] Pp. 64, 65.

   [73] There are three distinct questions, relating to a future life,
   here considered: Whether death be the destruction of living agents; if
   not, Whether it be the destruction of their present powers of
   reflection, as it certainly is the destruction of their present powers
   of sensation; and if not, Whether it be the suspension, or
   discontinuance of the exercise of these present reflecting powers. Now,
   if there be no reason to believe the last, there will be, if that were
   possible, less for the next, and less still for the first.

   [74] This, according to Strabo, was the opinion of the Brachmans,

   ton de thanoton, genesin eis ton antos bion, kai ton eudaimona tois

   perhaps Antoninus may allude in these words, hos nun perimeneis, pote

  CHAP. II.

  OF THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD BY REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS; AND PARTICULARLY OF THE
  LATTER.

   THAT which makes the question concerning a future fife to be of so
   great importance to us, is our capacity of happiness and misery. And
   that which makes the consideration of it to be of so great importance
   to us, is the supposition of our happiness and misery hereafter
   depending upon our actions here. Without this indeed, curiosity could
   not but sometimes bring a subject, in which we may be so highly
   interested, to our thoughts; especially upon the mortality of others,
   or the near prospect of our own. But reasonable men would not take any
   further thought about hereafter, than what should happen thus
   occasionally to rise in their minds, if it were certain that our future
   interest no way depended upon our present behaviour; whereas, on the
   contrary, if there be ground, either from analogy or any thing else, to
   think it does; then there is reason also for the most active thought
   and solicitude, to secure that interest; to behave so as that we may
   escape that misery, land obtain that happiness, in another life, which
   we not only suppose ourselves capable of, but which we apprehend also
   is put in our own power. And whether there be ground for this last
   apprehension, certainly would deserve to be most seriously considered,
   were there no other proof of a future life and interest, than that
   presumptive one, which the foregoing observations amount to.

   Now in the present state, all which we enjoy, and a great part of what
   we suffer, is put in our own power. For pleasure and pain are the
   consequences of our actions; and we are endued by the Author of our
   nature with capacities of foreseeing these consequences. We find by
   experience he does not so much as preserve our lives, exclusively of
   our own care and attention, to provide ourselves with, and to make use
   of, that sustenance, by which he has appointed our lives shall be
   preserved; and without which, he has appointed, they shall not be
   preserved at all. And in general we foresee, that the external things,
   which are the objects of our various passions, can neither be obtained
   nor enjoyed, without exerting ourselves in such and such manners: but
   by thus exerting ourselves, we obtain and enjoy these objects, in which
   our natural good consists; or by this means God gives us the possession
   and enjoyment of them. I know not, that we have any one kind or degree
   of enjoyment, hut by the means of our own actions. And by prudence and
   care, we may, for the most part, pass our days in tolerable ease and
   quiet: or, on the contrary, we may, by rashness, ungoverned passion,
   wilfulness, or even by negligence, make ourselves as miserable as ever
   we please. And many do please to make themselves extremely miserable,
   i. e. to do what they know beforehand will render them so. They follow
   those ways, the fruit of which they know, by instruction, example,
   experience, will be disgrace, and poverty, and sickness, and untimely
   death. This every one observes to be the general course of things;
   though it is to be allowed, we cannot find by experience, that all our
   sufferings are owing to our own follies.

   Why the Author of Nature does riot give his creatures promiscuously
   such and such perceptions, without regard to their behaviour; why he
   does not make them happy without the instrumentality of their own
   actions, and prevent their bringing any sufferings upon themselves; is
   another matter. Perhaps there may be some impossibilities in the nature
   of things, which we are unacquainted with. [76] Or less happiness, it
   may be, would upon the whole be produced by such a method of conduct,
   than is by the present. Or perhaps divine goodness, with which, if I
   mistake not, we make very free in our speculations, may not be a bare
   single disposition to produce happiness; but a disposition to make the
   good, the faithful, the honest man happy. Perhaps an infinitely perfect
   Mind may be pleased with seeing his creatures behave suitably to the
   nature which he has given them; to the relations which he has placed
   them in to each other; and to that which they stand in to himself: that
   relation to himself, which, during their existence, is even necessary,
   and which is the most important one of all: perhaps, I say, an
   infinitely perfect Mind may be pleased with this moral piety of moral
   agents, in and for itself; as well as upon account of its being
   essentially conducive to the happiness of his creation. Or the whole
   end, for which God made, and thus governs the world, may be utterly
   beyond the reach of our faculties: there may be somewhat in it as
   impossible for us to have any conception of, as for a blind man to have
   a conception of colours. But however this be, it is certain matter of
   universal experience, that the general method of divine administration
   is, forewarning us, or giving us capacities to foresee, with more or
   less clearness, that if we act so and so, we shall have such
   enjoyments; if so and so, such sufferings; and giving us those
   enjoyments, and making us feel those sufferings, in consequence of our
   actions.

   "But all this is to be ascribed to the general course of nature." True.
   This is the very thing which I am observing. It is to be ascribed to
   the general course of nature: i. e. not surely to the words or ideas,
   course of nature; but to him who appointed it, and put things into it:
   or to a course of operation, from its uniformity or constancy, called
   natural; [77] and which necessarily implies an operating agent. For
   when men find themselves necessitated to confess an Author of Nature,
   or that God is the natural governor of the world; they must not deny
   this again, because his government is uniform; they must not deny that
   he does things at all, because he does them constantly; because the
   effects of his acting are permanent, whether his acting be so or not;
   though there is no reason to think it is not. In short, every man, in
   every thing he does, naturally acts upon the forethought and
   apprehension of avoiding evil or obtaining good: and if the natural
   course of things be the appointment of God, and our natural faculties
   of knowledge and experience are given us by him; then the good and bad
   consequences which follow our actions, are his appointment, and our
   foresight of those consequences, is a warning given us by him, how we
   are to act.

   "Is the pleasure then, naturally accompanying every particular
   gratification of passion, intended to put us upon gratifying ourselves
   in every such particular instance, and as a reward to us for so doing?"
   No certainly. Nor is it to be said, that our eyes were naturally
   intended to give us the sight of each particular object, to which they
   do or can extend; objects which are destructive of them, or which, for
   any other reason, it may become us to turn our eyes from. Yet there is
   no doubt, but that our eyes were intended for us to see with. So
   neither is there any doubt. but that the foreseen pleasures and pains
   belonging to the passions, were intended, in general, to induce mankind
   to act in such and such manners.

   Now from this general observation, obvious to every one, that God has
   given us to understand, he has appointed satisfaction and delight to be
   the consequence of our acting in one manner, and pain and uneasiness of
   our acting in another, and of our not acting at all; and that we find
   the consequences, which we were beforehand informed of, uniformly to
   follow; we may learn, that we are at present actually under his
   government in the strictest and most proper sense; in such a sense, as
   that he rewards and punishes us for our actions An Author of nature
   being supposed., it is not so much a deduction of reason, as a matter
   of experience, that we are thus under his government; under his
   government: in the same sense, as we are under the government of civil
   magistrates. Because the annexing pleasure to some actions, and pain to
   others, in our power to do or forbear, and giving notice of this
   appointment beforehand to those whom it concerns; is the proper formal
   notion of government. Whether the pleasure or pain which thus follows
   upon our behaviour, be owing to the Author of Nature's acting upon us
   every moment which we feel it; or to his having at once contrived and
   executed his own part in the plan of the world; makes no alteration as
   to the matter before us. For if civil magistrates could make the
   sanctions of their laws take place, without interposing at all, after
   they had passed them; without a trial, and the formalities of an
   execution: if they were able to make their laws execute themselves, or
   every offender to execute them upon himself; we should be just in the
   same sense under their government then, as we are now; but in a much
   higher degree, and more perfect manner. Vain is the ridicule, with
   which one foresees some persons will divert themselves, upon finding
   lesser pains considered as instances of divine punishment. There is no
   possibility of answering or evading the general thing here intended,
   without denying all final causes. For final causes being admitted, the
   pleasures and pains now mentioned must be admitted too as instances of
   them. And if they are; if God annexes delight to some actions, and
   uneasiness to others, with an apparent design to induce us to act so
   and so: then he not only dispenses happiness and misery, but also
   rewards and punishes actions. If, for example, the pain which we feel,
   upon doing what tends to the destruction of our bodies, suppose upon
   too near approaches to fire, or upon wounding ourselves, be appointed
   by the Author of Nature to prevent our doing what thus tends to our
   destruction; this is altogether as much an instance oi his punishing
   our actions, and consequently of our being under his government, as
   declaring by a voice from heaven, that if we acted so, he would inflict
   such pain upon us, and inflicting it, whether it be greater or less.

   Thus we find, that the true notion or conception of the Author of
   Nature, is that of a master or governor, prior to the consideration of
   his moral attributes. The fact of our case, which we find by
   experience, is, that he actually exercises dominion or government over
   us at present, by rewarding and punishing us for our actions, in as
   strict and proper a sense of these words, and even in the same sense,
   as children, servants, subjects, are rewarded and punished by those who
   govern them.

   And thus the whole analogy of Nature, the whole present course of
   things, most fully shows, that there is nothing incredible in the
   general doctrine of religion, that God will reward and punish men for
   their actions hereafter: nothing incredible, I mean, arising out of the
   notion of rewarding and punishing. For the whole course of nature is a
   present instance of his exercising that government over us, which
   implies in it rewarding and punishing.

   But as divine punishment is what men chiefly object against, and are
   most unwilling to allow; it may be proper to mention some circumstances
   in the natural course of punishments at present, which are analogous to
   what religion teaches us concerning a future state of punishment;
   indeed so analogous, that as they add a further credibility to it, so
   they cannot but raise a most serious apprehension of it in those who
   will attend to them.

   It has been now observed, that such and such miseries naturally follow
   such and such actions of imprudence and wilfulness, as well as actions
   more commonly and more distinctly considered as vicious; and that these
   consequences, when they may be foreseen, are properly natural
   punishments annexed to such actions. For the general thing here
   insisted upon, is, not that we see a great deal of misery in the world,
   but a great deal which men bring upon themselves by their own
   behaviour, which they might have foreseen and avoided. Now the
   circumstances of these natural punishments, particularly deserving our
   attention, are such as these; That oftentimes they follow, or are
   inflicted in consequence of, actions which procure many present
   advantages, and are accompanied with much present pleasure; for
   instance, sickness and untimely death are the consequence of
   intemperance, though accompanied with the highest mirth and jollity:
   that these punishments are often much greater, than the advantages or
   pleasures obtained by the actions, of which they are the punishments or
   consequences: that though we may imagine a constitution of nature, in
   which these natural punishments, which are in fact to follow, would
   follow, immediately upon such actions being done, or very soon after;
   we find on the contrary in our world, that they are often delayed a
   great while, sometimes even till long after the actions occasioning
   them are forgot; so that the constitution of nature is such, that delay
   of punishment is no sort nor degree of presumption of final impunity:
   that after such delay, these natural punishments or miseries often
   come, not by degrees, but suddenly, with violence, and at once;
   however, the chief misery often does: that as certainty of such distant
   misery following such actions, is never afforded persons; so perhaps
   during the actions, they have seldom a distinct, full expectation of
   its following: [78] and many times the case is only thus, that they see
   in general, or may see, the credibility, that intemperance, suppose,
   will bring after it diseases; civil crimes, civil punishments; when yet
   the real probability often is, that they shall escape; but things
   notwithstanding take their destined course, and the misery inevitably
   follows at its appointed time, in very many of these cases. Thus also
   though youth may be alleged as an excuse for rashness and folly, as
   being naturally thoughtless, and not clearly foreseeing all the
   consequences of being untractable and profligate; this does not hinder,
   but that these consequences follow; and are grievously felt, throughout
   the whole course of mature life. Habits contracted even in that age,
   are often utter ruin: and men's success in the world, not only in the
   common sense of worldly success, but their real happiness and misery,
   depends, in a great degree, and in various ways, upon the manner in
   which they pass their youth which consequences they for the most part
   neglect to consider, and perhaps seldom can properly be said to
   believe, beforehand. It requires also to be mentioned, that, in
   numberless cases, the natural course of things affords us opportunities
   for procuring advantages to ourselves at certain times, which we cannot
   procure when we will; nor ever recall the opportunities, if we have
   neglected them. Indeed the general course of nature is an example of
   this. If, during the opportunity of youth, persons are indocile and
   self-willed; they inevitably suffer in their future life, for want of
   those acquirements, which they neglected the natural season of
   attaining. If the husbandman lets his seedtime pass without sowing, the
   whole year is lost to him beyond recovery. In like manner, though after
   men have been guilty of folly and extravagance up to a certain degree,
   it is often in their power, for instance, to retrieve their affairs, to
   recover their health and character; at least in good measure, yet real
   reformation is in many cases, of no avail at all to, wards preventing
   the miseries, poverty, sickness, infamy, naturally annexed to folly and
   extravagance exceeding that degree. There is a certain bound to
   imprudence and misbehaviour, which being transgressed, there remains no
   place for repentance in the natural course of things. It is further
   very much to be remarked, that neglects from inconsiderateness, want of
   attention, [79] not looking about us to see what we have to do, are
   often attended with consequences altogether as dreadful, as any active
   misbehaviour, from the most extravagant passion. And lastly, civil
   government being natural, the punishments of it are so too: and some of
   these punishments are capital; as the effects of a dissolute course of
   pleasure are often mortal. So that many natural punishments are final
   [80] to him who incurs them, if considered only in his temporal
   capacity: and seem inflicted by natural appointment, either to remove
   the offender out of the way of being further mischievous; or as an
   example, though frequently a disregarded one, to those who are left
   behind.

   These things are not what we call accidental, or to be met with only
   now and then; but they are things of every day's experience: they
   proceed from general laws., very general ones, by which God governs the
   world, in the natural course of his providence. And they are so
   analogous, to what Religion teaches us concerning the future punishment
   of the wicked, so much of a piece with it, that both would naturally be
   expressed in the very same words, and manner of description. In the
   book of Proverbs, [81] for instance, Wisdom is introduced, as
   frequenting the most public places of resort, and as rejected when she
   offers herself as the natural appointed guide of human life. How long,
   speaking to those who are passing through it, how long, ye simple ones,
   will ye love folly, and the scorners delight in their scorning, and
   fools hate knowledge? Turn ye at my reproof. Behold, I will pour out my
   spirit upon you, I will make known my words unto you. But upon being
   neglected, Because I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out
   my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set at nought all my counsel,
   and would none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity, I
   will mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as desolation,
   and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish
   cometh upon you. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer;
   they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me. This passage,
   every one sees, is poetical, and some parts of it are highly
   figurative; but their meaning is obvious. And the thing intended is
   expressed more literally in the following words; For that they hated
   knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord--therefore shall
   they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own
   devices. For the security of the simple shall slay them, and the
   prosperity of fools shall destroy them. And the whole passage is so
   equally applicable to what we experience in the present world,
   concerning the consequences of men's actions, and to what Religion
   teaches us is to be expected in another, that it may be questioned
   which of the two was principally intended.

   Indeed when one has been recollecting the proper proofs of a future
   state of rewards and punishments, nothing methinks can give one so
   sensible an apprehension of the latter, or representation of it to the
   mind; as observing, that after the many disregarded checks,
   admonitions, and warnings, which people meet with in the ways of vice
   and folly and extravagance: warnings from their very nature; from the
   examples of others; from the lesser inconveniences which they bring
   upon themselves; from the instructions of wise and virtuous men: after
   these have been long despised, scorned, ridiculed: after the chief bad
   consequences, temporal consequences, of their follies, have been
   delayed for a great while; at length they break in irresistibly, like
   an armed force: repentance is too late to relieve, and can serve only
   to aggravate their distress, the case is become desperate: and poverty
   and sickness, remorse and anguish, infamy and death, the effects of
   their own doings, overwhelm them beyond possibility of remedy or
   escape. This is an account of what is in fact the general constitution
   of nature.

   It is not in any sort meant, that, according to what appears at present
   of the natural course of things, men are always uniformly punished in
   proportion to their misbehaviour: but that there are very many
   instances of misbehaviour punished in the several ways now mentioned,
   and very dreadful instances too; sufficient to show what the laws of
   the universe may admit; and, if thoroughly considered, sufficient fully
   to answer all objections against the credibility of a future state of
   punishments, from any imaginations, that the frailty of our nature and
   external temptations, almost annihilate the guilt of human vices: as
   well as objections of another sort; from necessity; from suppositions,
   that the will of an infinite Being cannot be contradicted; or that he
   must be incapable of offence and provocation. [82]

   Reflections of this kind are not without their terrors to serious
   persons, the most free from enthusiasm, and of the greatest strength of
   mind; but it is fit things be stated and considered as they really are.
   And there is, in the present age, a certain fearlessness, with regard
   to what may be hereafter under the government of God, which nothing but
   an universally acknowledged demonstration on the side of atheism can
   justify; and which makes it quite necessary, that men be reminded, and
   if possible made to feel, that there is no sort of ground for being
   thus presumptuous, even upon the most sceptical principles. For, may it
   not be said of any person upon his being born into the world, he may
   behave so, as to be of no service to it, but by being made an example
   of the woeful effects of vice and folly? That he may, as any one may,
   if he will, incur an infamous execution, from the hands of civil
   justice; or in some other course of extravagance shorten his days; or
   bring upon himself infamy and diseases worse than death? So that it had
   been better for him, even with regard to the present world, that he had
   never been born. And is there any pretence of reason, for people to
   think themselves secure, and talk as if they had certain proof, that,
   let them act as licentiously as they will, there can be nothing
   analogous to this, with regard to a future and more general interest,
   under the providence and government of the same God?

   [80] The general consideration of a future state of punishment, most
   evidently belongs to the subject of natural Religion. But if any of
   these reflections should be thought to relate more peculiarly to this
   doctrine, as taught in Scripture; the reader is desired to observe,
   that Gentile writers, both moralists, and poets, speak of the future
   punishment of the wicked, both as to the duration and degree of it, in
   a like manner of expression and of description, as the Scripture does.
   So that all which can positively be asserted to be matter of mere
   Revelation, with regard to this doctrine, seems to be, that the great
   distinction between the righteous and the wicked, shall be made at the
   end of this world; that each shall then receive according to his
   deserts. Reason did, as it well might, conclude that it should, finally
   and upon the whole, be well with the righteous, and ill with the
   wicked: but it could not be determined upon any principles of reason,
   whether human creatures might not have been appointed to pass through
   other states of life and being, before that distributive justice should
   finally and effectually take place. Revelation teaches us, that the
   next state of things after the present is appointed for the execution
   of this justice; that it shall be no longer delayed; but the mystery of
   God, the great mystery of his suffering vice and confusion to prevail,
   shall then be finished; and he will take to him his great power and
   will reign, by rendering to every one according to his works.

  CHAP. III.

  OF THE MORAL GOVERNMENT OF GOD.

   As the manifold appearances of design and of final causes, in the
   constitution of the world, prove it to be the work of an intelligent
   Mind; so the particular final causes of pleasure and pain distributed
   amongst his creatures, prove that they are under his government; what
   may be called his natural government of creatures endued with sense and
   reason. This, however, implies somewhat more than seems usually
   attended to, when we speak of God's natural government of the world. It
   implies government of the very same kind with that which a master
   exercises over his servants, or a civil magistrate over his subjects.
   These latter instances of final causes, as really prove an intelligent
   Governor of the world, in the sense now mentioned, and before [83]
   distinctly treated of; as any other instances of final causes prove an
   intelligent Maker of it.

   But this alone does not appear at first sight to determine any thing
   certainly, concerning the moral character of the Author of Nature,
   considered in this relation of governor; does not ascertain his
   government to be moral, or prove that he is the righteous judge of the
   world. Moral government consists, not barely in rewarding and punishing
   men for their actions, which the most tyrannical person may do: but in
   rewarding the righteous, and punishing the wicked: in rendering to men
   according to their actions, considered as good or evil. And the
   perfection of moral government consists in doing this, with regard to
   all intelligent creatures, in an exact proportion to their personal
   merits or demerits.

   Some men seem to think the only character of the Author of Nature to be
   that of simple absolute benevolence. This, considered as a principle of
   action and infinite in degree, is a disposition to produce the greatest
   possible happiness, without regard to persons' behavior, otherwise than
   as such regard would produce higher degrees of it. And supposing this
   to be the only character of God, veracity and justice in him would be
   nothing but benevolence conducted by wisdom. Now surely this I ought
   not to be asserted, unless it can be proved; for we should speak with
   cautious reverence upon such a subject And whether it can be proved or
   no, is not the thing here to be inquired into; but whether in the
   constitution and conduct of the world, a righteous government be not
   discernibly planned out: which necessarily implies a righteous
   governor. There may possibly be in the creation beings, to whom the
   Author of Nature manifests himself under this most amiable of all
   characters, this of infinite absolute benevolence; for it is the most
   amiable, supposing it not, as perhaps it is not, incompatible with
   justice; but he manifests himself to us under the character of a
   righteous governor. He may, consistently with this, be simply and
   absolutely benevolent, in the sense now explained: but he is (for he
   has given us a proof in the constitution and conduct of the world that
   he is) a governor over servants, as he rewards and punishes us for our
   actions. And in the constitution and conduct of it, he may also have
   given, besides the reason of the thing, and the natural presages of
   conscience, clear and distinct intimations, that his government is
   righteous or moral: clear to such as think the nature of it deserving
   their attention; and yet not to every careless person, who casts a
   transient reflection upon the subject. [84]

   But it is particularly to be observed, that the divine government,
   which we experience ourselves under in the present state, taken alone,
   is allowed not to be the perfection of moral government. And yet this
   by no means hinders, but that there may be somewhat, be it more or
   less, truly moral in it. A righteous government may plainly appear to
   be carried on to some degree: enough to give us the apprehension that
   it shall be completed, or carried on to that degree of perfection which
   religion teaches us it shall; but which cannot appear, till much more
   of the divine administration be seen, than can in the present life. And
   the design of this Chapter is to inquire how far this is the case: how
   far, over and above the moral nature [85] which God has given us, and
   our natural notion of him as righteous governor of those his creatures,
   to whom he has given this nature; [86] I say how far besides this, the
   principles and beginnings of a moral government over the world may be
   discerned, notwithstanding and amidst all the confusion and disorder of
   it.

   Now one might mention here, what has been often urged with great force,
   that, in general, less uneasiness and more satisfaction, are the
   natural consequences [87] of a virtuous than of a vicious course of
   life, in the present state, as an instance of a moral government
   established in nature; an instance of it collected from experience and
   present matter of fact. But it must be owned a thing of difficulty to
   weigh and balance pleasures and uneasinesses, each amongst themselves,
   and also against each other, so as to make an estimate with any
   exactness, of the overplus of happiness on the side of virtue. And it
   is not impossible, that, amidst the infinite disorders of the world,
   there may be exceptions to the happiness of virtue; even with regard to
   those persons, whose course of life from their youth up has been
   blameless: and more with regard to those who have gone on for some time
   in the ways of vice, and have afterwards reformed. For suppose an
   instance of the latter case; a person with his passions inflamed, his
   natural faculty of self-government impaired by habits of indulgence,
   and with all his vices about him, like so many harpies, craving for
   their accustomed gratification: who can say how long it might be,
   before such a person would find more satisfaction in the reasonableness
   and present good consequences of virtue, than difficulties and
   self-denial in the restraints of it? Experience also shows, that men
   can to a great degree, get over their sense of shame, so as that by
   professing themselves to be without principle, and avowing even direct
   villany, they can support themselves against the infamy of it. But as
   the ill actions of any one will probably be more talked of, and oftener
   thrown in his way, upon his reformation; so the infamy of them will be
   much more felt, after the natural sense of virtue and of honour is
   recovered. Uneasinesses of this kind ought indeed to be put to the
   account of former vices: yet it will be said they are in part the
   consequences of reformation. Still I am far from allowing it doubtful,
   whether virtue, upon the whole, be happier than vice in the present
   world. But if it were, yet the beginnings of a righteous administration
   may, beyond all question, be found in nature, if we will attentively
   inquire after them. And,

   I. In whatever manner the notion of God's moral government over the
   world might be treated, if it did not appear, whether he were in a
   proper sense our governor at all; yet when it is certain matter of
   experience, that he does manifest himself to us under the character of
   a governor in the sense explained; [88] it must deserve to be
   considered, whether there be not reason to apprehend, that he may be a
   righteous or moral governor. Since it appears to be fact, that God does
   govern mankind by the method of rewards and punishments, according to
   some settled rules of distribution; it is surely a question to be
   asked, what presumption is there against his finally rewarding and
   punishing them according to this particular rule, namely, as they act
   reasonably, or unreasonably, virtuously or viciously? since rendering
   men happy or miserable by this rule, certainly falls in, much more
   falls in, with our natural apprehensions and sense of things, than
   doing so by any other rule whatever; since rewarding and punishing
   actions by any other rule, would appear much harder to be accounted
   for, by minds formed as he has formed ours. Be the evidence of religion
   then more or less clear, the expectation which it raises in us, that
   the righteous shall, upon the whole, be happy, and the wicked
   miserable, cannot however possibly be considered as absurd or
   chimerical; because it is no more than an expectation, that a method of
   government already begun, shall be carried on, the method of rewarding
   and punishing actions; and shall be carried on by a particular rule,
   which unavoidably appears to us at first sight more natural than any
   other, the rule which we call distributive justice. Nor,

   II. Ought it to be entirely passed over, that tranquillity,
   satisfaction, and external advantages, being the natural Consequences
   of prudent management of ourselves, and our affairs; and rashness,
   profligate negligence, and wilful folly, bringing after them many
   inconveniences and sufferings; these afford instances of a right
   constitution of nature: as the correction of children, for their own
   sakes, and by way of example, when they run into danger or hurt
   themselves, is a part of right education? And thus, that God governs
   the world by general fixed laws, that he has endued us with capacities
   of reflecting upon this constitution of things, and foreseeing the good
   and bad consequences of our behaviour; plainly implies some sort of
   moral government; since from such a constitution of things it cannot
   but follow, that prudence and imprudence, which are of the nature of
   virtue and vice, [89] must be, as they are, respectively rewarded and
   punished.

   III. From the natural course of things, vicious actions are, to a great
   degree, actually punished as mischievous to society; and besides
   punishment actually inflicted upon this account, there is also the fear
   and apprehension of it in those persons, whose crimes have rendered
   them obnoxious to it, in case of a discovery; this state of fear being
   itself often a very considerable punishment. The natural fear and
   apprehension of it too, which restrains from such crimes, is a
   declaration of nature against them. It is necessary to the very being
   of society, that vices, destructive of it. should be punished as being
   so; the vices of falsehoods injustice, cruelty: which punishment
   therefore is as natural as society; and so is an instance of a kind of
   moral government, naturally established, and actually taking place.
   And, since the certain natural course of things is the conduct of
   Providence or the government of God, though carried on by the
   instrumentality of men; the observation here made amounts to this, that
   mankind find themselves placed by him in such circumstances, as that
   they are unavoidably accountable for their behaviour, and are often
   punished, and sometimes rewarded under his government, in the view of
   their being mischievous, or eminently beneficial to society.

   If it be objected that good actions and such as are beneficial to
   society, are often punished, as in the case of persecution and in other
   cases; and that ill and mischievous actions are often rewarded: it may
   be answered distinctly; first, that this is in no sort necessary, and
   consequently not natural, in the sense in which it is necessary, and
   therefore natural, that ill or mischievous actions should be punished:
   and in the next place, that good actions are never punished, considered
   as beneficial to society, nor ill actions rewarded, under the view of
   their being hurtful to it. So that it stands good, without any thing on
   the side of vice to be set over against it, that the Author of Nature
   has as truly directed, that vicious actions, considered as mischievous
   to society, should be punished, and put mankind under a necessity of
   thus punishing them; as he has directed and necessitated us to preserve
   our lives by food.

   IV. In the natural course of things, virtue as such is actually
   rewarded, and vice as such punished: which seems to afford an instance
   or example, not only of government, but of moral government begun and
   established; moral in the strictest sense; though not in that
   perfection of degree, which religion teaches us to expect. In order to
   see this more clearly, we must distinguish between actions themselves,
   and that quality ascribed to them, which we call virtuous or vicious.
   The gratification itself of every natural passion, must be attended
   with delight: and acquisitions of fortune, however made, are
   acquisitions of the means or materials of enjoyment. An action then, by
   which any natural passion is gratified or fortune acquired, procures
   delight or advantage; abstracted from all consideration of the morality
   of such action. Consequently, the pleasure or advantage in this case,
   is gained by the action itself, not by the morality, the virtuousness
   or viciousness of it; though it be, perhaps, virtuous or vicious. Thus,
   to say such an action or course of behaviour, procured such pleasure or
   advantage, or brought on such inconvenience and pain, is quite a
   different thing from saying, that such good or bad effect was owing to
   the virtue or vice of such action or behaviour. In one case, an action
   abstracted from all moral consideration, produced its effect: in the
   other case, for it will appear that there are such cases, the morality
   of the action under a moral consideration, i. e. the virtuousness or
   viciousness of it, produced the effect. Now I say virtue as such,
   naturally procures considerable advantages to the virtuous, and vice as
   such, naturally occasions great inconvenience and even misery to the
   vicious, in very many instances. The immediate effects of virtue and
   vice upon the mind and temper, are to be mentioned as instances of it.
   Vice as such is naturally attended with some sort of uneasiness, and,
   not uncommonly, with great disturbance and apprehension. That inward
   feeling, which, respecting lesser matters, and in familiar speech, we
   call being vexed with oneself, and in matters of importance and in more
   serious language, remorse; is an uneasiness naturally arising from an
   action of a man's own, reflected upon by himself as wrong,
   unreasonable, faulty, i. e. vicious in greater or less degrees: and
   this manifestly is a different feeling from that uneasiness, which
   arises from a sense of mere loss or harm. What is more common, than to
   hear a man lamenting an accident or event, and adding--but however he
   has the satisfaction that he cannot blame himself for it; or on the
   contrary, that he has the uneasiness of being sensible it was his own
   doing? Thus also the disturbance and fear, which often follow upon a
   man's having done an injury, arise from a sense of his being
   blame-worthy; otherwise there would, in many cases, be no ground of
   disturbance, nor any reason to fear resentment or shame. On the other
   hand, inward security and peace, and a mind open to the several
   gratifications ol life, are the natural attendants of innocence and
   virtue. To which must be added the complacency, satisfaction, and even
   joy of heart, which accompany the exercise. the real exercise of
   gratitude, friendship, benevolence.

   And here, I think, ought to be mentioned, the fears of future
   punishment, and peaceful hopes of a better life, in those who fully
   believe, or have any serious apprehension of religion: because these
   hopes and fears are present uneasiness and satisfaction to the mind;
   and cannot be got rid of by great part of the world, even by men who
   have thought most thoroughly upon that subject of religion. And no one
   can say, how considerable this uneasiness and satisfaction may be, or
   what upon the whole it may amount to.

   In the next place comes in the consideration, that all honest and good
   men are disposed to befriend honest good men as such, and to
   discountenance the vicious as such, and do so in some degree; indeed in
   a considerable degree: from which favour and discouragement cannot but
   arise considerable advantage and inconvenience. And though the
   generality of the world have little regard to the morality of their own
   actions, and may be supposed to have less to that of others, when they
   themselves are not concerned; yet let any one be known to be a man of
   virtue, some how or other he will be favoured and good offices will be
   done him, from regard to his character, without remote views,
   occasionally, and in some low degree, I think, by the generality of the
   world, as it happens to come in their way. Public honours too and
   advantages are the natural consequences, are sometimes at least the
   consequences in fact, of virtuous actions; of eminent justice,
   fidelity, charity, love to our country, considered in the view of being
   virtuous. And sometimes even death itself, often infamy and external
   inconveniences, are the public consequences of vice as vice. For
   instance, the sense which mankind have of tyranny, injustice,
   oppression, additional to the mere feeling or fear of misery, has
   doubtless been instrumental in bringing about revolutions, which make a
   figure even in the history of the world. For it is plain, men resent
   injuries as implying faultiness, and retaliate, not merely under the
   notion of having received harm, but of having received wrong; and they
   have this resentment in behalf of others, as well as of themselves. So
   likewise even the generality are, in some degree, grateful and disposed
   to return good offices, not merely because such a one has been the
   occasion of good to them, but under the view, that such good offices
   implied kind intention and good desert in the doer. To all this may be
   added two or three particular things, which many persons will think
   frivolous; but to me nothing appears so, which at all comes in towards
   determining a question of such importance, as, whether there be, or be
   not, a moral institution of government, in the strictest sense moral,
   visibly established and begun in nature. The particular things are
   these: That in domestic government, which is doubtless natural,
   children and others also are very generally punished for falsehood and
   injustice and ill-behaviour, as such, and rewarded for the contrary:
   which are instances where veracity and justice and right behaviour, as
   such, are naturally enforced by rewards and punishments, whether more
   or less considerable in degree: that, though civil government be
   supposed to take cognizance of actions in no other view than as
   prejudicial to society, without respect to the immorality of them; yet
   as such actions are immoral, so the sense which men have of the
   immorality of them, very greatly contributes, in different ways, to
   bring offenders to justice: and that entire absence of all crime and
   guilt in the moral sense, when plainly appearing, will almost of course
   procure, and circumstances of aggravated guilt prevent, a remission of
   the penalties annexed to civil crimes, in many cases, though by no
   means in all.

   Upon the whole then, besides the good and bad effects of virtue and
   vice upon men's own minds, the course of the world does, in some
   measure, turn upon the approbation and disapprobation of them as such
   in others. The sense of well and ill doing, the presages of conscience,
   the love of good characters and dislike of bad ones, honour, shame,
   resentment, gratitude; all these, considered in themselves, and in
   their effects, do afford manifest real instances of virtue as such
   naturally favoured, and of vice as such discountenanced, more or less,
   in the daily course of human life; in every age, in every relation, in
   every general circumstance of it. That God has given us a moral nature,
   [90] may most justly be urged as a proof of our being under his moral
   government: but that he has placed us in a condition, which gives this
   nature, as one may speak, scope to operate, and in which it does
   unavoidably operate; i. e. influence mankind to act, so as thus to
   favour and reward virtue, and discountenance and punish vice; this is
   not the same, but a further, additional proof of his moral government:
   for it is an instance of it. The first is a proof, that he will finally
   favour and support virtue effectually: the second is an example of his
   favouring and supporting it at present, in some degree.

   If a more distinct inquiry be made, whence it arises, that virtue as
   such is often rewarded, and vice as such is punished, and this rule
   never inverted: it will be found to proceed, in part, immediately from
   the moral nature itself, which God has given us; and also in part, from
   his having given us, together with this nature, so great a power over
   each other's happiness and misery. For, first, it is certain, that
   peace and delight, in some degree and upon some occasions, is the
   necessary and present effect of virtuous practice; an effect arising
   immediately from that constitution of our nature. We are so made, that
   well-doing as such gives us satisfaction, at least, in some instances;
   ill-doing as such, in none. And, secondly, from our moral nature,
   joined with God's having put our happiness and misery in many respects
   in each other's power, it cannot but be, that vice as such, some kinds
   and instances of it at least, will be infamous, and men will be
   disposed to punish it as in itself detestable; and the villain will by
   no means be able always to avoid feeling that infamy, any more than he
   will be able to escape this further punishment, which mankind will be
   disposed to inflict upon him, under the notion of his deserving it. But
   there can be nothing on the side of vice, to answer this; because there
   is nothing in the human mind contradictory, as the logicians speak, to
   virtue. For virtue consists in a regard to what is right and
   reasonable, as being so; in a regard to veracity, justice, charity, in
   themselves: and there is surely no such thing, as a like natural regard
   to falsehood, injustice, cruelty. If it be thought, that there are
   instances of an approbation of vice, as such, in itself, and for its
   own sake (though it does not appear to me, that there is any such thing
   at all; but supposing there be), it is evidently monstrous: as much so,
   as the most acknowledged perversion of any passion whatever. Such
   instances of perversion then being left out, as merely imaginary, or,
   however, unnatural; it must follow, from the frame of our nature, and
   from our condition, in the respects now described, that vice cannot at
   all be, and virtue cannot but be, favoured as such by others, upon some
   occasions, and happy in itself, in some degree. For what is here
   insisted upon, is not the degree in which virtue and vice are thus
   distinguished, but only the thing itself, that they are so in some
   degree; though the whole good and bad effect of virtue and vice as
   such, is not inconsiderable in degree. But that they must be thus
   distinguished in some degree, is in a manner necessary: it is matter of
   fact of daily experience, even in the greatest confusion of human
   affairs.

   It is not pretended but that, in the natural course of things,
   happiness and misery appear to be distributed by other rules, than only
   the personal merit and demerit of characters. They may sometimes be
   distributed by way of mere discipline. There may be the wisest and best
   reasons, why the world should be governed by general laws, from whence
   such promiscuous distribution perhaps must follow; and also why our
   happiness and misery should be put in each other's power, in the degree
   which they are. And these things, as in general they contribute to the
   rewarding virtue and punishing vice, as such: so they often contribute
   also, not to the inversion of this, which is impossible; but to the
   rendering persons prosperous, though wicked; afflicted, though
   righteous; and, which is worse, to the rewarding some actions, though
   vicious, and punishing other actions, though virtuous. But all this
   cannot drown the voice of Nature in the conduct of Providence, plainly
   declaring itself for virtue, by way of distinction from vice, and
   preference to it. For our being so constituted as that virtue and vice
   are thus naturally favoured and discountenanced, rewarded and punished,
   respectively as such, is an intuitive proof of the intent of Nature,
   that it should be so; otherwise the constitution of our mind, from
   which it thus immediately and directly proceeds, would be absurd. But
   it cannot be said, because virtuous actions are sometimes punished, and
   vicious actions rewarded, that Nature intended it. For, though this
   great disorder is brought about, as all actions are done, by means of
   some natural passion; yet this may be, as it undoubtedly is, brought
   about by the perversion of such passion, implanted in us for other, and
   those very good purposes. And indeed these other and good purposes,
   even of every passion, may be clearly seen.

   We have then a declaration, in some degree of present effect, from Him
   who is supreme in Nature, which side he is of, or what part he takes; a
   declaration for virtue, and against vice. So far therefore as a man is
   true to virtue, to veracity and justice, to equity and charity, and the
   right of the case, in whatever he is concerned; so far he is on the
   side of the divine administration, and co-operates with it: and from
   hence, to such a man, arises naturally a secret satisfaction and sense
   of security, and implicit hope of somewhat further. And,

   V. This hope is confirmed by the necessary tendencies of virtue, which,
   though not of present effect, yet are at present discernible in nature;
   and so afford an instance of somewhat moral in the essential
   constitution of it. There is, in the nature of things, a tendency in
   virtue and vice to produce the good and bad effects now mentioned, in a
   greater degree than they do in fact produce them. For instance; good
   and bad men would be much more rewarded and punished as such, were it
   not, that justice is often artificially eluded, that characters are not
   known, and many, who would thus favour virtue and discourage vice, are
   hindered from doing so by accidental causes. These tendencies of virtue
   and vice are obvious with regard to individuals. But it may require
   more particularly to be considered, that power in a society, by being
   under the direction of virtue, naturally increases, and has a necessary
   tendency to prevail over opposite power, not under the direction of it;
   in like manner, as power, by being under the direction of reason,
   increases, and has a tendency to prevail over brute force. There are
   several brute creatures of equal, and several of superior strength, to
   that of men; and possibly the sum of the whole strength of brutes may
   be greater than that of mankind; but reason gives us the advantage and
   superiority over them; and thus man is the acknowledged governing
   animal upon the earth. Nor is this superiority considered by any as
   accidental; but as what reason has a tendency, in the nature of the
   thing, to obtain. And yet perhaps difficulties may be raised about the
   meaning, as well as the truth, of the assertion, that virtue has the
   like tendency.

   To obviate these difficulties, let us see more distinctly, how the case
   stands with regard to reason; which is so readily acknowledged to have
   this advantageous tendency. Suppose then two or three men, of the best
   and most improved understanding, in a desolate open plain, attacked by
   ten times the number of beasts of prey: would their reason secure them
   the victory in this unequal combat? Power then, though joined with
   reason, and under its direction, cannot be expected to prevail over
   opposite power, though merely brutal, unless the one bears some
   proportion to the other. Again: put the imaginary case, that rational
   and irrational creatures were of like external shape and manner: it is
   certain, before there were opportunities for the first to distinguish
   each other, to separate from their adversaries, and to form a union
   among themselves, they might be upon a level, or in several respects
   upon great disadvantage; though united they might be vastly superior;
   since union is of such efficacy, that ten men united, might be able to
   accomplish, what ten thousand of the same natural strength and
   understanding wholly ununited, could not. In this case then, brute
   force might more than maintain its ground against reason, for want of
   union among the rational creatures. Or suppose a number of men to land
   upon an island inhabited only by wild beasts; a number of men who, by
   the regulations of civil government, the inventions of art, and the
   experience of some years, could they be preserved so long, would be
   really sufficient to subdue the wild beasts, and to preserve themselves
   in security from them: yet a conjuncture of accidents might give such
   advantage to the irrational animals as that they might at once
   overpower, and even extirpate, the whole species of rational ones.
   Length of time then, proper scope and opportunities, for reason to
   exert itself, may be absolutely necessary to its prevailing over brute
   force. Further still: there are many instances of brutes succeeding in
   attempts, which they could not have undertaken, had not their
   irrational nature rendered them incapable of foreseeing the danger of
   such attempt, or the fury of passion hindered their attending to it:
   and there are instances of reason and real prudence preventing men's
   undertaking what, it hath appeared afterwards, they might have
   succeeded in by a lucky rashness. And in certain conjunctures,
   ignorance and folly, weakness and discord, may have their advantages.
   So that rational animals have not necessarily the superiority over
   irrational ones; but, how improbable soever it may be, it is evidently
   possible, that in some globes the latter may be superior. And were the
   former wholly at variance and disunited, by false self-interest and
   envy, by treachery and injustice, and consequent rage and malice
   against each other, whilst the latter were firmly united among
   themselves by instinct; this might greatly contribute to the
   introducing such an inverted order of things. For every one would
   consider it as inverted: since reason has, in the nature of it, a
   tendency to prevail over brute force; notwithstanding the possibility
   it may not prevail, and the necessity, which there is, of many
   concurring circumstances to render it prevalent.

   Now I say, virtue in a society has a like tendency to procure
   superiority and additional power: whether this power be considered as
   the means of security from opposite power, or of obtaining other
   advantages. And it has this tendency, by rendering public good, an
   object and end, to every member of the society; by putting every one
   upon consideration and diligence, recollection and self-government,
   both in order to see what is the most effectual method, and also in
   order to perform their proper part, for obtaining and preserving it; by
   uniting a society within itself, and so increasing its strength; and,
   which is particularly to be mentioned, uniting it by means of veracity
   and justice. For as these last are principal bonds of union, so
   benevolence or public spirit, undirected, unrestrained by them, is,
   nobody knows what.

   And suppose the invisible world, and the invisible dispensations of
   Providence, to be, in any sort, analogous to what appears: or that both
   together make up one uniform scheme, the two parts of which, the part
   which we see, and that which is beyond our observation, are analogous
   to each other: then, there must be a like natural tendency in the
   derived power, throughout the universe, under the direction of virtue,
   to prevail in general over that which is not under its direction; as
   there is in reason, derived reason in the universe, to prevail over
   brute force. But then, in order to the prevalence of virtue, or that it
   may actually produce, what it has a tendency to produce; the like
   concurrences are necessary, as are, to the prevalence of reason. There
   must be some proportion, between the natural power or force which is,
   and that which is not, under the direction of virtue: there must be
   sufficient length of time; for the complete success of virtue, as of
   reason, cannot, from the nature of the thing, be otherwise than
   gradual: there must be, as one may speak, a fair field of trial, a
   stage large and extensive enough, proper occasions and opportunities,
   for the virtuous to join together, to exert themselves against lawless
   force, and to reap the fruit of their united labours. Now indeed it is
   to be hoped, that the disproportion between the good and bad, even here
   on earth, is not so great, but that the former have natural power
   sufficient to their prevailing to a considerable degree, if
   circumstances would permit this power to be united. For, much less,
   very much less, power under the direction of virtue, would prevail over
   much greater not under the direction of it. However, good men over the
   face of the earth cannot unite; as for other reasons, so because they
   cannot be sufficiently ascertained of each other's characters. And the
   known course of human things, the scene we are now passing through,
   particularly the shortness of life, denies to virtue its full scope in
   several other respects. The natural tendency which we have been
   considering, though real, is hindered from being carried into effect in
   the present state: but these hinderances may be removed in a future
   one. Virtue, to borrow the Christian allusion, is militant here; and
   various untoward accidents contribute to its being often overborne: but
   it may combat with greater advantage hereafter, and prevail completely,
   and enjoy its consequent rewards, in some future states. Neglected as
   it is, perhaps unknown, perhaps despised and oppressed here; there may
   be scenes in eternity, lasting enough, and in every other way adapted,
   to afford it a sufficient sphere of action; and a sufficient sphere for
   the natural consequences of it to follow in fact. If the soul be
   naturally immortal, and this state be a progress towards a future one,
   as childhood is towards mature age; good men may naturally unite, not
   only amongst themselves, but also with other orders of virtuous
   creatures, in that future state. For virtue, from the very nature of
   it, is a principle and bond of union, in some degree, amongst all who
   are endued with it, and known to each other; so as that by it, a good
   man cannot but recommend himself to the favour and protection of all
   virtuous beings, throughout the whole universe, who can be acquainted
   with his character, and can any way interpose in his behalf in any part
   of his duration. And one might add, that suppose all this advantageous
   tendency of virtue to become effect, amongst one or more orders of
   creatures, in any distant scenes and periods, and to be seen by any
   orders of vicious creatures, throughout the universal kingdom of God;
   this happy effect of virtue would have a tendency, by way of example,
   and possibly in other ways, to amend those of them who are capable of
   amendment, and being recovered to a just sense of virtue. If our
   notions of the plan of Providence were enlarged in any sort
   proportionable to what late discoveries have enlarged our views with
   respect to the material world; representations of this kind would not
   appear absurd or extravagant. However, they are not to be taken as
   intended for a literal delineation of what is in fact the particular
   scheme of the universe, which cannot be known without revelation: for
   suppositions are not to be looked on as true, because not incredible:
   but they are mentioned to show, that our finding virtue to be hindered
   from procuring to itself such superiority and advantages, is no
   objection against its having, in the essential nature of the thing, a
   tendency to procure them. And the suppositions now mentioned do plainly
   show this: for they show, that these hinderances are so far from being
   necessary, that we ourselves can easily conceive, how they may be
   removed in future states, and full scope be granted to virtue. And all
   these advantageous tendencies of it are to be considered as
   declarations of God in its favour. This however is taking a pretty
   large compass: though it is certain, that, as the material world
   appears to be, in a manner, boundless and immense; there must be some
   scheme of Providence vast in proportion to it.

   But let us return to the earth our habitation; and we shall see this
   happy tendency of virtue, by imagining an instance not so vast and
   remote: by supposing a kingdom or society of men upon it, perfectly
   virtuous, for a succession of many ages; to which, if you please, may
   be given a situation advantageous for universal monarchy. In such a
   state, there would be no such thing as faction: but men of the greatest
   capacity would of course, all along, have the chief direction of
   affairs willingly yielded to them; and they would share it among
   themselves without envy. Each of these would have the part assigned
   him, to which his genius was peculiarly adapted: and others, who had
   not any distinguished genius, would be safe, and think themselves very
   happy, by being under the protection and guidance of those who had.
   Public determinations would really be the result of the united wisdom
   of the community: and they would faithfully be executed, by the united
   strength of it. Some would in a higher way contribute, but all would in
   some way contribute, to the public prosperity: and in it, each would
   enjoy the fruits of his own virtue. And as injustice, whether by fraud
   or force, would be unknown among themselves; so they would be
   sufficiently secured from it in their neighbours. For cunning and false
   self-interest, confederacies in injustice, ever slight, and accompanied
   with faction and intestine treachery; these on one hand would be found
   mere childish folly and weakness, when set in opposition against
   wisdom, public spirit, union inviolable, and fidelity on the other:
   allowing both a sufficient length of years to try their force. Add the
   general influence, which such a kingdom would have over the face of the
   earth, by way of example particularly, and the reverence which would be
   paid it. It would plainly be superior to all others, and the world must
   gradually come under its empire; not by means of lawless violence; but
   partly by what must be allowed to be just conquest; and partly by other
   kingdoms submitting themselves voluntarily to it, throughout a course
   of ages, and claiming its protection, one after another, in successive
   exigencies. The head of it would be an universal monarch, in another
   sense than any mortal has yet been; and the eastern style would be
   literally applicable to him, that all people, nations, and languages
   should serve him. And though indeed our knowledge of human nature, and
   the whole history of mankind, show the impossibility, without some
   miraculous interposition, that a number of men, here on earth, should
   unite in one society or government, in the fear of God and universal
   practice of virtue; and that such a government should continue so
   united for a succession of ages: yet admitting or supposing this, the
   effect would be as now drawn out. And thus for instance, the wonderful
   power and prosperity promised to the Jewish nation in the Scripture,
   would be, in a great measure, the consequence of what is predicted of
   them; that the people should be all righteous, and inherit the land for
   ever; [91] were we to understand the latter phrase of a long
   continuance only, sufficient to give things time to work. The
   predictions of this kind, for there are many of them, cannot come to
   pass, in the present known course of nature; but suppose them come to
   pass, and then, the dominion and pre-eminence promised must naturally
   follow, to a very considerable degree.

   Consider now the general system of religion; that the government of the
   world is uniform, and one, and moral; that virtue and right shall
   finally have the advantage, and prevail over fraud and lawless force,
   over the deceits as well as the violence of wickedness, under the
   conduct of one supreme governor: and from the observations above made,
   it will appear. that God has, by our reason, given us to see a peculiar
   connexion in the several parts of this scheme, and a tendency towards
   the completion of it, arising out of the very nature of virtue: which
   tendency is to be considered as somewhat moral in the essential
   constitution of things. If any one should think all this to be of
   little importance; I desire him to consider, what he would think, if
   vice had, essentially and in its nature, these advantageous tendencies;
   or if virtue had essentially the direct contrary ones.

   But it may be objected, that notwithstanding all these natural effects
   and these natural tendencies of virtue; yet things may be now going on
   throughout the universe, and may go on hereafter, in the same mixed way
   as here at present upon earth: virtue sometimes prosperous, sometimes
   depressed; vice sometimes punished, sometimes successful. The answer to
   which is, that it is not the purpose of this chapter, nor of this
   treatise, properly to prove God's perfect moral government over the
   world, or the truth of Religion; but to observe what there is in the
   constitution and course of nature, to confirm the proper proof of it,
   supposed to be known: and that the weight of the foregoing observations
   to this purpose may be thus distinctly proved. Pleasure and pain are
   indeed to a certain degree, say to a very high degree, distributed
   amongst us without any apparent regard to the merit or demerit of
   characters. And were there nothing else concerning this matter
   discernible in the constitution and course of nature; there would be no
   ground from the constitution and course of nature to hope or to fear,
   that men would be rewarded or punished hereafter according to their
   deserts: which, however, it is to be remarked, implies, that even then
   there would be no ground from appearances to think, that vice upon the
   whole would have the advantage, rather than that virtue would. And thus
   the proof of a future state of retribution would rest upon the usual
   known arguments for it: which are I think plainly unanswerable; and
   would be so, though there were no additional confirmation of them from
   the things above insisted on. But these things are a very strong
   confirmation of them. For,

   First, They show that the Author of Nature is not indifferent to virtue
   and vice. They amount to a declaration, from him, determinate and not
   to be evaded, in favour of one, and against the other; such a
   declaration, as there is nothing to be set over against or answer, on
   the part of vice. So that were a man, laying aside the proper proof of
   Religion, to determine from the course of nature only, whether it were
   most probable, that the righteous or the wicked would have the
   advantage in a future life; there can be no doubt, but that he would
   determine the probability to be, that the former would. The course of
   nature then, in the view of it now given furnishes us with a real
   practical proof of the obligations of Religion.

   Secondly, When, conformably to what Religion teaches us, God shall
   reward and punish virtue and vice as such, so as that every one shall,
   upon the whole, have his deserts; this distributive justice will not be
   a thing different in kind, but only in degree, from what we experience
   in his present government. It will be that in effect, toward which we
   now see a tendency. It will be no more than the completion of that
   moral government, the principles and beginning of which have been
   shown, beyond all dispute, discernible in the present constitution and
   course of nature. And from hence it follows,

   Thirdly, That, as under the natural government of God, our experience
   of those kinds and degrees of happiness and misery, which we do
   experience at present, gives just ground to hope for, and to fear,
   higher degrees and other kinds of both in a future state, supposing a
   future state admitted: so under his moral government our experience,
   that virtue and vice are, in the manners above mentioned, actually
   rewarded and punished at present, in a certain degree, gives just
   ground to hope and to fear, that they may be rewarded and punished in a
   higher degree hereafter. It is acknowledged indeed that this alone is
   not sufficient ground to think, that they actually will be rewarded and
   punished in a higher degree, rather than in a lower: but then,

   Lastly, There is sufficient ground to think so, from the good and bad
   tendencies of virtue and vice. For these tendencies are essential, and
   founded in the nature of things: whereas the hinderances to their
   becoming effect, are, in numberless cases, not necessary, but
   artificial only. Now it may be much more strongly argued, that these
   tendencies, as well as the actual rewards and punishments, of virtue
   and vice, which arise directly out of the nature of things, will remain
   hereafter, than that the accidental hinderances of them will. And if
   these hinderances do not remain; those rewards and punishments cannot
   but be carried on much farther towards the perfection of moral
   government: i. e. the tendencies of virtue and vice will become effect;
   but when, or where, or in what particular way, cannot be known at all,
   but by revelation.

   Upon the whole: there is a kind of moral government implied in God's
   natural government: [92] virtue and vice are naturally rewarded and
   punished as beneficial and mischievous to society; [93] and rewarded
   and punished directly as virtue and vice. [94] The notion then of a
   moral scheme of government is not fictitious, but natural; for it is
   suggested to our thoughts by the constitution and course of nature: and
   the execution of this scheme is actually begun, in the instances here
   mentioned. And these things are to be considered as a declaration of
   the Author of Nature, for virtue, and against vice: they give a
   credibility to the supposition of their being rewarded and punished
   hereafter; and also ground to hope and to fear, that they may be
   rewarded and punished in higher degrees than they are here. And as all
   this is confirmed, so the argument for Religion, from the constitution
   and course of nature, is carried on farther, by observing, that there
   are natural tendencies, and, in innumerable cases, only artificial
   hinderances, to this moral scheme's being carried on much farther
   towards perfection, than it is at present. [95] The notion then of a
   moral scheme of government, much more perfect than what is seen, is not
   a fictitious, but a natural notion; for it is suggested to our
   thoughts, by the essential tendencies of virtue and vice. And these
   tendencies are to be considered as intimations, as implicit promises
   and threatenings, from the Author of Nature, of much greater rewards
   and punishments to follow virtue and vice, than do at present. And
   indeed, every natural tendency, which is to continue, but which is
   hindered from becoming effect by only accidental causes, affords a
   presumption, that such tendency will, some time or other, become
   effect: a presumption in degree proportionable to the length of the
   duration, through which such tendency will continue. And from these
   things together, arises a real presumption, that the moral scheme of
   government established in nature, shall be carried on much farther
   towards perfection hereafter; and, I think, a presumption that it will
   be absolutely completed. But from these things, joined with the moral
   nature which God has given us, considered as given us by him, arises a
   practical proof [96] that it will be completed: a proof from fact; and
   therefore a distinct one from that which is deduced froml the eternal
   and unalterable relations, the fitness and unfitness of actions.

  CHAP. IV.

  OF A STATE OF PROBATION, AS IMPLYING TRIAL, DIFFICULTIES, AND DANGER.

   THE general doctrine of Religion, that our present life is a state of
   probation for a future one, comprehends under it several particular
   things, distinct from each other. But the first and most common meaning
   of it seems to be, that our future interest is now depending, and
   depending upon ourselves; that we have scope and opportunities here,
   for that good and bad behaviour, which God will reward and punish
   hereafter; together with temptations to one, as well as inducements of
   reason to the other. And this is, in a great measure, the same with
   saying, that we are under the moral government of God, and to give an
   account of our actions to him. For the notion of a future account and
   general righteous judgment, implies some sort of temptations to what is
   wrong: otherwise there would be no moral possibility of doing wrong,
   nor ground for judgment, or discrimination. But there is this
   difference, that the word probation is more distinctly and particularly
   expressive of allurements to wrong, or difficulties in adhering
   uniformly to what is right, and of the danger of miscarrying by such
   temptations, than the words moral government. A state of probation
   then, as thus particularly implying in it trial, difficulties, and
   danger, may require to be considered distinctly by itself.

   And as the moral government of God, which Religion teaches us, implies,
   that we are in a state of trial with regard to a future world: so also
   his natural government over us implies, that we are in a state of
   trial, in the like sense, with regard to the present world. Natural
   government by rewards and punishments, as much implies natural trial,
   as moral government does moral trial. The natural government of God
   here meant [97] consists in his annexing pleasure to some actions, and
   pain to others, which are in our power to do or forbear, and in giving
   us notice of such appointment beforehand. This necessarily implies,
   that he has made our happiness and misery, or our interest, to depend
   in part upon ourselves. And so far as men have temptations to any
   course of action, which will probably occasion them greater temporal
   inconvenience and uneasiness, than satisfaction; so far their temporal
   interest is in danger from themselves, or they are in a state of trial
   with respect to it. Now people often blame others, and even themselves,
   for their misconduct in their temporal concerns. And we find many are
   greatly wanting to themselves, and miss of that natural happiness,
   which they might have obtained in the present life: perhaps every one
   does in some degree. But many run themselves into great inconvenience,
   and into extreme distress and misery: not through incapacity of knowing
   better, and doing better, for themselves, which would be nothing to the
   present purpose; but through their own fault. And these things
   necessarily imply temptation, and danger of miscarrying, in a greater
   or less degree with respect to our worldly interest or happiness. Every
   one too, without having Religion in his thoughts, speaks of the hazards
   which young people run, upon their setting out in the world: hazards
   from other causes, than merely their ignorance, and unavoidable
   accidents. And some courses of vice, at least, being contrary to men's
   worldly interest or good; temptations to these must at the same time be
   temptations to forego our present and our future interest. Thus in our
   natural or temporal capacity, we are in a state of trial, i. e. of
   difficulty and danger, analogous, or like to our moral and religious
   trial.

   This will more distinctly appear to any one, who thinks it worth while,
   more distinctly, to consider, what it is which constitutes our trial in
   both capacities, and to observe, how mankind behave under it.

   And that which constitutes this our trial, in both these capacities,
   must be somewhat either in our external circumstances, or in our
   nature. For, on the one hand, persons may be betrayed into wrong
   behaviour upon surprise, or overcome upon any other very singular and
   extraordinary external occasions; who would, otherwise, have preserved
   their character of prudence and of virtue: in which cases, every one,
   in speaking of the wrong behaviour of these persons, would impute it to
   such particular external circumstances. And on the other hand, men who
   have contracted habits of vice and folly of any kind, or have some
   particular passions in excess, will seek opportunities, and, as it
   were, go out of their way, to gratify themselves in these respects, at
   the expense of their wisdom and their virtue; led to it, as every one
   would say, not by external temptations, but by such habits and
   passions. And the account of this last case is, that particular
   passions are no more coincident with prudence, or that reasonable
   self-love, the end of which is our worldly interest, than they are with
   the principle of virtue and religion; but often draw contrary ways to
   one, as well as to the other: and so such particular passions are as
   much temptations, to act imprudently with regard to our worldly
   interest, as to act viciously. [98] However, as when we say, men are
   misled by external circumstances of temptation; it cannot but be
   understood, that there is somewhat within themselves, to render those
   circumstances temptations, or to render them susceptible of impressions
   from them; so when we say, they are misled by passions; it is always
   supposed, that there are occasions, circumstances, and objects,
   exciting these passions, and affording means for gratifying them. And
   therefore, temptations from within, and from without, coincide, and
   mutually imply each other. Now the several external objects of the
   appetites, passions, and affections, being present to the senses, or
   offering themselves to the mind, and so exciting emotions suitable to
   their nature; not only in cases where they can be gratified
   consistently with innocence and prudence, but also in cases where they
   cannot, and yet can be gratified imprudently and viciously: this as
   really puts them in danger of voluntarily foregoing their present
   interest or good, as their future; and as really renders self-denial
   necessary to secure one, as the other: i. e. we are in a like state of
   trial with respect to both, by the very same passions, excited by the
   very same means. Thus mankind having a temporal interest depending upon
   themselves, and a prudent course of behaviour being necessary to secure
   it; passions inordinately excited, whether by means of example, or by
   any other external circumstance, towards such objects, at such times,
   or in such degrees, as that they cannot be gratified consistently with
   worldly prudence; are temptations, dangerous, and too often successful
   temptations, to forego a greater temporal good for a less; i. e. to
   forego what is, upon the whole, our temporal interest, for the sake of
   a present gratification. This is a description of our state of trial in
   our temporal capacity. Substitute now the word future for temporal, and
   virtue for prudence; and it will be just as proper a description of our
   state of trial in our religious capacity; so analogous are they to each
   other.

   If, from consideration of this our like state of trial in both
   capacities, we go on to observe farther, how mankind behave under it;
   we shall find there are some, who have so little sense of it, that they
   scarce look beyond the passing day: they are so taken up with present
   gratifications, as to have, in a manner, no feeling of consequences, no
   regard to their future case or fortune in this life; any more than to
   their happiness in another, Some appear to be blinded and deceived by
   inordinate passion, in their worldly concerns, as much as in Religion.
   Others are, not deceived, but, as it were, forcibly carried away by the
   like passions, against their better judgment, and feeble resolutions
   too of acting better. And there are men, and truly they are not a few,
   who shamelessly avow, not their interest, but their mere will and
   pleasure, to be their law of life: and who, in open defiance of every
   thing that is reasonable, will go on in a course of vicious
   extravagance, foreseeing, with no remorse and little fear, that it will
   be their temporal ruin; and some of them, under the apprehension of the
   consequences of wickedness in another state. And to speak in the most
   moderate way, human creatures are not only continually liable to go
   wrong voluntarily, but we see likewise that they often actually do so,
   with respect to their temporal interests, as well as with respect to
   Religion.

   Thus our difficulties and dangers, or our trials, in our temporal and
   our religious capacity, as they proceed from the same causes, and have
   the same effect upon men's behaviour, are evidently analogous, and of
   the same kind.

   It may be added, that as the difficulties and dangers of miscarrying in
   our religious state of trial, are greatly increased, and one is ready
   to think, in a manner wholly made, by the ill behaviour of others; by a
   wrong education, wrong in a moral sense, sometimes positively vicious;
   by general bad example; by the dishonest artifices which are got into
   business of all kinds; and, in very many parts of the world, by
   religion's being corrupted into superstitions, which indulge men in
   their vices: so in like manner, the difficulties, of conducting
   ourselves prudently in respect to our present interest, and our danger
   of being led aside from pursuing it, are greatly increased, by a
   foolish education; and, after we come to mature age, by the
   extravagance and carelessness of others, whom we have intercourse with:
   and by mistaken notions, very generally prevalent, and taken up from
   common opinion, concerning temporal happiness, and wherein it consists.
   And persons, by their own negligence and folly in their temp( ral
   affairs, no less than b) a course of vice, bring themselves into new
   difficulties; and, by habits of indulgence, become less qualified to go
   through them: and one irregularity after another, embarrasses things to
   such a degree, that they know not whereabout they are; and often makes
   the path of conduct so intricate and perplexed, that it is difficult to
   trace it out; difficult even to determine what is the prudent or the
   moral part. Thus, for instance, wrong behaviour in one stage of life,
   youth; wrong, I mean, considering ourselves only in our temporal
   capacity, without taking in religion; this, in several ways, increases
   the difficulties of right behaviour in mature age; i. e. puts us into a
   more disadvantageous state of trial in our temporal capacity.

   We are an inferior part of the creation of God. There are natural
   appearances of our being in a state of degradation. [99] And we
   certainly are in a condition, which does not seem, by any means, the
   most advantageous we could imagine or desire, either in our natural or
   moral capacity, for securing either our present or future interest.
   However, this condition, low and careful and uncertain as it is, does
   not afford any just ground of complaint. For, as men may manage their
   temporal affairs with prudence, and so pass their days here on earth in
   tolerable ease and satisfaction, by a moderate degree of care: so
   likewise with regard to religion, there is no more required than what
   they are well able to do, and what they must be greatly wanting to
   themselves, if they neglect. And for persons to have that put upon
   them, which they are well able to go through, and no more, we naturally
   consider as an equitable thing; supposing it done by proper authority.
   Nor have we any more reason to complain of it, with regard to the
   Author of Nature, than of his not having given us other advantages,
   belonging to other orders of creatures.

   But the thing here insisted upon is, that the state or trial, which
   Religion teaches us we are in, is rendered credible, by its being
   throughout uniform and of a piece with the general conduct of
   Providence towards us, in all other respects within the compass of our
   knowledge. Indeed if mankind, considered in their natural capacity, as
   inhabitants of this world only, found themselves, from their birth to
   their death, in a settled state of security and happiness, without any
   solicitude or thought of their own: or if they were in no danger of
   being brought into inconveniences and distress, by carelessness, or the
   folly of passion, through bad example, the treachery of others, or the
   deceitful appearances of things: were this our natural condition, then
   it might seem strange, and be some presumption against the truth of
   Religion, that it represents our future and more general interest, as
   not secure of course, but as depending upon our behaviour, and
   requiring recollection and self-government to obtain it. For it might
   be alleged, "What you say is our condition, in one respect, is not in
   any wise of a sort with what we find, by. experience, our condition is
   in another. Our whole present interest is secured to our hands, without
   any solicitude of ours; and why should not our future interest, if we
   have any such, be so too?" But since, on the contrary, thought and
   consideration, the voluntary denying ourselves many things which we
   desire, and a course of behaviour, far from being always agreeable to
   us; are absolutely necessary to our acting even a common decent, and
   common prudent part, so as to pass with any satisfaction through the
   present world, and be received upon any tolerable good terms in it:
   since this is the case, all presumption against self-denial and
   attention being necessary to secure our higher interest, is removed.
   Had we not experience, it might, perhaps speciously, be urged, that it.
   is improbable any thing of hazard and danger should be put upon us by
   an infinite Being; when every thing which is hazard and danger in our
   manner of conception, and will end in error, confusion, and misery, is
   now already certain in his foreknowledge. And indeed, why any thing of
   hazard and danger should be put upon such frail creatures as we are,
   may well be thought a difficulty in speculation; and cannot but be so,
   till we know the whole, or, however, much more of the case. But still
   the constitution of nature is as it is. Our happiness and misery are
   trusted to our conduct, and made to depend upon it. Somewhat, and, in
   many circumstances, a great deal too, is put upon us, either to do, or
   to suffer, as we choose. And all the various miseries of life, which
   people bring upon themselves by negligence and folly, and might have
   avoided by proper care, are instances of this: which miseries are
   beforehand, just as contingent and undetermined as their conduct, and
   left to be determined by it.

   These observations are an answer to the objections against the
   credibility of a state of trial, as implying temptations, and real
   danger of miscarrying with regard to our general interest, under the
   moral government of God: and they show, that, if we are at all to be
   considered in such a capacity, and as having such an interest; the
   general analogy of Providence must lead us to apprehend ourselves in
   danger of miscarrying, in different degrees, as to this interest, by
   our neglecting to act the proper part belonging to us in that capacity.
   For we have a present interest under the government of God, which we
   experience here upon earth. And this interest, as it is not forced upon
   us, so neither is it offered to our acceptance, but to our acquisition;
   in such sort, as that we are in danger of missing it, by means of
   temptations to neglect, or act contrary to it; and without attention
   and self-denial, must and do miss of it. It is then perfectly credible,
   that this may be our case, with respect to that chief and final good,
   which Religion proposes to us.

  CHAP. V.

  OF A STATE OF PROBATION, AS INTENDED FOR MORAL DISCIPLINE AND IMPROVEMENT.

   FROM the consideration of our being in a probation-state, of so much
   difficulty and hazard, naturally arises the question, how we came to be
   placed in it? But such a general inquiry as this would be found
   involved in insuperable difficulties. For, though some of these
   difficulties would be lessened by observing, that all wickedness is
   voluntary, as is implied in its very notion; and that many of the
   miseries of life have apparent good, effects: yet, when we consider
   other circumstances belonging to both, and what must be the consequence
   of the former in a life to come; it cannot but be acknowledged plain
   folly and presumption, to pretend to give an account of the whole
   reasons of this matter: the whole reasons of our being allotted a
   condition, out of which so much wickedness and misery, so
   circumstanced, would in fact arise. Whether it be not beyond our
   faculties, not only to find out, but even to understand, the whole
   account of this; or, though we should be supposed capable of
   understanding it, yet, whether it would be of service or prejudice to
   us to be informed of it, is impossible to say. But as our present
   condition can in no wise be shown inconsistent with the perfect moral
   government of God: so Religion teaches us we were placed in it, that we
   might qualify ourselves, by the practice of virtue, for another state
   which is to follow it. And this, though but a partial answer, a very
   partial one indeed, to the inquiry now mentioned; yet, is a more
   satisfactory answer to another, which is of real, and of the utmost
   importance to us to have answered: the inquiry, What is our business
   here? The known end then, why we are placed in a state of so much
   affliction, hazard, and difficulty, is, our improvement in virtue and
   piety, as the requisite qualification for a future state of security
   and happiness.

   Now the beginning of life, considered as an education for mature age in
   the present world, appears plainly, at first sight, analogous to this
   our trial for a future one: the former being in our temporal capacity,
   what the latter is in our religious capacity. But some observations
   common to both of them, and a more distinct consideration of each, will
   more distinctly show the extent and, force of the analogy between them;
   and the credibility, which arises from hence, as well as from the
   nature of the thing, that the present life was intended to be a state
   of discipline for a future one.

   I. Every species of creatures is, we see, designed for a particular way
   of life; to which, the nature, the capacities, temper, and
   qualifications of each species, are as necessary, as their external
   circumstances. Both come into the notion of such state, or particular
   way of life, and are constituent parts of it. Change a man's capacities
   or character to the degree in which it is conceivable they may be
   changed; and he would be altogether incapable of a human course of
   life, and human happiness; as incapable, as if, his nature continuing
   unchanged, he were placed in a world, where he had no sphere of action,
   nor any objects to answer his appetites, passions, and affections of
   any sort. One thing is set over against another, as an ancient writer
   expresses it. Our nature corresponds to our external condition. Without
   this correspondence, there would be no possibility of any such thing as
   human life and human happiness: which life and happiness are,
   therefore, a result from our nature and condition jointly: meaning by
   human life, not living in the literal sense, but the whole complex
   notion commonly understood by those words. So that, without determining
   what will be the employment and happiness, the particular life, of good
   men hereafter; there must be some determinate capacities, some
   necessary character and qualifications, without which persons cannot
   but be utterly incapable of it: in like manner, as there must be some,
   without which men would be incapable of their present state of life.
   Now,

   II. The constitution of human creatures, and indeed of all creatures
   which come under our notice, is such, as that they are capable of
   naturally becoming qualified for states of life, for which they were
   once wholly unqualified. In imagination we may indeed conceive of
   creatures, as incapable of having any of their faculties naturally
   enlarged, or as being unable naturally to acquire any new
   qualifications: but the faculties of every species known to us are made
   for enlargement; for acquirements of experience and habits. We find
   ourselves in particular endued with capacities, not only of perceiving
   ideas, and of knowledge or perceiving truth, but also of storing up our
   ideas and knowledge by memory. We are capable, not only of acting, and
   of having different momentary impressions made upon us; but of getting
   a new facility in any kind of action, and of settled alterations in our
   temper or character. The power of the two last is the power of habits.
   But neither the perception of ideas, nor knowledge of any sort, are
   habits; though absolutely necessary to the forming of them. However,
   apprehension, reason, memory, which are the capacities of acquiring
   knowledge, are greatly improved by exercise. Whether the word habit is
   applicable to all these improvements, and in particular how far the
   powers of memory and of habits may be powers of the same nature, I
   shall not inquire. But that perceptions come into our minds readily and
   of course, by means of their having been there before, seems a thing of
   the same sort, as readiness in any particular kind of action,
   proceeding from being accustomed to it. And aptness to recollect
   practical observations of service in our conduct, is plainly habit in
   many cases. There are habits of perception, and habits of action. An
   instance of the former, is our constant and even involuntary readiness,
   in correcting the impressions of our sight concerning magnitudes and
   distances, so as to substitute judgment in the room of sensation
   imperceptibly to ourselves. And it seems as if all other associations
   of ideas not naturally connected might be called passive habits; as
   properly as our readiness in understanding languages upon sight, or
   hearing of words. And our readiness in speaking and writing them is an
   instance of the latter, of active habits. For distinctness, we may
   consider habits, as belonging to the body, or the mind: and the latter
   will be explained by the former. Under the former are comprehended all
   bodily activities or motions, whether graceful or unbecoming, which are
   owing to use: under the latter, general habits of life and conduct;
   such as those of obedience and submission to authority, or to any
   particular person; those of veracity, justice, and charity; those of
   attention, industry, self-government, envy, revenge. And habits of this
   latter kind seem produced by repeated acts, as well as the former. And
   in like manner as habits belonging to the body are produced by external
   acts: so habits of the mind are produced by the exertion of inward
   practical principles; i. e. by carrying them into act, or acting upon
   them; the principles of obedience, of veracity, justice, and charity.
   Nor can those habits be formed by any external course of action,
   otherwise than as it proceeds from these principles: because it is only
   these inward principles exerted, which are strictly acts of obedience,
   of veracity, of justice, and of charity. So likewise habits of
   attention, industry, self-government, are in the same manner acquired
   by exercise; and habits of envy and revenge by indulgence, whether in
   outward act, or in thought and intention; i. e. inward act: for such
   intention is an act. Resolutions also to do well are properly acts. And
   endeavouring to enforce upon our own minds a practical sense of virtue,
   or to beget in others that practical sense of it, which a man really
   has himself, is a virtuous act. All these, therefore, may and will
   contribute towards forming good habits. But going over the theory of
   virtue in one's thoughts, talking well, and drawing fine pictures, of
   it; this is so far from necessarily or certainly conducing to form a
   habit of it, in him who thus employs himself, that it may harden the
   mind in a contrary course, and render it gradually more insensible; i.
   e. form a habit of insensibility to all moral considerations. For, from
   our very faculty of habits, passive impressions, by being repeated,
   grow weaker. Thoughts, by often passing through the mind, are felt less
   sensibly: being accustomed to danger, begets intrepidity, i. e. lessens
   fear; to distress, lessens the passion of pity; to instances of others'
   mortality, lessens the sensible apprehension of our own. And from these
   two observations together; that practical habits are formed and
   strengthened by repeated acts, and that passive impressions grow weaker
   by being repeated upon us; it must follow, that active habits may be
   gradually forming and strengthening, by a course of acting upon such
   and such motives and excitements, whilst these motives and excitements
   themselves are, by proportionable degrees, growing less sensible; i. e.
   are continually less and less sensibly felt, even as the active habits
   strengthen. And experience confirms this: for active principles, at the
   very time that they are less lively in perception than they were, are
   found to be, somehow, wrought more thoroughly into the temper and
   character, and become more effectual in influencing our practice. The
   three things just mentioned may afford instances of it. Perception of
   danger is a natural excitement of passive fear, and active caution: and
   by being inured to danger, habits of the latter are gradually wrought,
   at the same time that the former gradually lessens. Perception of
   distress in others is a natural excitement, passively to pity, and
   actively to relieve it: but let a man set himself to attend to, inquire
   out, and relieve distressed persons, and he cannot but grow less and
   less sensibly affected with the various miseries of life, with which he
   must become acquainted; when yet at the same time, benevolence,
   considered not as a passion, but as a practical principle of action,
   will strengthen: and whilst he passively compassionates the distressed
   less, he will acquire a greater aptitude actively to assist and
   befriend them. So also at the same time that the daily instances of
   men's dying around us give us daily a less sensible passive feeling or
   apprehension of our own mortality, such instances greatly contribute to
   the strengthening a practical regard to it in serious men; i. e. to
   forming a habit of acting with a constant view to it. And this seems
   again further to show, that passive impressions made upon our minds by
   admonition, experience, example, though they may have a remote
   efficacy, and a very great one, towards forming active habits, yet can
   have this efficacy no otherwise than by inducing us to such a course of
   action: and that it is not being affected so and so, but acting, which
   forms those habits: only it must be always remembered, that real
   endeavours to enforce good impressions upon ourselves are a species of
   virtuous action. Nor do we know how far it is possible, in the nature
   of things, that effects should be wrought in us at once, equivalent to
   habits; i. e. what is wrought by use and exercise. However, the thing
   insisted upon is, not what may be possible, but what is in fact the
   appointment of nature: which is, that active habits are to be formed by
   exercise. Their progress may be so gradual, as to be imperceptible in
   its steps: it may be hard to explain the faculty, by which we are
   capable of habits, throughout its several parts; and to trace it up to
   its original, so as to distinguish it from all others in our mind: and
   it seems as if contrary effects were to be ascribed to it. But the
   thing in general, that our nature is formed to yield, in some such
   manner as this, to use and exercise, is matter of certain experience.

   Thus, by accustoming ourselves to any course of action, we get an
   aptness to go on, a facility, readiness, and often pleasure, in it. The
   inclinations which rendered us averse to it grow weaker: the
   difficulties in it, not only the imaginary but the real ones, lessen:
   the reasons for it offer themselves of course to our thoughts upon all
   occasions: and the least glimpse of them is sufficient to make us go
   on, in a course of action, to which we have been accustomed. And
   practical principles appear to grow stronger, absolutely in themselves,
   by exercise: as well as relatively, with regard to contrary principles,
   which, by being accustomed to submit, do so habitually, and of course.
   And thus a new character, in several respects, may be formed; and many
   habitudes of life not given by nature, but which nature directs us to
   acquire.

   III. Indeed we may be assured, that we should never have had these
   capacities of improving by experience, acquired knowledge, and habits,
   had they not been necessary, and intended to be made use of. And
   accordingly we find them so necessary, and so much intended. that
   without them we should be utterly incapable of that which was the end
   for which we were made, considered in our temporal capacity only: the
   employments and satisfactions of our mature state of life.

   Nature does in nowise qualify us wholly, much less at once, for this
   mature state of life. Even maturity of understanding, and bodily
   strength, are not only arrived to gradually, but are also very much
   owing to the continued exercise of our powers of body and mind from
   infancy. But if we suppose a person brought into the world with both
   these in maturity, as far as this is conceivable; he would plainly at
   first be as unqualified for the human life of mature age, as an idiot.
   He would be in a manner distracted, with astonishment, and
   apprehension, and curiosity, and suspense: nor can one guess, how long
   it would be, before he would be familiarized to himself and the objects
   about him enough, even to set himself to any thing. It may be
   questioned too, whether the natural information of his sight and
   hearing would be of any manner of use at all to him in acting, before
   experience. And it seems, that men would be strangely headstrong and
   self-willed, and disposed to exert themselves with an impetuosity,
   which would render society insupportable, and the living in it
   impracticable; were it not for some acquired moderation and
   self-government, some aptitude and readiness in restraining themselves,
   and concealing their sense of things. Want of every thing of this kind
   which is learnt would render a man as uncapable of society, as want of
   language would; or as his natural ignorance of any of the particular
   employments of life would render him uncapable of providing himself
   with the common conveniences, or supplying the necessary wants of it.
   In these respects, and probably in many more of which we have no
   particular notion, mankind is left, by nature, an unformed, unfinished
   creature; utterly deficient and unqualified, before the acquirement of
   knowledge, experience, and habits, for that mature state of life, which
   was the end of his creation, considering him as related only to this
   world.

   But then, as nature has endued us with a power of supplying those
   deficiencies, by acquired knowledge, experience, and habits: so
   likewise we are placed in a condition, in infancy, childhood. and
   youth, fitted for it; fitted for our acquiring those qualifications of
   all sorts, which we stand in need of in mature age. Hence children,
   from their very birth, are daily growing acquainted with the objects
   about them, with the scene in which they are placed, and to have a
   future part; and learning somewhat or other, necessary to the
   performance of it. The subordinations, to which they are accustomed in
   domestic life, teach them self-government in common behaviour abroad,
   and prepare them for subjection and obedience to civil authority. What
   passes before their eyes, and daily happens to them, gives them
   experience, caution against treachery and deceit, together with
   numberless little rules of action and conduct, which we could not live
   without; and which are learnt so insensibly and so perfectly, as to be
   mistaken perhaps for instinct: though they are the effect of long
   experience and exercise; as much so as language, or knowledge in
   particular business, or the qualifications and behaviour belonging to
   the several ranks and professions. Thus the beginning of our days is
   adapted to be, and is, a state of education in the theory and practice
   of mature life. We are much assisted in it by example, instruction, and
   the care of others; but a great deal is left to ourselves to do. And of
   this, as part is done easily and of course; so part requires diligence
   and care, the voluntary foregoing many things which we desire, and
   setting ourselves to what we should have no inclination to, but for the
   necessity or expedience of it. For that labour and industry, which the
   station of so many absolutely requires, they would be greatly
   unqualified for, in maturity, as those in other stations would be for
   any other sorts of application; if both were not accustomed to them in
   their youth. And, according as persons behave themselves, in the
   general education which all go through, and in the particular ones
   adapted to particular employments; their character is formed, and made
   appear; they recommend themselves more or less; and are capable of, and
   placed in, different stations in the society of mankind.

   The former part of life, then, is to be considered as an important
   opportunity, which nature puts into our hands; and which, when lost is
   not to be recovered. And our being placed in a state of discipline
   throughout this life, for another world, is a providential disposition
   of things, exactly of the same kind, as our being placed in a state of
   discipline during childhood, for mature age. Our condition in both
   respects is uniform and of a-piece, and comprehended under one and the
   same general law of nature.

   And if we were not able at all to discern, how or in what way the
   present life could be our preparation for another; this would be no
   objection against the credibility of its being so. For we do not
   discern, how food and sleep contribute to the growth of the body; nor
   could have any thought that they would, before we had experience. Nor
   do children at all think, on the one hand, that the sports and
   exercises, to which they are so much addicted, contribute to their
   health and growth; nor, on the other, of the necessity which there is
   for their being restrained in them: nor are they capable of
   understanding the use of many parts of discipline, which nevertheless
   they must be made to go through, in order to qualify them for the
   business of mature age. Were we not able then to discover, in what
   respects the present life could form us for a future one; yet nothing
   would be more supposable than that it might, in some respects or other,
   from the general analogy of Providence. And this, for ought I see,
   might reasonably be said even though we should not take in the
   consideration of God's moral government over the world. But,

   IV. Take in this consideration, and consequently, that the character of
   virtue and piety is a necessary qualification for the future state; and
   then we may distinctly see, how, and in what respects, the present life
   may be a preparation for it: since we want, and are capable of,
   improvement in that character, by moral and religious habits; and the
   present life is fit to be a state of discipline for such improvement:
   in like manner as we have already observed, how, and in what respects,
   infancy, childhood, and youth, are a necessary preparation, and a
   natural state of discipline, for mature age.

   Nothing which we at present see would lead us to the thought of a
   solitary unactive state hereafter: but, if we judge at all from the
   analogy of nature, we must suppose, according to the Scripture account
   of it, that it will be a community. And there is no shadow of any thing
   unreasonable in conceiving, though there be no analogy for it, that
   this community will be, as the Scripture represents it, under the more
   immediate, or, if such an expression may be used, the more sensible
   government of God. Nor is our ignorance, what will be the employments
   of this happy community, nor our consequent ignorance, what particular
   scope or occasion there will be for the exercise of veracity, justice,
   and charity, amongst the members of it with regard to each other; any
   proof, that there will be no sphere of exercise for those virtues. Much
   less, if that were possible, is our ignorance any proof, that there
   will be no occasion for that frame of mind, or character, which is
   formed by the daily practice of those particular virtues here, and
   which is a result from it. This at least must be owned in general,
   that, as the government established in the universe is moral, the
   character of virtue and piety must, in some way or other, be the
   condition of our happiness or the qualification for it.

   Now from what is above observed, concerning our natural power of
   habits, it is easy to see, that we are capable of moral improvement by
   discipline. And how greatly we want it, need not be proved to any one
   who is acquainted with the great wickedness of mankind; or even with
   those imperfections, which the best are conscious of. But it is not
   perhaps distinctly attended to by every one, that the occasion which
   human creatures have for discipline, to improve in them this character
   of virtue and piety, is to be traced up higher than to excess in the
   passions, by indulgence and habits of vice. Mankind, and perhaps all
   finite creatures, from the very constitution of their nature, before
   habits of virtue, are deficient, and in danger of deviating from what
   is right; and therefore stand in need of virtuous habits, for a
   security against this danger. For, together with the general principle
   of moral understanding, we have in our inward frame various affections
   towards particular external objects. These affections are naturally,
   and of right, subject to the government of the moral principle, as to
   the occasions upon which they may be gratified; as to the times,
   degrees, and manner, in which the objects of them may be pursued: but
   then the principle of virtue can neither excite them, nor prevent their
   being excited. On the contrary, they are naturally felt, when the
   objects of them are present to the mind, not only before all
   consideration whether they can be obtained by lawful means, but after
   it is found they cannot. For the natural objects of affection continue
   so; the necessaries, conveniences, and pleasures of life, remain
   naturally desirable; though they cannot be obtained innocently: nay,
   though they cannot possibly be obtained at all. And when the objects of
   any affection whatever cannot be obtained without unlawful means; but
   may be obtained by them: such affection, though its being excited, and
   its continuing some time in the mind, be as innocent as it is natural
   and necessary; yet cannot but be conceived to have a tendency to
   incline persons to venture upon such unlawful means: and therefore must
   be conceived as putting them in some danger of it. Now what is the
   general security against this danger, against their actually deviating
   from right? As the danger is, so also must the security be, from
   within: from the practical principle of virtue. [100] And the
   strengthening or improving this principle, considered as practical, or
   as a principle of action, will lessen the danger, or increase the
   security against it. And this moral principle is capable of
   improvement, by proper discipline and exercise: by recollecting the
   practical impressions which example and experience have made upon us:
   and, instead of following humour and mere inclination, by continually
   attending to the equity and right of the case, in whatever we are
   engaged, be it in greater or less matters; and accustoming ourselves
   always to act upon it; as being itself the just and natural motive of
   action; and as this moral course of behaviour must necessarily, under
   the divine government, be our final interest. Thus the principle of
   virtue, improved into a habit, of which improvement we are thus
   capable, will plainly be, in proportion to the strength of it, a
   security against the danger which finite creatures are in, from the
   very nature of propension, or particular affections. This way of
   putting the matter, supposes particular affections to remain in a
   future state; which it is scarce possible to avoid supposing. And if
   they do; we clearly see, that acquired habits of virtue and
   self-government may be necessary for the regulation of them. However,
   though we were not distinctly to take in this supposition, but to speak
   only in general; the thing really comes to the same. For habits of
   virtue, thus acquired by discipline, are improvement in virtue: and
   improvement in virtue must be advancement in happiness, if the
   government of the universe be moral

   From these things we may observe, and it will further show this our
   natural and original need of being improved by discipline, how it comes
   to pass, that creatures made upright fall; and that those who preserve
   their uprightness, by so doing, raise themselves to a more secure state
   of virtue. To say that the former is accounted for by the nature of
   liberty, is to say no more, than that an event's actually happening is
   accounted for by a mere possibility of its happening. But it seems
   distinctly conceivable from the very nature of particular affections or
   propensions. For, suppose creatures intended for such a particular
   state of life, for which such propensions were necessary: suppose them
   endued with such propensions, together with moral understanding, as
   well including a practical sense of virtue as a speculative perception
   of it; and that all these several principles, both natural and moral,
   forming an inward constitution of mind, were in the most exact
   proportion possible; i. e. in a proportion the most exactly adapted to
   their intended state of life; such creatures would be made upright, or
   finitely perfect. Now particular propensions, from their very nature,
   must be felt, the objects of them being present; though they cannot be
   gratified at all, or not with the allowance of the moral principle. But
   if they can be gratified without its allowance, or by contradicting it;
   then they must be conceived to have some tendency, in how low a degree
   soever, yet some tendency, to induce persons to such forbidden
   gratification. This tendency, in some one particular propension, may be
   increased, by the greater frequency of occasions naturally exciting it,
   than of occasions exciting others. The least voluntary indulgence in
   forbidden circumstances, though but m thought, will increase this wrong
   tendency; and may increase it further, till, peculiar conjunctures
   perhaps conspiring, it becomes effect; and danger of deviating from
   right, ends in actual deviation from it; a danger necessarily arising
   from the very nature of propension; and which therefore could not have
   been prevented, though it might have been escaped, or got innocently
   through. The case would be, as if we were to suppose a straight path
   marked out for a person, in which such a degree of attention would keep
   him steady: but if he would not attend in this degree, any one of a
   thousand objects, catching his eye, might lead him out of it. Now it is
   impossible to say, how much even the first full overt act of
   irregularity might disorder the inward constitution; unsettle the
   adjustments, and alter the proportions, which formed it, and in which
   the uprightness of its make consisted: but repetition of irregularities
   would produce habits. And thus the constitution would be spoiled; and
   creatures made upright, become corrupt and depraved in their settled
   character, proportionably to their repeated irregularities in
   occasional acts. But, on the contrary, these creatures might have
   improved and raised themselves, to a higher and more secure state of
   virtue, by the contrary behaviour: by steadily following the moral
   principle, supposed to be one part of their nature: and thus
   withstanding that unavoidable danger of defection, which necessarily
   arose from propension, the other part of it. For, by thus preserving
   their integrity for some time, their danger would lessen; since
   propensions, by being inured to submit, would do it more easily and of
   course: and their security against this lessening danger would
   increase; since the moral principle would gain additional strength by
   exercise: both which things are implied in the notion of virtuous
   habits. Thus then vicious indulgence is not only criminal in itself,
   but also depraves the inward constitution and character. And virtuous
   self-government is not only right in itself, but also improves the
   inward constitution or character: and may improve it to such a degree,
   that though we should suppose it impossible for particular affections
   to be absolutely coincident with the moral principle; and consequently
   should allow, that such creatures as have been above supposed, would
   for ever remain defectible; yet their danger of actually deviating from
   right may be almost infinitely lessened, and they fully fortified
   against what remains of it; if that may be called danger, against which
   there is an adequate, effectual security. But still, this their higher
   perfection may continue to consist in habits of virtue formed in a
   state of discipline, and this their more complete security remain to
   proceed from them. And thus it is plainly conceivable, that creatures
   without blemish, as they came out of the hands of God, may be in danger
   of going wrong; and so may stand in need of the security of virtuous
   habits, additional to the moral principle wrought into their natures by
   him. That which is the ground of their danger, or their want of
   security, may be considered as a deficiency in them, to which virtuous
   habits are the natural supply. And as they are naturally capable of
   being raised and improved by discipline, it may be a thing fit and
   requisite, that they should be placed in circumstances with an eye to
   it: in circumstances peculiarly fitted to be to them a state of
   discipline for their improvement in virtue.

   But how much more strongly must this hold with respect to those who
   have corrupted their natures, are fallen from their original rectitude,
   and whose passions are become excessive by repeated violations of their
   inward constitution? Upright creatures may want to be improved:
   depraved creatures want to be renewed. Education and discipline, which
   may be in all degrees and sorts of gentleness and of severity, are
   expedient for those: but must be absolutely necessary for these. For
   these, discipline of the severer sort too, and in the higher degrees of
   it, must be necessary, in order to wear out vicious habits; to recover
   their primitive strength of self-government, which indulgence must have
   weakened; to repair, as well as raise into a habit, the moral
   principle, in order to their arriving at a secure state of virtuous
   happiness.

   Now, whoever will consider the thing may clearly see, that the present
   world is peculiarly fit to be a state of discipline for this purpose,
   to such as will set themselves to mend and improve. For, the various
   temptations with which we are surrounded; our experience of the deceits
   of wickedness; having been in many instances led wrong ourselves; the
   great viciousness of the world; the infinite disorders consequent upon
   it; our being made acquainted with pain and sorrow, either from our own
   feeling of it, or from the sight of it in others; these things, though
   some of them may indeed produce wrong effects upon our minds, yet when
   duly reflected upon, have, all of them, a direct tendency to bring us
   to a settled moderation and reasonableness of temper: the contrary both
   to thoughtless levity, and also to that unrestrained self-will, and
   violent bent to follow present inclination, which may be observed in
   undisciplined minds. Such experience, as the present state affords, of
   the frailty of our nature; of the boundless extravagance of ungoverned
   passion; of the power which an infinite Being has over us, by the
   various capacities of misery which he has given us; in short, that kind
   and degree of experience, which the present state affords us, that the
   constitution of nature is such as to admit the possibility, the danger,
   and the actual event, of creatures losing their innocence and
   happiness, and becoming vicious and wretched; hath a tendency to give
   us a practical sense of things very different from a mere speculative
   knowledge, that we are liable to vice, and capable of misery. And who
   knows, whether the security of creatures in the highest and most
   settled state of perfection, may not in part arise, from their having
   had such a sense of things as this, formed, and habitually fixed within
   them, in some state of probation. And passing through the present world
   with that moral attention, which is necessary to the acting a right
   part in it, may leave everlasting impressions of this sort upon our
   minds. But to be a little more distinct: allurements to what is wrong;
   difficulties in the discharge of our duty; our not being able to act a
   uniform right part without some thought and care; and the opportunities
   which we have, or imagine we have, of avoiding what we dislike, or
   obtaining what we desire, by unlawful means, when we either cannot do
   it at all, or at least not so easily, by lawful ones; these things, i.
   e. the snares and temptations of vice, are what render the present
   world peculiarly fit to be a state of discipline, to those who will
   preserve their integrity: because they render being upon our guard,
   resolution, and the denial of our passions, necessary in order to that
   end. And the exercise of such particular recollection, intention of
   mind, and self-government, in the practice of virtue, has, from the
   make of our nature, a peculiar tendency to form habits of virtue; as
   implying, not only a real, but also a more continued, and a more
   intense exercise of the virtuous principle; or a more constant and a
   stronger effort of virtue exerted into act. Thus suppose a person to
   know himself to be in particular danger, for some time, of doing any
   thing wrong, which yet he fully resolves not to do: continued
   recollection, and keeping upon his guard, in order to make good his
   resolution, is a continued exerting of that act of virtue in a high
   degree, which need have been, and perhaps would have been, only
   instantaneous and weak, had the temptation been so. It is indeed
   ridiculous to assert, that self-denial is essential to virtue and
   piety: but it would have been nearer the truth, though not strictly the
   truth itself, to have said, that it is essential to discipline and
   improvement. For though actions materially virtuous, which have no sort
   of difficulty, but are perfectly agreeable to our particular
   inclinations, may possibly be done only from these particular
   inclinations, and so may pot be any exercise of the principle of
   virtue, i. e. not be virtuous actions at all; yet, on the contrary,
   they may be an exercise of that principle: and when they are, they have
   a tendency to form and fix the habit of virtue. But when the exercise
   of the virtuous principle is more continued, oftener repeated, and more
   intense; as it must be in circumstances of danger, temptation, and
   difficulty, of any kind and in any degree; this tendency is increased
   proportionably, and a more confirmed habit is the consequence.

   This undoubtedly holds to a certain length: but how far it may hold, I
   know not. Neither our intellectual powers, nor our bodily strength can
   be improved beyond such a degree: and both may be over-wrought.
   Possibly there may be somewhat analogous to this, with respect to the
   moral character; which is scarce worth considering. And I mention it
   only, lest it should come into some persons' thoughts, not as an
   exception to the foregoing observations, which perhaps it is; but as a
   confutation of them, which it is not. And there may be several other
   exceptions. Observations of this kind cannot be supposed to hold
   minutely, and in every case. It is enough that they hold in general.
   And these plainly hold so far, as that from them may be seen
   distinctly, which is all that is intended by them, that the present
   world is peculiarly fit to be a state of discipline, for our
   improvement in virtue and piety: in the same sense as some sciences, by
   requiring and engaging the attention, not to be sure of such persons as
   will not, but of such as will, set themselves to them; are fit to form
   the mind to habits of attention.

   Indeed the present state is so far from proving, in event, a discipline
   of virtue to the generality of men, that, on the contrary, they seem to
   make it a discipline of vice. And the viciousness of the world is, in
   different ways, the great temptation which renders it a state of
   virtuous discipline, in the degree it is, to good men. The whole end,
   and the whole occasion, of mankind's being placed in such a state as
   the present, is not pretended to be accounted for. That which appears
   amidst the general corruption, is, that there are some persons, who,
   having within them the principle of amendment and recovery, attend to
   and follow the notices of virtue and religion, be they more clear or
   more obscure which are afforded them; and that the present world is,
   not only an exercise of virtue in these persons, but an exercise of it
   in ways and degrees, peculiarly apt to improve it: apt to improve it,
   in some respects, even beyond what would be, by the exercise of it,
   required in a perfectly virtuous society, or in a society of equally
   imperfect virtue with themselves. But that the present world does not
   actually become a state of moral discipline to many, even to the
   generality, i. e. that they do not improve or grow better in it, cannot
   be urged as a proof, that it was not intended for moral discipline, by
   any who at all observe the analogy of nature. For, of the numerous
   seeds of vegetables and bodies of animals, which are adapted and put in
   the way, to improve to such a point or state of natural maturity and
   perfection, we do not see perhaps that one in a million actually does.
   Far the greatest part of them decay before they are improved to it; and
   appear to be absolutely destroyed. Yet no one, who does not deny all
   final causes, will deny, that those seeds and bodies, which do attain
   to that point of maturity and perfection, answer the end for which they
   were really designed by nature; and therefore that nature designed them
   for such perfection. And I cannot forbear adding, though it is not to
   the present purpose, that the appearance of such an amazing waste in
   nature, with respect to these seeds and bodies, by foreign causes, is
   to us as unaccountable, as, what is much more terrible, the present and
   future ruin of so many moral agents by themselves, i. e. by vice.

   Against this whole notion of moral discipline, it may be objected, in
   another way; that so far as a course of behaviour, materially virtuous,
   proceeds from hope and fear, so far it is only a discipline and
   strengthening of self-love. But doing what God commands, because he
   commands it, is obedience, though it proceeds from hope or fear. And a
   course of such obedience will form habits of it. And a constant regard
   to veracity, justice, and charity. may form distinct habits of these
   particular virtues; and will certainly form habits of self-government,
   and of denying our inclinations, whenever veracity, justice, or charity
   requires it. Nor is there any foundation for this great nicety, with
   which some affect to distinguish in this case, in order to depreciate
   all Religion proceeding from hope or fear. For, veracity, justice, and
   charity, regard to God's authority, and to our own chief interest, are
   not only all three coincident; but each of them is, in itself, a just
   and natural motive or principle of action. And he who begins a good
   life from any one of them, and perseveres in it, as he is already in
   some degree, so he cannot fail of becoming more and more, of that
   character which is correspondent to the constitution of nature as
   moral; and to the relation which God stands in to us as moral governor
   of it: nor consequently can he fail of obtaining that happiness, which
   this constitution and relation necessarily suppose connected with that
   character.

   These several observations, concerning the active principle of virtue
   and obedience to God's commands, are applicable to passive submission
   or resignation to his will: which is another essential part of a right
   character, connected with the former, and very much in our power to
   form ourselves to. It may be imagined, that nothing but afflictions can
   give occasion for or require this virtue; that it can have no respect
   to, nor be any way necessary to qualify for, a state of perfect
   happiness: but it is not experience which can make us think thus.
   Prosperity itself, whilst any thing supposed desirable is not ours,
   begets extravagant and unbounded thoughts. Imagination is altogether as
   much a source of discontent, as any thing in our external condition. It
   is indeed true, that there can be no scope for patience, when sorrow
   shall be no more; but there may be need of a temper of mind, which
   shall have been formed by patience. For, though self-love, considered
   merely as an active principle leading us to pursue our chief interest,
   cannot but be uniformly coincident with the principle of obedience to
   God's commands, our interest being rightly understood; because this
   obedience, and the pursuit of our own chief interest, must be in every
   case one and the same thing: yet it may be questioned, whether
   self-love, considered merely as the desire of our own interest or
   happiness, can, from its nature, be thus absolutely and uniformly
   coincident with the will of God; any more than particular affections
   can: [101] coincident in such sort, as not to be liable to be excited
   upon occasions and in degrees, impossible to be gratified consistently
   with the constitution of things, or the divine appointments. So that
   habits of resignation may, upon this account, be requisite for all
   creatures: habits, I say; which signify what is formed by use. However,
   in general it is obvious that both self-love and particular affection
   in human creatures considered only as passive feelings, distort and
   rend the mind; and therefore stand in need of discipline. Now denial of
   those particular affections, in a course of active virtue: and
   obedience to God's will, has a tendency to moderate them; and seems
   also to have a tendency to habituate the mind, to be easy and satisfied
   with that degree of happiness which is allotted us, i. e. to moderate
   self-love. But the proper discipline for resignation is affliction. For
   a right behaviour under that trial; recollecting ourselves so as to
   consider it in the view, in which Religion teaches us to consider it,
   as from the hand of God; receiving it as what he appoints, or thinks
   proper to permit, in his world and under his government; this will
   habituate the mind to a dutiful submission. And such submission,
   together with the active principle of obedience, make up the temper and
   character in us, which answers to his sovereignty; and which absolutely
   belongs to the condition of our being, as dependent creatures. Nor can
   it be said, that this is only breaking the mind to a submission to mere
   power; for mere power may be accidental, and precarious, and usurped:
   but it is forming within ourselves the temper of resignation to his
   rightful authority, who is, by nature, supreme over all.

   Upon the whole: such a character, and such qualifications, are
   necessary for a mature state of life in the present world, as nature
   alone does in no wise bestow; but has put it upon us, in great part, to
   acquire, in our progress from one stage of life to another, from
   childhood to mature age; put it upon us to acquire them, by giving us
   capacities of doing it, and by placing us, in the beginning of life, in
   a condition fit for it. And this is a general analogy to our condition
   in the present world, as in a state of moral discipline for another. It
   is in vain then to object against the credibility of the present life's
   being intended for this purpose, that all the trouble and the danger
   unavoidably accompanying such discipline, might have been saved us, by
   our being made at once the creatures and the characters, which we were
   to be. For we experience, that what we were to be, was to be the effect
   of what we would do: and that the general conduct of nature is, not to
   save us trouble or danger, but to make us capable of going through
   them, and to put it upon us to do so. Acquirememts of our own,
   experience and habits, are the natural supply to our deficiencies, and
   security against our dangers: since it is as plainly natural to set
   ourselves to acquire the qualifications, as the external things, which
   we stand in need of. In particular, it is as plainly a general law of
   nature, that we should with regard to our temporal interest, form and
   cultivate practical principles within us, by attention, use, and
   discipline, as any thing whatever is a natural law; chiefly in the
   beginning of life, but also throughout the whole course of it. And the
   alternative is left to our choice: either to improve ourselves, and
   better our condition; or, in default of such improvement, to remain
   deficient and wretched. It is therefore perfectly credible, from the
   analogy of nature, that the same may be our case, with respect to the
   happiness of a future state, and the qualifications necessary for it.

   There is a third thing, which may seem implied in the present world's
   being a state of probation; that it is a theatre of action, for the
   manifestation of persons' characters, with respect to a future one:
   not, to be sure, to an all-knowing Being, but to his creation or part
   of it. This may, perhaps, be only a consequence of our being in a state
   of probation in the other senses. However, it is not impossible, that
   men's showing and making manifest, what is in their heart, what their
   real character is, may have respect to a future life, in ways and
   manners which we are not acquainted with: particularly it may be a
   means, for the Author of Nature does not appear to do any thing without
   means, of their being disposed of suitably to their characters; and of
   its being known to the creation, by way of example, that they are thus
   disposed of. But not to enter upon any conjectural account of this; one
   may just mention, that the manifestation of persons' characters
   contributes very much, in various ways, to the carrying on a great part
   of that general course of nature, respecting mankind, which comes under
   our observation at present. I shall only add, that probation, in both
   these senses, as well as in that treated of in the foregoing chapter,
   is implied in moral government; since by persons' behaviour under it,
   their characters cannot but be manifested, and if they behave well,
   improved.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [100] It may be thought, that a sense of interest would as effectually
   restrain creatures from doing wrong. But if by a sense of interest is
   meant a speculative conviction or belief, that such and such indulgence
   would occasion them greater uneasiness, upon the whole, than
   satisfaction; it is contrary to present experience to say, that this
   sense of interest is sufficient to restrain them from thus indulging
   themselves. And if by a sense of interest is meant a practical regard
   to what is upon the whole our happiness; this is not only coincident
   with the principle of virtue or moral rectitude, but is a part of the
   idea itself. And it is evident this reasonable self-love wants to be
   improved, as really as any principle in our nature. For we daily see it
   overmatched, not only by the more boisterous passions, but by
   curiosity, shame, love of imitation, by any thing, even indolence:
   especially if the interest, the temporal interest, suppose, which is
   the end of such self-love, be at a distance. So greatly are profligate
   men mistaken, when they affirm they are wholly governed by
   interestedness and self-love; and so little cause is there for
   moralists to disdain this principle.--See p. 108.

  CHAP. VI.

  OF THE OPINION OF NECESSITY, CONSIDERED AS INFLUENCING PRACTICE.

   THROUGHOUT the foregoing Treatise it appears, that the condition of
   mankind, considered as inhabitants of this world only, and under the
   government of God which we experience, is greatly analogous to our
   condition, as designed for another world, or under that farther
   government, which Religion teaches us. If therefore any assert, as a
   Fatalist must, that the opinion of universal Necessity is reconcilable
   with the former; there immediately arises a question in the way of
   analogy, whether he must not also own it to be reconcilable with the
   latter, i. e. with the system of Religion itself, and the proof of it.
   The reader then will observe, that the question now before us is not
   absolute. Whether the opinion of Fate be reconcilable with Religion;
   but hypothetical, whether, upon supposition of its being reconcilable
   with the constitution of Nature, it be not reconcilable with Religion
   also: or, what pretence a Fatalist, not other persons, but a Fatalist,
   has to conclude from his opinion, that there can be no such thing as
   Religion. And as the puzzle and obscurity, which must unavoidably arise
   from arguing upon so absurd a supposition as that of universal
   Necessity, will, I fear, easily be seen; it will, I hope, as easily be
   excused.

   But since it has been all along taken for granted, as a thing proved,
   that there is an intelligent Author of Nature, or natural Governor of
   the world; and since an objection may be made against the proof of
   this, from the opinion of universal Necessity, as it may be supposed,
   that such Necessity will itself account for the origin and preservation
   of all things: it is requisite, that this objection be distinctly
   answered; or that it be shown, that a Fatality supposed consistent with
   what we certainly experience, does not destroy the proof of an
   intelligent Author and Governor of Nature; before we proceed to
   consider, whether it destroys the proof of a moral Governor of it, or
   of our being in a state of Religion.

   Now, when it is said by a Fatalist, that the whole constitution of
   Nature, and the actions of men, that every thing, and every mode and
   circumstance of every thing, is necessary, and could not possibly have
   been otherwise; it is to be observed, that this Necessity does not
   exclude deliberation, choice, preference, and acting from certain
   principles, and to certain ends: because all this is matter of
   undoubted experience, acknowledged by all, and what every man may,
   every moment, be conscious of. And from hence it follows, that
   Necessity, alone and of itself, is in no sort an account of the
   constitution of Nature, and how things came to be and to continue as
   they are; but only an account of this circumstance relating to their
   origin and continuance, that they could not have been otherwise, than
   they are and have been. The assertion, that every thing is by Necessity
   of Nature, is not an answer to the question; Whether the world came
   into being as it is, by an intelligent Agent forming it thus, or not:
   but to quite another question; Whether it came into being as it is, in
   that way and manner which we call necessarily, or in that way and
   manner which we call freely. For suppose farther, that one who was a
   Fatalist, and one who kept to his natural sense of things, and believed
   himself a Free Agent, were disputing together, and vindicating their
   respective opinions; and they should happen to instance in a house:
   they would agree that it was built by an architect. Their difference
   concerning Necessity and Freedom would occasion no difference of
   judgment concerning this; but only concerning another matter; whether
   the architect built it necessarily or freely. Suppose then they should
   proceed to inquire concerning the constitution of nature: in a lax way
   of speaking, one of them might say, it was by Necessity; and the other,
   by Freedom: but if they had any meaning to their words, as the latter
   must mean a Free Agent, so the former must at length be reduced to mean
   an Agent, whether he would say one or more, acting by Necessity: for
   abstract notions can do nothing. Indeed we ascribe to God a necessary
   existence, uncaused by any agent. For we find within ourselves the idea
   of infinity, i. e. immensity and eternity, impossible, even in
   imagination, to be removed out of being. We seem to discern
   intuitively, that there must, and cannot but be, somewhat, external to
   ourselves, answering this idea, or the archetype of it. And from hence
   (for this abstract, as much as any other, implies a concrete) we
   conclude, that there is, and cannot but be, an infinite and immense
   eternal Being existing, prior to all design contributing to his
   existence, and exclusive of it. And from the scantiness of language, a
   manner of speaking has been introduced; that Necessity is the
   foundation, the reason, the account of the existence of God. But it is
   not alleged, nor can it be at all intended, that every thing exists as
   it does, by this kind of Necessity; a Necessity antecedent in nature to
   design: it cannot, I say, be meant that every thing exists as it does,
   by this kind of Necessity, upon several accounts; and particularly
   because it is admitted, that design, in the actions of men, contributes
   to many alterations in nature. For if any deny this, I shall not
   pretend to reason with them.

   From these things it follows; First, That when a Fatalist asserts, that
   every thing is by Necessity, he must mean, by an Agent acting
   necessarily; he must, I say, mean this, for I am very sensible he would
   not choose to mean it: and Secondly, That the Necessity, by which such
   an Agent is supposed to act, does not exclude intelligence and design.
   So that, were the system of Fatality admitted, it would just as much
   account for the formation of the world, as for the structure of a
   house, and no more. Necessity as much requires and supposes a Necessary
   Agent, as Freedom requires and supposes a Free Agent, to be the former
   of the world. And the appearances of design and of final causes in the
   constitution of nature as really prove this acting Agent to be an
   intelligent designer, or to act from choice; upon the scheme of
   Necessity, supposed possible, as upon that of Freedom.

   It appearing thus, that the notion of Necessity does not destroy the
   proof, that there is an intelligent Author of Nature and natural
   Governor of the world; the present question, which the analogy before
   mentioned suggests, [102] and which, I think, it will answer, is this:
   Whether the opinion of Necessity, supposed consistent with possibility,
   with the constitution of the world, and the natural government which we
   experience exercised over it, destroys all reasonable ground of belief,
   that we are in a state of Religion: or whether that opinion be
   reconcilable with Religion; with the system, and the proof of it.

   Suppose then a Fatalist to educate any one, from his youth up, in his
   own principles; that the child should reason upon them, and conclude,
   that since he cannot possibly behave otherwise than he does, he is not
   a subject of blame or commendation, nor can deserve to be rewarded or
   punished: imagine him to eradicate the very perceptions of blame and
   commendation out of his mind, by means of this system; to form his
   temper, and character, and behaviour to it; and from it to judge of the
   treatment he was to expect, say, from reasonable men, upon his coming
   abroad into the world: as the Fatalist judges from this system, what he
   is to expect from the Author of Nature, and with regard to a future
   state. I cannot forbear stopping here to ask, whether any one of common
   sense would think fit, that a child should be put upon these
   speculations, and be left to apply them to practice. And a man has
   little pretence to reason, who is not sensible, that we are all
   children in speculations of this kinid. However, the child would
   doubtless be highly delighted to find himself freed from the restraints
   of fear and shame, with which his play-fellows were fettered and
   embarrassed; and highly conceited in his superior knowledge, so far
   beyond his years. But conceit and vanity would be the least bad part of
   the influence, which these principles must have, when thus reasoned and
   acted upon, during the course of his education. He must either be
   allowed to go on and be the plague of all about him, and himself too,
   even to his own destruction: or else correction must be continually
   made use of, to supply the want of those natural perceptions of blame
   and commendation, which we have supposed to be removed; and to give him
   a practical impression, of what he had reasoned himself out of the
   belief of, that he was in fact an accountable child, and to be punished
   for doing what he was forbid. It is therefore in reality impossible,
   but that the correction which he must meet with, in the course of his
   education, must convince him, that if the scheme he was instructed in
   were not false; yet that he reasoned inconclusively upon it, and
   somehow or other misapplied it to practice and common life; as what the
   Fatalist experiences of the conduct of Providence at present, ought in
   all reason to convince him, that this scheme is misapplied, when
   applied to the subject of Religion. [103] But supposing the child's
   temper could remain still formed to the system, and his expectation of
   the treatment he was to have in the world be regulated by it; so as to
   expect that no reasonable man would blame or punish him, for any thing
   which he should do, because he could not help doing it: upon this
   supposition it is manifest he would, upon his coming abroad into the
   world, be insupportable to society, and the treatment which he would
   receive from it would render it so to him; and he could not fail of
   doing somewhat, very soon, for which he would be delivered over into
   the hands of civil justice. And thus, in the end, he would be convinced
   of the obligations he was under to his wise instructor. Or suppose this
   scheme of Fatality in any other way, applied to practice, such
   practical application of it will be found equally absurd; equally
   fallacious in a practical sense: for instance, that if a man be
   destined to live such a time, he shall live to it, though he take no
   care of his own preservation; or if he be destined to die before that
   time, no care can prevent it: therefore all care about preserving one's
   life is to be neglected: which is the fallacy instanced in by the
   ancients. But now, on the contrary, none of these practical absurdities
   can be drawn from reasoning, upon the supposition that we are free; but
   all such reasoning with regard to the common affairs of life is
   justified by experience. And therefore, though it were admitted that
   this opinion of Necessity were speculatively true; yet, with regard to
   practice, it is as if it were false, so far as our experience reaches:
   that is, to the whole of our present life. For, the constitution of the
   present world, and the condition in which we are actually placed, is,
   as if we were free. And it may perhaps justly be concluded, that since
   the whole process of action, through every step of it, suspense,
   deliberation, inclining one way, determining, and at last doing as we
   determine, is as if we were free, therefore we are so. But the thing
   here insisted upon is, that under the present natural government of the
   world, we find we are treated and dealt with, as if we were free, prior
   to all consideration whether we are or not. Were this opinion therefore
   of Necessity admitted to be ever so true; yet such is in fact our
   condition and the natural course of things, that whenever we apply it
   to life and practice, this application of it always misleads us, and
   cannot but mislead us, in a most dreadful manner, with regard to our
   present interest. And how can people think themselves so very secure
   then, that the same application of the same opinion may not mislead
   them also, in some analogous manner, with respect to a future, a more
   general, and more important interest? For, Religion being a practical
   subject; and the analogy of nature showing us, that we have not
   faculties to apply this opinion, were it a true one, to practical
   subjects; whenever we do apply it to the subject of Religion, and
   thence conclude, that we are free from its obligations, it is plain
   this conclusion cannot be depended upon. There will still remain just
   reason to think, whatever appearances are, that we deceive ourselves;
   in somewhat of a like manner, as when people fancy they can draw
   contradictory conclusions from the idea of infinity.

   From these things together, the attentive reader will see it follows,
   that if upon supposition of Freedom the evidence of Religion be
   conclusive, it remains so, upon supposition of Necessity, because the
   notion of Necessity is not applicable to practical subjects: i. e. with
   respect to them, is as if it were not true. Nor does this contain any
   reflection upon reason, but only upon what is unreasonable. For to
   pretend to act upon reason, in opposition to practical principles,
   which the Author of our nature gave us to act upon; and to pretend to
   apply our reason to subjects, with regard to which, our own short
   views, and even our experience, will show us, it cannot be depended
   upon; and such, at best, the subject of Necessity must be; this is
   vanity, conceit, and unreasonableness.

   But this is not all. For we find within ourselves a will, and are
   conscious of a character. Now if this, in us, be reconcilable with
   Fate, it is reconcilable with it, in the Author of Nature. And besides,
   natural government and final causes imply a character and a will in the
   Governor and Designer; [104] a will concerning the creatures whom he
   governs. The Author of Nature then being certainly of some character or
   other, notwithstanding Necessity; it is evident this Necessity is as
   reconcilable with the particular character of benevolence, veracity,
   and justice, in him, which attributes are the foundation of Religion,
   as with any other character: since we find this Necessity no more
   hinders men from being benevolent, than cruel; true, than faithless;
   just, than unjust; or, if the Fatalist pleases, what we call unjust.
   For it is said indeed, that what, upon supposition of Freedom, would be
   just punishment; upon supposition of Necessity, becomes manifestly
   unjust: because it is punishment inflicted for doing that which persons
   could not avoid doing. As if the Necessity, which is supposed to
   destroy the injustice of murder, for instance, would not also destroy
   the injustice of punishing it. However, as little to the purpose as
   this objection is in itself, it is very much to the purpose to observe
   from it, how the notions of justice and injustice remain, even whilst
   we endeavour to suppose them removed; how they force themselves upon
   the mind, even whilst we are making suppositions destructive of them:
   for there is not, perhaps, a man in the world, but would be ready to
   make this objection at first thought.

   But though it is most evident, that universal Necessity, if it be
   reconcilable with any thing, is reconcilable with that character in the
   Author of Nature, which is the foundation of Religion; "Yet, does it
   not plainly destroy the proof, that he is of that character, and
   consequently the proof of Religion?" By no means. For we find, that
   happiness and misery are not our fate, in any such sense as not to be
   the consequences of our behaviour; but that they are the consequences
   of it. [105] We find God exercises the same kind of government over us,
   with that which a father exercises over his children, and a civil
   magistrate over his subjects. Now, whatever becomes of abstract
   questions concerning Liberty and Necessity, it evidently appears to us,
   that veracity and justice must he the natural rule and measure of
   exercising this authority or government, to a Being who can have no
   competitions, or interfering of interests, with his creatures and his
   subjects.

   But as the doctrine of Liberty, though we experience its truth, may be
   perplexed with difficulties, which run up into the most abstruse of all
   speculations; and as the opinion of Necessity seems to be the very
   basis upon which infidelity grounds itself; it may be of some use to
   offer a more particular proof of the obligations of Religion, which may
   distinctly be shown not to be destroyed by this opinion.

   The proof from final causes of an intelligent Author of Nature is not
   affected by the opinion of Necessity; supposing Necessity a thing
   possible in itself, and reconcilable with the constitution of things.
   [106] And it is a matter of fact, independent on this or any other
   speculation, that he governs the world by the method of rewards and
   punishments: [107] and also that he hath given us a moral faculty, by
   which we distinguish between actions, and approve some as virtuous and
   of good desert, and disapprove others as vicious and of ill desert.
   [108] Now this moral discernment implies, in the notion of it, a rule
   of action, and a rule of a very peculiar kind: for it carries in it
   authority and a right of direction; authority in such a sense, as that
   we cannot depart from it without being self-condemned. [109] And that
   the dictates of this moral faculty, which are by nature a rule to us,
   are moreover the laws of God, laws in a sense including sanctions; may
   be thus proved. Consciousness of a rule or guide of action, in
   creatures who are capable of considering it as given them by their
   Maker, not only raises immediately a sense of duty, but also a sense of
   security in following it, and of danger in deviating from it. A
   direction of the Author of Nature, given to creatures capable of
   looking upon it as such, is plainly a command from him: and a command
   from him necessarily includes in it, at least, an implicit promise in
   case of obedience, or threatening in case of disobedience. But then the
   sense or perception of good and ill desert, [110] which is contained in
   the moral discernment, renders the sanction explicit, and makes it
   appear, as one may say, expressed. For since his method of government
   is to reward and punish actions, his having annexed to some actions an
   inseparable sense of good desert, and to others of ill, this surely
   amounts to declaring, upon whom his, punishments shall be inflicted,
   and his rewards be bestowed. For he must have given us this discernment
   and sense of things, as a presentiment of what is to be hereafter: that
   is, by way of information beforehand, what we are finally to expect in
   this world. There is then most evident ground to think, that the
   government of God, upon the whole, will be found to correspond to the
   nature which he has given us: and that, in the upshot and issue of
   things, happiness and misery shall, in fact and event, be made to
   follow virtue and vice respectively; as he has already, in so peculiar
   a manner, associated the ideas of them in our minds. And from hence
   might easily be deduced the obligations of religious worship, were it
   only to be considered as a means of preserving upon our minds a sense
   of this moral government of God, and securing our obedience to it:
   which yet is an extremely imperfect view of that most important duty.

   Now, I say, no objection from Necessity can lie against this general
   proof of Religion. None against the proposition reasoned upon, that we
   have such a moral faculty and discernment; because this is a mere
   matter of fact: a thing of experience, that human kind is thus
   constituted: none against the conclusion; because it is immediate and
   wholly from this fact. For the conclusion, that God will finally reward
   the righteous and punish the wicked, is not here drawn, from its
   appearing to us fit [111] that he should; but from its appearing, that
   he has told us, he will. And this he hath certainly told us, in the
   promise and threatening, which it hath been observed the notion of a
   command implies, and the sense of good and ill desert which he has
   given us, more distinctly expresses. And this reasoning from fact is
   confirmed, and in some degree even verified, by other facts; by the
   natural tendencies of virtue and of vice; [112] and by this, that God,
   in the natural course of his providence, punishes vicious actions as
   mischievous to society; and also vicious actions as such in the
   strictest sense. [113] So that the general proof of Religion is
   unanswerably real, even upon the wild supposition which we are arguing
   upon. It must likewise be observed further, that natural Religion hath,
   besides this, an external evidence; which the doctrine of Necessity, if
   it could be true, would not affect. For suppose a person, by the
   observations and reasoning above, or by any other, convinced of the
   truth of Religion; that there is a God, who made the world, who is the
   moral Governor and Judge of mankind, and will upon the whole deal with
   every one according to his works: I say, suppose a person convinced of
   this by reason; but to know nothing at all of antiquity, or the present
   state of mankind: it would be natural for such a one to be inquisitive,
   what was the history of this system of doctrine; at what time, and in
   what manner, it came first into the world; and whether it were believed
   by any considerable part of it. And were he upon inquiry to find, that
   a particular person, in a late age, first of all proposed it, as a
   deduction of reason, and that mankind were before wholly ignorant of
   it; then, though its evidence from reason would remain, there would be
   no additional probability of its truth, from the account of its
   discovery. But instead of this being the fact of the case, on the
   contrary, he would find, what could not but afford him a very strong
   confirmation of its truth: First, That somewhat of this system, with
   more or fewer additions and alterations, hath been professed in all
   ages and countries, of which we have any certain information relating
   to this matter. Secondly, That it is certain historical fact, so far as
   we can trace things up, that this whole system of belief, that there is
   one God, the Creator and moral Governor of the world, and that mankind
   is in a state of Religion, was received in the first ages. And Thirdly,
   That as there is no hint or intimation in history, that this system was
   first reasoned out; so there is express historical or traditional
   evidence, as ancient. as history, that it was taught first by
   revelation. Now, these things must be allowed to be of great weight.
   The first of them, general consent, shows this system to be conformable
   to the common sense of mankind. The second, namely, that Religion was
   believed in the first ages of the world, especially as it does not
   appear that there were then any superstitious or false additions to it,
   cannot but be a further confirmation of its truth. For it is a proof of
   this alternative: either that it came into the world by revelation; or
   that it is natural, obvious, and forces itself upon the mind. The
   former of these is the conclusion of learned men. And whoever will
   consider, how unapt for speculation rude and uncultivated minds are,
   will, perhaps from hence alone, be strongly inclined to believe it the
   truth. And as it is shown in the Second Part [114] of this Treatise,
   that there is nothing of such peculiar presumption against a revelation
   in the beginning of the world, as there is supposed to be against
   subsequent ones: a sceptic could not, I think, give any account, which
   would appear more probable even to himself, of the early pretences to
   revelation; than by supposing some real original one, from whence they
   were copied. And the third thing above mentioned, that there is express
   historical or traditional evidence as ancient as history, of the system
   of Religion being taught mankind by revelation; this must be admitted
   as some degree of real proof, that it was so taught. For why should not
   the most ancient tradition be admitted as some additional proof of a
   fact, against which there is no presumption? And this proof is
   mentioned here, because it has its weight to show, that Religion came
   into the world by revelation, prior to all consideration of the proper
   authority of any book supposed to contain it; and even prior to all
   consideration, whether the revelation itself be uncorruptly handed
   down, and related, or mixed and darkened with fables. Thus the
   historical account, which we have of the origin of Religion, taking in
   all circumstances, is a real confirmation of its truth, no way affected
   by the opinion of Necessity. And the external evidence, even of natural
   Religion, is by no means inconsiderable.

   But it is carefully to be observed, and ought to be recollected after
   all proofs of virtue and religion, which are only general; that as
   speculative reason may be neglected, prejudiced, and deceived, so also
   may our moral understanding be impaired and perverted, and the dictates
   of it not impartially attended to. This indeed proves nothing against
   the reality of our speculative or practical faculties of perception;
   against their being intended by nature, to inform us in the theory of
   things, and instruct us how we are to behave, and what we are to expect
   in consequence of our behaviour. Yet our liableness, in the degree we
   are liable, to prejudice and perversion, is a most serious admonition
   to us to be upon our guard, with respect to what is of such
   consequence, as our determinations concerning virtue and religion; and
   particularly not to take custom, and fashion, and slight notions of
   honour, or imaginations of present ease, use, and convenience to
   mankind, for the only moral rule. [115]

   The foregoing observations, drawn from the nature of the thing, and the
   history of Religion, amount, when taken together, to a real practical
   proof of it, not to be confuted: such a proof as, considering the
   infinite importance of the thing, I apprehend, would be admitted fully
   sufficient, in reason, to influence the actions of men, who act upon
   thought and reflection; if it were admitted that there is no proof of
   the contrary. But it may be said; "There are many probabilities, which
   cannot indeed be confuted, i. e. shown to be no probabilities, and yet
   may be overbalanced by greater probabilities on the other side; much
   more by demonstration. And there is no occasion to object against
   particular arguments alleged for an opinion, when the opinion itself
   maybe clearly shown to be false, without meddling with such arguments
   at all, but leaving them just as they are. [116] Now the method of
   government by rewards and punishments, and especially rewarding and
   punishing good and ill desert as such respectively, must go upon
   supposition, that we are Free and not Necessary Agents. And it is
   incredible, that the Author of Nature should govern us upon a
   supposition as true, which he knows to be false; and therefore absurd
   to think, he will reward or punish us for our actions hereafter;
   especially that he will do it under the notion, that they are of good
   or ill desert." Here then the matter is brought to a point. And the
   answer to all this is full, and not to be evaded; that the whole
   constitution and course of things, the whole analogy of providence,
   shows beyond possibility of doubt, that the conclusion from this
   reasoning is false; wherever the fallacy lies. The doctrine of freedom
   indeed clearly shows where: in supposing ourselves Necessary, when in
   truth we are Free Agents. But, upon the supposition of Necessity, the
   fallacy lies in taking for granted, that it is incredible Necessary
   Agents should be rewarded and punished. But that, somehow or other, the
   conclusion now mentioned is false, is most certain. For it is fact,
   that God does govern even brute creatures by the method of rewards and
   punishments, in the natural course of things. And men are rewarded and
   punished for their actions, punished for actions mischievous to society
   as being so, punished for vicious actions as such; by the natural
   instrumentality of each other, under the present conduct of Providence.
   Nay even the affection of gratitude, and the passion of resentment, and
   the rewards and punishments following from them, which in general are
   to be considered as natural, i. e. from the Author of Nature; these
   rewards and punishments, being naturally [117] annexed to actions
   considered as implying good intention and good desert, ill intention
   and ill desert; these natural rewards and punishments, I say, are as
   much a contradiction to the conclusion above, and show its falsehood,
   as a more exact and complete rewarding and punishing of good and ill
   desert as such. So that if it be incredible, that Necessary Agents
   should be thus rewarded and punished; then, men are not necessary but
   free; since it is matter of fact, that they are thus rewarded and
   punished. But if, on the contrary, which is the supposition we have
   been arguing upon, it be insisted, that men are Necessary Agents; then,
   there is nothing incredible in the further supposition of Necessary
   Agents being thus rewarded and punished: since we ourselves are thus
   dealt with.

   From the whole therefore it must follow, that a Necessity supposed
   possible, and reconcilable with the constitution of things, does in no
   sort prove that the Author of Nature will not, nor destroy the proof
   that he will, finally and upon the whole, in his eternal government,
   render his creatures happy or miserable, by some means or other, as
   they behave well or ill. Or, to express this conclusion in words
   conformable to the title of the Chapter, the analogy of nature shows
   us, that the opinion of Necessity, considered as practical, is false.
   And if Necessity, upon the supposition above mentioned, doth not
   destroy the proof of natural Religion, it evidently makes no alteration
   in the proof of revealed.

   From these things likewise we may learn, in what sense to understand
   that general assertion, that the opinion of Necessity is essentially
   destructive of all religion. First, in a practical sense; that by this
   notion, atheistical men pretend to satisfy and encourage themselves in
   vice, and justify to others their disregard to all religion. And
   secondly, in the strictest sense; that it is a contradiction to the
   whole constitution of nature, and to what we may every moment
   experience in ourselves, and so overturns every thing. But by no means
   is this assertion to be understood, as if Necessity, supposing it could
   possibly be reconciled with the constitution of things and with what we
   experience, were not also reconcilable with Religion: for upon this
   supposition, it demonstrably is so.

   [111] However, I am far from intending to deny, that the will of God is
   determined, by what is fit, by the right and reason of the case; though
   one chooses to decline matters of such abstract speculation, and to
   speak with caution when one does speak of them. But if it be
   intelligible to say, that it is fit and reasonable for every one to
   consult his own happiness, then fitness of action, or the right and

   as inconceivable, to suppose God to approve one course of action, or
   one end, preferably to another, which yet his acting at all from design
   implies that he does, without supposing somewhat prior in that end, to
   be the ground of the preference; as to suppose him to discern an
   abstract proposition to be true, without supposing somewhat prior in
   it, to be the ground of the discernment. It doth not therefore appear,
   that moral right is any more relative to perception, than abstract
   truth is; or that it is any more improper, to speak of the fitness and
   rightness of actions and ends, as founded in the nature of things, than
   to speak of abstract truth, as thus founded.

  CHAP. VII.

  OF THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD, CONSIDERED AS A SCHEME OR CONSTITUTION, IMPERFECTLY
  COMPREHENDED.

   THOUGH it be, as it cannot but be, acknowledged, that the analogy of
   nature gives a strong credibility to the general doctrine of Religion,
   and to the several particular things contained in it, considered as so
   many matters of fact; and likewise that it shows this credibility not
   to be destroyed by any notions of Necessity: yet still, objections may
   be insisted upon, against the wisdom, equity, and goodness of the
   divine government implied in the notion of. Religion, and against the
   method by which this government is conducted; to which objections
   analogy can be no direct answer. For the credibility, or the certain
   truth, of a matter of fact, does not immediately prove any thing
   concerning the wisdom or goodness of it: and analogy can do no more,
   immediately or directly, than show such and such things to be true or
   credible, considered only as matters of fact. But still, if, upon
   supposition of a moral constitution of nature and a moral government
   over it, analogy suggests and makes it credible, that this government
   must be a scheme, system, or constitution of government, as
   distinguished from a number of single unconnected acts of distributive
   justice and goodness; and likewise, that it must be a scheme, so
   imperfectly comprehended, and of such a sort in other respects, as to
   afford a direct general answer to all objections against the justice
   and goodness of it: then analogy is, remotely, of great service in
   answering those objections; both by suggesting the answer, and showing
   it to be a credible one.

   Now this, upon inquiry, will be found to be the case. For, First, Upon
   supposition that God exercises a moral government over the world, the
   analogy of his natural government suggests and makes it credible, that
   his moral government must be a scheme, quite beyond our comprehension:
   and this affords a general answer to all objections against the justice
   and goodness of it. And, Secondly, A more distinct observation of some
   particular things contained in God's scheme of natural government, the
   like things being supposed, by analogy, to be contained in his moral
   government, will further show, how little weight is to be laid upon
   these objections.

   I. Upon supposition that God exercises a moral government over the
   world, the analogy of his natural government suggests and makes it
   credible, that his moral government must be a scheme, quite beyond our
   comprehension; and this affords a general answer to all objections
   against the justice and goodness of it. It is most obvious, analogy
   renders it highly credible, that, upon supposition of a moral
   government, it must be a scheme: for the world, and the whole natural
   government of it, appears to be so: to be a scheme, system, or
   constitution, whose parts correspond to each other, and to a whole; as
   really as any work of art, or as any particular model of a civil
   constitution and government. In this great scheme of the natural world,
   individuals have various peculiar relations to other individuals of
   their own species. And whole species are, we find, variously related to
   other species, upon this earth. Nor do we know, how much further these
   kinds of relations may extend. And, as there is not any action or
   natural event, which we are acquainted with, so single and unconnected,
   as not to have a respect to some other actions and events; so possibly
   each of them, when it has not an immediate, may yet have a remote,
   natural relation to other actions and events, much beyond the compass
   of this present world. There seems indeed nothing, from whence we can
   so much as make a conjecture, whether all creatures, actions, and
   events, throughout the whole of nature, have relations to each other.
   But, as it is obvious, that all events have future unknown
   consequences; so if we trace any, as far as we can go, into what is
   connected with it, we shall find, that if such event were not connected
   with somewhat further in nature unknown to us, somewhat both past and
   present, such event could not possibly have been at all. Nor can we
   give the whole account of any one thing whatever; of all its causes,
   ends, and necessary adjuncts; those adjuncts, I mean, without which it
   could not have been. By this most astonishing connexion, these
   reciprocal correspondences and mutual relations, every thing which we
   see in the course of nature is actually brought about. And things
   seemingly the most insignificant imaginable are perpetually observed to
   be necessary conditions to other things of the greatest importance; so
   that any one thing whatever may, for ought we know to the contrary, be
   a necessary condition to any other. The natural world then, and natural
   government of it, being such an incomprehensible scheme; so
   incomprehensible, that a man must, really in the literal sense, know
   nothing at all, who is. not sensible of his ignorance in it; this
   immediately suggests, and strongly shows the credibility, that the
   moral world and government of it may be so too. Indeed the natural and
   moral constitution and government of the world are so connected, as to
   make up together but one scheme: and it is highly probable, that the
   first is formed and carried on merely in subserviency to the latter; as
   the vegetable world is for the animal, and organized bodies for minds.
   But the thing intended here is, without inquiring how far the
   administration of the natural world is subordinate to that of the
   moral, only to observe the credibility, that one should be analogous or
   similar to the other: that therefore every act of divine justice and
   goodness may be supposed to look much beyond itself, and its immediate
   object; may have some reference to other parts of God's moral
   administration, and to a general moral plan; and that every
   circumstance of this his moral government may be adjusted beforehand
   with a view to the whole of it. Thus for example: the determined length
   of time, and the degrees and ways, in which virtue is to remain in a
   state of warfare and discipline, and in which wickedness is permitted
   to have its progress; the times appointed for the execution of justice;
   the appointed instruments of it; the kinds of rewards and punishments,
   and the manners of their distribution; all particular instances of
   divine justice and goodness, and every circumstance of them, may have
   such respects to each other, as to make up altogether a whole,
   connected and related in all its parts; a scheme or system, which is as
   properly one as the natural world is, and of the like kind. And
   supposing this to be the case; it is most evident, that we are not
   competent judges of this scheme, from the small parts of it which come
   within our view in the present life: and therefore no objections
   against any of these parts can be insisted upon by reasonable men.

   This our ignorance, and the consequence here drawn from it, are
   universally acknowledged upon other occasions; and though scarce
   denied, yet are universally forgot, when persons come to argue against
   Religion. And it is not perhaps easy, even for the most reasonable men,
   always to bear in mind the degree of our ignorance, and make due
   allowances for it. Upon these accounts, it may not be useless to go on
   a little further, in order to show more distinctly, how just an answer
   our ignorance is, to objections against the scheme of Providence.
   Suppose then a person boldly to assert, that the things complained of,
   the origin and continuance of evil, might easily have been prevented by
   repeated interpositions; [118] interpositions so guarded and
   circumstanced, as would preclude all mischief arising from them; or, if
   this were impracticable, that a scheme of government is itself an
   imperfection; since more good might have been produced, without any
   scheme, system, or constitution at all, by continued single unrelated
   acts of distributive justice and goodness; because these would have
   occasioned no irregularities. And farther than this, it is presumed,
   the objections will not be carried. Yet the answer is obvious: that
   were these assertions true, still the observations above, concerning
   our ignorance in the scheme of divine government and the consequence
   drawn from it, would hold, in great measure; enough to vindicate
   Religion, against all objections from the disorders of the present
   state. Were these assertions true, yet the government of the world
   might be just and good notwithstanding; for, at the most, they would
   infer nothing more than that it might have been better. But indeed they
   are mere arbitrary assertions; no man being sufficiently acquainted
   with the possibilities of things, to bring any proof of them to the
   lowest degree of probability. For however possible what is asserted may
   seem; yet many instances may be alleged, in things much less out of our
   reach, of. suppositions absolutely impossible, and reducible to the
   most palpable self-contradictions, which, not every one by any means
   would perceive to be such, nor perhaps any one at first sight suspect.
   From these things, it is easy to see distinctly, how our ignorance, as
   it is the common, is really a satisfactory answer to all objections
   against the justice and goodness of Providence. If a man, contemplating
   any one providential dispensation, which had no relation to any others,
   should object, that he discerned in it a disregard to justice, or a
   deficiency of goodness; nothing would be less an answer to such
   objection, than our ignorance in other parts of providence, or in the
   Possibilities of things, no way related to what he was contemplating.
   But when we know not but the parts objected against may be relative to
   other parts unknown to us; and when we are unacquainted with what is,
   in the nature of the thing, practicable in the case before us; then our
   ignorance is a satisfactory answer; because, some unknown relation, or
   some unknown impossibility, may render what is objected against, just
   and good; nay good in the highest practicable degree.

   II. And how little weight is to be laid upon such objections, will
   further appear, by a more distinct observation of some particular
   things contained in the natural government of God, the like to which
   may be supposed, from analogy, to be contained in his moral government.

   First, As in the scheme of the natural world, no ends appear to be
   accomplished without means: so we find that means very undesirable,
   often conduce to bring about ends in such a measure desirable, as
   greatly to overbalance the disagreeableness of the means. And in cases
   where such means are conducive to such ends, it is not reason, but
   experience, which shows us, that they are thus conducive. Experience
   also shows many means to be conducive and necessary to accomplish ends,
   which means, before experience, we should have thought, would have had
   even a contrary tendency. Now from these observations relating to the
   natural scheme of the world, the moral being supposed analogous to it,
   arises a great credibility, that the putting our misery in each other's
   power to the degree it is, and making men liable to vice to the degree
   we are; and in general, that those things which are objected against
   the moral scheme of Providence, may be, upon the whole, friendly and
   assistant to virtue, and productive of an overbalance of happiness: i.
   e. the things objected against may be means, by which an overbalance of
   good will, in the end, be found produced. And from the same
   observations, it appears to be no presumption against this, that we do
   not, if indeed we do not, see those means to have any such tendency, or
   that they seem to us to have a contrary one. Thus those things, which
   we call irregularities, may not be so at all: because they may be means
   of accomplishing wise and good ends more considerable. And it may be
   added, as above, that they may also be the only means, by which these
   wise and good ends are capable of being accomplished.

   After these observations it may be proper to add, in order to obviate
   an absurd and wicked conclusion from any of them, that though the
   constitution of our nature, from whence we are capable of vice and
   misery, may, as it undoubtedly does, contribute to the perfection and
   happiness of the world; and though the actual permission of evil may be
   beneficial to it: (i. e. it would have been more mischievous, not that
   a wicked person had himself abstained from his own wickedness, but that
   any one had forcibly prevented it, than that it was permitted:) yet
   notwithstanding, it might have been much better for the world, if this
   very evil had never been done. Nay it is most clearly conceivable, that
   the very commission of wickedness may be beneficial to the world, and
   yet, that it would be infinitely more beneficial for men to refrain
   from it. For thus, in the wise and good constitution of the natural
   world, there are disorders which bring their own cures; diseases, which
   are themselves remedies. Many a man would have died, had it not been
   for the gout or a fever; yet it would be thought madness to assert,
   that sickness is a better or more perfect state than health; though the
   like, with regard to the moral world, has been asserted. But,

   Secondly, The natural government of the world is carried on by general
   laws. For this there may be wise and good reasons: the wisest and best,
   for ought we know to the contrary. And that there are such reasons, is
   suggested to our thoughts by the analogy of nature: by our being made
   to experience good ends to be accomplished, as indeed all the good
   which we enjoy is accomplished, by this means, that the laws, by which
   the world is governed, are general. For we have scarce any kind of
   enjoyments, but what we are, in some way or other, instrumental in
   procuring ourselves, by acting in a manner which we foresee likely to
   procure them: now this foresight could not be at all, were not the
   government of the world carried on by general laws. And though, for
   ought we know to the contrary, every single case may be, at length,
   found to have been provided for even by these: yet to prevent all
   irregularities, or remedy them as they arise, by the wisest and best
   general laws, may be impossible in the nature of things; as we see it
   is absolutely impossible in civil government. But then we are ready to
   think, that, the constitution of nature remaining as it is, and the
   course of things being permitted to go on, in other respects, as it
   does, there might be interpositions to prevent irregularities; though
   they could not have been prevented, or remedied by any general laws.
   And there would indeed be reason to wish, which, by the way, is very
   different from a right to claim, that all irregularities were prevented
   or remedied by present interpositions, if these interpositions would
   have no other effect than this. But it is plain they would have some
   visible and immediate bad effects: for instance, they would encourage
   idleness and negligence; and they would render doubtful the natural
   rule of life, which is ascertained by this very thing, that the course
   of the world is carried on by general laws. And further, it is certain
   they would have distant effects, and very great ones too; by means of
   the wonderful connexions before mentioned. [119] So that we cannot so
   much as guess, what would be the whole result of the interpositions
   desired. It may be said, any bad result might be prevented by further
   interpositions, whenever there was occasion for them: but this again is
   talking quite at random, and in the dark. [120] Upon the whole then, we
   see wise reasons, why the course of the world should be carried on by
   general laws, and good ends accomplished by this means: and for ought
   we know, there may be the wisest reasons for it, and the best ends
   accomplished by it. We have no ground to believe, that all
   irregularities could be remedied as they arise, or could have been
   precluded, by general laws. We find that interpositions would produce
   evil, and prevent good: and, for ought we know, they would produce
   greater evil than they would prevent; and prevent greater good than
   they would produce. And if this be the case, then the not interposing
   is so far from being a ground of complaint, that it is an instance of
   goodness. This is intelligible and sufficient: and going further, seems
   beyond the utmost reach of our faculties.

   But it may be said, that "after all, these supposed impossibilities and
   relations are what we are unacquainted with; and we must judge of
   Religion, as of other things, by what we do know, and look upon the
   rest as nothing: or however, that the answers here given to what is
   objected against Religion, may equally be made use of to invalidate the
   proof of it; since their stress lies so very much upon our ignorance."
   But,

   First, Though total ignorance in any matter does indeed equally
   destroy, or rather preclude, all proof concerning it, and objections
   against it; yet partial ignorance does not. For we may in any degree be
   convinced, that a person is of such a character, and consequently will
   pursue such ends; though we are greatly ignorant, what is the proper
   way of acting, in order the most effectually to obtain those ends: and
   in this case, objections against his manner of acting, as seemingly not
   conducive to obtain them, might be answered by our ignorance; though
   the proof that such ends were intended, might not at all be invalidated
   by it. Thus, the proof of Religion is a proof of the moral character of
   God, and consequently that his government is moral, and that every one
   upon the whole shall receive according to his deserts; a proof that
   this is the designed end of his government. But we are not competent
   judges, what is the proper way of acting, in order the most effectually
   to accomplish this end. [121] Therefore our ignorance is an answer to
   objections against the conduct of Providence, in permitting
   irregularities, as seeming contradictory to this end. Now, since it is
   so obvious, that our ignorance may be a satisfactory answer to
   objections against a thing, and yet not affect the proof of it; till it
   can be shown, it is frivolous to assert, that our ignorance invalidates
   the proof of Religion, as it does the objections against it.

   Secondly, Suppose unknown impossibilities, and unknown relations, might
   justly be urged to invalidate the proof of Religion, as well as to
   answer objections against it: and that, in consequence of this, the
   proof of it were doubtful. Yet still, let the assertion be despised, or
   let it be ridiculed, it is undeniably true, that moral obligations
   would remain certain, though it were not certain what would, upon the
   whole, be the consequences of observing or violating them. For, these
   obligations arise immediately and necessarily from the judgment of our
   own mind, unless perverted, which we cannot violate without being
   self-condemned. And they would be certain too, from considerations of
   interest. For though it were doubtful, what will be the future
   consequences of virtue and vice; yet it is, however, credible, that
   they may have those consequences, which Religion teaches us they will:
   and this credibility is a certain [122] obligation in point of
   prudence, to abstain from all wickedness, and to live in the
   conscientious practice of all that is good. But,

   Thirdly, The answers above given to the objections against Religion
   cannot equally be made use of to invalidate the proof of it. For, upon
   suspicion that God exercises a moral government over the world, analogy
   does most strongly lead us to conclude, that this moral government must
   be a scheme, or constitution, beyond our comprehension. And a thousand
   particular analogies show us, that parts of such a scheme, from their
   relation to other parts, may conduce to accomplish ends, which we
   should have thought they had no tendency at all to accomplish: nay
   ends, which before experience, we should have thought such parts were
   contradictory to, and had a tendency to prevent. And therefore all
   these analogies show, that the way of arguing made use of in objecting
   against Religion is delusive: because they show it is not at all
   incredible, that, could we comprehend the whole, we should find the
   permission of the disorders objected against to be consistent with
   justice and goodness; and even to be instances of them. Now this is not
   applicable to the proof of Religion, as it is to the objections against
   it; [123] and therefore cannot invalidate that proof, as it does these
   objections.

   Lastly, From the observation now made, it is easy to see, that the
   answers above given to the objections against Providence, though, in a
   general way of speaking, they may be said to be taken from our
   ignorance; yet are by no means taken merely from that, but from
   somewhat which analogy shows us concerning it. For analogy shows us
   positively, that our ignorance in the possibilities of things, and the
   various relations in nature, renders us incompetent judges, and leads
   us to false conclusions, in cases similar to this, in which we pretend
   to judge and to object. So that the things above insisted upon are not
   mere suppositions of unknown impossibilities and relations: but they
   are suggested to our thoughts, and even forced upon the observation of
   serious men, and rendered credible too, by the analogy of nature. And
   therefore to take these things into the account, is to judge by
   experience and what we do know: and it is not judging so, to take no
   notice of them.

  CONCLUSION.

   THE observations of the last Chapter lead us to consider this little
   scene of human life, in which we are so busily engaged, as having a
   reference, of some sort or other, to a much larger plan of things.
   Whether we are, any way, related to the more distant parts of the
   boundless universe, into which we are brought, is altogether uncertain.
   But it is evident, that the course of things, which comes within our
   view, is connected with somewhat, past, present, and future, beyond it.
   [124] So that we are placed, as one may speak, in the middle of a
   scheme, not a fixed but a progressive one, every way, incomprehensible:
   incomprehensible, in a manner equally, with respect to what has been,
   what now is, and what shall be hereafter. And this scheme cannot but
   contain in it somewhat as wonderful, and as much beyond our thought and
   conception, [125] as any thing in that of Religion. For, will any man
   in his senses say, that it is less difficult to conceive, how the world
   came to be and to continue as it is; without, than with, an intelligent
   Author and Governor of it? or, admitting an intelligent Governor of it,
   that there is some other rule of government more natural, and of easier
   conception, than that which we call moral Indeed, without an
   intelligent Author and Governor of Nature, no account at all can be
   given, how this universe, or the part of it particularly in which we
   are concerned, came to be, and the course of it to be carried on, as it
   is: nor any, of its general end and design, without a moral Governor of
   it. That there is an intelligent Author of Nature, and natural Governor
   of the world, is a principle gone upon in the foregoing treatise; as
   proved, and generally known and confessed to be proved. And the very
   notion of an intelligent Author of Nature, proved by particular final
   causes, implies a will and a character. [126] Now, as our whole nature,
   the nature which he has given us, leads us to conclude his will and
   character to be moral, just, and good: so we can scarce in imagination
   conceive, what it can be otherwise. However, in consequence of this his
   will and character, whatever it be, he formed the universe as it is,
   and carries on the course of it as he does, rather than in any other
   manner; and has assigned to us, and to all living creatures, a part and
   a lot in it. Irrational creatures act this their part, and enjoy and
   undergo the pleasures and the pains allotted them, without any
   reflection. But one would think it impossible, that creatures endued
   with reason could avoid reflecting sometimes upon all this; reflecting,
   if not from whence we came, yet, at least, whither we are going; and
   what the mysterious scheme, in the midst of which we find ourselves,
   will, at length, come out and produce: a scheme in which it is certain
   we are highly interested, and in which we may be interested even beyond
   conception. For many things prove it palpably absurd to conclude, that
   we shall cease to be, at death. Particular analogies do most sensibly
   show us, that there is nothing to be thought strange, in our being to
   exist in another state of life. And that we are now living beings,
   affords a strong probability that we shall continue so; unless there be
   some positive ground, and there is none from reason or analogy, to
   think death will destroy us. Were a persuasion of this kind ever so
   well grounded, there would, surely, be little reason to take pleasure
   in it. But indeed it can have no other ground, than some such
   imagination, as that of our gross bodies being ourselves; which is
   contrary to experience. Experience too most clearly shows us the folly
   of concluding, from the body and the living agent affecting each other
   mutually, that the dissolution of the former is the destruction of the
   latter. And there are remarkable instances of their not affecting each
   other, which lead us to a contrary conclusion. The supposition, then,
   which in all reason we are to go upon, is, that our living nature will
   continue after death. And it is infinitely unreasonable to form an
   institution of life, or to act upon any other supposition. Now all
   expectation of immortality, whether more or less certain, opens an
   unbounded prospect to our hopes and our fears: since we see the
   constitution of nature is such, as to admit of misery, as well as to be
   productive of happiness, and experience ourselves to partake of both in
   some degree; and since we cannot but know, what higher degrees of both
   we are capable of. And there is no presumption against believing
   further, that our future interest depends upon our present behaviour:
   for we see our present interest doth; and that the happiness and
   misery, which are naturally annexed to our actions, very frequently do
   not follow, till long after the actions are done, to which they are
   respectively annexed. So that were speculation to leave us uncertain,
   whether it were likely, that the Author of Nature, in giving happiness
   and misery to his creatures, hath regard to their actions or not: yet,
   since we find by experience that he hath such regard, the whole sense
   of things which he has given us, plainly leads us, at once and without
   any elaborate inquiries, to think, that it may, indeed must, be to good
   actions chiefly that he hath annexed happiness, and to bad actions
   misery; or that he will, upon the whole, reward those who do well, and
   punish those who do evil. To confirm this from the constitution of the
   world, it has been observed, that some sort of moral government is
   necessarily implied in that natural government of God, which we
   experience ourselves under; that good and bad actions, at present, are
   naturally rewarded and punished, not only as beneficial and mischievous
   to society, but also as virtuous and vicious: and that there is, in the
   very nature of the thing, a tendency to their being rewarded and
   punished in a much higher degree than they are at present. And though
   this higher degree of distributive justice, which nature thus points
   out and leads towards, is prevented for a time from taking place; it is
   by obstacles, which the state of this world unhappily throws in its
   way, and which therefore are in their nature temporary. Now, as these
   things in the natural conduct of Providence are observable on the side
   of virtue; so there is nothing to be set against them on the side of
   vice. A moral scheme of government then is visibly established, and, in
   some degree, carried into execution: and this, together with the
   essential tendencies of virtue and vice duly considered, naturally
   raise in us an apprehension, that it will be carried on further towards
   perfection in a future state, and that every one shall there receive
   according to his deserts. And if this be so, then our future and
   general interest, under the moral government of God, is appointed to
   depend upon our behaviour; notwithstanding the difficulty, which this
   may occasion, of securing it, and the danger of losing it: just in the
   same manner as our temporal interest, under his natural government, is
   appointed to depend upon our behaviour; notwithstanding the like
   difficulty and danger. For, from our original constitution, and that of
   the world which we inhabit, we are naturally trusted with ourselves;
   with our own conduct and our own interest. And from the same
   constitution of nature, especially joined with that course of things
   which is owing to men, we have temptations to be unfaithful in this
   trust; to forfeit this interest, to neglect it, and run ourselves into
   misery and ruin. From these temptations arise the difficulties of
   behaving so as to secure our temporal interest, and the hazard of
   behaving so as to miscarry in it. There is therefore nothing incredible
   in supposing there may be the like difficulty and hazard with regard to
   that chief and final good, which Religion lays before us. Indeed the
   whole account, how it came to pass that we were placed in such a
   condition as this, must be beyond our comprehension. But it is in part
   accounted for by what Religion teaches us, that the character of virtue
   and piety must be a necessary qualification for a future state of
   security and happiness, under the moral government of God; in like
   manner, as some certain qualifications or other are necessary for every
   particular condition of life, under his natural government: and that
   the present state was intended to be a school of discipline, for
   improving in ourselves that character. Now this intention of nature is
   rendered highly credible by observing; that we are plainly made for
   improvement of all kinds: that it is a general appointment of
   Providence, that we cultivate practical principles, and form within
   ourselves habits of action, in order to become fit for what we were
   wholly unfit for before: that in particular, childhood and youth is
   naturally appointed to be a state of discipline for mature age: and
   that the present world is peculiarly fitted for a state of moral
   discipline. And, whereas objections are urged against the whole notion
   of moral government and a probationary state, from the opinion of
   Necessity; it has been shown, that God has given us the evidence, as it
   were, of experience, that all objections against Religion, on this
   head, are vain and delusive. He has also, in his natural government,
   suggested an answer to all our short-sighted objections, against the
   equity and goodness of his moral government; and in general he has
   exemplified to us the latter by the former.

   These things, which it is to be remembered, are matters of fact, ought,
   in all common sense, to awaken mankind; to induce them to consider in
   earnest their condition, and what they have to do. It is absurd, absurd
   to the degree of being ridiculous, if the subject were not of so
   serious a kind, for men to think themselves secure in a vicious life;
   or even in that immoral thoughtlessness, which far the greatest part of
   them are fallen into. And the credibility of Religion, arising from
   experience and facts here considered, is fully sufficient, in reason,
   to engage them to live in the general practice of all virtue and piety;
   under the serious apprehension, though it should be mixed with some
   doubt, [127] of a righteous administration established in nature, and a
   future judgment in consequence of it: especially when we consider, how
   very questionable it is, whether any thing at all can be gained by
   vice; [128] how unquestionably little as well as precarious, the
   pleasures and profits of it are at the best, and how soon they must be
   parted with at the longest. For, in the deliberations of reason,
   concerning what we are to pursue and what to avoid, as temptations to
   any thing from mere passion are supposed out of the case: so
   inducements to vice, from cool expectations of pleasure and interest so
   small and uncertain and short, are really so insignificant, as, in the
   view of reason to be almost nothing in themselves; and in comparison
   with the importance of Religion they quite disappear and are lost. Mere
   passion indeed may be alleged, though not as a reason, yet as an
   excuse, for a vicious course of life. And how sorry an excuse it is,
   will be manifest by observing, that we are placed in a condition in
   which we are unavoidably inured to govern our passions, by being
   necessitated to govern them: and to lay ourselves under the same kind
   of restraints, and as great ones too, from temporal regards, as virtue
   and piety, in the ordinary course of things, require. The plea of
   ungovernable passion then, on the side of vice, is the poorest of all
   things; for it is no reason, and but a poor excuse. But the proper
   motives to religion are the proper proofs of it, from our moral nature,
   from the presages of conscience, and our natural apprehension of God
   under the character of a righteous Governor and Judge: a nature, and
   conscience, and apprehension, given us by him; and from the
   confirmation of the dictates of reason, by life and immortality brought
   to light by the Gospel; and the wrath of God revealed from heaven
   against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.

PART II.

OF REVEALED RELIGION.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAP I. OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CHRISTIANITY.

   SOME persons, upon pretence of the sufficiency of the light of nature,
   avowedly reject all revelation, as, in its very notion, incredible, and
   what must be fictitious. And indeed it is certain, no revelation would
   have been given, had the light of nature been sufficient in such a
   sense, as to render one not wanting and useless. But no man, in
   seriousness and simplicity of mind, can possibly think it so, who
   considers the state of Religion in the heathen world before revelation,
   and its present state in those places which have borrowed no light from
   it: particularly the doubtfulness of some of the greatest men,
   concerning things of the utmost importance, as well as the natural
   inattention and ignorance of mankind in general. It is impossible to
   say, who would have been able to have reasoned out that whole system,
   which we call natural Religion, in its genuine simplicity, clear of
   superstition: but there is certainly no ground to affirm that the
   generality could. If they could, there is no sort of probability that
   they would. Admitting there were, they would highly want a standing
   admonition to remind them of it, and inculcate it upon them.

   And further still, were they as much disposed to attend to Religion, as
   the better sort of men are; yet even upon this supposition, there would
   be various occasions for supernatural instruction and assistance, and
   the greatest advantages might be afforded by them. So that to say
   revelation is a thing superfluous, what there was no need of, and what
   can be of no service, is, I think, to talk quite wildly and at random.
   Nor would it be more extravagant to affirm, that mankind is so entirely
   at ease in the present state, and life so completely happy, that it is
   a contradiction to suppose our condition capable of being, in any
   respect, better.

   There are other persons, not to be ranked with these, who seem to be
   getting into a way of neglecting, and, as it were, overlooking
   revelation, as of small importance, provided natural Religion be kept
   to. With little regard either to the evidence of the former, or to the
   objections against it, and even upon supposition of its truth; "the
   only design of it," say they, "must be, to establish a belief of the
   moral system of nature, and to enforce the practice of natural piety
   and virtue. The belief and practice of these things were, perhaps, much
   promoted by the first publication of Christianity: but whether they are
   believed and practised, upon the evidence and motives of nature or of
   revelation, is no great matter." [129] This way of considering
   revelation, though it is not the same with the former, yet borders
   nearly upon it, and very much, at length, runs up into it: and requires
   to be particularly considered, with regard to the persons who seem to
   be getting into this way. The consideration of it will likewise further
   show the extravagance of the former opinion, and the truth of the
   observations in answer to it, just mentioned. And an inquiry into the
   Importance of Christianity, cannot be an improper introduction to a
   treatise concerning the credibility of it.

   Now if God has given a revelation to mankind, and commanded those
   things which are commanded in Christianity; it is evident, at first
   sight, that it cannot in any wise be an indifferent matter, whether we
   obey or disobey those commands: unless we are certainly assured, that
   we know all the reasons for them, and that all those reasons are now
   ceased, with regard to mankind in general, or to ourselves in
   particular. And it is absolutely impossible we can be assured of this.
   For our ignorance of these reasons proves nothing in the case: since
   the whole analogy of nature shows, what is indeed in itself evident,
   that there may be infinite reasons for things, with which we are not
   acquainted.

   But the importance of Christianity will more distinctly appear, by
   considering it more distinctly: First, as a republication, and external
   institution, of natural or essential Religion, adapted to the present
   circumstances of mankind, and intended to promote natural piety and
   virtue: and Secondly, as containing an account of a dispensation of
   things, not discoverable by reason, in consequence of which several
   distinct precepts are enjoined us. For though natural Religion is the
   foundation and principal part of Christianity, it is not in any sense
   the whole of it.

   I. Christianity is a republication of natural Religion. It instructs
   mankind in the moral system of the world: that it is the work of an
   infinitely perfect Being, and tinder his government; that virtue is his
   law; and that he will finally judge mankind in righteousness, and
   render to all according to their works, in a future state. And, which
   is very material, it teaches natural Religion in its genuine
   simplicity; free from those superstitions, with which it was totally
   corrupted, and under which it was in a manner lost.

   Revelation is, further, an authoritative publication of natural
   Religion, and so affords the evidence of testimony for the truth of it.
   Indeed the miracles and prophecies recorded in Scripture, were intended
   to prove a particular dispensation of Providence, the redemption of the
   world by the Messiah: but this does not hinder, but that they may also
   prove God's general providence over the world, as our moral Governor
   and Judge. And they evidently do prove it; because this character of
   the Author of Nature, is necessarily connected with and implied in that
   particular revealed dispensation of things: it is likewise continually
   taught expressly, and insisted upon, by those persons who wrought the
   miracles and delivered the prophecies. So that indeed natural Religion
   seems as much proved by the Scripture revelation, as it would have
   been, had the design of revelation been nothing else than to prove it.

   But it may possibly be disputed, how far miracles can prove natural
   Religion; and notable objections may be urged against this proof of it,
   considered as a matter of speculation: but considered as a practical
   thing, there can be none. For suppose a person to teach natural
   Religion to a nation, who had lived in total ignorance or forgetfulness
   of it; and to declare he was commissioned by God so to do: suppose him,
   in proof of his commission, to foretell things future, which no human
   foresight could have guessed at; to divide the sea with a word; feed
   great multitudes with bread from heaven; cure all manner of diseases;
   and raise the dead, even himself, to life; would not this give
   additional credibility to his teaching, a credibility beyond what that
   of a common man would have; and be an authoritative publication of the
   law of nature, i. e. a new proof of it? It would be a practical one, of
   the strongest kind, perhaps, which human creatures are capable of
   having given them. The Law of Moses then, and the Gospel of Christ, are
   authoritative publications of the religion of nature; they afford a
   proof of God's general providence, as moral Governor of the world, as
   well as of his particular dispensations of providence towards sinful
   creatures, revealed in the Law and the Gospel. As they are the only
   evidence of the latter, so they are an additional evidence of the
   former.

   To show this further, let us suppose a man of the greatest and most
   improved capacity, who had never heard of revelation, convinced upon
   the whole, notwithstanding the disorders of the world, that it was
   under the direction and moral government of an infinitely perfect
   Being; but ready to question, whether he were not got beyond the reach
   of his faculties: suppose him brought, by this suspicion, into great
   danger of being carried away by the universal bad example of almost
   every one around him, who appeared to have no sense, no practical sense
   at least, of these things: and this, perhaps, would be as advantageous
   a situation with regard to Religion, as nature alone ever placed any
   man in. What a confirmation now must it be to such a person, all at
   once, to find, that this moral system of things was revealed to
   mankind, in the name of that infinite Being, whom he had from
   principles of reason believed in: and that the publishers of the
   revelation proved their commission from him, by making it appear, that
   he had entrusted them with a power of suspending and changing the
   general laws of nature.

   Nor must it by any means be omitted, for it is a thing of the utmost
   importance, that life and immortality are eminently brought to light by
   the Gospel. The great doctrines of a future state, the danger of a
   course of wickedness, and the efficacy of repentance, are not only
   confirmed in the Gospel, but are taught, especially the last is, with a
   degree of light, to which that of nature is but darkness.

   Further: As Christianity served these ends and purposes, when it was
   first published, by the miraculous publication itself; so it was
   intended to serve the same purposes in future ages, by means of the
   settlement of a visible church: of a society, distinguished from common
   ones, and from the rest of the world, by peculiar religious
   institutions; by an instituted method of instruction, and an instituted
   form of external Religion. Miraculous powers were given to the first
   preachers of Christianity, in order to their introducing it into the
   world: a visible church was established, in order to continue it, and
   carry it on successively throughout all ages. Had Moses and the
   Prophets, Christ and his Apostles, only taught, and by miracles proved.
   Religion to their contemporaries; the benefits of their instructions
   would have reached but to a small part of mankind. Christianity must
   have been, in a great degree, sunk and forgot in a very few ages. To
   prevent this, appears to have been one reason why a visible church was
   instituted: to be, like a city upon a hill, a standing memorial to the
   world of the duty which we owe our Maker: to call men continually, both
   by example and instruction, to attend to it, and, by the form of
   Religion, ever before their eyes, remind them of the reality: to be the
   repository of the oracles of God: to hold up the light of revelation in
   aid to that of nature, and propagate it throughout all generations to
   the end of the world--the light of revelation, considered here in no
   other view, than as designed to enforce natural Religion. And in
   proportion as Christianity is professed and taught in the world,
   Religion, natural or essential Religion, is thus distinctly and
   advantageously laid before mankind, and brought again and again to
   their thoughts, as a matter of infinite importance. A visible church
   has also a further tendency to promote natural Religion, as being an
   instituted method of education, originally intended to be of more
   peculiar advantage to those who conform to it. For one end of the
   institution was, that, by admonition and reproof, as well as
   instruction; by a general regular discipline, and public exercises of
   Religion; the body of Christ, as the Scripture speaks, should be
   edified; i. e. trained up in piety and virtue for a higher and better
   state. This settlement, then, appearing thus beneficial; tending in the
   nature of the thing to answer, and, in some degree, actually answering,
   those ends; it is to be remembered, that the very notion of it implies
   positive institutions; for the visibility of the church consists in
   them. Take away every thing of this kind, and you lose the very notion
   itself. So that if the things now mentioned are advantages, the reason
   and importance of positive institutions in general is most obvious;
   since without them these advantages could not be secured to the world.
   And it is mere idle wantonness, to insist upon knowing the reasons, why
   such particular ones were fixed upon rather than others.

   The benefit arising from this supernatural assistance, which
   Christianity affords to natural Religion, is what some persons are very
   slow in apprehending. And yet it is a thing distinct in itself, and a
   very plain obvious one. For will any in good earnest really say, that
   the bulk of mankind in the heathen world were in as advantageous a
   situation with regard to natural Religion, as they are now amongst us:
   that it was laid before them, and enforced upon them, in a manner as
   distinct, and as much tending to influence their practice?

   The objections against all this, from the perversion of Christianity,
   and from the supposition of its having had but little good influence,
   however innocently they may be proposed, yet cannot be insisted upon as
   conclusive, upon any principles, but such as lead to downright Atheism;
   because the manifestation of the law of nature by reason, which, upon
   all principles of Theism, must have been from God, has been perverted
   and rendered ineffectual in the same manner. It may indeed, I think,
   truly be said, that the good effects of Christianity have not been
   small; nor its supposed ill effects, any effects at all of it, properly
   speaking. Perhaps, too, the things themselves done have been
   aggravated; and if not, Christianity hath been often only a pretence;
   and the same evils in the main would have been done upon some other
   pretence. However, great and shocking as the corruptions and abuses of
   it have really been, they cannot be insisted upon as arguments against
   it, upon principles of Theism. For one cannot proceed one step in
   reasoning upon natural Religion, any more than upon Christianity,
   without laying it down as a first principle, that the dispensations of
   Providence are not to be judged of by their perversions, but by their
   genuine tendencies: not by what they do actually seem to effect, but by
   what they would effect if mankind did their part; that part which is
   justly put and left upon them. It is altogether as much the language of
   one as of the other: He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he
   that is holy, let him be holy still. [130] The light of reason does
   not, any more than that of revelation, force men to submit to its
   authority; both admonish them of what they ought to do and avoid,
   together with the consequences of each; and after this, leave them at
   full liberty to act just as they please, till the appointed time of
   judgment. Every moment's experience shows, that this is God's general
   rule of government.

   To return then: Christianity being a promulgation of the law of nature;
   being moreover an authoritative promulgation of it; with new light, and
   other circumstances of peculiar advantage, adapted to the wants of
   mankind; these things fully show its importance. And it is to be
   observed further, that as the nature of the case requires, so all
   Christians are commanded to contribute, by their profession of
   Christianity, to preserve it in he world, and render it such a
   promulgation and enforcement of Religion. For it is the very scheme of
   the Gospel, that each Christian should, in his degree, contribute
   towards continuing and carrying it on: all by uniting in the public
   profession and external practice of Christianity; some by instructing,
   by having the oversight and taking care of this religious community,
   the Church of God. Now this further shows the importance of
   Christianity; and, which is what I chiefly intend, its importance in a
   practical sense: or the high obligations we are under, to take it into
   our most serious consideration; and the danger there must necessarily
   be, not only in treating it despitefully, which I am not now speaking
   of, but in disregarding and neglecting it. For this is neglecting to do
   what is expressly enjoined us, for continuing those benefits to the
   world, and transmitting them down to future times. And all this holds,
   even though the only thing to be considered in Christianity, were its
   subserviency to natural Religion. But,

   II. Christianity is to be considered in a further view; as containing
   an account of a dispensation of things, not at all discoverable by
   reason, in consequence of which several distinct precepts are enjoined
   us. Christianity is not only an external institution of natural
   Religion, and a new promulgation of God's general providence, as
   righteous Governor and Judge of the world; but it contains also a
   revelation of a particular dispensation of Providence, carrying on by
   his Son and Spirit, for the recovery and salvation of mankind, who are
   represented in Scripture to be in a state of ruin. And in consequence
   of this revelation being made, we are commanded to be baptized, not
   only in the name of the Father, but also, of the Son, and of the Holy
   Ghost: and other obligations of duty, unknown before, to the Son and
   the Holy Ghost, are revealed. Now the importance of these duties may be
   judged of, by observing that they arise, not from positive command
   merely, but also from the offices, which appear, from Scripture, to
   belong to those divine persons in the Gospel dispensation; or from the
   relations, which, we are there informed, they stand in to us. By reason
   is revealed the relation, which God the Father stands in to us. Hence
   arises the obligation of duty which we are under to him. In Scripture
   are revealed the relations, which the Son and Holy Spirit stand in to
   us. Hence arise the obligations of duty, which we are under to them.
   The truth of the case, as one may speak, in each of these three
   respects being admitted: that God is the governor of the world, upon
   the evidence of reason; that Christ is the mediator between God and
   man, and the Holy Ghost our guide and sanctifier, upon the evidence of
   revelation: the truth of the case, I say, in each of these respects
   being admitted; it is no more a question, why it should be commanded,
   that we be baptized in the name of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, than
   that we be baptized in the name of the Father. This matter seems to
   require to be more fully stated. [131]

   Let it be remembered, then, that Religion comes under the twofold
   consideration of internal and external: for the latter is as real a
   part of Religion, of true Religion, as the former. Now when Religion is
   considered under the first notion, as an inward principle, to be
   exerted in such and such inward acts of the mind and heart; the essence
   of natural Religion may be said to consist in religious regards to God
   the Father Almighty: and the essence of revealed Religion, as
   distinguished from natural, to consist in religious regards to the Son,
   and to the Holy Ghost. And the obligation we are under, of paying these
   religious regards to each of these divine persons respectively, arises
   from the respective relations which they each stand in to us. How these
   relations are made known, whether by reason or revelation, makes no
   alteration in the case: because the duties arise out of the relations
   themselves, not out of the manner in which we are informed of them. The
   Son and Spirit have each his proper office in that great dispensation
   of Providence, the redemption of the world; the one our mediator, the
   other our sanctifier. Does not then the duty of religious regards to
   both these divine persons, as immediately arise to the view of reason,
   out of the very nature of these offices and relations; as the inward
   good-will and kind intention, which we owe to our fellow creatures,
   arises out of the common relations between us and them? But it will be
   asked, "What are the inward religious regards, appearing thus obviously
   due to the Son and Holy Spirit; as arising, not merely from command in
   Scripture, but from the very nature of the revealed relations, which
   they stand in to us?" I answer, the religious regards of reverence,
   honour, love, trust, gratitude, fear, hope. In what external manner
   this inward worship is to be expressed, is a matter of pure revealed
   command; as perhaps the external manner, in which God the Father is to
   be worshipped, may be more so, than we are ready to think: but the
   worship, the internal worship itself, to the Son and Holy Ghost, is no
   further matter of pure revealed command, than as the relations they
   stand in to us are matter of pure revelation: for the relations being
   known, the obligations to such internal worship are obligations of
   reason, arising out of those relations themselves. In short, the
   history of the Gospel as immediately shows us the reason of these
   obligations, as it shows us the meaning of the words, Son and Holy
   Ghost.

   If this account of the Christian Religion be just; those persons who
   can speak lightly of it, as of little consequence, provided natural
   Religion be kept to, plainly forget, that Christianity, even what is
   peculiarly so called, as distinguished from natural Religion, has yet
   somewhat very important, even of a moral nature. For the office of our
   Lord being made known, and the relation he stands in to us, the
   obligation of religious regards to him is plainly moral, as much as
   charity to mankind is; since this obligation arises, before external
   command, immediately out of that his office and relation itself. Those
   persons appear to forget, that revelation is to be considered, as
   informing us of somewhat new in the state of mankind, and in the
   government of the world: as acquainting us with some relations we stand
   in, which could not otherwise have been known. And these relations
   being real (though before revelation we could be under no obligations
   from them, yet upon their being revealed), there is no reason to think,
   but that neglect of behaving suitably to them will be attended with the
   same kind of consequences under God's government, as neglecting to
   behave suitably to any other relations made known to us by reason. And
   ignorance, whether unavoidable or voluntary, so far as we can possibly
   see, will just as much, and just as little, excuse in one case as in
   the other: the ignorance being supposed equally unavoidable, or equally
   voluntary, in both cases.

   If therefore Christ be indeed the mediator between God and man, i. e.
   if Christianity be true; if he be indeed our Lord, our Saviour, and our
   God; no one can say, what may follow, not only the obstinate, but the
   careless disregard to him, in those high relations. Nay no one can say,
   what may follow such disregard, even in the way of natural consequence.
   [132] For, as the natural consequences of vice in this life are
   doubtless to be considered as judicial punishments inflicted by God; so
   likewise, for aught we know, the judicial punishments of the future
   life may be, in a like way or a like sense, the natural consequence of
   vice: [133] of men's violating or disregarding the relations which God
   has placed them in here, and made known to them.

   Again: If mankind are corrupted and depraved in their moral character,
   and so are unfit for that state, which Christ is gone to prepare for
   his disciples; and if the assistance of God's Spirit be necessary to
   renew their nature, in the degree requisite to their being qualified
   for that state; all which is implied in the express, though figurative
   declaration, Except a man be born of the Spirit, he cannot enter into
   the kingdom of God:John iii. v. supposing this, is it possible any
   serious person can think it a slight matter, whether or no he makes use
   of the means, expressly commanded by God, for obtaining this divine
   assistance? especially since the whole analogy of nature shows, that we
   are not to expect any benefits, without making use of the appointed
   means for obtaining or enjoying them. Now reason shows us nothing, of
   the particular immediate means of obtaining either temporal or
   spiritual benefits. This therefore we must learn, either from
   experience or revelation. And experience, the present case does not
   admit of.

   The conclusion from all this evidently is, that, Christianity being
   supposed either true or credible, it is unspeakable irreverence, and
   really the most presumptuous rashness, to treat it as a light matter.
   It can never justly be esteemed of little consequence, till it be
   positively supposed false. Nor do I know a higher and more important
   obligation which we are under, than that of examining most seriously
   into the evidence of it, supposing its credibility; and of embracing
   it, upon supposition of its truth.

   The two following deductions may be proper to be added, in order to
   illustrate the foregoing observations, and to prevent their being
   mistaken.

   First, Hence we may clearly see, where lies the distinction between
   what is positive and what is moral in Religion. Moral precepts are
   precepts, the reasons of which we see: positive precepts are precepts,
   the reasons of which we do not see. [134] Moral duties arise out of the
   nature of the case itself, prior to external command. Positive duties
   do not arise out of the nature of the case, but from external command;
   nor would they be duties at all, were it not for such command, received
   from him whose creatures and subjects we are. But the manner in which
   the nature of the case, or the fact of the relation, is made known,
   this doth not denominate any duty either positive or moral. That we be
   baptized in the name of the Father is as much a positive duty, as that
   we be baptized in the name of the Son; because both arise equally from
   revealed command: though the relation which we stand in to God the
   Father is made known to us by reason; the relation we stand in to
   Christ, by revelation only. On the other hand, the dispensation of the
   Gospel admitted, gratitude as immediately becomes due to Christ, from
   his being the voluntary minister of this dispensation, as it is due to
   God the Father, from his being the fountain of all good; though the
   first is made known to us by revelation only, the second by reason.
   Hence also we may see, and, for distinctness' sake, it may be worth
   mentioning, that positive institutions come under a twofold
   consideration. They are either institutions founded on natural
   Religion, as baptism in the name of the Father; though this has also a
   particular reference to the Gospel dispensation, for it is in the name
   of God, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: or they are external
   institutions founded on revealed Religion; as baptism in the name of
   the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Secondly, From the distinction between
   what is moral and what is positive in Religion, appears the ground of
   that peculiar preference, which the Scripture teaches us to be due to
   the former. The reason of positive institutions in general is very
   obvious; though we should not see the reason, why such particular ones
   are pitched upon rather than others. Whoever therefore, instead of
   cavilling at words, will attend to the thing itself, may clearly see,
   that positive institutions in general, as distinguished from this or
   that particular one, have the nature of moral commands; since the
   reasons of them appear. Thus, for instance, the external worship of God
   is a moral duty, though no particular mode of it be so. Care then is to
   be taken, when a comparison is made between positive and moral duties,
   that they be compared no further than as they are different; no further
   than as the former are positive, or arise out of mere external command,
   the reasons of which we are not acquainted with; and as the latter are
   moral, or arise out of the apparent reason of the case, without such
   external command. Unless this caution be observed, we shall run into
   endless confusion.

   Now this being premised, suppose two standing precepts enjoined by the
   same authority; that, in certain conjunctures, it is impossible to obey
   both; that the former is moral i. e. a precept of which we see the
   reasons, and that they hold in the particular case before us; but that
   the latter is positive, i. e. a precept of which we do not see the
   reasons: it is indisputable that our obligations are to obey the
   former; because there is an apparent reason for this preference, and
   none against it. Further, positive institutions, I suppose all those
   which Christianity enjoins, are means to a moral end: and the end must
   be acknowledged more excellent than the means. Nor is observance of
   these institutions any religious obedience at all, or of any value,
   otherwise than as it proceeds from a moral principle. This seems to be
   the strict logical way of stating and determining this matter; but
   will, perhaps, be found less applicable to practice, than may be
   thought at first sight.

   And therefore, in a more practical, though more lax way of
   consideration, and taking the words, moral law and positive
   institutions, in the popular sense; I add, that the whole moral law is
   as much matter of revealed command, as positive institutions are: for
   the Scripture enjoins every moral virtue. In this respect then they are
   both upon a level. But the moral law is, moreover, written upon our
   hearts; interwoven into our very nature. And this is a plain intimation
   of the Author of it, which is to be preferred, when they interfere.

   But there is not altogether so much necessity for the determination of
   this question, as some persons seem to think. Nor are we left to reason
   alone to determine it. For, First, Though mankind have, in all ages,
   been greatly prone to place their religion in peculiar positive rites,
   by way of equivalent for obedience to moral precepts; yet, without
   making any comparison at all between them, and consequently without
   determining Which is to have the preference, the nature of the thing
   abundantly shows all notions of that kind to be utterly subversive of
   true Religion as they are, moreover, contrary to the whole general
   tenor of Scripture; and likewise to the most express particular
   declarations of it, that nothing can render us accepted of God, without
   moral virtue. Secondly, Upon the occasion of mentioning together
   positive and moral duties, the Scripture always puts the stress of
   Religion upon the latter, and never upon the former: which, though no
   sort of allowance to neglect the former, when they do not interfere
   with the latter, yet is a plain intimation, that when they do, the
   latter are to be preferred. And further, as mankind are for placing the
   stress of their religion any where, rather than upon virtue; lest both
   the reason of the thing, and the general spirit of Christianity,
   appearing in the intimation now mentioned, should be ineffectual
   against this prevalent folly: our Lord himself, from whose command
   alone the obligation of positive institutions arises, has taken
   occasion to make the comparison between them and moral precepts; when
   the Pharisees censured him, for eating with publicans and sinners; and
   also when they censured his disciples, for plucking the ears of corn on
   the Sabbath day. Upon this comparison, he has determined expressly, and
   in form, which shall have the preference when they interfere. And by
   delivering his authoritative determination in a proverbial manner of
   expression, he has made it general: I will have mercy, and not
   sacrifice. [135] The propriety of the word proverbial, is not the thing
   insisted upon: though I think the manner of speaking is to be called
   so. But that the manner of speaking very remarkably renders the
   determination general, is surely indisputable. For, had it, in the
   latter case, been said only, that God preferred mercy to the rigid
   observance of the Sabbath; even then, by parity of reason, most justly
   might we have argued, that he preferred mercy likewise, to the
   observance of other ritual institutions; and in general, moral duties,
   to positive ones. And thus the determination would have been general;
   though its being so were inferred and not expressed. But as the passage
   really stands in the Gospel, it is much stronger. For the sense and the
   very literal words of our Lord's answer are as applicable to any other
   instance of a comparison, between positive and moral duties, as to this
   upon which they were spoken. And if, in case of competition, mercy is
   to be preferred to positive institutions, it will scarce be thought,
   that justice is to give place to them. It is remarkable too, that, as
   the words are a quotation from the Old Testament, they are introduced,
   on both the forementioned occasions, with a declaration, that the
   Pharisees did not understand the meaning of them. This, I say, is very
   remarkable. For, since it is scarce possible, for the most ignorant
   person, not to understand the literal sense of the passage, in the
   Prophet;Hos. vi. and since understanding the literal sense would not
   have prevented their condemning the guiltless, [136] it can hardly be
   doubted, that the thing which our Lord really intended in that
   declaration was, that the Pharisees had not learned from it, as they
   might, wherein the general spirit of Religion consists: that it
   consists in moral piety and virtue, as distinguished from forms, and
   ritual observances. However, it is certain we may learn this from his
   divine application of the passage, in the Gospel.

   But, as it is one of the peculiar weaknesses of human nature, when,
   upon a comparison of two things, one is found to be of greater
   importance than the other, to consider this other as of scarce any
   importance at all: it is highly necessary that we remind ourselves, how
   great presumption it is, to make light of any institutions of divine
   appointment; that our obligations to obey all God's commands whatever
   are absolute and indispensable; and that commands merely positive,
   admitted to be from him, lay us under a moral obligation to obey them:
   an obligation moral in the strictest and most proper sense.

   To these things I cannot forbear adding, that the account now given of
   Christianity most strongly shows and enforces upon us the obligation of
   searching the Scriptures, in order to see, what the scheme of
   revelation really is; instead of determining beforehand, from reason,
   what the scheme of it must be. [137] Indeed if in Revelation there be
   found any passages, the seeming meaning of which is contrary to natural
   Religion; we may most certainly conclude, such seeming meaning not to
   be the real one. But it is not any degree of a presumption against an
   interpretation of Scripture, that such interpretation contains a
   doctrine, which the light of nature cannot discover; [138] or a
   precept, which the la of nature does not oblige to.

   [134] This is the distinction between moral and positive precepts
   considered respectively as such. But yet, since the latter have
   somewhat of a moral nature, we may see the reason of them, considered
   in this view. Moral and positive precepts are in some respects alike,
   in other respects different. So far as they are alike, we discern the
   reasons of both; so far as they are different, we discern the reasons
   of the former, but not of the latter. See p. 168, &c., and p. 177.

  CHAP. II.

  OF THE SUPPOSED PRESUMPTION AGAINST A REVELATION CONSIDERED AS MIRACULOUS.

   HAVING shown the importance of the Christian revelation, and the
   obligations which we are under seriously to attend to it, upon
   supposition of its truth, or its credibility: the next thing in order,
   is to consider the supposed presumptions against revelation in general;
   which shall be the subject of this Chapter: and the objections against
   the Christian in particular; which shall be the subject of some
   following ones. [139] For it seems the most natural method, to remove
   the prejudices against Christianity, before we proceed to the
   consideration of the positive evidence for it, and the objections
   against that evidence. [140]

   It is, I think, commonly supposed, that there is some peculiar
   presumption, from the analogy of nature, against the Christian scheme
   of things; at least against miracles; so as that stronger evidence is
   necessary to prove the truth and reality of them, than would be
   sufficient to convince us of other events, or matters of fact. Indeed
   the consideration of this supposed presumption cannot but be thought
   very insignificant, by many persons. Yet, as it belongs to the subject
   of this Treatise; so it may tend to open the mind, and remove some
   prejudices: however needless the consideration of it be, upon its own
   account.

   I. I find no appearance of a presumption, from the analogy of nature,
   against the general scheme of Christianity, that God created and
   invisibly governs the world by Jesus Christ; and by him also will
   hereafter judge it in righteousness, i. e. render to every one
   according to his works; and that good men are under the secret
   influence of his Spirit. Whether these things are, or are not, to be
   called miraculous, is, perhaps, only a question about words; or
   however, is of no moment in the case. If the analogy of nature raises
   any presumption against this general scheme of Christianity, it must
   be, either because it is not discoverable by reason or experience; or
   else, because it is unlike that course of nature, which is. But analogy
   raises no presumption against the truth of this scheme, upon either of
   these accounts.

   First, There is no presumption, from analogy, against the truth of it,
   upon account of its not being discoverable by reason or experience. For
   suppose one who never heard of revelation, of the most improved
   understanding, and acquainted with our whole system of natural
   philosophy and natural religion; such a one could not but be sensible,
   that it was but a very small part of the natural and moral system of
   the universe, which he was acquainted with. He could not but be
   sensible, that there must be innumerable things, in the dispensations
   of Providence past, in the invisible government over the world at
   present carrying on, and in what is to come; of which he was wholly
   ignorant, [141] and which could not be discovered without revelation.
   Whether the scheme of nature be, in the strictest sense, infinite or
   not; it is evidently vast, even beyond all possible imagination. And
   doubtless that part of it, which is opened to our view, is but as a
   point, in comparison of the whole plan of Providence, reaching
   throughout eternity past and future; in comparison of what is even now
   going on in the remote parts of the boundless universe; nay, in
   comparison of the whole scheme of this world. And therefore, that
   things lie beyond the natural reach of our faculties, is no sort of
   presumption against the truth and reality of them: because it is
   certain, there are innumerable things, in the constitution and
   government of the universe, which are thus beyond the natural reach of
   our faculties. Secondly, Analogy raises no presumption against any of
   the things contained in this general doctrine of Scripture now
   mentioned, upon account of their being unlike the known course of
   nature. For there is no presumption at all from analogy, that the whole
   course of things, or divine government, naturally unknown to us, and
   every thing in it, is like to any thing in that which is known; and
   therefore no peculiar presumption against any thing in the former, upon
   account of its being unlike to any thing in the latter. And in the
   constitution and natural government of the world, as well as in the
   moral government of it, we see things, in a great degree, unlike one
   another: and therefore ought not to wonder at such unlikeness between
   things visible and invisible. However, the scheme of Christianity is by
   no means entirely unlike the scheme of nature; as will appear in the
   following part of this Treatise.

   The notion of a miracle, considered as a proof of a divine mission, has
   been stated with great exactness by divines; and is, I think,
   sufficiently understood by every one. There are also invisible
   miracles, the Incarnation of Christ, for instance, which, being secret,
   cannot be alleged as a proof of such a mission; but require themselves
   to be proved by visible miracles. Revelation itself too is miraculous;
   and miracles are the proof of it; and the supposed presumption against
   these shall presently be considered. All which I have been observing
   here is, that, whether we choose to call every thing in the
   dispensations of Providence, not discoverable without revelation, nor
   like the known course of things, miraculous; and whether the general
   Christian dispensation now mentioned is to be called so, or not; the
   foregoing observations seem certainly to show, that there is no
   presumption against it from the analogy of nature.

   II. There is no presumption, from analogy, against some operations,
   which we should now call miraculous; particularly none against a
   revelation at the beginning of the world: nothing of such presumption
   against it, as is supposed to be implied or expressed in the word,
   miraculous. For a miracle, in its very notion, is relative to a course
   of nature; and implies somewhat different from it, considered as being
   so. Now, either there was no course of nature at the time which we are
   speaking of; or if there were, we are not acquainted what the course of
   nature is, upon the first peopling of worlds. And therefore the
   question, whether mankind had a revelation made to them at that time,
   is to be considered, not as a question concerning a miracle, but as a
   common question of fact. And we have the like reason, be it more or
   less, to admit the report of tradition, concerning this question, and
   concerning common matters of fact of the same antiquity; for instance,
   what part of the earth was first peopled.

   Or thus: When mankind was first placed in this state, there was a power
   exerted, totally different from the present course of nature. Now,
   whether this power, thus wholly different from the present course of
   nature, for we cannot properly apply to it the word miraculous; whether
   this power stopped immediately after it had made man, or went on, and
   exerted itself further in giving him a revelation, is a question of the
   same kind, as whether an ordinary power exerted itself in such a
   particular degree and manner, or not.

   Or suppose the power exerted in the formation of the world be
   considered as miraculous, or rather, be called by that name; the case
   will not be different: since it must be acknowledged, that such a power
   was exerted. For supposing it acknowledged, that our Saviour spent some
   years in a course of working miracles: there is no more presumption,
   worth mentioning, against his having exerted this miraculous power, in
   a certain degree greater, than in a certain degree less; in one or two
   more instances, than in ore or two fewer; in this, than in another
   manner.

   It is evident then, that there can be no peculiar presumption, from the
   analogy of nature, against supposing a revelation, when man was first
   placed upon earth.

   Add, that there does not appear the least intimation in history or
   tradition, that Religion was first reasoned out: but the whole of
   history and tradition makes for the other side, that it came into the
   world by revelation. Indeed the state of Religion in the first ages, of
   which we have any account, seems to suppose and imply, that this was
   the original of it amongst mankind. And these reflections together,
   without taking in the peculiar authority of Scripture, amount to real
   and a very material degree of evidence, that there was a revelation at
   the beginning of the world. Now this, as it is a confirmation of
   natural Religion, and therefore mentioned in the former part of this
   Treatise; [142] so likewise it has a tendency to remove any prejudices
   against a subsequent revelation.

   III. But still it may be objected, that there is some peculiar
   presumption, from analogy, against miracles; particularly against
   revelation, after the settlement and during the continuance of a course
   of nature.

   Now with regard to this supposed presumption, it is to be observed in
   general, that before we can have ground for raising what can, with any
   propriety, be called an argument from analogy, for or against
   revelation considered as somewhat miraculous, we must be acquainted
   with a similar or parallel case. But the history of some other world,
   seemingly in like circumstances with our own, is no more than a
   parallel case: and therefore nor thing short of this can be so. Yet,
   could we come at a presumptive proof, for or against a revelation, from
   being informed, whether such world had one, or not; such a proof, being
   drawn from one single instance only, must be infinitely precarious.
   More particularly: First of all; There is a very strong presumption
   against common speculative truths, and against the most ordinary facts,
   before the proof of them; which yet is overcome by almost any proof.
   There is a presumption of millions to one, against the story of Cæsar,
   or of any other man. For suppose a number of common facts so and so
   circumstanced, of which one had no kind of proof, should happen to come
   into one's thoughts; every one would, without any possible doubt,
   conclude them to be false. And the like may be said of a single common
   fact. And from hence it appears, that the question of importance, as to
   the matter before us, is, concerning the degree of the peculiar
   presumption supposed against miracles; not whether there be any
   peculiar presumption at all against them. For, if there be the
   presumption of millions to one, against the most common facts; what can
   a small presumption, additional to this, amount to, though it be
   peculiar? It cannot be estimated, and is as nothing. The only material
   question is, whether there be any such presumption against miracles, as
   to render them in any sort incredible. Secondly, If we leave out the
   consideration of Religion, we are in such total darkness, upon what
   causes, occasions, reasons, or circumstances, the present course of
   nature depends; that there does not appear any improbability for or
   against supposing, that five or six thousand years may have given scope
   for causes, occasions, reasons, or circumstances, from whence
   miraculous interpositions may have arisen. And from this, joined with
   the foregoing observation, it will follow, that there must be a
   presumption, beyond all comparison, greater, against the particular
   common facts just now instanced in, than against miracles in general;
   before any evidence of either. But, Thirdly, Take in the consideration
   of Religion, or the moral system of the world, and then we see distinct
   particular reasons for miracles: to afford mankind instruction
   additional to that of nature, and to attest the truth of it. And this
   gives a real credibility to the supposition, that it might be part of
   the original plan of things, that there should be miraculous
   interpositions. Then, Lastly, Miracles must not be compared to common
   natural events; or to events which, though uncommon, are similar to
   what we daily experience: but to the extraordinary phenomena of nature.
   And then the comparison will be between the presumption against
   miracles, and the presumption against such uncommon appearances,
   suppose, as comets, and against there being any such powers in nature
   as magnetism and electricity, so contrary to the properties of other
   bodies not endued with these powers. And before any one can determine,
   whether there be any peculiar presumption against miracles, more than
   against other extraordinary things; he must consider, what, upon first
   hearing, would be the presumption against the last mentioned
   appearances and powers, to a person acquainted only with the daily,
   monthly, and annual course of nature respecting this earth, and with
   those common powers of matter which we every day see.

   Upon all this I conclude; that there certainly is no such presumption
   against miracles, as to render them in any wise incredible: that, on
   the contrary, our being able to discern reasons for them, gives a
   positive credibility to the history of them, in cases where those
   reasons hold: and that it is by no means certain, that there is any
   peculiar presumption at all, from analogy, even in the lowest degree,
   against miracles, as distinguished from other extraordinary phenomena:
   though it is not worth while to perplex the reader with inquiries into
   the abstract nature of evidence, in order to determine a question,
   which, without such inquiries, we see [143] is of no importance.

  CHAP. III.

  OF OUR INCAPACITY OF JUDGING, WHAT WERE TO BE EXPECTED IN A REVELATION; AND
  THE CREDIBILITY, FROM ANALOGY, THAT IT MUST CONTAIN THINGS APPEARING LIABLE TO
  OBJECTIONS.

   BESIDES the objections against the evidence for Christianity, many are
   alleged against the scheme of it; against the whole manner in which it
   is put and left with the world; as well as against several particular
   relations in Scripture: objections drawn from the deficiencies of
   revelation: from things in it appearing to men foolishness; [144] from
   its containing matters of offence, which have led, and it must have
   been foreseen would lead, into strange enthusiasm and superstition, and
   be made to serve the purposes of tyranny and wickedness; from its not
   being universal; and, which is a thing of the same kind, from its
   evidence not being so convincing and satisfactory as it might have
   been: for this last is sometimes turned into a positive argument
   against its truth. [145] It would be tedious, indeed impossible, to
   enumerate the several particulars comprehended under the objections
   here referred to; they being so various, according to the different
   fancies of men. There are persons who think it a strong objection
   against the authority of Scripture, that it is not composed by rules of
   art, agreed upon by critics, for polite and correct writing. And the
   scorn is inexpressible, with which some of the prophetic parts of
   Scripture are treated: partly through the rashness of interpreters; but
   very much also, on account of the hieroglyphical and figurative
   language, in which they are left us. Some of the principal things of
   this sort shall be particularly considered in the following Chapters.
   But my design at present is to observe in general, with respect to this
   whole way of arguing, that, upon supposition of a revelation, it is
   highly credible beforehand, we should be incompetent judges of it to a
   great degree: and that it would contain many things appearing to us
   liable to great objections; in case we judge of it otherwise, than by
   the analogy of nature. And therefore, though objections against the
   evidence of Christianity are most seriously to be considered; yet
   objections against Christianity itself are, in a great measure,
   frivolous: almost all objections against it, excepting those which are
   alleged against the particular proofs of its coming from God. I express
   myself with caution, lest I should be mistaken to vilify reason; which
   is indeed the only faculty we have wherewith to judge concerning any
   thing, even revelation itself: or be misunderstood to assert, that a
   supposed revelation cannot be proved false, from internal characters.
   For, it may contain clear immoralities or contradictions; and either of
   these would prove it false. Nor will I take upon me to affirm, that
   nothing else can possibly render any supposed revelation incredible.
   Yet still the observation above, is, I think, true beyond doubt; that
   objections against Christianity, as distinguished from objections
   against its evidence, are frivolous. To make out this, is the general
   design of the present Chapter. And with regard to the whole of it, I
   cannot but particularly wish, that the proofs might be attended to;
   rather than the assertions cavilled at, upon account of any
   unacceptable consequences, whether real or supposed, which may be drawn
   from them. For, after all, that which is true, must be admitted, though
   it should show us the shortness of our faculties; and that we are in no
   wise judges of many things, of which we are apt to think ourselves very
   competent ones. Nor will this be any objection with reasonable men, at
   least upon second thought it will not be any objection with such,
   against the justness of the following observations.

   As God governs the world and instructs his creatures, according to
   certain laws or rules, in the known course of nature; known by reason
   together with experience: so the Scripture informs us of a scheme of
   divine Providence, additional to this. It relates, that God has, by
   revelation, instructed men in things concerning his government, which
   they could not otherwise have known; and reminded them of things, which
   they might otherwise know; and attested the truth of the whole by
   miracles. Now if the natural and the revealed dispensation of things
   are both from God, if they coincide with each other, and together make
   up one scheme of Providence; our being incompetent judges of one, must
   render it credible, that we may, be incompetent judges also of the
   other. Since, upon experience, the acknowledged constitution and course
   of nature is found to be greatly different from what, before
   experience, would have been expected; and such as, men fancy, there lie
   great objections against: this renders it beforehand highly credible,
   that they may find the revealed dispensation likewise, if they judge of
   it as they do of the constitution of nature, very different from
   expectations formed beforehand; and liable, in appearance, to great
   objections: objections against the scheme itself, and against the
   degrees and manners of the miraculous interpositions, by which it was
   attested and carried on. Thus, suppose a prince to govern his dominions
   in the wisest manner possible, by common known laws; and that upon some
   exigencies he should suspend these laws; and govern, in several
   instances, in a different manner; if one of his subjects were not a
   competent judge beforehand, by what common rules the government should
   or would be carried on; it could not be expected, that the same person
   would be a competent judge, in what exigencies, or in what manner, or
   to what degree, those laws commonly observed would be suspended or
   deviated from. If he were not a judge of the wisdom of the ordinary
   administration, there is no reason to think he would be a judge of the
   wisdom of the extraordinary. If he thought he had objections against
   the former; doubtless, it is highly supposable, he might think also,
   that he had objections against the latter. And thus, as we fall into
   infinite follies and mistakes, whenever we pretend, otherwise than from
   experience and analogy, to judge of the constitution and course of
   nature; it is evidently supposable beforehand, that we should fall into
   as great, in pretending to judge, in like manner, concerning
   revelation. Nor is there any more ground to expect that this latter
   should appear to us clear of objections, than that the former should.

   These observations, relating to the whole of Christianity, are
   applicable to inspiration in particular. As we are in no sort judges
   beforehand, by what laws or rules, in what degree, or by what means, it
   were to have been expected, that God would naturally instruct us; so
   upon supposition of his affording us light and instruction by
   revelation, additional to what he has afforded us by reason and
   experience, we are in no sort judges, by what methods, and in what
   proportion, it were to be expected that this supernatural light and
   instruction would be afforded us. We know not beforehand, what degree
   or kind of natural information it were to be expected God would afford
   men, each by his own reason and experience: nor how far he would enable
   and effectually dispose them to communicate it, whatever it should be,
   to each other; nor whether the evidence of it would be certain, highly
   probable, or doubtful; nor whether it would be given with equal
   clearness and conviction to all. Nor could we guess, upon any good
   ground I mean, whether natural knowledge, or even the faculty itself,
   by which we are capable of attaining it, reason, would be given us at
   once, or gradually. In like manner, we are wholly ignorant, what degree
   of new knowledge, it were to be expected God would give mankind by
   revelation, upon supposition of his affording one: or how far, or in
   what way he would interpose miraculously, to qualify them, to whom he
   should originally make the revelation, for communicating the knowledge
   given by it; and to secure their doing it to the age in which they
   should live; and to secure its being transmitted to posterity. We are
   equally ignorant, whether the evidence of it would be certain or highly
   probable, or doubtful: [146] or whether all who should have any degree
   of instruction from it, and any degree of evidence of its truth, would
   have the same: or whether the scheme would be revealed at once, or
   unfolded gradually. Nay we are not in any sort able to judge, whether
   it were to have been expected, that the revelation should have been
   committed to writing; or left to be handed down, and consequently
   corrupted, by verbal tradition, and at length sunk under it, if mankind
   so pleased, and during such time as they are permitted, in the degree
   they evidently are, to act as they will.

   But it may be said, "that a revelation in some of the above mentioned
   circumstances, one, for instance, which was not committed to writing,
   and thus secured against danger of corruption, would not have answered
   its purpose." I ask, what purpose? It would not have answered all the
   purposes, which it has now answered, and in the same degree: but it
   would have answered others, or the same in different degrees. And which
   of these were the purposes of God, and best fell in with his general
   government, we could not at all have determined beforehand.

   Now since it has been shown, that we have no principles of reason, upon
   which to judge beforehand, how it were to be expected revelation should
   have been left, or what was most suitable to the divine plan of
   government, ill any of the forementioned respects; it must be quite
   frivolous to object afterward as to any of them, against its being left
   in one way, rather than another: for this would be to object against
   things, upon account of their being different from expectations, which
   have been shown to be without reason. And thus we see, that the only
   question concerning the truth of Christianity is, whether it be a real
   revelation; not whether it be attended with every circumstance which we
   should have looked for: and concerning the authority of Scripture,
   whether it be what it claims to be; not whether it be a book of such
   sort, and so promulged, as weak men are apt to fancy a book containing
   a divine revelation should. And therefore, neither obscurity, nor
   seeming inaccuracy of style, nor various readings, nor early disputes
   about the authors of particular parts; nor any other things of the like
   kind, though they had been much more considerable in degree than they
   are, could overthrow the authority of the Scripture: unless the
   Prophets, Apostles, or our Lord, had promised, that the book containing
   the divine revelation should be secure from those things. Nor indeed
   can any objections overthrow such a kind of revelation as the Christian
   claims to be, since there are no objections against the morality of it,
   [147] but such as call show, that there is no proof of miracles wrought
   originally in attestation of it; no appearance of any thing miraculous
   in its obtaining in the world; nor any of prophecy, that is, of events
   foretold, which human sagacity could not foresee. If it can be shown,
   that the proof alleged for all these is absolutely none at all, then is
   revelation overturned. But were it allowed, that the proof of any one
   or all of them is lower than is allowed; yet, whilst any proof of them
   remains, revelation will stand upon much the same foot it does at
   present, as to all the purposes of life and practice, and ought to have
   the like, influence upon our behaviour.

   From the foregoing observations too, it will follow, and those who will
   thoroughly examine into revelation will find it worth remarking; that
   there are several ways or arguing, which, though just with regard to
   other writings, are not applicable to Scripture: at least not to the
   prophetic parts of it. We cannot argue, for instance, that this cannot
   be the sense or intent of such a passage of Scripture; for, if it had,
   it would have been expressed more plainly, or have been represented
   under a more apt figure or hieroglyphic: yet we may justly argue thus,
   with respect to common books. And the reason of this difference is very
   evident; that in Scripture we are not competent judges, as we are in
   common books, how plainly it were to have been expected, what is the
   true sense should have been expressed, or under how apt an image
   figured. The only question is, what appearance there is, that this is
   the sense; and scarce at all, how much more determinately or accurately
   it might have been expressed or figured.

   "But is it not self-evident, that internal improbabilities of all kinds
   weaken external probable proof?" Doubtless. But to what practical
   purpose can this be alleged here, when it has been proved before, [148]
   that real internal improbabilities, which rise even to moral certainty,
   are overcome by the most ordinary testimony; and when it now has been
   made appear, that we scarce know what are improbabilities, as to the
   matter we are here considering: as it will further appear from what
   follows.

   For though from the observations above made it is manifest, that we are
   not in any sort competent judges, what supernatural instruction were to
   have been expected; and though it is self-evident, that the objections
   of an incompetent judgment must be frivolous; yet it may be proper to
   go one step further, and observe; that if men will be regardless of
   these things, and pretend to judge of the Scripture by preconceived
   expectations; the analogy of nature shows beforehand, not only that it
   is highly credible they may, but also probable that they will, imagine
   they have strong objections against it, however really unexceptionable:
   for so, prior to experience, they would think they had, against the
   circumstances, and degrees, and the whole manner of that instruction,
   which is afforded by the ordinary course of nature. Were the
   instruction which God affords to brute creatures by instincts and mere
   propensions, and to mankind by these together with reason, matter of
   probable proof, and not of certain observation; it would be rejected as
   incredible, in many instances of it, only upon account of the means by
   which this instruction is given, the seeming disproportions, the
   limitations, necessary conditions, and circumstances of it. For
   instance: would it not have been thought highly improbable, that men
   should have been so much more capable of discovering, even to certainty
   the general laws of matter, and the magnitudes, paths, and revolutions,
   of heavenly bodies; than the occasions and cures of distempers, and
   many other things, in which human life seems so much more nearly
   concerned, than in astronomy? How capricious and irregular a way of
   information would it be said, is that of invention, by means of which
   nature instructs us in matters of science, and in many things, upon
   which the affairs of the world greatly depend: that a man should, by
   this faculty, be made acquainted with a thing in an instant, when
   perhaps he is thinking of somewhat else, which he has in vain been
   searching after, it may be, for years. So likewise the imperfections
   attending the only method, by which nature enables and directs us to
   communicate our thoughts to each other, are innumerable. Language is,
   in its very nature, inadequate, ambiguous, liable to infinite abuse,
   even from negligence; and so liable to it from design, that every man
   can deceive and betray by it. And, to mention but one instance more;
   that brutes, without reason, should act, in many respects, with a
   sagacity and foresight vastly greater than what men have in those
   respects, would be thought impossible. Yet it is certain they do act
   with such superior foresight: whether it be their own, indeed, is
   another question. From these things, it is highly credible beforehand,
   that upon supposition God should afford men some additional instruction
   by revelation, it would be with circumstances, in manners, degrees, and
   respects, which we should be apt to fancy we had great objections
   against the credibility of. Nor are the objections against the
   Scripture, nor against Christianity in general, at all more or greater,
   than the analogy of nature would beforehand--not perhaps give ground to
   expect; for this analogy may not be sufficient, in some cases, to
   ground an expectation upon; but no more nor greater, than analogy would
   show it, beforehand, to be supposable and credible, that there might
   seem to lie against revelation.

   By applying these general observations to a particular objection, it
   will be more distinctly seen, how they are applicable to others of the
   like kind: and indeed to almost all objections against Christianity, as
   distinguish from objections against its evidence. It appears from
   Scripture, that, as it was not unusual in the apostolic age, for
   persons, upon their conversion to Christianity, to be endued with
   miraculous gifts; so, some of those persons exercised these gifts in a
   strangely irregular and disorderly manner; and this is made an
   objection against their being really miraculous. Now the foregoing
   observations quite remove this objection, how considerable soever it
   may appear at first sight. For, consider a person endued with any of
   these gifts; for instance, that of tongues: it is to be supposed, that
   he had the same power over this miraculous gift, as he would have had
   over it, had it been the effect of habit, of study and use, as it
   ordinarily is; or the same power over it, as he had over any other
   natural endowment. Consequently, he would use it in the same manner he
   did any other; either regularly, and upon proper occasions only, or
   irregularly, and upon improper ones: according to his sense of decency,
   and his character of prudence. Where then is the objection? Why, if
   this miraculous power was indeed given to the world to propagate
   Christianity, and attest the truth of it, we might, it seems, have
   expected, that other sort of persons should have been chosen to be
   invested with it; or that these should, at the same time, have beer.
   endued with prudence; or that they should have been continually
   restrained and directed in the exercise of it: i. e. that God should
   have miraculously interposed, if at all, in a different manner, or
   higher degree. But, from the observations made above, it is undeniably
   evident, that we are not judges in what degrees and manners it were to
   have been expected he should miraculously interpose; upon supposition
   of his doing it in some degree and manner. Nor, in the natural course
   of Providence, are superior gifts of memory, eloquence, knowledge, and
   other talents of great influence, conferred only on persons of prudence
   and decency, or such as are disposed to make the properest use of them.
   Nor is the instruction and admonition naturally afforded us for the
   conduct of life, particularly in our education, commonly given in a
   manner the most suited to recommend it; but often with circumstances
   apt to prejudice us against such instruction.

   One might go on to add, that there is a great resemblance between the
   light of nature and of revelation, in several other respects. Practical
   Christianity, or that faith and behaviour which renders a man a
   Christian, is a plain and obvious thing: like the common rules of
   conduct, with respect to our ordinary Temporal affairs. The more
   distinct and particular knowledge of those things, the study of which
   the Apostle calls going on unto perfection, [149] and of the prophetic
   parts of revelation, like many parts of natural and even civil
   knowledge, may require very exact thought, and careful consideration.
   The hinderances too, of natural, and of supernatural light and
   knowledge, have been of the same kind. And as it is owned the whole
   scheme of Scripture is not yet understood; so, if it ever comes to be
   understood, before the restitution of all things, [150] and without
   miraculous interpositions; it must be in the same way as natural
   knowledge is come at: by the continuance and progress of learning and
   of liberty; and by particular persons attending to, comparing, and
   pursuing, intimations scattered up and down it, which are overlooked
   and disregarded by the generality of the world. For this is the way, in
   which all improvements are made; by thoughtful men's tracing on obscure
   hints, as it were, dropped us by nature accidentally, or which seem to
   come into our minds by chance. Nor is it at all incredible, that a
   book, which has been. so long in the possession of mankind, should
   contain many truths as yet undiscovered. For, all the same phenomena,
   and the same faculties of investigation, from which such great
   discoveries in natural knowledge have been made in the present and last
   age, were equally in the possession of mankind, several thousand years
   before. And possibly it might be intended, that events, as they come to
   pass, should open and ascertain the meaning of several parts of
   Scripture.

   It may be objected, that this analogy fails in a material respect: for
   that natural knowledge is of little or no consequence. But I have been
   speaking of the general instruction which nature does or does not
   afford us. And besides, some parts of natural knowledge, in the more
   common restrained sense of the words, are of the greatest consequence
   to the ease and convenience of life. But suppose the analogy did, as it
   does not, fail in this respect; yet it might be abundantly supplied,
   from the whole constitution and course of nature: which shows, that God
   does not dispense his gifts according to our notions of the advantage
   and consequence they would be of to us. And this in general, with his
   method of dispensing knowledge in particular, would together make out
   an analogy full to the point before us.

   But it may be objected still further and more generally; "The Scripture
   represents the world as in a state of ruin, and Christianity as an
   expedient to recover it, to help in these respects where nature fails:
   in particular, to supply the deficiencies of natural light. Is it
   credible then, that so many ages should have been let pass, before a
   matter of such a sort, of so great and so general importance, was made
   known to mankind; and then that it should be made known to so small a
   part of them? Is it conceivable, that this supply should be so very
   deficient, should have the like obscurity and doubtfulness, be liable
   to the like perversions, in short, lie open to all the like objections,
   as the light of nature itself? [151] Without determining how far this,
   in fact, is so, I answer; it is by no means incredible, that it might
   be so, if the light of nature and of revelation be from the same hand.
   Men are naturally liable to diseases: for which God, in his good
   providence, has provided natural remedies. [152] But remedies existing
   in nature have been unknown to mankind for many ages: are known but to
   few now: probably many valuable ones are not known yet. Great has been
   and is the obscurity and difficulty, in the nature and application of
   them. Circumstances seem often to make them very improper, where they
   are absolutely necessary. It is after long labour and study, and many
   unsuccessful endeavours, that they are brought to be as useful as they
   are; after high contempt and absolute rejection of the most useful we
   have; and after disputes and doubts, which have seemed to be endless.
   The best remedies too, when unskilfully, much more if dishonestly
   applied, may produce new diseases; and with the rightest application
   the success of them is often doubtful. In many cases they are not at
   all effectual: where they are, it is often very slowly: and the
   application of them, and the necessary regimen accompanying it, is, not
   uncommonly, so disagreeable, that some will not submit to them; and
   satisfy themselves with the excuse, that, if they would, it is not
   certain whether it would be successful. And many persons, who labour
   under diseases, for which there are known natural remedies, are not so
   happy as to be always, if ever, in the way of them. In a word, the
   remedies which nature has provided for diseases are neither certain,
   perfect, nor universal. And indeed the same principles of arguing,
   which would lead us to conclude, that they must be so, would lead us
   likewise to conclude, that there could be no occasion for them; i. e.
   that there could be no diseases at all. And therefore our experience
   that there are diseases shows, that it is credible beforehand, upon
   supposition nature has provided remedies for them, that these remedies
   may be, as by experience we find they are, not certain, nor perfect,
   nor universal; because it shows, that the principles upon which we
   should expect the contrary are fallacious.

   And now, what is the just consequence from all these things? Not that
   reason is no judge of what is offered to us as being of divine
   revelation. For this would be to infer that we are unable to judge of
   any thing, because we are unable to judge of all things. Reason can,
   and it ought to judge, not only of the meaning, but also of the
   morality and the evidence of revelation. First, It is the province of
   reason to judge of the morality of the Scripture; i. e. not whether it
   contains things different from what we should have expected from a
   wise, just, and good Being; for objections from hence have been now
   obviated: but whether it contains things plainly contradictory to
   wisdom, justice, or goodness; to what the light of nature teaches us of
   God. And I know nothing of this sort objected against Scripture,
   excepting such objections as are formed upon suppositions, which I
   would equally conclude, that the constitution of nature is
   contradictory to wisdom, justice or goodness; which most certainly it
   is not. Indeed there are some particular precepts in Scripture, given
   to particular persons, requiring actions, which would be immoral and
   vicious, were it not for such precepts. But it is easy to see, that all
   these are of such a kind, as that the precept changes the whole nature
   of the case and of the action; and both constitutes and shows that not
   to be unjust or immoral, which, prior to the precept, must have
   appeared and really have been so: which may well be, since none of
   these precepts are contrary to immutable morality. If it were
   commanded, to cultivate the principles, and act from the spirit of
   treachery, ingratitude, cruelty; the command would not alter the nature
   of the case or of the action, in any of these instances. But it is
   quite otherwise in precepts, which require only the doing an external
   action: for instance, taking away the property, or life of any. For men
   have no right to either life or property, but what arises solely from
   the grant of God: when this grant is revoked, they cease to have any
   right at all in either: and when this revocation is made known, as
   surely it is possible it may be, it must cease to be unjust to deprive
   them of either. And though a course of external acts, which without
   command would be immoral, must make an immoral habit; yet a few
   detached commands have no such natural tendency. I thought proper to
   say thus much of the few Scripture precepts, which require, not vicious
   actions, but actions which would have been vicious, had it not been for
   such precepts; because they are sometimes weakly urged as immoral, and
   great weight is laid upon objections drawn from them. But to me there
   seems no difficulty at all in these precepts, but what arises from
   their being offences: i. e. from their being liable to be perverted, as
   indeed they are, by wicked designing men, to serve the most horrid
   purposes; and, perhaps, to mislead the weak and enthusiastic. And
   objections from this head are not objections against revelation; but
   against the whole notion of religion, as a trial: and against the
   general constitution of nature. Secondly, Reason is able to judge, and
   must, of the evidence of revelation, and of the objections urged
   against that evidence: which shall be the subject of a following
   Chapter. [153]

   But the consequence of the foregoing observations is, that the question
   upon which the truth of Christianity depends is scarce at all, what
   objections there are against its scheme, since there are none against
   the morality of it; but what objections there are against its evidence;
   or, what proof there remains of it, after due allowances made for the
   objections against that proof: because it has been shown, that the
   objections against Christianity, as distinguished from objections
   against its evidence, are frivolous. For surely very little weight, if
   any at all, is to be laid upon a way of arguing and objecting, which,
   when applied to the general constitution of nature, experience shows
   not to be conclusive: and such, I think, is the whole way of objecting
   treated of throughout this Chapter. It is resolvable into principles,
   and goes upon suppositions, which mislead us to think, that the Author
   of Nature would not act, as we experience he does; or would act, in
   such and such cases, as we experience he does not in like cases. But
   the unreasonableness of this way of objecting will appear yet more
   evidently from hence, that the chief things thus objected against are
   justified, as shall be further shown, [154] by distinct, particular,
   and full analogies, in the constitution and course of nature.

   But it is to be remembered, that, as frivolous as objections of the
   foregoing sort against revelation are, yet, when a supposed revelation
   is more consistent with itself, and has a more general and uniform
   tendency to promote virtue, than, all circumstances considered, could
   have been expected from enthusiasm and political views; this is a
   presumptive proof of its not proceeding from them, and so of its truth:
   because we are competent judges, what might have been expected from
   enthusiasm and political views.

  CHAP. IV.

  OF CHRISTIANITY, CONSIDERED AS A SCHEME OR CONSTITUTION, IMPERFECTLY
  COMPREHENDED.

   IT hath been now shown, [155] that the analogy of nature renders it
   highly credible beforehand, that, supposing a revelation to be made, it
   must contain many things very different from what we should have
   expected, and such as appear open to great objections: and that this
   observation, in good measure, takes off the force of those objections,
   or rather precludes them. But it may be alleged, that this is a very
   partial answer to such objections, or a very unsatisfactory way of
   obviating them: because it doth not show at all, that the things
   objected against can be wise, just, and good; much less, that it is
   credible they are so. It will therefore be proper to show this
   distinctly; by applying to these objections against the wisdom,
   justice, and goodness of Christianity, the answer above [156] given to
   the like objections against the constitution of Nature: before we
   consider the particular analogies in the latter, to the particular
   things objected against in the former. Now that which affords a
   sufficient answer to objections against the wisdom, justice, and
   goodness of the constitution of Nature, is its being a constitution, a
   system, or scheme, imperfectly comprehended; a scheme in which means
   are made use of to accomplish ends; and which is carried on by general
   laws. For from these things it has been proved, not only to be
   possible, but also to be credible, that those things which are objected
   against may be consistent with wisdom, justice, and goodness; nay, may
   be instances of them: and even that the constitution and government of
   Nature may be perfect in the highest possible degree. If Christianity
   then be a scheme, and of the like kind; it is evident, the like
   objections against it must admit of the like answer. And,

   I. Christianity is a scheme, quite beyond our comprehension. The moral
   government of God is exercised, by gradually conducting things so in
   the course of his providence, that every one, at length and upon the
   whole, shall receive according to his deserts; and neither fraud nor
   violence, but truth and right, shall finally prevail. Christianity is a
   particular scheme under this general plan of Providence, and a part of
   it, conducive to its completion, with regard to mankind: consisting
   itself also of various parts, and a mysterious economy, which has been
   carrying on from the time the world came into its present wretched
   state, and is still carrying on, for its recovery, by a divine person,
   the Messiah; who is to gather together in one the children of God, that
   are scattered abroad, [157] and establish an everlasting kingdom,
   wherein dwelleth righteousness. [158] And in order to it; after various
   manifestations of things, relating to this great and general scheme of
   Providence, through a succession of many ages: (For the Spirit of
   Christ which was in the prophets, testified beforehand his sufferings,
   and the glory that should follow: unto whom it was revealed, that not
   unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things which are now
   reported unto us by them that have preached the Gospel; which things
   the angels desire to look into: [159] )--after various dispensations
   looking forward and preparatory to, this final salvation: in the
   fulness of time, when infinite wisdom thought fit; He, being in the
   form of God,--made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form
   of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in
   fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death,
   even the death of the cross: wherefore God also hath highly exalted
   him, and given him a name, which is above every name: that at the name
   of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in the
   earth, and things under the earth: and that every tongue should
   confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
   [160] Parts likewise of this economy are the miraculous mission of the
   Holy Ghost, and his ordinary assistances given to good men: the
   invisible government, which Christ at present exercises over his
   church: that which he himself refers to in these words; In my Father's
   house are many mansions--I go to prepare a place for you: [161] and his
   future return to judge the world in righteousness, and completely
   re-establish the kingdom of God. For the Father judgeth no man; but
   hath committed all judgment unto the Son: that all men should honour
   the Son, even as they honour the Father. [162] All power is given unto
   him in heaven and in earth. [163] And he must reign, till he hath put
   all enemies under his feet. Then cometh the end, when he shall have
   delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have
   put down all rule, and all authority and power. And when all things
   shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject
   unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.
   [164] Now little, surely, need be said to show, that this system, or
   scheme of things, is but imperfectly comprehended by us. The Scripture
   expressly asserts it to be so. And indeed one cannot read a passage
   relating to this great mystery of godliness, [165] but what immediately
   runs up into something which shows us our ignorance in it; as every
   thing in nature shows us our ignorance in the constitution of nature.
   And whoever will seriously consider that part of the Christian scheme,
   which is revealed in Scripture, will find so much more unrevealed, as
   will convince him, that, to all the purposes of judging and objecting,
   we know as little of it, as of the constitution of nature. Our
   ignorance, therefore, is as much an answer to our objections against
   the perfection of one, as against the perfection of the other. [166]

   II. It is obvious too, that in the Christian dispensation, as much as
   in the natural scheme of things, means are made use of to accomplish
   ends. And the observation of this furnishes us with the same answer, to
   objections against the perfection of Christianity, as to objections of
   the like kind, against the constitution of nature. It shows the
   credibility, that the things objected against, how foolish1 Cor. i.
   soever they appear to men, may be the very best means of accomplishing
   the very best ends. And their appearing foolishness is no presumption
   against this, in a scheme so greatly beyond our comprehension. [167]

   III. The credibility, that the Christian dispensation may have been,
   all along, carried on by general laws, [168] no less than the course of
   nature, may require to be more distinctly made out. Consider then, upon
   what ground it is we say, that the whole common course of nature is
   carried on according to general fore-ordained laws. We know indeed
   several of the general laws of matter: and a great part of the natural
   behaviour of living agents is reducible to general laws. But we know in
   a manner nothing, by what laws, storms and tempests, earthquakes,
   famine, pestilence, become the instruments of destruction to mankind.
   And the laws, by which persons born into the world at such a time and
   place are of such capacities, geniuses, tempers; the laws, by which
   thoughts come into our mind, in a multitude of cases; and by which
   innumerable things happen, of the greatest influence upon the affairs
   and state of the world; these laws are so wholly unknown to us, that we
   call the events, which come to pass by them, accidental: though all
   reasonable men know certainly, that there cannot, in reality, be any
   such thing as chance; and conclude, that the things which have this
   appearance are the result of general laws, and may be reduced into
   them. It is then but an exceeding little way, and in but a very few
   respects, that we can trace up the natural course of things before us,
   to general laws. And it is only from analogy, that we conclude the
   whole of it to be capable of being reduced into them: only from our
   seeing, that part is so. It is from our finding, that the course of
   nature, in some respects and so far, goes on by general laws, that we
   conclude this of the rest. And if that be a just ground for such a
   conclusion, it is a just ground also, if not to conclude, yet to
   apprehend, to render it supposable and credible, which is sufficient
   for answering objections, that God's miraculous interpositions may have
   been, all along in like manner, by general laws of wisdom. Thus, that
   miraculous powers should be exerted, at such times, upon such
   occasions, in such degrees and manners, and with regard to such
   persons, rather than others; that the affairs of the world, being
   permitted to go on in their natural course so far, should, just at such
   a point, have a new direction given them by miraculous interpositions;
   that these interpositions should be exactly in such degrees and
   respects only; all this may have been by general laws. These laws are
   unknown indeed to us: but no more unknown than the laws from whence it
   is, that some die as soon as they are born, and others live to extreme
   old age; that one man is so superior to another in understanding; with
   innumerable more things, which, as was before observed, we cannot
   reduce to any laws or rules at all, though it is taken for granted,
   they are as much reducible to general ones, as gravitation. Now, if the
   revealed dispensations of Providence, and miraculous interpositions, be
   by general laws, as well as God's ordinary government in the course of
   nature, made known by reason and experience; there is no more reason to
   expect that every exigence, as it arises, should be provided for by
   these general laws or miraculous interpositions, than that every
   exigence in nature should, by the general laws of nature: yet there
   might be wise and good reasons, that miraculous interpositions should
   be by general laws; and that these laws should not be broken in upon,
   or deviated from, by other miracles.

   Upon the whole, then, the appearance of deficiencies and irregularities
   in nature is owing to its being a scheme but in part made known, and of
   such a certain particular kind in other respects. Now we see no more
   reason why the frame and course of nature should be such a scheme, than
   why Christianity should. And that the former is such a scheme, renders
   it credible, that the latter, upon supposition of its truth, may be so
   too. And as it is manifest, that Christianity is a scheme revealed but
   in part, and a scheme in which means are made use of to accomplish
   ends, like to that of nature: so the credibility, that it may have been
   all along carried on by general laws, no less than the course of
   nature, has been distinctly proved. And from all this it is beforehand
   credible that there might, I think probable that there would, be the
   like appearance of deficiencies and irregularities in Christianity, as
   in nature: i. e. that Christianity would be liable to the like
   objections, as the frame of nature. And these objections are answered
   by these observations concerning Christianity; as the like objections
   against the frame of nature are answered by the like observations
   concerning the frame of nature.

   The objections against Christianity, considered as a matter of fact,
   [169] having, in general, been obviated in the preceding Chapter; and
   the same, considered as made against the wisdom and goodness of it,
   having been obviated in this: the next thing, according to the method
   proposed, is to show, that the principal objections, in particular,
   against Christianity, may be answered, by particular and full analogies
   in nature. And as one of them is made against the whole scheme of it
   together, as just now described, I choose to consider it here, rather
   than in a distinct Chapter by itself. The thing objected against this
   scheme of the Gospel is, "that it seems to suppose God was reduced to
   the necessity of a long series of intricate means, in order to
   accomplish his ends, the recovery and salvation of the world: in like
   sort as men, for want of understanding or power, not being able to come
   at their ends directly, are forced to go round-about ways, and make use
   of many perplexed contrivances to arrive at them." Now every thing
   which we see shows the folly of this, considered as an objection
   against the truth of Christianity. For, according to our manner of
   conception, God makes use of variety of means, what we often think
   tedious ones, in the natural course of providence, for the
   accomplishment of all his ends. Indeed it is certain there is somewhat
   in this matter quite beyond our comprehension: but the mystery is as
   great in nature as in Christianity. We know what we ourselves aim at,
   as final ends: and what courses we take, merely as means conducing to
   those ends. But we are greatly ignorant how far things are considered
   by the Author of Nature, under the single notion of means and ends; so
   as that it may be said, this is merely an end, and that merely means,
   in his regard. And whether there be not some peculiar absurdity in our
   very manner of conception, concerning this matter, somewhat
   contradictory arising from our extremely imperfect views of things, it
   is impossible to say. However, thus much is manifest, that the whole
   natural world and government of it is a scheme or system; not a fixed,
   but a progressive one: a scheme in which the operation of various means
   takes up a great length of time, before the ends they tend to can be
   attained. The change of seasons, the ripening of the fruits of the
   earth, the very history of a flower, is an instance of this: and so is
   human life. Thus vegetable bodies, and those of animals, though
   possibly formed at once, yet grow up by degrees to a mature state. And
   thus rational agents, who animate these latter bodies, are naturally
   directed to form each his own manners and character, by the gradual
   gaining of knowledge and experience, and by a long course of action.
   Our existence is not only successive, as it must be of necessity; but
   one state of our life and being is appointed by God, to be a
   preparation for another; and that to be the means of attaining to
   another succeeding one: infancy to childhood; childhood to youth; youth
   to mature age. Men are impatient, and for precipitating things: but the
   Author of Nature appears deliberate throughout his operations;
   accomplishing his natural ends by slow successive steps. And there is a
   plan of things beforehand laid out, which, from the nature of it,
   requires various systems of means, as well as length of time, in order
   to the carrying on its several parts into execution. Thus, in the daily
   course of natural providence, God operates in the very same manner, as
   in the dispensation of Christianity; making one thing subservient to
   another; this, to somewhat further; and soon, through a progressive
   series of means, which extend, both backward and forward, beyond our
   utmost view. Of this manner of operation, every thing we see in the
   course of nature is as much an instance, as any part of the Christian
   dispensation.

  CHAP. V.

  OF THE PARTICULAR SYSTEM OF CHRISTIANITY; THE APPOINTMENT OF A MEDIATOR, AND
  THE REDEMPTION OF THE WORLD BY HIM.

   THERE is not, I think, any thing relating to Christianity, which has
   been more objected against, than the mediation of Christ, in some or
   other of its parts. Yet upon thorough consideration, there seems
   nothing less justly liable to it. For,

   I. The whole analogy of nature removes all imagined presumption against
   the general notion of a Mediator between God and man. [170] For we find
   all living creatures are brought into the world, and their life in
   infancy is preserved, by the instrumentality of others: and every
   satisfaction of it, some way or other, is bestowed by the like means.
   So that the visible government, which God exercises over the world, is
   by the instrumentality and mediation of others. And how far his
   invisible government be or be not so, it is impossible to determine at
   all by reason. And the supposition, that part of it is so, appears, to
   say the least, altogether as credible, as the contrary. There is then
   no sort of objection, from the light of nature, against the general
   notion of a mediator between God and man, considered as a doctrine of
   Christianity, or as an appointment in this dispensation: since we find
   by experience, that God does appoint mediators, to be the instruments
   of good and evil to us: the instruments of his justice and his mercy.
   And the objection here referred to is urged, not against mediation in
   that high, eminent, and peculiar sense, in which Christ is our
   mediator; but absolutely against the whole notion itself of a mediator
   at all.

   II. As we must suppose, that the world is under the proper moral
   government of God, or in a state of religion, before we can enter into
   consideration of the revealed doctrine concerning the redemption of it
   by Christ: so that supposition is here to be distinctly taken notice
   of. Now the divine moral government which religion teaches us, implies,
   that the consequence of vice shall be misery, in some future state, by
   the righteous judgment of God. That such consequent punishment shall
   take effect by his appointment, is necessarily implied. But, as it is
   not in any sort to be supposed, that we are made acquainted with all
   the ends or reasons, for which it is fit future punishments should be
   inflicted, or why God has appointed such and such consequent misery
   should follow vice; and as we are altogether in the dark, how or in
   what manner it shall follow, by what immediate occasions, or by the
   instrumentality of what means; there is no absurdity in supposing it
   may follow in a way analogous to that, in which many miseries follow
   such and such courses of action at present; poverty, sickness, infamy,
   untimely death by diseases, death from the hands of civil justice.
   There is no absurdity in supposing future punishment may follow
   wickedness of course, as we speak, or in the way of natural consequence
   from God's original constitution of the world: from the nature he has
   given us, and from the condition in which he places us; or in a like
   manner, as a person rashly trifling upon a precipice, in the way of
   natural consequence, falls down; in the way of natural consequence,
   breaks his limbs, suppose; in the way of natural consequence of this,
   without help, perishes.

   Some good men may perhaps be offended with hearing it spoken of as a
   supposable thing that future punishments of wickedness may be in the
   way of natural consequence: as if this were taking the execution of
   justice out of the hands of God, and giving it to nature. But they
   should remember, that when things come to pass according to the course
   of nature, this does not hinder them from being his doing, who is the
   God of nature: and that the Scripture ascribes those punishments to
   divine justice, which are known to be natural; and which must be called
   so, when distinguished from such as are miraculous. But after all, this
   supposition, or rather this way of speaking, is here made use of only
   by way of illustration of the subject before us.. For since it must be
   admitted, that the future punishment of wickedness is not a matter of
   arbitrary appointment, but of reason, equity, and justice; it comes,
   for ought I see, to the same thing, whether it is supposed to be
   inflicted in a way analogous to that, in which the temporal punishments
   of vice and folly are inflicted, or in any other way. And though there
   were a difference, it is allowable, in the present case, to make this
   supposition, plainly not an incredible one; that future punishment may
   follow wickedness in the way of natural consequence, or according to
   some general laws of government already established in the universe.

   III. Upon this supposition, or even without it, we may observe
   somewhat, much to the present purpose, in the constitution of nature or
   appointments of Providence. the provision which is made, that all the
   bad natural consequences of men's actions should not always actually
   follow; or that such bad consequences, as, according to the settled
   course of things, would inevitably have followed if not prevented,
   should, in certain degrees, be prevented. We are apt presumptuously to
   imagine, that the world might have been so constituted, as that there
   would not have been any such thing as m;sery or evil. On the contrary
   we find the Author of Nature permits it: but then he has provided
   reliefs, and in many cases perfect remedies for it, after some pains
   and difficulties; reliefs and remedies even for that evil, which is the
   fruit of our own misconduct; and which, in the course of nature, would
   have continued, and ended in our destruction, but for such remedies.
   And this is an instance both of severity and of indulgence, in the
   constitution of nature. Thus all the bad consequences, now mentioned,
   of a man's trifling upon a precipice, might be prevented. And though
   all were not, yet some of them might, by proper interposition, if not
   rejected: by another's coming to the rash man's relief, with his own
   laying hold on that relief, in such sort as the case required. Persons
   may do a great deal themselves towards preventing the bad consequences
   of their follies: and more may be done by themselves, together with the
   assistance of others their fellow creatures; which assistance nature
   requires and prompts us to. This is the general constitution of the
   world. Now suppose it had been so constituted, that after such actions
   were done, as were foreseen naturally to draw after them misery to the
   doer, it should have been no more in human power to have prevented that
   naturally consequent misery, in any instance, than it is in all: no one
   can say, whether such a more severe constitution of things might not
   yet have been really good. But, that, on the contrary, provision is
   made by nature, that we may and do, to so great degree, prevent the bad
   natural effects of our follies; this may be called mercy or compassion
   in the original constitution of the world: compassion, as distinguished
   from goodness in general. And, the whole known constitution and course
   of things affording us instances of such compassion, it would be
   according to the analogy of nature, to hope, that, however ruinous the
   natural consequences of vice might be, from the general laws of God's
   government over the universe; yet provision might be made, possibly
   might have been originally made, for preventing those ruinous
   consequences from inevitably following: at least from following
   universally, and in all cases.

   Many, I am sensible, will wonder at finding this made a question, or
   spoken of as in any degree doubtful. The generality of mankind are so
   far from having that awful sense of things, which the present state of
   vice and misery and darkness seems to make but reasonable, that they
   have scarce any apprehension or thought at all about this matter, any
   way: and some serious persons may have spoken unadvisedly concerning
   it. But let us observe, what we experience to be, and what, from the
   very constitution of nature, cannot but be, the consequences of
   irregular and disorderly behaviour: even of such rashness, wilfulness,
   neglects, as we scarce call vicious. Now it is natural to apprehend,
   that the bad consequences of irregularity will be greater, in
   proportion as the irregularity is so. And there is no comparison
   between these irregularities, and the greater instances of vice, or a
   dissolute profligate disregard to all religion; if there be any thing
   at all in religion. For consider what it is for creatures, moral
   agents, presumptuously to introduce that confusion and misery into the
   kingdom of God, which mankind have in fact introduced: to blaspheme the
   Sovereign Lord of all; to contemn his authority; to be injurious, to
   the degree they are, to their fellow creatures, the creatures of God.
   Add that the effects of vice in the present world are often extreme
   misery, irretrievable ruin, and even death: and upon putting all this
   together, it will appear, that as no one can say, in what degree fatal
   the unprevented consequences of vice may be, according to the general
   rule of divine government; so it is by no means intuitively certain,
   how far these consequences could possibly, in the nature of the thing,
   be prevented, consistently with the eternal rule of right, or with what
   is, in fact, the moral constitution of nature. However, there would be
   large ground to hope, that the universal government was not so severely
   strict, but that there was room for pardon, or for having those penal
   consequences prevented. Yet,

   IV. There seems no probability, that any thing we could do would alone
   and of itself prevent them: prevent their following, or being
   inflicted. But one would think at least, it were impossible that the
   contrary should be thought certain. For we are not acquainted with the
   whole of the case. We are not informed of all the reasons, which render
   it fit that future punishments should be inflicted: and therefore
   cannot know, whether any thing we could do would make such an
   alteration, as to render it fit that they should be remitted. We do not
   know what the whole natural or appointed consequences of vice are; nor
   in what way they would follow, if not prevented: and therefore can in
   no sort say, whether we could do any thing which would be sufficient to
   prevent them. Our ignorance being thus manifest, let us recollect the
   analogy of Nature or Providence. For, though this may be but a slight
   ground to raise a positive opinion upon, in this matter; yet it is
   sufficient to answer a mere arbitrary assertion, without any kind of
   evidence, urged by way of objection against a doctrine, the proof of
   which is not reason, but revelation. Consider then: people ruin their
   fortunes by extravagance; they bring diseases upon themselves by
   excess; they incur the penalties of civil laws; and surely civil
   government is natural; will sorrow for these follies past, and behaving
   well for the future, alone and of itself prevent the natural
   consequences of them? On the contrary, men's natural abilities of
   helping themselves are often impaired; or if not, yet they are forced
   to be beholden to the assistance of others, upon several accounts, and
   in different ways; assistance which they would have had no occasion
   for, had it not been for their misconduct; but which, in the
   disadvantageous condition they had reduced themselves to, is absolutely
   necessary to their recovery, and retrieving their affairs. Now since
   this is our case, considering ourselves merely as inhabitants of this
   world, and as having a temporal interest here, under the natural
   government of God, which however has a great deal moral in it; why is
   it not supposable that this may be our case also, ill our more
   important capacity, as under his perfect moral government, and having a
   more general and future interest depending? If we have misbehaved in
   this higher capacity, and rendered ourselves obnoxious to the future
   punishment, which God has annexed to vice: it is plainly credible, that
   behaving well for the time to come may be--not useless, God forbid--but
   wholly insufficient, alone and of itself, to prevent that punishment:
   or to put us in the condition, which we should have been in had we
   preserved our innocence.

   And though we ought to reason with all reverence, whenever we reason
   concerning the divine conduct: yet it may be added, that it is clearly
   contrary to all our notions of government, as well as to what is, in
   fact, the general constitution of nature, to suppose, that doing well
   for the future should, in all cases, prevent all the judicial bad
   consequences of having done evil, or all the punishment annexed to
   disobedience. And we have manifestly nothing from whence to determine,
   in what degree, and in what cases, reformation would prevent this
   punishment, even supposing that it would in some. And though the
   efficacy of repentance itself alone, to prevent what mankind had
   rendered themselves obnoxious to, and recover what they had forfeited,
   is now insisted upon, in opposition to Christianity; yet, by the
   general prevalence of propitiatory sacrifices over the heathen world,
   this notion of repentance alone being sufficient to expiate guilt,
   appears to be contrary to the general sense of mankind.

   Upon the whole then; had the laws, the general laws of God's government
   been permitted to operate, without any interposition in our behalf, the
   future punishment, for ought we know to the contrary, or have any
   reason to think, must inevitably have followed, notwithstanding any
   thing we could have done to prevent it. Now,

   V. In this darkness, or this light of nature, call it which you please,
   revelation comes in; confirms every doubting fear, which could enter
   into the heart of man, concerning the future unprevented consequence of
   wickedness; supposes the world to be in a state of ruin (a supposition
   which seems the very ground of the Christian dispensation, and which,
   if not provable by reason, yet is in no wise contrary to it;) teaches
   us too, that the rules of divine government are such, as not to admit
   of pardon immediately and directly upon repentance, or by the sole
   efficacy of it: but then teaches at the same time, what nature might
   justly have hoped, that the moral government of the universe was not so
   rigid, but that there was room for an interposition, to avert the fatal
   consequences of vice; which therefore, by this means, does admit of
   pardon. Revelation teaches us, that the unknown laws of God's more
   general government, no less than the particular laws by which we
   experience he governs us at present, are compassionate, [171] as well
   as good in the more general notion of goodness: and that he hath
   mercifully provided, that there should be an interposition to prevent
   the destruction of human kind; whatever that destruction unprevented
   would have been. God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
   Son, that whosoever believeth, not, to be sure, in a speculative, but
   in a practical sense, that whosoever believeth in him, should not
   perish: [172] gave his Son in the same way of goodness to the world, as
   he affords particular persons the friendly assistance of their fellow
   creatures: when, without it, their temporal ruin would be the certain
   consequence of their follies: in the same way of goodness, I say;
   though in a transcendent and infinitely higher degree. And the Son of
   God loved us, and gave himself for us, with a love, which he himself
   compares to that of human friendship: though, in this case, all
   comparisons must fall infinitely short of the thing intended to be
   illustrated by them. He interposed in such a manner as was necessary
   and effectual to prevent that execution of justice upon sinners, which
   God had appointed should otherwise have been executed upon them: or in
   such a manner, as to prevent that punishment from actually following,
   which, according to the general laws of divine government, must have
   followed the sins of the world, had it not been for such interposition.
   [173]

   If any thing here said should appear, upon first thought, inconsistent
   with divine goodness; a second, I am persuaded, will entirely remove
   that appearance. For were we to suppose the constitution of things to
   be such, as that the whole creation must have perished, had it not been
   for somewhat, which God had appointed should be, in order to prevent
   that ruin: even this supposition would not be inconsistent, in any
   degree, with the most absolutely perfect goodness. But still it may be
   thought, that this whole manner of treating the subject before us
   supposes mankind to be naturally in a very strange state. And truly so
   it does. But it is not Christianity which has put us into this state.
   Whoever will consider the manifold miseries, and the extreme wickedness
   of the world; that the best have great wrongnesses within themselves,
   which they complain of and endeavour to amend; but that the generality
   grow more profligate and corrupt with age; that even moralists thought
   the present state to be a state of punishment: and, what might be
   added, that the earth our habitation has the appearances of being a
   ruin: whoever, I say, will consider all these, and some other obvious
   things, will think he has little reason to object against the Scripture
   account, that mankind is in a state of degradation; against this being
   the fact: how difficult soever he may think it to account for, or even
   to form a distinct conception of the occasions and circumstances of it.
   But that the crime of our first parents was the occasion of our being
   placed in a more disadvantageous condition, is a thing throughout and
   particularly analogous to what we see in the daily course of natural
   providence; as the recovery of the world by the interposition of Christ
   has been shown to be so in general.

   VI. The particular manner in which Christ interposed in the redemption
   of the world, or his office as Mediator, in the largest sense, between
   God and man, is thus represented to us in the Scripture. He is the
   light of the world; [174] the revealer of the will of God in the most
   eminent sense. He is a propitiatory sacrifice; [175] the Lamb of God:
   [176] and, as he voluntarily offered himself up, he is styled our High
   Priest. [177] And, which seems of peculiar weight, he is described
   beforehand in the Old Testament, under the same characters of a priest,
   and an expiatory victim. [178] And whereas it is objected, that all
   this is merely by way of allusion to the sacrifices of the Mosaic law,
   the Apostle on the contrary affirms, that the law was a shadow of good
   things to come, and not the very image of the things: [179] and that
   the priests that offer gifts according to the law--serve unto the
   example anti shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God,
   when he was about to make the tabernacle. For see, saith he, that thou
   make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount:
   [180] i. e. the Levitical priesthood was a shadow of the priesthood of
   Christ; in like manner as the tabernacle made by Moses was according to
   that showed him in the mount. The priesthood of Christ, and the
   tabernacle in the mount, were the originals: of the former of which the
   Levitical priesthood was a type; and of the latter the tabernacle made
   by Moses was a copy. The doctrine of this epistle then plainly is, that
   the legal sacrifices were allusions to the great and final atonement to
   be made by the blood of Christ; and not that this was an allusion to
   those. Nor can any thing be more express or determinate than the
   following passage. It is not possible that the blood of bulls and of
   goats should take away sin. Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he
   saith, Sacrifice and offering, i. e. of bulls and of goats, thou
   wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me. Lo, I come to do thy
   will, O God. By which will we are sanctified, through the offering of
   the body of Jesus Christ once for all. [181] And to add one passage
   more of the like kind: Christ was once offered to bear the sins of
   many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time,
   without sin; i. e. without bearing sin, as he did at his first coming,
   by being an offering for it; without having our iniquities again laid
   upon him, without being any more a sin-offering:--unto them that look
   for him shall he appear the second time, without sin, unto salvation.
   [182] Nor do the inspired writers at all confine themselves to this
   manner of speaking concerning the satisfaction of Christ; but declare
   an efficacy in what he did and suffered for us, additional to and
   beyond mere instruction, example, and government, in great variety of
   expression: That Jesus should die for that nation, the Jews: and not
   for that nation only, but that also, plainly by the efficacy of his
   death, he should gather together in one the children of God that were
   scattered abroad: [183] that he suffered for sins, the just for the
   unjust: [184] that he gave his life, himself, a ransom: [185] that we
   are bought, bought with a price: [186] that he redeemed us with his
   blood: redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for
   us: [187] that he is our advocate, intercessor, and propitiation: [188]
   that he was made perfect, or consummate, through sufferings; and being
   thus made perfect, he became the author of salvation: [189] that God
   was in Christ reconciling the world to himself; by the death of his
   Son, by the cross; not imputing their trespasses unto them: [190] and
   lastly, that through death he destroyed him that had the power of
   death. [191] Christ then having thus humbled himself, and become
   obedient to death, even the death of the cross; God also hath highly
   exalted him, and given him a name, which is above every name: hath
   given all things into his hands: hath committed all judgment unto him;
   that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.
   [192] For, worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power, and
   riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.
   And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, heard I,
   saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that
   sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. [193]

   These passages of Scripture seem to comprehend and express the chief
   parts of Christ's office, as Mediator between God and man, so far, I
   mean, as the nature of this his office is revealed; and it is usually
   treated of by divines under three heads.

   First, He was, by way of eminence, the Prophet: that Prophet that
   should come into the world, [194] to declare the divine will. He
   putbished anew the law of nature, which men had corrupted; and the very
   knowledge of which, to some degree, was lost among them. He taught
   mankind, taught us authoritatively, to live soberly, righteously, and
   godly in this present world, in expectation of the future judgment of
   God. He confirmed the truth of this moral system of nature, and gave us
   additional evidence of it; the evidence of testimony. [195] He
   distinctly revealed the manner, in which God would be worshipped, the
   efficacy of repentance, and the rewards and punishments of a future
   life. Thus he was a prophet in a sense in which no other ever was. To
   which is to be added, that he set us a perfect example, that we should
   follow his steps.

   Secondly, He has a kingdom which is not of this world. He founded a
   Church, to be to mankind a standing memorial of religion, and
   invitation to it; which he promised to be with always even to the end.
   He exercises an invisible government over it, himself, and by his
   Spirit: over that part of it, which is militant here on earth, a
   government of discipline, for the perfecting of the saints, for the
   edifying his body: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of
   the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure
   of the stature of the fulness of Christ. [196] Of this Church, all
   persons scattered over the world, who live in obedience to his laws,
   are members. For these he is gone to prepare a place, and will come
   again to receive them unto himself that where he is, there they may be
   also; and reign with him for ever and ever, and likewise to take
   vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not his Gospel. [197]

   Against these parts of Christ's office I find no objections, but what
   are fully obviated in the beginning of this Chapter.

   Lastly, Christ offered himself a propitiatory sacrifice, and made
   atonement for the sins of the world; which is mentioned last, in regard
   to what is objected against it. Sacrifices of expiation were commanded
   the Jews, and obtained amongst most other nations, from tradition,
   whose original probably was revelation. And they were continually
   repeated, both occasionally, and at the returns of stated times: and
   made up great part of the external religion of mankind. But now once in
   the end of the world Christ appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice
   of himself. [198] And this sacrifice was, in the highest degree and
   with the most extensive influence, of that efficacy for obtaining
   pardon of sin, which the heathens may be supposed to have thought their
   sacrifices to have been, and which the Jewish sacrifices really were in
   some degree, and with regard to some persons.

   How and in what particular way it had this efficacy; there are not
   wanting persons who have endeavoured to explain: but I do not find that
   the Scripture has explained it. We seem to be very much in the dark
   concerning the manner in which the ancients understood atonement to be
   made, i. e. pardon to be obtained by sacrifices. And if the Scripture
   has, as surely it has, left this matter of the satisfaction of Christ
   mysterious, left somewhat in it unrevealed, all conjectures about it
   must be, if not evidently absurd, yet at least uncertain. Nor has any
   one reason to complain for want of further information, unless he can
   show his claim to it.

   Some have endeavoured to explain the efficacy of what Christ has done
   and suffered for us, beyond what the Scripture has authorized: others,
   probably because they could not explain it, have been for taking it
   away, and confining his office as Redeemer of the world to his
   instruction, example, and government of the church. Whereas the
   doctrine of the Gospel appears to be, not only that he taught the
   efficacy of repentance, but rendered it of the efficacy of which it is,
   by what he did and suffered for us: that he obtained for us the benefit
   of having our repentance accepted unto eternal life: not only that he
   revealed to sinners, that they were in a capacity of salvation, and how
   they might obtain it; but moreover that he put them into this capacity
   of salvation, by what he did and suffered for them; put us into a
   capacity of escaping future punishment, and obtaining future happiness.
   And it is our wisdom thankfully to accept the benefit, by performing.
   the conditions, upon which it is offered, on our part, without
   disputing how it was procured on his. For,

   VII. Since we neither know by what means punishment in a future state
   would have followed wickedness in this: nor in what manner it would
   have been inflicted, had it not been prevented; nor all the reasons why
   its infliction would have been needful, nor the particular nature of
   that state of happiness, which Christ is gone to prepare for his
   disciples: and since we are ignorant how far any thing which we could
   do, would, alone and of itself, have been effectual to prevent that
   punishment to which we were obnoxious, and recover that happiness,
   which we had forfeited; it is most evident we are not judges,
   antecedently to revelation, whether a mediator was or was not
   necessary, to obtain those ends: to prevent that future punishment, and
   bring mankind to the final happiness of their nature. And for the very
   same reasons, upon supposition of the necessity of a mediator, we are
   no more judges, antecedently to revelation, of the whole nature of his
   office, or the several parts of which it consists; of what was fit and
   requisite to be assigned him, in order to accomplish the ends of divine
   Providence in the appointment. And from hence it follows, that to
   object against the expediency or usefulness of particular things,
   revealed to have been done or suffered by him, because we do not see
   how they were conducive to those ends, is highly absurd. Yet nothing is
   more common to be met with, than this absurdity. But if it be
   acknowledged beforehand, that we are not judges in the case, it is
   evident that no objection can, with any shadow of reason, be urged
   against any particular part of Christ's mediatorial office revealed in
   Scripture, till it can be shown positively not to be requisite or
   conducive to the ends proposed to be accomplished; or that it is in
   itself unreasonable.

   And there is one objection made against the satisfaction of Christ,
   which looks to be of this positive kind: that the doctrine of his being
   appointed to suffer for the sins of the world, represents God as being
   indifferent whether he punished the innocent or the guilty. Now from
   the foregoing observations we may see the extreme slightness of all
   such objections; and (though it is most certain all who make them do
   not see the consequence) that they conclude altogether as much against
   God's whole original constitution of nature, and the whole daily course
   of divine Providence in the government of the world, i. e. against the
   whole scheme of Theism and the whole notion of Religion, as against
   Christianity. For the world is a constitution or system, whose parts
   have a mutual reference to each other: and there is a scheme of things
   gradually carrying on, called the course of nature, to the carrying on
   of which God has appointed us, in various ways, to contribute. And
   when, in the daily course of natural providence, it is appointed that
   innocent people should suffer for the faults of the guilty, this is
   liable to the very same objection, as the instance we are now
   considering. The infinitely greater importance of that appointment of
   Christianity, which is objected against, does not hinder but it may be,
   as it plainly is, an appointment of the very same kind, with what the
   world affords us daily examples of. Nay, if there were any force at all
   in the objection, it would be stronger, in one respect, against natural
   providence, than against Christianity: because under the former we are
   in many cases commanded, and even necessitated whether we will or no,
   to suffer for the faults of others' whereas the sufferings of Christ
   were voluntary. The world's being under the righteous government of God
   does indeed imply, that finally and upon the whole every one shall
   receive according to his personal deserts: and the general doctrine of
   the whole Scripture is, that this shall be the completion of the divine
   government. But during the progress, and, for ought we know, even in
   order to the completion of this moral scheme, vicarious punishments may
   be fit, and absolutely necessary. Men by their follies run themselves
   into extreme distress; into difficulties which would be absolutely
   fatal to them, were it not for the interposition and assistance of
   others. God commands by the law of nature, that we afford them this
   assistance, in many cases where we cannot do it without very great
   pains, and labour, and sufferings to ourselves. And we see in what
   variety of ways one person's sufferings contribute to the relief of
   another: and how, or by what particular means, this comes to pass, or
   follows, from the constitution and laws of nature, which came under our
   notice: and, being familiarized to it, men are not shocked with it. So
   that the reason of their insisting upon objections of the foregoing
   kind against the satisfaction of Christ is, either that they do not
   consider God's settled and uniform appointments as his appointments at
   all; or else they forget that vicarious punishment is a providential
   appointment of every day's experience: and then, from their being
   unacquainted with the more general laws of nature or divine government
   over the world, and not seeing how the sufferings of Christ could
   contribute to the redemption of it, unless by arbitrary and tyrannical
   will; they conclude his sufferings could not contribute to it any other
   way. And yet, what has been often alleged in justification of this
   doctrine, even from the apparent natural tendency of this method of our
   redemption; its tendency to vindicate the authority of God's laws, and
   deter his creatures from sin; this has never yet been answered, and is
   I think plainly unanswerable: though I am far from thinking it an
   account of the whole of the case. But, without taking this into
   consideration, it abundantly appears, from the observations above made,
   that this objection is, not an objection against Christianity, but
   against the whole general constitution of nature. And if it were to be
   considered as an objection against Christianity, or considering it as
   it is, an objection against the constitution of nature; it amounts to
   no more in conclusion than this, that a divine appointment cannot be
   necessary or expedient, because the objector does not discern it to be
   so: though he must own that the nature of the case is such, as renders
   him incapable of judging, whether it be so or not; or of seeing it to
   be necessary, though it were so.

   It is indeed a matter of great patience to reasonable men, to find
   people arguing in this manner: objecting against the credibility of
   such particular things revealed in Scripture, that they do not see the
   necessity or expediency of them. For though it is highly right, and the
   most pious exercise of our understanding, to inquire with due reverence
   into the ends and reasons of God's dispensation: yet when those reasons
   are concealed, to argue from our ignorance, that such dispensations
   cannot be from God, is infinitely absurd. The presumption of this kind
   of objections seems almost lost in the folly of them. And the folly of
   them is yet greater, when they are urged, as usually they are, against
   things in Christianity analogous or like to those natural dispensations
   of Providence, which are matter of experience. Let reason be kept to:
   and if any part of the Scripture account of the redemption of the world
   by Christ can be shown to be really contrary to it, let the Scripture,
   in the name of God, be given up: but let not such poor creatures as we
   go on objecting against an infinite scheme, that we do not see the
   necessity or usefulness of all its parts, and call this reasoning; and,
   which still further heightens the absurdity in the present case, parts
   which we are not actively concerned in. For it may be worth mentioning,

   Lastly, That not only the reason of the thing, but the whole analogy of
   nature, should teach us, not to expect to have the like information
   concerning the divine conduct, as concerning our own duty. God
   instructs us by experience (for it is not reason, but experience which
   instructs us), what good or bad consequences will follow from our
   acting in such and such manners: and by this he directs us how we are
   to behave ourselves. But, though we are sufficiently instructed for the
   common purposes of life: yet it is but an almost infinitely small part
   of natural providence, which we are at all let into. The case is the
   same with regard to revelation, The doctrine of a mediator between God
   and man, against which it is objected, that the expediency of some
   things in it is not understood, relates only to what was done on God's
   part in the appointment, and on the Mediator's in the execution of it.
   For what is required of us, in consequence of this gracious
   dispensation, is another subject, in which none can complain for want
   of information. The constitution of the world, and God's natural
   government over it, is all mystery, as much as the Christian
   dispensation. Yet under the first he has given men all things
   pertaining to life; and under the other all things pertaining unto
   godliness. And it may be added, that there is nothing hard to be
   accounted for in any of the common precepts of Christianity: though if
   there were, surely a divine command is abundantly sufficient to lay us
   under the strongest obligations to obedience. But the fact is, that the
   reasons of all the Christian precepts are evident. Positive
   institutions are manifestly necessary to keep up and propagate religion
   amongst mankind. And our duty to Christ, the internal find external
   worship of him; this part of the religion of the Gospel manifestly
   arises out of what he has done and suffered, his authority and
   dominion, and the relation which he is revealed to stand in to us.

  CHAP. VI.

  OF THE WANT OF UNIVERSALITY IN REVELATION; AND OF THE SUPPOSED DEFICIENCY IN
  THE PROOF OF IT.

   IT has been thought by some persons, that if the evidence of revelation
   appears doubtful, this itself turns into a positive argument against
   it: because it cannot be supposed, that, if it were true, it would be
   left to subsist upon doubtful evidence. And the objection against
   revelation from its not being universal is often insisted upon as of
   great weight.

   Now the weakness of these opinions may be shown, by observing the
   suppositions on which they are founded: which are really such as these;
   that it cannot be thought God would have bestowed any favour at all
   upon us, unless in the degree, which, we think, he might, and which, we
   imagine, would be most to our particular advantage; and also that it
   cannot be thought he would bestow a favour upon any, unless he bestowed
   the same upon all; suppositions, which we find contradicted, not by a
   few instances in God's natural government of the world, but by the
   general analogy of nature together.

   Persons who speak of the evidence of religion as doubtful, and of this
   supposed doubtfulness as a positive argument against it, should be put
   upon considering, what that evidence indeed is, which they act upon
   with regard to their temporal interests. For, it is not only extremely
   difficult, but in many cases absolutely impossible, to balance pleasure
   and pain, satisfaction and uneasiness, so as to be able to say on which
   side the overplus is. There are the like difficulties and
   impossibilities in making the due allowances for a change of temper and
   taste, for satiety, disgusts, ill health: any of which render men
   incapable of enjoying, after they have obtained what they most eagerly
   desired. Numberless too are the accidents, besides that one of untimely
   death, which may even probably disappoint the best concerted schemes:
   and strong objections are often seen to lie against them, not to be
   removed or answered, but which seem overbalanced by reasons on the
   other side; so as that the certain difficulties and dangers of the
   pursuit are, by every one, thought justly disregarded, upon account of
   the appearing greater advantages in case of success, though there be
   but little probability of it. Lastly, every one observes our
   liableness, if we be not upon our guard, to be deceived by the
   falsehood of men, and the false appearances of things: and this danger
   must be greatly increased, if there be a strong bias within, suppose
   from indulged passion, to favour the deceit. Hence arises that great
   uncertainty and doubtfulness of proof, wherein our temporal interest
   really consists; what are the most probable means of attaining it; and
   whether those means will eventually be successful. And numberless
   instances there are, in the daily course of life, in which all men
   think it reasonable to engage in pursuits, though the probability is
   greatly against succeeding; and to make such provision for themselves,
   as it is supposable they may have occasion for, though the plain
   acknowledged probability is, that they never shall. Then those who
   think the objection against revelation, from its light not being
   universal, to be of weight, should observe, that the Author of Nature,
   in numberless instances, bestows that upon some, which he does not upon
   others, who seem equally to stand in need of it. Indeed he appears to
   bestow all his gifts with the most promiscuous variety among creatures
   of the same species: health and strength, capacities of prudence and of
   knowledge, means of improvement, riches, and all external advantages.
   And as there are not any two men found, of exactly like shape and
   features; so it is probable there are not any two, of an exactly like
   constitution, temper, and situation, with regard to the goods and evils
   of life; Yet, notwithstanding these uncertainties and varieties; God
   does exercise a natural government over the world; and there is such a
   thing as a prudent and imprudent institution of life, with regard to
   our health and our affairs, under that his natural government.

   As neither the Jewish nor Christian revelation have been universal; and
   as they have been afforded to a greater or less part of the world, at
   different times; so likewise at different times, both revelations have
   had different degrees of evidence. The Jews who lived during the
   succession of prophets, that is, from Moses till after the Captivity,
   had higher evidence of the truth of their religion, than those had, who
   lived in the interval between the last mentioned period, and the coming
   of Christ. And the first Christians had higher evidence of the miracles
   wrought in attestation of Christianity, than what we have now. They had
   also a strong presumptive proof of the truth of it, perhaps of much
   greater force, in way of argument, than many think, of which we have
   very little remaining; I mean the presumptive proof of its truth, from
   the influence which it had upon the lives of the generality of its
   professors. And we, or future ages, may possibly have a proof of it,
   which they could not have, from the conformity between the prophetic
   history, and the state of the world and of Christianity. And further:
   if we were to suppose the evidence, which some have of religion, to
   amount to little more than seeing that it may be true; but that they
   remain in great doubts and uncertainties about both its evidence and
   its nature, and great perplexities concerning the rule of life: others
   to have a full conviction of the truth of religion, with a distinct
   knowledge of their duty; and others severally to have all the
   intermediate degrees of religious light and evidence, which lie between
   these two--if we put the case, that for the present, it was intended,
   revelation should be no more than a small light, in the midst of a
   world greatly overspread, notwithstanding it, with ignorance and
   darkness: that certain glimmerings of this light should extend, and be
   directed, to remote distances, in such a manner as that those who
   really partook of it should not discern from whence it originally came:
   that some in a nearer situation to it should have its light obscured,
   and, in different ways and degrees, intercepted: and that others should
   be placed within its clearer influence, and be much more enlivened,
   cheered, and directed by it; but yet that even to these it should be no
   more than a light shining in a dark place: all this would be perfectly
   uniform, and of a piece with the conduct of Providence, in the
   distribution of its other blessings. If the fact of the case really
   were, that some have received no light at all from the Scripture; as
   many ages and countries in the heathen world: that others, though they
   have, by means of it, had essential or natural religion enforced upon
   their consciences, yet have never had the genuine Scripture revelation,
   with its real evidence, proposed to their consideration; and the
   ancient Persians and modern Mahometans may possibly be instances of
   people in a situation somewhat like to this: that others, though they
   have had the Scripture laid before them as of divine revelation, yet
   have had it with the system and evidence of Christianity so
   interpolated, the system so corrupted, the evidence so blended with
   false miracles, as to leave the mind in the utmost doubtfulness and
   uncertainty about the whole; which may be the state of some thoughtful
   men, in most of those nations who call themselves Christian: and
   lastly, that others have had Christianity offered to them in its
   genuine simplicity, and with its proper evidence, as persons in
   countries and churches of civil and of Christian liberty; but however
   that even these persons are left in great ignorance in many respects,
   and have by no means light afforded them enough to satisfy their
   curiosity, but only to regulate their life, to teach them their duty,
   and encourage them in the careful discharge of it: I say, if we were to
   suppose this somewhat of a general true account of the degrees of moral
   and religious light and evidence, which were intended to be afforded
   mankind, and of what has actually been and is their situation, in their
   moral and religi3us capacity; there would be nothing in all this
   ignorance, doubtfulness, and uncertainty, in all these varieties, and
   supposed disadvantages of some in comparison of others, respecting
   religion, but may be paralleled by manifest analogies in the natural
   dispensations of Providence at present, and considering ourselves
   merely in our temporal capacity.

   Nor is there any thing shocking in all this, or which would seem to
   bear hard upon the moral administration in nature, if we would really
   keep in mind, that every one shall be dealt equitably with: instead of
   forgetting this, or explaining it away, after it is acknowledged in
   words. All shadow of injustice, and indeed all harsh appearances, in
   this various economy of Providence, would be lost; if we would keep in
   mind, that every merciful allowance shall be made, and no more be
   required of any one, than what might have been equitably expected of
   him, from the circumstances in which he was placed; and not what might
   have been expected, had he been placed in other circumstances: i. e. in
   Scripture language, that every man shall be accepted according to what
   he had, not according to what he had not. [200] This however doth not
   by any means imply, that all persons condition here is equally
   advantageous with respect to futurity. And Providence's designing to
   place some in greater darkness with respect to religious knowledge, is
   no more a reason why they should not endeavour to get out of that
   darkness, and others to bring them out of it; than why ignorant and
   slow people in matters of other knowledge should not endeavour to
   learn, or should not be instructed.

   It is not unreasonable to suppose, that the same wise and good
   principle, whatever it was, which disposed the Author of Nature to make
   different kinds and orders of creatures, disposed him also to place
   creatures of like kinds in different situations: and that the same
   principle which disposed him to make creatures of different moral
   capacities, disposed him also to place creatures of like moral
   capacities in different religious situations; and even the same
   creatures, in different periods of their being. And the account or
   reason of this is also most probably the account why the constitution
   of things is such, as that creatures of moral natures or capacities,
   for a considerable part of that duration in which they are living
   agents, are not at all subjects of morality and religion; but grow up
   to be so, and grow up to be so more and more gradually from childhood
   to mature age.

   What, in particular, is the account or reason of these things, we must
   be greatly in the dark, were it only that we know so very little even
   of our own case. Our present state may possibly be the consequence of
   somewhat past, which we are wholly ignorant of: as it has a reference
   to somewhat to come, of which we know scarce any more than is necessary
   for practice. A system or constitution, in its notion, implies variety;
   and so complicated a one as this world, very great variety. So that
   were revelation universal, yet, from men's different capacities of
   understanding, from the different lengths of their lives, their
   different educations and other external circumstances, and from their
   difference of temper and bodily constitution; their religious
   situations would be widely different, and the disadvantage of some in
   comparison of others, perhaps, altogether as much as at present. And
   the true account, whatever it be, why mankind, or such a part of
   mankind, are placed in this condition of ignorance, must be supposed
   also the true account of our further ignorance, in not knowing the
   reasons why, or whence it is, that they are placed in this condition.
   But the following practical reflections may deserve the serious
   consideration of those persons, who think the circumstances of mankind
   or their own, in the forementioned respects, a ground of complaint.

   First, The evidence of religion not appearing obvious, may constitute
   one particular part of some men's trial in the religious sense: as it
   gives scope, for a. virtuous exercise, or vicious neglect of their
   understanding, in examining or not examining into that evidence. There
   seems no possible reason to be given, why we may not be in a state of
   moral probation, with regard to the exercise of our understanding upon
   the subject of religion, as we are with regard to our behaviour in
   common affairs. The former is as much a thing within our power and
   choice as the latter. And I suppose it is to be laid down for certain,
   that the same character, the same inward principle, which, after a man
   is convinced of the truth of religion, renders him obedient to the
   precepts of it, would, were he not thus convinced, set him about an
   examination of it, upon its system and evidence being offered to his
   thoughts: and that in the latter state his examination would be with an
   impartiality, seriousness, and solicitude, proportionable to what his
   obedience is in the former. And as inattention, negligence, want of all
   serious concern, about a matter of such a nature and such importance,
   when offered to men's consideration, is, before a distinct conviction
   of its truth, as real immoral depravity and dissoluteness; as neglect
   of religious practice after such conviction: so active solicitude about
   it, and fair impartial consideration of its evidence before such
   conviction, is as really an exercise of a morally right temper; as is
   religious practice after. Thus, that religion is not intuitively true,
   but a matter of deduction and inference; that a conviction of its truth
   is not forced upon every one, but left to be, by some, collected with
   heedful attention to premises; this as much constitutes religious
   probation, as much affords sphere, scope, opportunity, for right and
   wrong behaviour, as any thing whatever does. And their manner of
   treating this subject, when laid before them, shows what is in their
   heart, and is an exertion of it.

   Secondly, It appears to be a thing as evident, though it is not so much
   attended to, that if, upon consideration of religion, the evidence of
   it should seem to any persons doubtful, in the highest supposable
   degree; even this doubtful evidence will, however, put them into a
   general state of probation in the moral and religious sense. For,
   suppose a man to be really in doubt, whether such a person had not done
   him the greatest favour; or, whether his whole temporal interest did
   not depend upon that person: no one, who had any sense of gratitude and
   of prudence, could possibly consider himself in the same situation,
   with regard to such person, as if he had no such doubt. In truth, it is
   as just to say, that certainty and doubt are the same; as to say the
   situations now mentioned would leave a man as entirely at liberty in
   point of gratitude or prudence, as he would be, were he certain he had
   received no favour from such person, or that he no way depended upon
   him. And thus, though the evidence of religion which is afforded to
   some men should be little more than they are given to see, the system
   of Christianity, or religion in general, to be supposable and credible;
   this ought in all reason to beget a serious practical apprehension,
   that it may be true. And even this will afford matter of exercise for
   religious suspense and deliberation, for moral resolution an,
   self-government; because the apprehension that religion may be true
   does as really lay men under obligations, as a full conviction that it
   is true. It gives occasion and motives to consider further the
   important subject; to preserve attentively upon their minds a general
   implicit sense that they may be under divine moral government, an awful
   solicitude about religion, whether natural or revealed. Such
   apprehension ought to turn men's eyes to every degree of new light
   which may be had, from whatever side it comes; and induce them to
   refrain, in the mean time, from all immoralities, and live in the
   conscientious practice of every common virtue. Especially are they
   bound to keep at the greatest distance from all dissolute profaneness;
   for this the very nature of the case forbids; and to treat with highest
   reverence a matter, upon which their own whole interest and being, and
   the fate of nature, depend. This behaviour, and an active endeavour to
   maintain within themselves this temper, is the business, the duty, and
   the wisdom of those persons, who complain of the doubtfulness of
   religion: is what they are under the most proper obligations to. And
   such behaviour is an exertion of, and has a tendency to improve in
   them, that character, which the practice of all the several duties of
   religion, from a full conviction of its truth, is an exertion of, and
   has a tendency to improve in others: others, I say, to whom God has
   afforded such conviction. Nay, considering the infinite importance of
   religion, revealed as well as natural, I think it may be said in
   general, that whoever will weigh the matter thoroughly may see, there
   is not near so much difference, as is commonly imagined, between what
   ought in reason to be the rule of life, to those persons who are fully
   convinced of its truth, and to those who have only a serious doubting
   apprehension, that it may be true. Their hopes, and fears, and
   obligations, will be in various degrees: but, as the subject matter of
   their hopes and fears is the same; so the subject matter of their
   obligations, what they are bound to do and to refrain from, is not so
   very unlike.

   It is to be observed further, that, from a character of understanding,
   or a situation of influence in the world, some persons have it in their
   power to do infinitely more harm or good, by setting an example of
   profaneness and avowed disregard to all religion, or, on the contrary,
   of a serious, though perhaps doubting, apprehension of its truth, and
   of a reverend regard to it under this doubtfulness; than they can do,
   by acting well or ill in all the common intercourses amongst mankind.
   And consequently they are most highly accountable for a behaviour,
   which, they may easily foresee, is of such importance, and in which
   there is most plainly a right and a wrong; even admitting the evidence
   of religion to be as doubtful as is pretended.

   The ground of these observations, and that which renders them just and
   true, is, that doubting necessarily implies some degree of evidence for
   that, of which we doubt. For no person would be in doubt concerning the
   truth of a number of facts so and so circumstanced, which should
   accidentally come into his thoughts, and of which he had no evidence at
   all. And though in the case of an even chance, and where consequently
   we were in doubt, we should in common language say, that we had no
   evidence at all for either side; yet that situation of things, which
   renders it an even chance and no more, that such an event will happen,
   renders this case equivalent to all others, where there is such
   evidence on both sides of a question, [201] as leaves the mind in doubt
   concerning the truth. Indeed in all these cases, there is no more
   evidence on one side than on the other; but there is (what is
   equivalent to) much more for either, than for the truth of a number of
   facts, which come into one's thoughts at random. And thus, in all these
   cases, doubt as much presupposes evidence, lower degrees of evidence,
   as belief presupposes higher, and certainty higher still. Any one, who
   will a little attend to the nature of evidence, will easily carry this
   observation on, and see, that between no evidence at all, and that
   degree of it which affords ground of doubt, there are as many
   intermediate degrees, as there are, between that degree which is the
   ground of doubt, and demonstration. And though we have not faculties to
   distinguish these degrees of evidence with any sort of exactness; yet,
   in proportion as they are discerned, they ought to influence our
   practice. For it is as real an imperfection in the moral character, not
   to be influenced in practice by a lower degree of evidence when
   discerned, as it is in the understanding, not to discern it. And as, in
   all subjects which men consider, they discern the lower as well as
   higher degrees of evidence, proportionably to their capacity of
   understanding; so, in practical subjects, they are influenced in
   practice, by the lower as well as higher degrees of it, proportionably
   to their fairness and honesty. And as, ill proportion to defects in the
   understanding, men are unapt to see lower degrees of evidence, are in
   danger of overlooking evidence when it is not glaring, and are easily
   imposed upon in such cases; so, in proportion to the corruption of the
   heart, they seem capable of satisfying themselves with having no regard
   in practice to evidence acknowledged real, if it be not overbearing.
   From these things it must follow, that doubting concerning religion
   implies such a degree of evidence for it, as, joined with the
   consideration of its importance, unquestionably lays men under the
   obligations before mentioned, to have a dutiful regard to it in all
   their behaviour.

   Thirdly, The difficulties in which the evidence of religion is
   involved, which some complain of, is no more a just ground of
   complaint, than the external circumstances of temptation, which others
   are placed in; or than difficulties in the practice of it, after a full
   conviction of its truth. Temptations render our state a more improving
   state of discipline, [202] than it would be otherwise: as they give
   occasion for a more attentive exercise of the virtuous principle, which
   confirms and strengthens it more, an an easier or less attentive
   exercise of it could. Now speculative difficulties are, in this
   respect, of the very same nature with these external temptations. For
   the evidence of religion not appearing obvious, is to some persons a
   temptation to reject it, without any consideration at all; and
   therefore requires such an attentive exercise of the virtuous
   principle, seriously to consider that evidence, as there would be no
   occasion for, but for such temptation. And the supposed doubtfulness of
   its evidence, after it has been in some sort considered, affords
   opportunity to an unfair mind of explaining away, and deceitfully
   hiding from itself, that evidence which it might see; and also for
   men's encouraging themselves in vice, from hopes of impunity, though
   they do clearly see thus much at least, that these hopes are uncertain:
   in like manner as the common temptation to many instances of folly,
   which end in temporal infamy and ruin, is the ground for hope of not
   being detected, and of escaping with impunity; i. e. the doubtfulness
   of the proof beforehand, that such foolish behaviour will thus end in
   infamy and ruin. On the contrary, supposed doubtfulness in the evidence
   of religion calls for a more careful and attentive exercise of the
   virtuous principle, in fairly yielding themselves up to the proper
   influence of any real evidence, though doubtful; and in practising
   conscientiously all virtue, though under some uncertainty, whether the
   government in the universe may not possibly be such, as that vice may
   escape with impunity. And in general, temptation, meaning by this word
   the lesser allurements to wrong and difficulties in the discharge of
   our duty, as well as the greater ones; temptation, I say, as such and
   of every kind and degree, as it calls forth some virtuous efforts,
   additional to what would otherwise have been wanting, cannot but be an
   additional discipline and improvement of virtue, as well as probation
   of it in the other senses of that word. [203] So that the very same
   account is to be given, why the evidence of religion should be left in
   such a manner, as to require, in some, an attentive, solicitous,
   perhaps painful exercise of their understanding, about it; as why
   others should be placed in such circumstances, as that the practice of
   its common duties, after a full conviction of the truth of it, should
   require attention, solicitude, and pains: or, why appearing
   doubtfulness should be permitted to afford matter of temptation to
   some; as why external difficulties and allurements should be permitted
   to afford matter of temptation to others. The same account also is to
   be given, why some should be exercised with temptations of both these
   kinds; as why others should be exercised with the latter in such very
   high degrees, as some have been, particularly as the primitive
   Christians were.

   Nor does there appear any absurdity in supposing, that the speculative
   difficulties, in which the evidence of religion is involved, may make
   even the principal part of some persons' trial. For as the chief
   temptations of the generality of the world are the ordinary motives to
   injustice or unrestrained pleasure; or to live in the neglect of
   religion from that frame of mind, which renders many persons almost
   without feeling as to any thing distant, or which is not the object of
   their senses: so there are other persons without this shallowness of
   temper, persons of a deeper sense as to what is invisible and future;
   who not only see, but have a general practical feeling, that what is to
   come will be present, and that things are not less real for their not
   being the objects of sense; and who, from their natural constitution of
   body and of temper, and from their external condition, may have small
   temptations to behave ill, small difficulty in behaving well, in the
   common course of life. Now when these latter persons have a distinct
   full conviction of the truth of religion, without any possible doubts
   or difficulties, the practice of it is to them unavoidable, unless they
   will do a constant violence to their own minds; and religion is scarce
   any more a discipline to them, than it is to creatures in a state of
   perfection. Yet these persons may possibly stand in need of moral
   discipline and exercise in a higher degree, than they would have by
   such an easy practice of religion. Or it may be requisite, for reasons
   unknown to us, that they should give some further manifestation [204]
   what is their moral character, to the creation of God, than such a
   practice of it would be. Thus in the great variety of religious
   situations in which men are placed, what constitutes, what chiefly and
   peculiarly constitutes, the probation, in all senses, of some persons,
   may be the difficulties in which the evidence of religion is involved:
   and their principal and distinguished trial may be, how they will
   behave under and with respect to these difficulties. Circumstances in
   men's situation in their temporal capacity, analogous in good measure
   to this respecting religion, are to be observed. We find some persons
   are placed in such a situation in the world, as that their chief
   difficulty with regard to conduct, is not the doing what is prudent
   when it is known; for this, in numberless cases, is as easy as the
   contrary: but to some the principal exercise is, recollection and being
   upon their guard against deceits, the deceits suppose of those about
   them; against false appearances of reason and prudence. To persons in
   some situations, the principal exercise with respect to conduct is,
   attention in order to inform themselves what is proper, what is really
   the reasonable and prudent part to act.

   But as I have hitherto gone upon supposition, that men's
   dissatisfaction with the evidence of religion is not owing to their
   neglects or prejudices; it must be added, on the other hand, in all
   common reason, and as what the truth of the case plainly requires
   should be added, that such dissatisfaction possibly may be owing to
   those, possibly may be men's own fault. For,

   If there are any persons, who never set themselves heartily and. in
   earnest to be informed in religion; if there are any, who secretly wish
   it may not prove true; and are less attentive to evidence than to
   difficulties, and more to objections than to what is said in answer to
   them: these persons will scarce be thought in a likely way of seeing
   the evidence of religion, though it were most certainly true, and
   capable of being ever so fully proved. If any accustom themselves to
   consider this subject usually in the way of mirth and sport: if they
   attend to forms and representations, and inadequate manners of
   expression, instead of the real things intended by them: (for signs
   often can be no more than inadequately expressive of the things
   signified:) or if they substitute human errors in the room of divine
   truth; why may not all, or any of these things, hinder some men from
   seeing that evidence, which really is seen by others; as a like turn of
   mind, with respect to matters of common speculation and practice, does,
   we find by experience, hinder them from attaining that knowledge and
   right understanding, in matters of common speculation and practice,
   which more fair and attentive minds attain to? And the effect will be
   the same, whether their neglect of seriously considering the evidence
   of religion, and their indirect behaviour with regard to it, proceed
   from mere carelessness, or from the grosser vices; or whether it be
   owing to this, that forms and figurative manners of expression, as well
   as errors, administer occasions of ridicule, when the things intended,
   and the truth itself, would not. Men may indulge a ludicrous turn so
   far as to lose all sense of conduct and prudence in worldly affairs,
   and even, as it seems, to impair their faculty of reason. And in
   general, levity, carelessness, passion, and prejudice do hinder us from
   being rightly informed, with respect to common things: and they may, in
   like manner, and perhaps in some further providential manner, with
   respect to moral and religious subjects: may hinder evidence from being
   laid before us, and from being seen when it is. The Scripture [205]
   does declare, that every one shall not understand. And it makes no
   difference, by what providential conduct this comes to pass: whether
   the evidence of Christianity was, originally and with design, put and
   left so, as that those who are desirous of evading moral obligations
   should not see it; and that honest-minded persons should: or, whether
   it comes to pass by any other means.

   Further: The general proof of natural religion and of Christianity
   does, I think, lie level to common men; even those, the greatest part
   of whose time, from childhood to old age, is taken up with providing
   for themselves and their families the common conveniences, perhaps
   necessaries, of life: those I mean, of this rank, who ever think at all
   of asking after proof, or attending to it. Common men, were they as
   much in earnest about religion, as about their temporal affairs, are
   capable of being convinced upon real evidence, that there is a God who
   governs the world: and they feel themselves to be of a moral nature,
   and accountable creatures. And as Christianity entirely falls in with
   this their natural sense of things, so they are capable, not only of
   being persuaded, but of being made to see, that there is evidence of
   miracles wrought in attestation of it; and many appearing completions
   of prophecy. But though this proof is real and conclusive, yet it is
   liable to objections, and may be run up into difficulties; which
   however persons who are capable not only of talking of; but of really
   seeing, are capable also of seeing through: i. e. not of clearing up
   and answering them, so as to satisfy their curiosity, for of such
   knowledge we are not capable with respect to any one thing in nature;
   but capable of seeing that the proof is not lost in these difficulties,
   or destroyed by these objections. But then a thorough examination into
   religion with regard to these objections, which cannot be the business
   of every man, is a matter of pretty large compass, and, from the nature
   of it, requires some knowledge, as well as time and attention; to see,
   how the evidence comes out, upon balancing one thing with another, and
   what, upon the whole, is the amount of it. Now if persons who have
   picked up these objections from others, and take for granted they are
   of weight, upon the word of those from whom they received them, or, by
   often retailing of them, come to see or fancy they see them to be of
   weight; will not prepare themselves for such an examination, with a
   competent degree of knowledge; or will. not give that time and
   attention to the subject, which, from the nature of it, is necessary
   for attaining such information: in this case, they must remain in
   doubtfulness, ignorance, or error: in the same way as they must, with
   regard to common sciences, and matters of common life, if they neglect
   the necessary means of being informed in them.

   But still perhaps it will be objected, that if a prince or common
   master were to send directions to a servant, he would take care, that
   they should always bear the certain marks, who they came from, and that
   their sense should be always plain: so as that there should be no
   possible doubt if he could help it, concerning the authority or meaning
   of them. Now the proper answer to all this kind of objections is, that,
   wherever the fallacy lies, it is even certain we cannot argue thus with
   respect to Him, who is the governor of the world: and particularly that
   he does not afford us such information, with respect to our temporal
   affairs and interests, as experience abundantly shows. However, there
   is a full answer to this objection,. from the very nature of religion.
   For, the reason why a prince would give his directions in this plain
   manner is, that he absolutely desires such an external action should be
   done, without concerning himself with the motive or principle upon
   which it is done: i. e. he reg;ards only the external event, or the
   thing's being done; and not at all, properly speaking, the doing of it,
   or the action. Whereas the whole of morality and religion, consisting
   merely in action itself, there is no sort of parallel between the
   cases. But if the prince be supposed to regard only the action; i. e.
   only to desire to exercise, or in any sense prove, the understanding or
   loyalty of a servant; he would not always give his orders in such a
   plain manner. It may be proper to add, that the will of God, respecting
   morality and religion, may be considered either as absolute, or as only
   conditional. If it be absolute, it can only be thus, that ae should act
   virtuously in such given circumstances; not that we should be brought
   to act so, by his changing of our circumstances. And if God's will be
   thus absolute, then it is in our power, in the highest and strictest
   sense, to do or to contradict his will; which is a most weighty
   consideration. Or his will may be considered only as conditional, that
   if we act so and so, we shall be rewarded; if otherwise, punished: of
   which conditional will of the Author of Nature, the whole constitution
   of it affords most certain instances.

   Upon the whole: that we are in a state of religion necessarily implies,
   that we are in a state of probation: and the credibility of our being
   at all in such a state being admitted, there seems no peculiar
   difficulty in supposing our probation to be, just as it is, in those
   respects which are above objected against. There seems no pretence,
   from the reason of the thing, to say, that the trial cannot equitably
   be any thing, but whether persons will act suitably to certain
   information, or such as admits no room for doubt; so as that there can
   be no danger of miscarriage, but either from their not attending to
   what they certainly know, or from overbearing passion hurrying them on
   to act contrary to it. For, since ignorance and doubt afford scope for
   probation in all senses, as really as intuitive conviction or
   certainty; and since the two former are to be put to the same account
   as difficulties in practice; men's moral probation may also be, whether
   they will take due care to inform themselves by impartial
   consideration, and afterwards whether they will act as the case
   requires, upon the evidence which they have, however doubtful. And
   this, we find by experience, is frequently our probation, [206] in our
   temporal capacity. For, the information which we want with regard to
   our worldly interests is by no means always given us of course, without
   any care of our own. And we are greatly liable to self-deceit from
   inward secret prejudices, and also to the deceits of others. So that to
   be able to judge what is the prudent part, often requires much and
   difficult consideration. Then after we have judged the very best we
   can, the evidence upon which we must act, if we will live and act at
   all, is perpetually doubtful to a very high degree. And the
   constitution and course of the world in fact is such, as that want of
   impartial consideration what we have to do, and venturing upon
   extravagant courses because it is doubtful what will be the
   consequence, are often naturally, i. e. providentially, altogether as
   fatal, as misconduct occasioned by heedless inattention to what we
   certainly know, or disregarding it from overbearing passion.

   Several of the observations here made may well seem strange, perhaps
   unintelligible, to many good men. But if the persons for whose sake
   they are made think so; persons who object as above, and throw off all
   regard to religion under pretence of want of evidence; I desire them to
   consider again, whether their thinking so be owing to any thing
   unintelligible in these observations, or to their own not having such a
   sense of religion and serious solicitude about it, as even their state
   of scepticism does in all reason require? It ought to be forced upon
   the reflection of these persons, that our nature and. condition
   necessarily require us, in the daily course of life, to act upon
   evidence much lower than what is commonly called probable: to guard,
   not only against what we fully believe will, but also against what we
   think it supposable may, happen; and to engage in pursuits when the
   probability is greatly against success, if it be credible, that
   possibly we may succeed in them.

  OF THE PARTICULAR EVIDENCE FOR CHRISTIANITY.

   THE presumptions against revelation, and objections against the general
   scheme of Christianity, and particular things relating to it, being
   removed; there remains to be considered, what positive evidence we have
   for the truth of it; chiefly in order to see, what the analogy of
   nature suggests with regard to that evidence, and the objections
   against it: or to see what is, and is allowed to be, the plain natural
   rule of judgment and of action, in our temporal concerns, in cases
   where we have the same kind of evidence, and the same kind of
   objections against it, that we have in the case before us.

   Now in the evidence of Christianity there seem to be several things of
   great weight, not reducible to the head, either of miracles, or the
   completion of prophecy, in the common acceptation of the words. But
   these two are its direct and fundamental proofs: and those other
   things, however considerable they are, yet ought never to be urged
   apart from its direct proofs, but always to be joined with them. Thus
   the evidence of Christianity will be a long series of things, reaching,
   as it seems, from the beginning of the world to the present time, of
   great variety and compass, taking in both the direct and also the
   collateral proofs; and making up, all of them together, one argument:
   the conviction arising from which kind of proof may be compared to what
   they call the effect in architecture or other works of art; a result
   from a great number of things so and so disposed, and taken into one
   view. I shall therefore, first, make some observations relating to
   miracles, and the appearing completions of prophecy; and consider what
   analogy suggests, in answer to the objections brought against this
   evidence. And, secondly, I shall endeavour to give some account of the
   general argument now mentioned, consisting both of the direct and
   collateral evidence, considered as making up one argument: this being
   the kind of proof, upon which we determine most questions of
   difficulty, concerning common facts, alleged to have happened, or
   seeming likely to happen; especially questions relating to conduct.

   First, I shall make some observations upon the direct proof of
   Christianity from miracles and prophecy, and upon the objections
   alleged against it.

   I. Now the following observations relating to the historical evidence
   of miracles wrought in attestation of Christianity appear to be of
   great weight.

   1. The Old Testament affords us the same historical evidence of the
   miracles of Moses and of the prophets, as of the common civil history
   of Moses and the kings of Israel; or, as of the affairs of the Jewish
   nation. And the Gospels and the Acts afford us the same historical
   evidence of the miracles of Christ and the Apostles, as of the common
   matters related in them. This indeed could not have been affirmed by
   any reasonable man, if the authors of these books, like many other
   historians, had appeared to make an entertaining manner of writing
   their aim; though they had interspersed miracles in their works, at
   proper distances and upon proper occasions. These might have animated a
   dull relation, amused the reader, and engaged his attention. And the
   same account would naturally have been given of them, as of the
   speeches and descriptions of such authors: the same account, in a
   manner, as is to be given, why the poets make use of wonders and
   prodigies. But the facts, both miraculous and natural, in Scripture,
   are related in plain unadorned narratives: and both of them appear, in
   all respects, to stand upon the same foot of historical evidence.
   Further: some parts of Scripture, containing an account of miracles
   fully sufficient to prove the truth of Christianity, are quoted as
   genuine, from the age in which they are said to be written, down to the
   present: and no other parts of them, material in the present question,
   are omitted to be quoted in such manner, as to afford any sort of proof
   of their not being genuine. And, as common history, when called in
   question in any instance, may often be greatly confirmed by
   contemporary or subsequent events more known and acknowledged; and as
   the common Scripture history, like many others, is thus confirmed; so
   likewise is the miraculous history of it, not only in particular
   instances, but in general. For, the establishment of the Jewish and
   Christian religions, which were events contemporary with the miracles
   related to be wrought in attestation of both, or subsequent to them,
   these events are just what we should have expected, upon supposition
   such miracles were really wrought to attest the truth of those
   religions. These miracles are a satisfactory account of those events:
   of which no other satisfactory account can be given; nor any account at
   all, but what is imaginary merely, and invented. It is to be added,
   that the most obvious, the most easy and direct account of this
   history, how it came to be written and to be received in the world, as
   a true history, is, that it really is so: nor can any other account of
   it be easy and direct. Now, though an account, not at all obvious, but
   very far-fetched and indirect, may indeed be, and often is, the true
   account of a matter; yet it cannot be admitted on the authority of its
   being asserted. Mere guess, supposition, and possibility, when opposed
   to historical evidence, prove nothing, hut that historical evidence is
   not demonstrative.

   Now the just consequence from all this, I think, is, that the
   Scripture-history in general is to be admitted as an authentic genuine
   history, till somewhat positive be alleged sufficient to invalidate it.
   But no man will deny the consequence to be, that it cannot be rejected,
   or thrown by as of no authority, till it can be proved to be of none;
   even though the evidence now mentioned for its authority were doubtful.
   This evidence may be confronted by historical evidence on the other
   side, if there be any: or general incredibility in the things related,
   or inconsistence in the general turn of the history, would prove it to
   be of no authority. But since, upon the face of the matter, upon a
   first and general view, the appearance is, that it is an authentic
   history; it cannot be determined to be fictitious without some proof
   that it is so. And the following observations in support of these, and
   coincident with them, will greatly confirm the historical evidence for
   the truth of Christianity.

   2. The Epistles of St Paul, from the nature of epistolary writing, and
   moreover from several of them being written, not to particular persons,
   but to churches, carry in them evidences of their being genuine, beyond
   what can be in a mere historical narrative, left to the world at large.
   This evidence, joined with that which they have in common with the rest
   of the New Testament, seems not to leave so much as any particular
   pretence for denying their genuineness, considered as an ordinary
   matter of fact, or of criticism: I say particular pretence, for denying
   it; because any single fact, of such a kind and such antiquity, may
   have general doubts raised concerning it, from the very nature of human
   affairs and human, testimony. There is also to be mentioned a distinct
   and particular evidence of the genuineness of the epistle chiefly
   referred to here, the first to the Corinthians; from the manner in
   which it is quoted by Clemens Romanus, in an epistle of his own to that
   church. [207] Now these epistles afford a proof of Christianity,
   detached from all others, which is, I think, a thing of weight; and
   also a proof of a nature and kind peculiar to itself. For,

   In them the author declares, that he received the Gospel in general,
   and the institution of the Communion is particular, not from the rest
   of the Apostles, or jointly together with them, but alone, from Christ
   himself; whom he declares likewise, conformably to the history in the
   Acts, that he saw after his ascension. [208] So that the testimony of
   St Paul is to be considered, as detached from that of the rest of the
   Apostles.

   And he declares further, that he was endued with a power of working
   miracles, as what was publicly known to those very people, speaks of
   frequent and great variety of miraculous. gifts as then subsisting in
   those very churches, to which he was waiting; which he was reproving
   for several irregularities; and where he had personal opposers: he
   mentions these gifts incidentally, in the most easy manner, and without
   effort; by way of reproof to those who had them, for their indecent use
   of them; and by way of depreciating them, in comparison of moral
   virtues: in short he speaks to these churches, of these miraculous
   powers, in the manner, any one would speak to another of a thing, which
   was as familiar and as much known in common to them both, as any thing
   in the world. [209] And this, as hath been observed by several persons,
   is surely a very considerable thing.

   3. It is an acknowledged historical fact, that Christianity offered
   itself to the world, and demanded to be received, upon the allegation,
   i. e. as unbelievers would speak, upon the pretence, of miracles,
   publicly wrought to attest the truth of it, in such an age; and that it
   was actually received by great numbers in that very age, and upon the
   professed belief of the reality of these miracles. And Christianity,
   including the dispensation of the Old Testament, seems distinguished by
   this from all other religions. I mean, that this does not appear to be
   the case with regard to any other; for surely it will not be supposed
   to lie upon any person, to prove by positive historical evidence, that
   it was not. It does in no sort appear that Mahometanisin was first
   received in the world upon the foot of supposed miracles, [210] i. e.
   public ones: for, as revelation is itself miraculous, all pretence to
   it must necessarily imply some pretence of miracles. And it is a known
   fact, that it was immediately, at the very first, propagated by other
   means. And as particular institutions, whether in Paganism or Popery,
   said to be confirmed by miracles after those institutions had obtained,
   are not to the purpose: so, were there what might be called historical
   proof, that any of them were introduced by a supposed divine command,
   believed to be attested by miracles; these would not be in any wise
   parallel. For single things of this sort are easy to be accounted for,
   after parties are formed, and have power in their hands; and the
   leaders of them are in veneration with the multitude; and political
   interests are blended with religious claims, and religious
   distinctions. But before any thing of this kind, for a few persons, and
   those of the lowest rank, all at once, to bring over such great numbers
   to a new religion, and get it to be received upon the particular
   evidence of miracles; this is quite another thing. And I think it will
   be allowed by any fair adversary, that the fact now mentioned, taking
   in all the circumstances of it, is peculiar to the Christian religion.
   However, the fact itself is allowed, that Christianity obtained, i. e.
   was professed to be received in the world, upon the belief of miracles,
   immediately in the age in which it is said those miracles were wrought:
   or that this is what its first converts would have alleged, as the
   reason for their embracing it. Now certainly it is not to be supposed
   that such numbers of men, in the most distant parts of the world should
   forsake the religion of their country, in which they had been educated;
   separate themselves from their friends, particularly in their festival
   shows and solemnities, to which the common people are so greatly
   addicted, and which were of a nature to engage them much more, than any
   thing of that sort amongst us; and embrace a religion, which could not
   but expose them to many inconveniences, and indeed must have been a
   giving up the world in a great degree, even from the very first, and
   before the empire engaged in form against them: it cannot be supposed,
   that such numbers should make so great, and, to say the least, so
   inconvenient a change in their whole institution of life, unless they
   were really convinced of the truth ok those miracles, upon the
   knowledge or belief of which they professed to make it. And it will, I
   suppose, readily be acknowledged, that the generality of the first
   converts to Christianity must have believed them: that as by becoming
   Christians they declared to the world, they were satisfied of the truth
   of those miracles; so this declaration was to be credited. And this
   their testimony is the same kind of evidence for those miracles, as if
   they had put it in writing, and these writings had come down to us. And
   it is real evidence, because it is of facts, which they had capacity
   and full opportunity to inform themselves of. It is also distinct from
   the direct or express historical evidence, though it is of the same
   kind: and it would be allowed to be distinct in all cases. For were a
   fact expressly related by one or more ancient historians, and disputed
   in after ages; that this fact is acknowledged to have been believed by
   great numbers of the age in which the historian says it was done, would
   be allowed an additional proof of such fact, quite distinct from the
   express testimony of the historian. The credulity of mankind is
   acknowledged: and the suspicions of mankind ought to be acknowledged
   too; and their backwardness even to believe, and greater still to
   practise, what makes against their interest. And it must particularly
   be remembered, that education, and prejudice, and authority, were
   against Christianity, in the age I am speaking of. So that the
   immediate conversion of such numbers is a real presumption of somewhat
   more than human in this matter: I say presumption, for it is not
   alleged as a proof alone and by itself. Nor need any one of the things
   mentioned in this Chapter be considered as a proof by itself: and yet
   all of them together may be one of the strongest. [211]

   Upon the whole: as there is large historical evidence, both direct and
   circumstantial, of miracles wrought in attestation of Christianity,
   collected by those who have writ upon the subject; it lies upon
   unbelievers to show, why this evidence is not to be credited. This way
   of speaking is, I think, just; and what persons who write in defence of
   religion naturally fall into. Yet, in a matter of such unspeakable
   importance, the proper question is, not whom it lies upon, according to
   the rules of argument, to maintain or confute objections: but whether
   there really are any, against this evidence, sufficient, in reason, to
   destroy the credit of it. However, unbelievers seem to take upon them
   the part of showing that there are.

   They allege, that numberless enthusiastic people, in different ages and
   countries, expose themselves to the same difficulties which the
   primitive Christians did; and are ready to give up their lives for the
   most idle follies imaginable. But it is not very clear, to what purpose
   this objection is brought. For every one, surely, in every case, must
   distinguish between opinions and facts. And though testimony is no
   proof of enthusiastic opinions, or of any opinions at all; yet it is
   allowed, in all other cases, to be a proof of facts. And a person's
   laying down his life in attestation of facts or of opinions, is the
   strongest proof of his believing them. And if the Apostles and their
   contemporaries did believe the facts, in attestation of which they
   exposed themselves to sufferings and death; this their belief, or
   rather knowledge, must be a proof of those facts: for they were such as
   came under the observation of their senses. And though it is not of
   equal weight, yet it is of weight, that the martyrs of the next age,
   notwithstanding they were not eye-witnesses of those facts, as were the
   Apostles and their contemporaries, had, however, full opportunity to
   inform themselves, whether they were true or not, and gave equal proof
   of their believing them to be true.

   But enthusiasm, it is said, greatly weakens the evidence of testimony
   even for facts, in matters relating to religion: some seem to think it
   totally and absolutely destroys the evidence of testimony upon this
   subject. And indeed the powers of enthusiasm, and of diseases too,
   which operate in a like manner, are very wonderful, in particular
   instances. But if great numbers of men, not appearing in any peculiar
   degree weak, nor under any peculiar suspicion of negligence, affirm
   that they saw and heard such things plainly with their eyes and their
   ears, and are admitted to be in earnest; such testimony is evidence of
   the strongest kind we can have, for any matter of fact. Yet possibly it
   may be overcome, strong as it is, by incredibility in the things thus
   attested, or by contrary testimony. And in an instance where one
   thought it was so overcome, it might be just to consider, how far such
   evidence could be accounted for, by enthusiasm; for it seems as if no
   other imaginable account were to be given of it. But till such
   incredibility be shown, or contrary testimony produced, it cannot
   surely be expected, that so far-fetched, so indirect and wonderful an
   account of such testimony, as that of enthusiasm must be; an account so
   strange, that the generality of mankind can scarce be made to
   understand what is meant by it: it cannot, I say, be expected, that
   such account will be admitted of such evidence; when there is this
   direct, easy, and obvious account of it, that people really saw and
   heard a thing not incredible, which they affirm sincerely and with full
   assurance, they did see and hear. Granting then that enthusiasm is not
   (strictly speaking) an absurd, but a possible account of such
   testimony; it is manifest, that the very mention of it goes upon the
   previous supposition, that the things so attested are incredible: and
   therefore need not be considered, till they are shown to be so. Much
   less need it be considered, after the contrary has been proved. And I
   think it has been proved, to full satisfaction, that there is no
   incredibility in a revelation, in general; or in such a one as the
   Christian, in particular. However, as religion is supposed peculiarly
   liable to enthusiasm, it may just be observed, that prejudices almost
   without number, and without name, romance, affectation, humour, a
   desire to engage attention, or to surprise, the party spirit, custom,
   little competitions, unaccountable likings and dislikinigs; these
   influence men strongly in common matters. And as these prejudices are
   often scarce known or reflected upon by the persons themselves who are
   influenced by them, they are to be considered as influences of a like
   kind to enthusiasm. Yet human testimony in common matters is naturally
   and justly believed notwithstanding.

   It is intimated further, in a more refined way of observation, that
   though it should be proved, that the Apostles and first Christians
   could not, in some respects, be deceived themselves, and, in other
   respects, cannot be thought to have intended to impose upon the world;
   yet it will not follow, that their general testimony is to be believed,
   though truly handed down to us: because they might still in part, i. e.
   in other respects, be deceived themselves, and in part also designedly
   impose upon others; which, it is added, is a thing very credible, from
   that mixture of real enthusiasm, and real knavery, to be met with in
   the same characters. And, I must confess, I think the matter of fact
   contained in this observation upon mankind is not to be denied; and
   that somewhat very much akin to it is often supposed in Scripture as a
   very common case, and most severely reproved. But it were to have been
   expected, that persons capable of applying this observation as applied
   in the objection, might also frequently have met with the like mixed
   character, in instances where religion was quite out of the case. The
   thing plainly is, that mankind are naturally endued with reason, or a
   capacity of distinguishing between truth and falsehood; and as
   naturally they are endued with veracity, or a regard to truth in what
   they say: but from many occasions they are liable to be prejudiced and
   biassed and deceived themselves, and capable of intending to deceive
   others, in every degree: insomuch that, as we are all liable to be
   deceived by prejudice, so likewise it seems to be not an uncommon
   thing, for persons, who, from their regard to truth, would not invent a
   lie entirely without any foundation at all, to propagate it with
   heightening circumstances, after it is once invented and set agoing.
   And others, though they would not propagate a lie, yet, which is a
   lower degree of falsehood, will let it pass without contradiction. But,
   notwithstanding all this, human testimony remains still a natural
   ground of assent; and this assent a natural principle of action.

   It is objected further, that however it has happened, the fact is, that
   mankind have, in different ages, been strangely deluded with pretences
   to miracles and wonders. But it is by no means to be admitted, that
   they have been oftener, or are at all more liable to be deceived by
   these pretences, than by others.

   It is added, that there is a very considerable degree of historical
   evidence for miracles, which are, on all hands, acknowledged to be
   fabulous. But suppose there were even the like historical evidence for
   these, to what there is for those alleged in proof of Christianity,
   which yet is in no wise allowed, but suppose this; the consequence
   would not be, that the evidence of the latter is not to be admitted.
   Nor is there a man in the world, who, in common cases, would conclude
   thus. For what would such a conclusion really amount to but this, that
   evidence, confuted by contrary evidence, or any way overbalanced,
   destroys the credibility of other evidence, neither confuted, nor
   overbalanced? To argue, that because there is, if there were, like
   evidence from testimony, for miracles acknowledged false, as for those
   in attestation of Christianity, therefore the evidence in the latter
   case is not to be credited; this is the same as to argue, that if two
   men of equally good reputation had given evidence in different cases no
   way connected, and one of them had been convicted of perjury, this
   confuted the testimony of the other.

   Upon the whole then, the general observation, that human creatures are
   so liable to be deceived, from enthusiasm in religion, and principles
   equivalent to enthusiasm in common matters, and in both from
   negligence; and that they are so capable of dishonestly endeavouring to
   deceive others; this does indeed weaken the evidence of testimony in
   all cases, but does not destroy it in any. And these things will
   appear, to different men, to weaken the evidence of testimony, in
   different degrees: in degrees proportionable to the observations they
   have made, or the notions they have any way taken up, concerning the
   weakness and negligence and dishonesty of mankind; or concerning the
   powers of enthusiasm, and prejudices equivalent to it. But it seems to
   me, that people do not know what they say, who affirm these things to
   destroy the evidence from testimony, which we have of the truth of
   Christianity. Nothing can destroy the evidence of testimony in any
   case, but a proof or probability, that persons are not competent judges
   of the facts to which they give testimony; or that they are actually
   under some indirect influence in giving it, in such particular case.
   Till this be made out, the natural laws of human actions require, that
   testimony be admitted. It can never be sufficient to overthrow direct
   historical evidence, indolently to say, that there are so many
   principles, from whence men are liable to be deceived themselves, and
   disposed to deceive others, especially in matters of religion, that one
   knows not what to believe. And it is surprising persons can help
   reflecting, that this very manner of speaking supposes they are not
   satisfied that there is nothing in the evidence, of which they speak
   thus; or that they can avoid observing, if they do make this
   reflection, that it is on such a subject, a very material one. [212]

   And over against all these objections is to be set the importance of
   Christianity, as what must have engaged the attention of its first
   converts, so as to have rendered them less liable to be deceived from
   carelessness, than they would in common matters; and likewise the
   strong obligations to veracity, which their religion laid them under:
   so that the first and most obvious presumption is, that they could not
   be deceived themselves nor deceive others. And this presumption, in
   this degree, is peculiar to the testimony we have been considering.

   In argument, assertions are nothing in themselves, and have an air of
   positiveness which sometimes is not very easy: yet they are necessary,
   and necessary to be repeated; in order to connect a discourse, and
   distinctly to lay before the view of the reader, what is proposed to be
   proved, and what is left as proved. Now the conclusion from the
   foregoing observations is, I think, beyond all doubt, this: that
   unbelievers must be forced to admit the external evidence for
   Christianity, i. e. the proof of miracles wrought to attest it, to be
   of real weight and very considerable; though they cannot allow it to be
   sufficient, to convince them of the reality of those miracles. And as
   they must, in all reason, admit this; so it seems to me, that upon
   consideration they would, in fact, admit it; those of them, I mean, who
   know any thing at all of the matter; in like manner as persons, in many
   cases, own they see strong evidence from testimony, for the truth of
   things, which yet they cannot be convinced are true: cases, suppose,
   where there is contrary testimony; or things which they think, whether
   with or without reason, to be incredible. But there is no testimony
   contrary to that which we have been considering: and it has been fully
   proved, that there is no incredibility in Christianity in general, or
   in any part of it.

   II. As to the evidence for Christianity from prophecy, I shall only
   make some few general observations, which are suggested by the Analogy
   of Nature; i. e. by the acknowledged natural rules of judging in common
   matters, concerning evidence of a like kind to this from prophecy.

   1. The obscurity or unintelligibleness of one part of a prophecy does
   not, in any degree, invalidate the proof of foresight, arising from the
   appearing completion of those other parts, which are understood. For
   the case is evidently the same, as if those parts, which are not
   understood, were lost, or not written at all, or written in an unknown
   tongue. Whether this observation be commonly attended to or not, it is
   so evident, that one can scarce bring oneself to set down an instance
   in common matters, to exemplify it. However, suppose a writing, partly
   in cipher, and partly in plain words at length; and that in the part
   one understood, there appeared mention of several known facts; it would
   never come into any man's thoughts to imagine, that if he understood
   the whole, perhaps he might find, that those facts were not in reality
   known by the writer. Indeed, both in this example and the thing
   intended to be exemplified by it, our not understanding the whole (the
   whole, suppose, of a sentence or a paragraph) might sometimes occasion
   a doubt, whether one understood the literal meaning of such a part: but
   this comes under another consideration.

   For the same reason, though a man should be incapable, for want of
   learning, or opportunities of inquiry, or from not having turned his
   studies this way, even so mulch as to judge whether particular
   prophecies have been throughout completely fulfilled; yet he may see,
   in general, that they have been fulfilled to such a degree, as, upon
   very good ground, to be convinced of foresight more than human in such
   prophecies, and of such events being intended by them. For the same
   reason also, though, by means of the deficiencies in civil history, and
   the different accounts of historians, the most learned should not be
   able to make out to satisfaction, that such parts of the prophetic
   history have been minutely and throughout fulfilled; yet a very strong
   proof of foresight may arise, from that general completion of them,
   which is made out: as much proof of foresight, perhaps, as the giver of
   prophecy intended should ever be afforded by such parts of prophecy.

   2. A long series of prophecy being applicable to such and such events,
   is itself a proof that it was intended of them: as the rules by which
   we naturally judge and determine, in common cases parallel to this,
   will show. This observation I make in answer to the common objection
   against the application of the prophecies, that, considering each of
   them distinctly by itself, it does not at all appear, that they were
   intended of those particular events, to which they are applied by
   Christians; and therefore it is to be supposed, that, if they meant any
   thing, they were intended of other events unknown to us, and not of
   these at all.

   Now there are two kinds of writing, which bear a great resemblance to
   prophecy, with respect to the matter before us: the mythological, and
   the satirical, where the satire is, to a certain degree, concealed. And
   a man might be assured, that he understood what an author intended by a
   fable or parable related without any application or moral, merely from
   seeing it to be easily capable of such application, and that such a
   moral might naturally be deduced from it. And he might be fully
   assured, that such persons and events were intended in a satirical
   writing, merely from its being applicable to them. And, agreeable to
   the last observation, he might be in a good measure satisfied of it,
   though he were not enough informed in affairs, or in the story of such
   persons to understand half the satire. For, his satisfaction, that he
   understood the meaning, the intended meaning, of these writings, would
   be greater or less in proportion as he saw the general turn of them to
   be capable of such application; and in proportion to the number of
   particular things capable of it. And thus, if a long series of prophecy
   is applicable to the present state of the church, and to the political
   situations of the kingdoms of the world, some thousand years after
   these prophecies were delivered, and a long series of prophecy
   delivered before the coming of Christ is applicable to him; these
   things are in themselves a proof, that the prophetic history was
   intended of him, and of those events: in proportion as the general turn
   of it is capable of such application, and to the number and variety of
   particular prophecies capable of it. And though, in all just way of
   consideration, the appearing completion of prophecies is to be allowed
   to be thus explanatory of, and to determine, their meaning; yet it is
   to be remembered further, that the ancient Jews apt plied the
   prophecies to a Messiah before his coming, in much the same manner as
   Christians do now: and that the primitive Christians interpreted the
   prophecies respecting, the state of the church and of the world in the
   last ages, in the sense which the event seems to confirm and verify.
   And from these things it may be made appear:

   3. That the showing even to a high probability, if that could be, that
   the prophets thought of some other events, in such and such
   predictions, and not those at all which Christians allege to be
   completions of those predictions; or that such and such prophecies are
   capable of being applied to other events than those, to which
   Christians apply them--that this would not confute or destroy the force
   of the argument from prophecy, even with regard to those very
   instances. For, observe how this matter really is. If one knew such a
   person to be the sole author of such a book, and was certainly assured,
   or satisfied to any degree, that one knew the whole of what he intended
   in it; one should be assured or satisfied to such degree, that one knew
   the whole meaning of that book: for the meaning of a book is nothing
   but the meaning of the author. But if one knew a person to have
   compiled a book out of memoirs, which he received from another, of
   vastly superior knowledge in the subject of it, especially if it were a
   book full of great intricacies and difficulties; it would in no wise
   follow, that one knew the whole meaning of the book, from knowing the
   whole meaning of the compiler: for the original memoirs, i. e. the
   author of them, might have, and there would be no degree of
   presumption, in many cases, against supposing him to have, some further
   meaning than the compiler saw. To say then, that the Scriptures, and
   the things contained in them, can have no other or further meaning than
   those persons thought or had, who first recited or wrote them, is
   evidently saying, that those persons were the original, proper, and
   sole authors of those books, i. e. that they are not inspired: which is
   absurd, whilst the authority of these books is under examination; i. e.
   till you have determined they are of no divine authority at all. Till
   this be determined, it must in all reason be supposed, not indeed that
   they have, for this is taking for granted that they are inspired; but
   that they may have, some further meaning than what the compilers saw or
   understood. And, upon this supposition, it is supposable also, that
   this further meaning may be fulfilled. Now events corresponding to
   prophecies, interpreted in a different meaning from that, in which the
   prophets are supposed to have understood them; this affords, in a
   manner, the same proof, that this different sense was originally
   intended, as it would have afforded, if the prophets had not understood
   their predictions in the sense it is supposed they did because there is
   no presumption of their sense of them being the whole sense of them.
   And it has been already shown, that the apparent completions of
   prophecy must be allowed to be explanatory of its meaning. So that the
   question is, whether a series of prophecy has been fulfilled, in a
   natural or proper, i. e. in any real sense of the words of it. For such
   completion is equally a proof of foresight more than human, whether the
   prophets are, or are not, supposed to have understood it in a different
   sense. I say, supposed: for, though I think it clear, that the prophets
   did not understand the full meaning of their predictions; it is another
   question, how far they thought they did, and in what sense they
   understood them.

   Hence may be seen, to how little purpose those persons busy themselves,
   who endeavour to prove, that the prophetic history is applicable to
   events of the age in which it was written, or of ages before it. Indeed
   to have proved this, before there was any appearance of a further
   completion of it, might have answered some purpose; for it might have
   prevented the expectation of any such further completion. Thus could
   Porphyry have shown, that some principal parts of the book of Daniel
   for instance, the seventh verse of the seventh chapter, which the
   Christians interpreted of the latter ages, was applicable to events,
   which happened before or about the age of Antiochus Epiphanes; this
   might have prevented them from expecting any further completion of it.
   And, unless there was then, as I think there must have been, external
   evidence concerning that book, more than is come down to us; such a
   discovery might have been a stumbling-block in the way of Christianity
   itself: considering the authority which our Saviour has given to the
   book of Daniel, and how much the general scheme of Christianity
   presupposes the truth of it. But even this discovery, had there been
   any such, [213] would be of very little weight with reasonable men now;
   if this passage, thus applicable to events before the age of Porphyry,
   appears to be applicable also to events, which succeeded the
   dissolution of the Roman empire. I mention this, not at all as
   intending to insinuate, that the division of this empire into ten
   parts, for it plainly was divided into about that number, were, alone
   and by itself, of any moment in verifying the prophetic history: but
   only as an example of the thing I am speaking of. And thus upon the
   whole, the matter of inquiry evidently must be, as above put, Whether
   the prophecies are applicable to Christ, and to the present state of
   the world, and of the church; applicable in such a degree, as to imply
   foresight: not whether they are capable of any other application;
   though I know no pretence for saying the general turn of them is
   capable of any other.

   These observations are, I think, just; and the evidence referred to in
   them real: though there may be people who will not accept of such
   imperfect information from Scripture. Some too have not integrity and
   regard enough to truth, to attend to evidence, which keeps the mind in
   doubt, perhaps perplexity, and which is much of a different sort from
   what they expected. And it plainly requires a degree of modesty and
   fairness, beyond what every one has, for a man to say, not to the
   world, but to himself, that there is a real appearance of somewhat of
   great weight in this matter, though he is not able thoroughly to
   satisfy himself about it; but it shall have its influence upon him, in
   proportion to its appearing reality and weight. It is much more easy,
   and more falls in with the negligence, presumption, and wilfulness of
   the generality, to determine at once, with a decisive air, There is
   nothing in it. The prejudices arising from that absolute contempt and
   scorn, with which this evidence is treated in the world, I do not
   mention. For what indeed can be said to persons, who are weak enough in
   their understandings to think this any presumption against it, or, if
   they do not, are yet weak enough in their temper to be influenced by
   such prejudices, upon such a subject?

   I shall now, Secondly, endeavour to give some account of the general
   argument for the truth of Christianity, consisting both of the direct
   and circumstantial evidence considered as making up one argument.
   Indeed to state and examine this argument fully, would be a work much
   beyond the compass of this whole treatise; nor is so much as a proper
   abridgment of it to be expected here. Yet the present subject requires
   to have some brief account of it given. For it is the kind of evidence,
   upon which most questions of difficulty, in common practice, are
   determined: evidence arising from various coincidences, which support
   and confirm each other, and in this manner prove, with more or less
   certainty, the point under consideration. And I choose to do it also:
   First, because it seems to be of the greatest importance, and not duly
   attended to by every one, that the proof of revelation is, not some
   direct and express things only, but a great variety of circumstantial
   things also; and that though each of these direct and circumstantial
   things is indeed to be considered separately, yet they are afterwards
   to be joined together; for that the proper force of the evidence
   consists in the result of those several things, considered in their
   respects to each other, and united into one view: and in the next
   place, because it seems to me, that the matters of fact here set down,
   which are acknowledged by unbelievers, must be acknowledged by them
   also to contain together a degree of evidence of great weight, if they
   could be brought to lay these several things before themselves
   distinctly, and then with attention consider them together; instead of
   that cursory thought of them, to which we are familiarized. For being
   familiarized to the cursory thought of things as really hinders the
   weight of them from being seen, as from having its due influence upon
   practice. The thing asserted, and the truth of which is to be inquired
   into, is this: That over and above our reason and affections, which God
   has given us for the information of our judgment and the conduct of our
   lives, he has also, by external revelation, given us an account of
   himself and his moral government over the world, implying a future
   state of rewards and punishments; i. e. hath revealed the system of
   natural religion: for natural religion may be externally [214] revealed
   by God, as the ignorant may be taught it by mankind, their fellow
   creatures--that God, I say, has given us the evidence of revelation, as
   well as the evidence of reason, to ascertain this moral system;
   together with an account of a particular dispensation of Providence,
   which reason could no way have discovered, and a particular institution
   of religion founded on it, for the recovery of mankind out of their
   present wretched condition, and raising them to the perfection and
   final happiness of their nature.

   This revelation, whether real or supposed, may be considered as wholly
   historical. For prophecy is nothing but the history of events before
   they come to pass; doctrines also are matters of fact; and precepts
   come under the same notion. And the general design of Scripture, which
   contains in it this revelation, thus considered as historical, may be
   said to be, to give us an account of the world, in this one single
   view, as God's world: by which it appears essentially distinguished
   from all other books, so far as I have found, except such as are copied
   from it. It begins with an account of God's creation of the world, in
   order to ascertain, and distinguish from all others, who is the object
   of our worship, by what he has done: in order to ascertain, who he is,
   concerning whose providence, commands, promises, and threatenings, this
   sacred book, all along, treats; the Maker and Proprietor of the world,
   he whose creatures we are, the God of Nature: in order likewise to
   distinguish him from the idols of the nations, which are either
   imaginary beings, i. e. no beings at all; or else part of that
   creation, the historical relation of which is here given. And St John,
   not improbably, with an eye to this Mosaic account of the creation,
   begins his Gospel with an account of our Saviour's pre-existence, and
   that all things were made by him; and without him was not any thing
   made that was made: [215] agreeably to the doctrine of St Paul, that
   God created all things by Jesus Christ. [216] This being premised, the
   Scripture, taken together, seems to profess to contain a kind of an
   abridgment of the history of the world, in the view just now mentioned:
   that is, a general account of the condition of religion and its
   professors, during the continuance of that apostasy from God, and state
   of wickedness. which it every where supposes the world to lie in. And
   this account of the state of religion carries with it some brief
   account of the political state of things, as religion is affected by
   it. Revelation indeed considers the common affairs of this world, and
   what is going on in it, as a mere scene of distraction; and cannot be
   supposed to concern itself with foretelling at what time Rome, or
   Babylon, or Greece, or any particular place, should be the most
   conspicuous seat of that tyranny and dissoluteness, which all places
   equally aspire to be; cannot, I say, be supposed to give any account of
   this wild scene for its own sake. But it seems to contain some very
   general account of the chief governments of the world, as the general
   state of religion has been, is, or shall be, affected by them, from the
   first transgression, and during the whole interval of the world's
   continuing in its present state, to a certain future period, spoken of
   both in the Old and New Testament, very distinctly, and in great
   variety of expression: The times of the restitution of all things:
   [217] when the mystery of God shall be finished, as he hath declared to
   his servants the prophets: [218] when the God of heaven shall set up a
   kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be
   left to other people, [219] as it is represented to be during this
   apostasy, but judgment shall be given to the saints, [220] and they
   shall reign: [221] and the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of
   the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the
   saints of the Most High [222]

   Upon this general view of the Scripture, I would remark, how great a
   length of time the whole relation takes up, near six thousand years of
   which are past; and how great a variety of things it treats of; the
   natural and moral system or history of the world, including the time
   when it was formed, all contained in the very first book, and evidently
   written in a rude and unlearned age; and in subsequent books, the
   various common and prophetic history, and the particular dispensation
   of Christianity. Now all this together gives the largest scope for
   criticism; and for confutation of what is capable of being confuted,
   either from reason, or from common history, or from any inconsistence
   in its several parts. And it is a thing which deserves, I think, to be
   mentioned, that whereas some imagine the supposed doubtfulness of the
   evidence for revelation implies a positive argument that it is not
   true; it appears, on the contrary, to imply a positive argument that it
   is true. For, could any common relation of such antiquity, extent, and
   variety (for in these things the stress of what I am now observing
   lies), be proposed to the examination of the world: that it could not,
   in an age of knowledge and liberty, be confuted, or shown to have
   nothing in it, to the satisfaction of reasonable men; this would be
   thought a strong presumptive proof of its truth. And indeed it must be
   a proof of it, just in proportion to the probability, that if it were
   false, it might be shown to be so: and this, I think, is scarce
   pretended to be shown, but upon principles and in ways of arguing,
   which have been clearly obviated. [223] Nor does it at all appear, that
   any set of men, who believe natural religion, are of the opinion, that
   Christianity has been thus confuted. But to proceed:

   Together with the moral system of the world, the Old Testament contains
   a chronological account of the beginning of it, and from thence, an
   unbroken genealogy of mankind for many ages before common history
   begins; and carried on as much farther as to make up a continued thread
   of history of the length of between three and four thousand years. It
   contains an account of God's making a covenant with a particular
   nation, that they should be his people, and he would be their God, in a
   peculiar sense; of his often interposing miraculously in their affairs;
   giving them the promise, and, long after, the possession, of a
   particular country; assuring them oi the greatest national prosperity
   in it, if they would worship him, in opposition to the idols which the
   rest of the world worshipped, and obey his commands; and threatening
   them with unexampled punishments if they disobeyed him, and fell into
   the general idolatry: insomuch that this one nation should continue to
   be the observation and the wonder of all the world. It declares
   particularly, that God would scatter them among all people, from one
   end of the earth unto the other; but that when they should return unto
   the Lord their God, he would have compassion upon them, and gather them
   from all the nations, whither he had scattered them: that Israel should
   be saved in the Lord, with an everlasting salvation; and not be ashamed
   or confounded world without end. And as some of these promises are
   conditional, others are as absolute, as any thing can be expressed:
   that the time should come, when the people should be all righteous, and
   inherit the land for ever: that though God would make a full end of all
   nations whither he had scattered them, yet would he not make a full end
   of them: that he would bring again the captivity of his people Israel,
   and plant them upon their land, and they should be no more pulled up
   out of their land: that the seed of Israel should not cease from being
   a nation for ever. [224] It foretells, that God would raise them up a
   particular person, in whom all his promises should finally be
   fulfilled; the Messiah, who should be, in a high and eminent sense,
   their anointed Prince and Saviour. This was foretold in such a manner,
   as raised a general expectation of such a person in the nation, as
   appears from the New Testament, and is an acknowledged fact; an
   expectation of his coming at such a particular time, before any one
   appeared claiming to be that person, and when there was no ground for
   such an expectation, but from the prophecies: which expectation,
   therefore, must in all reason be presumed to be explanatory of those
   prophecies, if there were any doubt about their meaning. It seems
   moreover to foretell, that this person should be rejected by that
   nation, to whom he had been so long promised, and though he was so much
   desired by them. [225] And it expressly foretells, that he should be
   the Saviour of the Gentiles; and even that the completion of the scheme
   contained in this book, and then begun, and in its progress, should be
   somewhat so great, that in comparison with it, the restoration of the
   Jews alone would be but of small account. It is a light thing that thou
   shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore
   the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the
   Gentiles, that thou mayest be for salvation unto the end of the earth.
   And, In the last days, the mountain of the Lord's house shall be
   established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the
   hills; and all nations shall flow into it--for out of Zion shall go
   forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall
   judge among the nations--and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that
   day, and the idols he shall utterly abolish. [226] The Scripture
   further contains an account, that at the time the Messiah was expected,
   a person rose up in this nation, claiming to be that Messiah, to be the
   person whom all the prophecies referred to, and in whom they should
   centre: that he spent some years in a continued course of miraculous
   works; and endued his immediate disciples and followers with a power of
   doing the same, as proof of the truth of that religion, which he
   commissioned them to publish: that, invested with this authority and
   power, they made numerous converts in the remotest countries, and
   settled and established his religion in the world; to the end of which
   the Scripture professes to give a prophetic account of the state of
   this religion amongst mankind.

   Let us now suppose a person utterly ignorant of history, to have all
   this related to him out of the Scripture. Or suppose such a one, having
   the Scripture put into his hands, to remark these things in it, not
   knowing but that the whole, even its civil history, as well as the
   other parts of it, might be, from beginning to end, an entire
   invention; and to ask, What truth was in it, and whether the revelation
   here related was real, or a fiction And, instead of a direct answer,
   suppose him, all at once, to be told the following confessed facts; and
   then to unite them into one view.

   Let him first be told, in how great a degree the profession and
   establishment of natural religion, the belief that there is one God to
   be worshipped, that virtue is his law, and that mankind shall be
   rewarded and punished hereafter, as they obey and disobey it here; in
   how very great a degree, I say, the profession and establishment of
   this moral system in the world is owing to the revelation whether real
   or supposed, contained in this book: the establishment of this moral
   system, even in those countries which do not acknowledge the proper
   authority of the Scripture. [227] Let him be told also, what number of
   nations do acknowledge its proper authority. Let him then take in the
   consideration, of what importance religion is to mankind. And upon
   these things he might, I think, truly observe, that this supposed
   revelation's obtaining and being received in the world, with all the
   circumstances and effects of it, considered together as one event, is
   the most conspicuous and important event in the history of mankind:
   that a book of this nature, and thus promulged and recommended to our
   consideration, demands, as if by a voice from heaven, to have its
   claims most seriously examined into: and that, before such examination,
   to treat it with any kind of scoffing and ridicule, is an offence
   against natural piety. But it is to be remembered, that how much soever
   the establishment of natural religion in the world is owing to the
   Scripture revelation, this does not destroy the proof of religion from
   reason, any more than the proof of Euclid's Elements is destroyed, by a
   man's knowing or thinking, that he should never have seen the truth of
   the several propositions contained in it, nor had those propositions
   come into his thoughts, but for that mathematician.

   Let such a person as we are speaking of be, in the next place, informed
   of the acknowledged antiquity of the first parts of this book; and that
   its chronology, its account of the time when the earth, and the several
   parts of it, were first peopled with human creatures, is no way
   contradicted, but is really confirmed, by the natural and civil history
   of the world, collected from common historians, from the state of the
   earth, and from the late invention of arts and sciences. And as the
   Scripture contains an unbroken thread of common and civil history, from
   the creation to the captivity, for between three and four thousand
   years; let the person we are speaking of be told, in the next place,
   that this general history, as it is not contradicted, but is confirmed
   by profane history as much as there would be reason to expect, upon
   supposition of its truth; so there is nothing in the whole history
   itself, to give any reasonable ground of suspicion of its not being, in
   the general, a faithful and literally true genealogy of men, and series
   of things. I speak here only of the common Scripture-history, or of the
   course of ordinary events related in it, as distinguished from
   miracles, and from the prophetic history. In all the
   Scripture-narrations of this kind, following events arise out of
   foregoing ones, as in all other histories. There appears nothing
   related as done in any age, not conformable to the manners of that age:
   nothing in the account of a succeeding age, which, one would say, could
   not be true, or was improbable, from the account of things in the
   preceding one. There is nothing in the characters, which would raise a
   thought of their being feigned; but all the internal marks imaginable
   of their being real. It is to be added also, that mere genealogies,
   bare narratives of the number of years, which persons called by such
   and such names lived, do not carry the face of fiction; perhaps do
   carry some presumption ol veracity: and all unadorned narratives, which
   have nothing to surprise, may be thought to carry somewhat of the like
   presumption too. And the domestic and the political history is plainly
   credible. There may be incidents in Scripture, which, taken alone in
   the naked way they are told, may appear strange; especially to persons
   of other manners, temper, education: but there are also incidents of
   undoubted truth, in many or most persons' lives, which, in the same
   circumstances, would appear to the full as strange. There may be
   mistakes of transcribers, there may be other real or seeming mistakes,
   not easy to be particularly accounted for: but there are certainly no
   more things of this kind in the Scripture, than what were to have been
   expected in books of such antiquity; and nothing, in any wise,
   sufficient to discredit the general narrative. Now, that a history,
   claiming to commence from the creation, and extending in one continued
   series, through so great a length of time, and variety of events,
   should have such appearances of reality and truth in its whole
   contexture, is surely a very remarkable circumstance in its favour. And
   as all this is applicable to the common history of the New Testament,
   so there is a further credibility, and a very high one, given to it by
   profane authors: many of these writing of the same times, and
   confirming the truth of customs and events, which are incidentally as
   well as more purposely mentioned in it. And this credibility of the
   common Scripture-history, gives some credibility to its miraculous
   history: especially as this is interwoven with the common, so as that
   they imply each other, and both together make up one relation.

   Let it then be more particularly observed to this person, that it is an
   acknowledged matter of facts which is indeed implied in the foregoing
   observation, that there was such a nation as the Jews, of the greatest
   antiquity, whose government and general polity was founded on the law,
   here related to be given them by Moses as from heaven: that natural
   religion, though with rites additional yet no way contrary to it, was
   their established religion, which cannot be said of the Gentile world:
   and that their very being as a nation, depended upon their
   acknowledgment of one God, the God of the universe. For, suppose in
   their captivity in Babylon, they had gone over to the religion of their
   conquerors, there would have remained no bond of union, to keep them a
   distinct people. And whilst they were under their own kings, in their
   own country, a total apostasy from God would have been the dissolution
   of their whole government. They in such a sense nationally acknowledged
   and worshipped the Maker of heaven and earth, when the rest of the
   world were sunk in idolatry, as rendered them, in fact, the peculiar
   people of God. And this so remarkable an establishment and preservation
   of natural religion amongst them, seems to add some peculiar
   credibility to the historical evidence for the miracles of Moses and
   the Prophets: because these miracles are a full satisfactory account of
   this event, which plainly wants to be accounted for, and cannot
   otherwise.

   Let this person, supposed wholly ignorant of history, be acquainted
   further, that one claiming to be the Messiah, of Jewish extraction,
   rose up at the time when this nation, from the prophecies above
   mentioned, expected the Messiah: that he was rejected, as it seemed to
   have been foretold he should, by the body of the people, under the
   direction of their rulers: that in the course of a very few years, he
   was believed on and acknowledged as the promised Messiah, by great
   numbers among the Gentiles, agreeably to the prophecies of Scripture,
   yet not upon the evidence of prophecy, but of miracles, [228] of which
   miracles we have also strong historical evidence; (by which I mean here
   no more than must be acknowledged by unbelievers; for let pious frauds
   and follies be admitted to weaken, it is absurd to say they destroy,
   our evidence of miracles wrought in proof of Christianity: [229] ) that
   this religion approving itself to the reason of mankind, and carrying
   its own evidence with it, so far as reason is a judge of its system,
   and being no way contrary to reason in those parts of it which require
   to be believed upon the mere authority of its Author; that this
   religion, I say, gradually spread and supported itself for some hundred
   years, not only without any assistance from temporal power, but under
   constant discouragements, and often the bitterest persecutions from it;
   and then became the religion of the world: that in the mean time the
   Jewish nation and government were destroyed in a very remarkable
   manner, and the people carried away captive and dispersed through the
   most distant countries; in which state of dispersion they have remained
   fifteen hundred years: and that they remain a numerous people, united
   amongst themselves, and distinguished from the rest of the world, as
   they were in the days of Moses, by the profession of his law; and every
   where looked upon in a manner, which one scarce knows how distinctly to
   express, but in the words of the prophetic account of it, given so many
   ages before it came to pass: Thou shalt become an astonishment, a
   proverb, and a by-word, among all nations whither the Lord shall lead
   thee. [230]

   The appearance of a standing miracle, in the Jews remaining a distinct
   people in their dispersion, and the confirmation which this event
   appears to give to the truth of revelation, may be thought to be
   answered, by their religion's forbidding them intermarriages with those
   of any other, and prescribing them a great many peculiarities in their
   food, by which they are debarred from the means of incorporating with
   the people in whose countries they live. This is not, I think, a
   satisfactory account of that which it pretends to account for. But what
   does it pretend to account for? The correspondence between this event
   and the prophecies; or the coincidence of both, with a long
   dispensation of Providence, of a peculiar nature, towards that people
   formerly? No. It is only the event itself, which is offered to be thus
   accounted for; which single event, taken alone, abstracted from all
   such correspondence and coincidence, perhaps would not have appeared
   miraculous: but that correspondence and coincidence may be so, though
   the event itself be supposed not. Thus the concurrence of our Saviour's
   being born at Bethlehem, with a long foregoing series of prophecy and
   other coincidences, is doubtless miraculous; the series of prophecy,
   and other coincidences, and the event, being admitted: though the event
   itself, his birth at that place, appears to have been brought about in
   a natural way; of which, however, no one can be certain.

   And as several of these events seem, in some degree expressly, to have
   verified the prophetic history already; so likewise they may be
   considered further; as having a peculiar aspect towards the full
   completion of it; as affording some presumption that the whole of it
   shall, one time or other, be fulfilled. Thus, that the Jews have been
   so wonderfully preserved in their long and wide dispersion; which is
   indeed the direct fulfilling of some prophecies, but is now mentioned
   only as looking forward to somewhat yet to come: that natural religion
   came forth from Judea, and spread, in the degree it has done over the
   world, before lost in idolatry; which, together with some other things,
   have distinguished that very place, in like manner as the people of it
   are distinguished. that this great change of religion over the earth
   was brought about under the profession and acknowledgment, that Jesus
   was the promised Messiah: things of this kind naturally turn the
   thoughts of serious men towards the full completion of the prophetic
   history, concerning the final restoration of that people; concerning
   the establishment of the everlasting kingdom among them, the kingdom of
   the Messiah; and the future state of the world, under this sacred
   government. Such circumstances and events, compared with these
   prophecies, though no completions of them, yet would not, I think, be
   spoken of as nothing in the argument, by a person upon his first being
   informed of them. They fall in with the prophetic history of things
   still future, give it some additional credibility, have the appearance
   of being somewhat in order to the full completion of it.

   Indeed it requires a good degree of knowledge, and great calmness and
   consideration, to be able to judge thoroughly of the evidence for the
   truth of Christianity, from that part of the prophetic history which
   relates to the situation of the kingdoms of the world, and to the state
   of the church, from the establishment of Christianity to the present
   time. But it appears from a general view of it, to be very material.
   And those persons who have thoroughly examined it, and some of them
   were men of the coolest tempers, greatest capacities, and least liable
   to imputations of prejudice, insist upon it as determinately
   conclusive.

   Suppose now a person quite ignorant of history, first to recollect the
   passages above mentioned out of Scripture, without knowing but that the
   whole was a late fiction, then to be informed of the correspondent
   facts now mentioned, and to unite them all into one view: that the
   profession and establishment of natural religion in the world is
   greatly owing, in different ways, to this book, and the supposed
   revelation which it contains; that it is acknowledged to be of the
   earliest antiquity; that its chronology and common history are entirely
   credible; that this ancient nation, the Jews, of whom it chiefly
   treats, appear to have been, in fact, the people of God in a
   distinguished sense; that, as there was a national expectation amongst
   them, raised from the prophecies, of a Messiah to appear at such a
   time, so one at this time appeared claiming to be that Messiah; that he
   was rejected by this nation, but received by the Gentiles, not upon the
   evidence of prophecy, but of miracles; that the religion lie taught
   supported itself under the greatest difficulties, gained ground, and at
   length became the religion of the world; that in the mean time the
   Jewish polity was utterly destroyed, and the nation dispersed over the
   face of the earth; that notwithstanding this, they have remained a
   distinct numerous people for so many centuries, even to this day; which
   not only appears to be the express completion of several prophecies
   concerning them, but also renders it, as one may speak, a visible and
   easy possibility that the promises made to them as a nation, may yet be
   fulfilled. And to these acknowledged truths, let the person we have
   been supposing add as I think he ought, whether every one will allow it
   or no, the obvious appearances which there are, of the state of the
   world, in other respects besides what relates to the Jews, and of the
   Christian church, having so long answered, and still answering to the
   prophetic history. Suppose, I say, these facts set over against the
   things before mentioned out of the Scripture, and seriously compared
   with them; the joint view of both together must, I think, appear of
   very great weight to a considerate reasonable person: of much greater
   indeed, upon having them first laid before him, than is easy for us,
   who are so familiarized to them, to conceive, without some particular
   attention for that purpose.

   All these things, and the several particulars contained under them,
   require to be distinctly and most thoroughly examined into; that the
   weight of each may be judged of, upon such examination, and such
   conclusion drawn as results from their united force. But this has not
   been, attempted here. I have gone no further than to show, that the
   general imperfect view of them now given, the confessed historical
   evidence for miracles, and the many obvious appearing completions of
   prophecy, together with the collateral things [231] here mentioned, and
   there are several others of the like sort; that all this together,
   which, being fact, must be acknowledged by unbelievers, amounts to real
   evidence of somewhat more than human in this matter: evidence much more
   important, than careless men, who have been accustomed only to
   transient and partial views of it, can imagine; and indeed abundantly
   sufficient to act upon. And these things, I apprehend, must be
   acknowledged by unbelievers. For though they may say, that the
   historical evidence of miracles wrought in attestation of Christianity,
   is not sufficient to convince them, that such miracles were really
   wrought: they cannot deny, that there is such historical evidence, it
   being a known matter of fact that there is. They may say, the
   conformity between the prophecies and events is by accident: but there
   are many instances in which such conformity itself cannot be denied.
   They may say, with regard to such kind of collateral things as those
   above mentioned, that any odd accidental events, without meaning, will
   have a meaning found in them by fanciful people: and that such as are
   fanciful in any one certain way, will make out a thousand coincidences,
   which seem to favour their peculiar follies Men, I say, may talk thus:
   but no one who is serious, can possibly think these things to be
   nothing, if he considers the importance of collateral things, and even
   of lesser circumstances, in the evidence of probability, as
   distinguished in nature, from the evidence of demonstration. In many
   cases indeed it seems to require the truest judgment, to determine with
   exactness the weight of circumstantial evidence: but it is very often
   altogether as convincing, as that which is the most express and direct.

   This general view of the evidence for Christianity, considered as
   making one argument, may also serve to recommend to serious persons, to
   set down every thing which they think may be of any real weight at all
   in proof of it, and particularly the many seeming completions of
   prophecy: and they will find, that, judging by the natural rules, by
   which we judge of probable evidence in common matters, they amount to a
   much higher degree of proof, upon such a joint review. than could be
   supposed upon considering them separately, at different times; how
   strong soever the proof might before appear to them, upon such separate
   views of it. For probable proofs, by being added, not only increase the
   evidence, but multiply it. Nor should I dissuade any one from setting
   down, what he thought made for the contrary side. But then it is to be
   remembered, not in order to influence his judgment, but his practice,
   that a mistake on one side may be, in its consequences, much more
   dangerous, than a mistake on the other. And what course is most safe,
   and what most dangerous, is a consideration thought very material, when
   we deliberate, not concerning events, but concerning conduct in our
   temporal affairs. To be influenced by this consideration in our
   judgment, to believe or disbelieve upon it, is indeed as much
   prejudice, as any thing whatever. And, like other prejudices, it
   operates contrary ways, in different men; for some are inclined to
   believe what they hope, and others what they fear. And it is manifest
   unreasonableness to apply to men's passions in order to gain their
   assent. But in deliberations concerning conduct, there is nothing which
   reason more requires to be taken into the account, than the importance
   of it. For, suppose it doubtful, what would be the consequence of
   acting in this, or in a contrary manner: still, that taking one side
   could be attended with little or no bad consequence, and taking the
   other might be attended with the greatest, must appear, to unprejudiced
   reason, of the highest moment towards determining, how we are to act.
   But the truth of our religion, like the truth of common matters, is to
   be judged of by all the evidence taken together. And unless the whole
   series of things which may be alleged in this argument, and every
   particular thing in it, can reasonably be supposed to have been by
   accident (for here the stress of the argument for Christianity lies);
   then is the truth of it proved: in like manner, as if in any common
   case, numerous events acknowledged, were to be alleged in proof of any
   other event disputed; the truth of the disputed event would be proved,
   not only if any one of the acknowledged ones did of itself clearly
   imply it but, though no one of them singly did so, if the whole of the
   acknowledged events taken together could not in reason be supposed to
   have happened, unless the disputed one were true.

   It is obvious, how much advantage the nature of this evidence gives to
   those persons who attack Christianity, especially in conversation. For
   it is easy to show, in a short and lively manner, that such and such
   things are liable to objection, that this and another thing is of
   little weight in itself; but impossible to show, in like manner, the
   united force of the whole argument in one view.

   However, lastly, as it has been made appear, that there is no
   presumption against a revelation as miraculous; that the general scheme
   of Christianity, and the principal parts of it, are conformable to the
   experienced constitution of things, and the whole perfectly credible:
   so the account now given of the positive evidence for it, shows, that
   this evidence is such, as, from the nature of it, cannot be destroyed,
   though it should be lessened.

  OF THE OBJECTIONS WHICH MAY BE MADE AGAINST ARGUING FROM THE ANALOGY OF
  NATURE, TO RELIGION.

   IF every one would consider, with such attention as they are bound,
   even in point of morality, to consider, what they judge and give
   characters of; the occasion of this chapter would be, in some good
   measure at least, superseded. But since this is not to be expected; for
   some we find do not concern themselves to understand even what they
   write against: since this treatise, in common with most others, lies
   open to objections, which may appear very material to thoughtful men at
   first sight; and, besides that, seems peculiarly liable to the
   objections of such as can judge without thinking, and of such as can
   censure without judging; it may not be amiss to set down the chief of
   these objections which occur to me, and consider them to their hands.
   And they are such as these:

   "That it is a poor thing to solve difficulties in revelation, by
   saying, that there are the same in natural religion; when what is
   wanting is to clear both of them of these their common, as well as
   other their respective, difficulties: but that it is a strange way
   indeed of convincing men of the obligations of religion, to show them,
   that they have as little reason for their worldly pursuits: and a
   strange way of vindicating the justice and goodness of the Author of
   Nature, and of removing the objections against both, to which the
   system of religion lies open, to show, that the like objections lie
   against natural providence; a way of answering objections against
   religion, without so much as pretending to make out, that the system of
   it, or the particular things in it objected against, are
   reasonable--especially, perhaps some may be inattentive enough to add,
   Must this be thought strange, when it is confessed that analogy is no
   answer to such objections: that when this sort of reasoning is carried
   to the utmost length it can be imagined capable of, it will yet leave
   the mind in a very unsatisfied state; and that it must be unaccountable
   ignorance of mankind, to imagine they will be prevailed with to forego
   their present interests and pleasures, from regard to religion, upon
   doubtful evidence."

   Now, as plausible as this way of talking may appear, that appearance
   will be found in a great measure owing to half views, which show but
   part of an object, yet show that indistinctly, and to undeterminate
   language. By these means weak men are often deceived by others, and
   ludicrous men, by themselves. And even those, who are serious and
   considerate, cannot always readily disentangle, and at once clearly see
   through the perplexities, in which subjects themselves are involved;
   and which are heightened by the deficiencies and the abuse of words. To
   this latter sort of persons, the following reply to each part of this
   objection severally, may be of some assistance; as it may also tend a
   little to stop and silence others.

   First, The thing wanted, i. e. what men require, is to have all
   difficulties cleared; And this is, or, at least for any thing we know
   to the contrary, it may be, the same, as requiring to comprehend the
   Divine nature, and the whole plan of Providence from everlasting to
   everlasting. But it hath always been allowed to argue from what is
   acknowledged, to what is disputed. And it is in no other sense a poor
   thing, to argue from natural religion to revealed, in the manner found
   fault with, than it is to argue in numberless other ways of probable
   deduction and inference, in matters of conduct, which we are
   continually reduced to the necessity of doing. Indeed the epithet poor
   may be applied, I fear as properly, to great part or the whole of human
   life, as it is to the things mentioned in the objection. Is it not a
   poor thing, for a physician to have so little knowledge in the cure of
   diseases, as even the most eminent have? To act upon conjecture and
   guess, where the life of man is concerned? Undoubtedly it is: but not
   in comparison of having no skill at all in that useful art, and being
   obliged to act wholly in the dark.

   Further: since it is as unreasonable, as it is common, to urge
   objections against revelation, which are of equal weight against
   natural religion; and those who do this, if they are not confused
   themselves, deal unfairly with others, in making it seem, that they are
   arguing only against revelation, or particular doctrines of it, when in
   reality they are arguing against moral providence; it is a thing of
   consequence to show, that such objections are as much levelled against
   natural religion, as against revealed. And objections, which are
   equally applicable to both, are properly speaking answered, by its
   being shown that they are so, provided the former be admitted to be
   true. And without taking in the consideration how distinctly this is
   admitted, it is plainly very material to observe, that as the things
   objected against in natural religion are of the same kind with what is
   certain matter of experience in the course of providence, and in the
   information which God affords us concerning our temporal interest under
   his government; so the objections against the system of Christianity,
   and the evidence of it, are of the very same kind with those which are
   made against the system and evidence of natural religion. However, the
   reader upon review may see, that most of the analogies insisted upon,
   even in the latter part of this treatise, do not necessarily require to
   have more taken for granted than is in the former; that there is an
   Author of nature, or natural Governor of the world: and Christianity is
   vindicated, not from its analogy to natural religion, but chiefly from
   its analogy to the experienced constitution of nature.

   Secondly, Religion is a practical thing, and consists in such a
   determinate course of life, as being what, there is reason to think, is
   commanded by the Author of nature, and will, upon the whole, be our
   happiness under his government. Now if men can be convinced, that they
   have the like reason to believe this, as to believe that taking care of
   their temporal affairs will be to their advantage; such conviction
   cannot but be an argument to them for the practice of religion. And if
   there be really any reason for believing one of these, and endeavouring
   to preserve life, and secure ourselves the necessaries and conveniences
   of it; then there is reason also for believing the other, and
   endeavouring to secure the interest it proposes to us. And if the
   interest, which religion proposes to us, be infinitely greater than our
   whole temporal interest; then there must be proportionably greater
   reason for endeavouring to secure one, than the other; since, by the
   supposition, the probability of our securing one is equal to the
   probability of our securing the other. This seems plainly unanswerable;
   and has a tendency to influence fair minds, who consider what our
   condition really is, or upon what evidence we are naturally appointed
   to act; and who are disposed to acquiesce in the terms upon which we
   live, and attend to and follow that practical instruction, whatever it
   be, which is afforded us.

   But the chief and proper force of the argument referred to in the
   objection, lies in another place. For, it is said that the proof of
   religion is involved in such inextricable difficulties, as to render it
   doubtful; and that it cannot be supposed, that, if it were true, it
   would be left upon doubtful evidence. Here then, over and above the
   force of each particular difficulty or objection, these difficulties
   and objections taken together are turned into a positive argument
   against the truth of religion; which argument would stand thus. If
   religion were true, it would not be left doubtful, and open to
   objections to the degree in which it is: therefore that it is thus
   left, not only renders the evidence of it weak, and lessens its force,
   in proportion to the weight of such objections; but also shows it to be
   false, or is a general presumption of its being so. Now the
   observation, that, from the natural constitution and course of things,
   we must in our temporal concerns, almost continually, and in matters of
   great consequence, act upon evidence of a like kind and degree to the
   evidence of religion, is an answer to this argument; because it shows,
   that it is according to the conduct and character of the Author of
   nature to appoint we should act upon evidence like to that. which this
   argument presumes he cannot be supposed to appoint we should act upon:
   it is an instance, a general one, made up of numerous particular ones,
   of somewhat in his dealing with us, similar to what is said to be
   incredible. And as the force of this answer lies merely in the
   parallel, which there is between the evidence for religion and for our
   temporal conduct; the answer is equally just and conclusive, whether
   the parallel be made out, by showing the evidence of the former to be
   higher, or the evidence of the latter to be lower.

   Thirdly, The design of this treatise is not to vindicate the character
   of God, but to show the obligations of men: it is not to justify his
   providence, but to show what belongs to us to do. These are two
   subjects, and ought not to be confounded. And though they may at length
   run up into each other, yet observations may immediately tend to make
   out the latter, which do not appear, by any immediate connexion, to the
   purpose of the former; which is less our concern, than many seem to
   think. For, first, it is not necessary we should justify the
   dispensations of Providence against objections, any farther than to
   show, that the things objected against may, for ought we know, be
   consistent with justice and goodness. Suppose then, that there are
   things in the system of this world, and plan of Providence relating to
   it, which taken alone would be unjust: yet it has been shown
   unanswerably, that if we could take in the reference, which these
   things may have to other things present, past, and to come; to the
   whole scheme, which the things objected against are parts of; these
   very things might, for ought we know, be found to be, not only
   consistent with justice, but instances of it. Indeed it has been shown,
   by the analogy of what we see, not only possible that this may be the
   case, but credible that it is. And thus objections, drawn from such
   things, are answered, and Providence is vindicated, as far as religion
   makes its vindication necessary. Hence it appears, secondly, that
   objections against the Divine justice and goodness are not endeavoured
   to be removed, by showing that the like objections, allowed to be
   really conclusive, lie against natural providence: but those objections
   being supposed and shown not to be conclusive, the things objected
   against, considered as matters of fact, are farther shown to be
   credible, from their conformity to the constitution of nature; for
   instance, that God will reward and punish men for their actions
   hereafter, from the observation, that he does reward and punish them
   for their actions here. And this, I apprehend, is of weight. And I add,
   thirdly, it would be of weight, even though those objections were n6t
   answered. For, there being the proof of religion above set down; and
   religion implying several facts; for instance again, the fact last
   mentioned, that God will reward and punish men for their actions
   hereafter; the observation, that his present method of government is by
   rewards and punishments, shows that future fact not to be incredible:
   whatever objections men may think they have against it, as unjust or
   unmerciful, according to their notions of justice and mercy; or as
   improbable from their belief of necessity. I say, as improbable: for it
   is evident no objection against it, as unjust, can be urged from
   necessity; since this notion as much destroys injustice, as it does
   justice. Then, fourthly, Though objections against the reasonableness
   of the system of religion cannot indeed be answered without entering
   into consideration of its reasonableness; yet objections against the
   credibility or truth of it may. Because the system of it is reducible
   into what is properly matter of fact: and the truth, the probable truth
   of facts, may be shown without consideration of their reasonableness.
   Nor is it necessary, though, in some cases and respects, it is highly
   useful and proper, yet it is not necessary, to give a proof of the
   reasonableness of every precept enjoined us, and of every particular
   dispensation of Providence, which comes into the system of religion.
   Indeed the more thoroughly a person of a right disposition is convinced
   of the perfection of the Divine nature and conduct, the farther he will
   advance towards that perfection of religion, which St John [232] speaks
   of. But the general obligations of religion are fully made out, by
   proving the reasonableness of the practice of it. And that the practice
   of religion is reasonable, may be shown, though no more could be
   proved, than that the system of it may be so, for ought we know to the
   contrary: and even without entering into the distinct consideration of
   this. And from hence, fifthly, It is easy to see, that though the
   analogy of nature is not an immediate answer to objections against the
   wisdom, the justice, or goodness, of any doctrine or precept of
   religion; yet it may be, as it is, an immediate and direct answer to
   what is really intended by such objections; which is, to show that the
   things objected against are incredible.

   Fourthly, It is most readily acknowledged, that the foregoing treatise
   is by no means satisfactory; very far indeed from it: but so would any
   natural institution of life appear, if reduced into a system, together
   with its evidence. Leaving religion out of the case, men are divided in
   their opinions, whether our pleasures overbalance our pains: and
   whether it be, or be not, eligible to live in this world. And were all
   such controversies settled, which perhaps, in speculation, would be
   found involved in great difficulties; and were it determined upon the
   evidence of reason, as nature has determined it to our hands, that life
   is to be preserved: yet still, the rules which God has been pleased to
   afford us, for escaping the miseries of it, and obtaining its
   satisfactions, the rules, for instance, of preserving health, and
   recovering it when lost, are not only fallible and precarious, but very
   far from being exact. Nor are we informed by nature, in future
   contingencies and accidents, so as to render it at all certain, what is
   the best method of managing our affairs. What will be the success of
   our temporal pursuits, in the common sense of the word Success, is
   highly doubtful. And what will be the success of them in the proper
   sense of the word; i. e. what happiness or enjoyment we shall obtain by
   them, is doubtful in a much higher degree. Indeed the unsatisfactory
   nature of the evidence, with which we are obliged to take up, in the
   daily course of life, is scarce to be expressed. Yet men do not throw
   away life, or disregard the interests of it, upon account of this
   doubtfulness. The evidence of religion then being admitted real, those
   who object against it, as not satisfactory, i. e. as not being what
   they wish it, plainly forget the very condition of our being: for
   satisfaction, in this sense, does not belong to such a creature as man.
   And, which is more material, they forget also the very nature of
   religion. For, religion presupposes, in all those who will embrace it,
   a certain degree of integrity and honesty; which it was intended to try
   whether men have or not, and to exercise in such as have it, in order
   to its improvement. Religion presupposes this as much, and in the same
   sense, as speaking to a man presupposes he understands the language in
   which yon speak; or as warning a man of any danger presupposes that he
   hath such a regard to himself, as that he will endeavour to avoid it.
   And therefore the question is not at all, Whether the evidence of
   religion be satisfactory; but Whether it be, in reason, sufficient to
   prove and discipline that virtue, which it presupposes. Now the
   evidence of it is fully sufficient for all those purposes of probation;
   how far soever it is from being satisfactory, as to the purposes of
   curiosity, or any other: and indeed it answers the purposes of the
   former in several respects, which it would not do, if it were as
   overbearing as is required. One might add farther; that whether the
   motives or the evidence for any course of action be satisfactory,
   meaning here, by that word, what satisfies a man, that such a course of
   action will in event be for his good; this need never be, and I think,
   strictly speaking, never is, the practical question in common matters.
   But the practical question in all cases is, Whether the evidence for a
   course of action be such as, taking in all circumstances, makes the
   faculty within us, which is the guide and judge of conduct, [233]
   determine that course of action to be prudent. Indeed, satisfaction
   that it will be for our interest or happiness, abundantly determines an
   action to be prudent: but evidence almost infinitely lower than this,
   determines actions to be so too; even in the conduct of every day.

   Fifthly, As to the objection concerning the influence which this
   argument, or any part of it, may, or may not be expected to have upon
   men; I observe, as above, that religion being intended for a trial and
   exercise of the morality of every person's character, who is a subject
   of it; and there being, as I have shown, such evidence for it, as is
   sufficient, in reason, to influence men to embrace it: to object, that
   it is not to be imagined mankind will be influenced by such evidence,
   is nothing to the purpose of the foregoing treatise. For the purpose of
   it is not to inquire, what sort of creatures mankind are; but what the
   light and knowledge, which is afforded them, requires they should be:
   to show how, in reason, they ought to behave; not how, in fact, they
   will behave. This depends upon themselves, and is their own concern;
   the personal concern of each man in particular. And how little regard
   the generality have to it, experience indeed does too fully show. But
   religion, considered as a probation, has had its end upon all persons,
   to whom it has been proposed with evidence sufficient in reason to
   influence their practice: for by this means they have been put into a
   state of probation; let them behave as they will in it. And thus, not
   only revelation, but reason also, teaches us, that by the evidence of
   religion being laid before men, the designs of Providence are carrying
   on, not only with regard to those who will, but likewise with regard to
   those who will not, be influenced by it. However, lastly, the objection
   here referred to, allows the things insisted upon in this treatise to
   be of some weight; and if so, it may be hoped it will have some
   influence. And if there be a probability that it will have any at all,
   there is the same reason in kind, though not in degree, to lay it
   before men, as there would be, if it were likely to have a greater
   influence.

   And farther, I desire it may be considered, with respect to the whole
   of the foregoing objections, that in this treatise I have argued upon
   the principles of others, [234] not my own: and have omitted what I
   think true, and of the utmost importance, because by others thought
   unintelligible, or not true. Thus I have argued upon the principles of
   the Fatalists, which I do not believe: and have omitted a thing of the
   utmost importance which I do believe, the moral fitness and unfitness
   of actions, prior to all will whatever; which I apprehend as certainly
   to determine the Divine conduct, as speculative truth and falsehood
   necessarily determine the Divine judgment. Indeed the principle of
   liberty, and that of moral fitness, so force themselves upon the mind,
   that moralists, the ancients as well as moderns, have formed their
   language upon it. And probably it may appear in mine: though I have
   endeavoured to avoid it; and, in order to avoid it, have sometimes been
   obliged to express myself in a manner, which will appear strange to
   such as do not observe the reason for it: but the general argument here
   pursued does not at all suppose, or proceed upon these principles. Now,
   these two abstract principles of liberty and moral fitness being
   omitted, religion can be considered in no other view, than merely as a
   question of fact: and in this view it is here considered. It is
   obvious, that Christianity, and the proof of it, are both historical.
   And even natural religion is, properly, a matter of fact. For, that
   there is a righteous Governor of the world, is so: and this proposition
   contains the general system of natural religion. But then, several
   abstract truths, and in particular those two principles, are usually
   taken into consideration in the proof of it: whereas it is here treated
   of only as a matter of fact. To explain this: that the three angles of
   a triangle are equal to two right ones, is an abstract truth: but that
   they appear so to our mind, is only a matter of fact. And this last
   must have been admitted, if any thing was, by those ancient sceptics,
   who would not have admitted the former: but pretended to doubt, Whether
   there were any such thing as truth, or Whether we could certainly
   depend upon our faculties of understanding for the knowledge of it in
   any case. So likewise, that there is, in the nature of things, an
   original standard of right and wrong in actions, independent upon all
   will, but which unalterably determines the will of God, to exercise
   that moral government over the world, which religion teaches, i. e.
   finally and upon the whole to reward and punish men respectively as
   they act right or wrong; This assertion contains an abstract truth, as
   well as matter of fact. But suppose, in the present state, every man,
   without exception, was rewarded and punished, in exact proportion as he
   followed or transgressed that sense of right and wrong, which God has
   implanted in the nature of every man: this would not be at all an
   abstract truth, but only a matter of fact. And though this fact were
   acknowledged by every one; yet the very same difficulties might be
   raised as are now, concerning the abstract questions of liberty and
   moral fitness: and we should have a proof, even the certain one of
   experience, that the government of the world was perfectly moral,
   without taking in the consideration of those questions: and this proof
   would remain, in what way soever they were determined. And thus, God
   having given mankind a moral faculty, the object of which is actions,
   and which naturally approves some actions as right, and of good desert,
   and condemns others as wrong, and of ill desert; that he will, finally
   and upon the whole, reward the former and punish the latter, is not an
   assertion of an abstract truth, but of what is as mere a fact, as his
   doing so at present would be. This future fact I have not, indeed,
   proved with the force with which it might be proved, from the
   principles of liberty and moral fitness; but without them have given a
   really conclusive practical proof of it, which is greatly strengthened
   by the general analogy of nature: a proof easily cavilled at easily
   shown not to be demonstrative, for it is not offered as such; but
   impossible, I think, to be evaded, or answered. And thus the
   obligations of religion are made out, exclusively of the questions
   concerning liberty and moral fitness; which have been perplexed with
   difficulties and abstruse reasonings, as every thing may.

   Hence therefore may be observed distinctly, what is the force of this
   treatise. It will be, to such as are convinced of religion upon the
   proof arising out of the two last mentioned principles, an additional
   proof and a confirmation of it: to such as do not admit those
   principles, an original proof of it, [235] and a confirmation of that
   proof. Those who believe will here find the scheme of Christianity
   cleared of objections, and the evidence of it in a peculiar manner
   strengthened: those who do not believe will at least be shown the
   absurdity of all attempts to prove Christianity false, the plain
   undoubted credibility of it; and, I hope, a good deal more.

   And thus, though some perhaps may seriously think, that analogy, as
   here urged, has too great stress laid upon it; and ridicule,
   unanswerable ridicule, may be applied, to show the argument from it in
   a disadvantageous light; yet there can be no question, but that it is a
   real one. For religion, both natural and revealed, implying in it
   numerous facts; analogy, being a confirmation of all facts to which it
   can be applied, as it is the only proof of most, cannot but be admitted
   by every one to be a material thing, and truly of weight on the side of
   religion, both natural and revealed: and it ought to be particularly
   regarded by such as profess to follow nature, and to be less satisfied
   with abstract reasonings.

   [234] By arguing upon the principles of others, the reader will observe
   is meant, not proving any thing from those principles, but
   notwithstanding them. Thus religion is proved, not from the opinion of
   necessity; which is absurd: but, notwithstanding or even though that
   opinion were admitted to be true.

  CONCLUSION.

   WHATEVER account may be given of the strange inattention and disregard,
   in some ages and countries, to a matter of such importance as Religion;
   it would, before experience, be incredible, that there should be the
   like disregard in those, who have had the moral system of the world
   laid before them, as it is by Christianity, and often inculcated upon
   them: because this moral system carries in it a good degree of evidence
   for its truth, upon its being barely proposed to our thoughts. There is
   no need of abstruse reasonings and distinctions, to convince an
   unprejudiced understanding, that there is a God who made and governs
   the world, and will judge it in righteousness; though they may be
   necessary to answer abstruse difficulties, when once such are raised:
   when the very meaning of those words, which express most intelligibly
   the general doctrine of religion, is pretended to be uncertain; and the
   clear truth of the thing itself is obscured by the intricacies of
   speculation. But to an unprejudiced mind, ten thousand thousand
   instances of design cannot but prove a designer. And it is intuitively
   manifest, that creatures ought to live under a dutiful sense of their
   Maker; and that justice and charity must be his laws, to creatures whom
   he has made social, and placed in society. Indeed the truth of revealed
   religion, peculiarly so called, is not self-evident, but requires
   external proof, in order to its being received. Yet inattention, among
   us, to revealed religion, will be found to imply the same dissolute
   immoral temper of mind, as inattention to natural religion: because,
   when both are laid before us, in the manner they are in Christian
   countries of liberty, our obligations to inquire into both, and to
   embrace both upon supposition of their truth, are obligations of the
   same nature. For, revelation claims to be the voice of God: and our
   obligation to attend to his voice is surely moral in all cases. And as
   it is insisted, that its evidence is conclusive, upon thorough
   consideration of it; so it offers itself to us with manifest obvious
   appearances of having something more than human in it, and therefore in
   all reason requires to have its claims most seriously examined into. It
   is to be added, that though light and knowledge, in what manner soever
   afforded us, is equally from God; yet a miraculous revelation. has a
   peculiar tendency, from the first principles of our nature, to awaken
   mankind, and inspire them with reverence and awe: and this is a
   peculiar obligation, to attend to what claims to be so with such
   appearances of truth. It is therefore most certain, that our
   obligations to inquire seriously into the evidence of Christianity,
   and, upon supposition of its truth, to embrace it, are of the utmost
   importance, and moral in the highest and most proper sense. Let us then
   suppose, that the evidence of religion in general, and of Christianity,
   has been seriously inquired into, by all reasonable men among us. Yet
   we find many professedly to reject both, upon speculative principles of
   infidelity. And all of them dio not content themselves with a bare
   neglect of religion, and enjoying their imaginary freedom from its
   restraints. Some go much beyond this. They deride God's moral
   government over the world. They renounce his protection, and defy his
   justice. They ridicule and vilify Christianity, and blaspheme the
   author of it; and take all occasions to manifest a scorn and contempt
   of revelation. This amounts to an active setting themselves against
   religion; to what may be considered as a positive principle of
   irreligion; which they cultivate within themselves, and, whether they
   intend this effect or not, render habitual, as a good man does the
   contrary principle. And others, who are not chargeable with all this
   profligateness, yet are in avowed opposition to religion, as if
   discovered to be groundless. Now admitting, which is the supposition we
   go upon, that these persons act upon what they think principles of
   reason, and otherwise they are not to be argued with; it is really
   inconceivable, that they should imagine they clearly see the whole
   evidence of it, considered in itself, to be nothing at all: nor do they
   pretend this. They are far indeed from having a just notion of its
   evidence: but they would not say its evidence was nothing, if they
   thought the system of it, with all its circumstances, were credible,
   like other matters of science or history. So their manner of treating
   it must proceed, either from such kind of objections against all
   religion, as have been answered or obviated in the former part of this
   treatise; or else from objections, and difficulties, supposed more
   peculiar to Christianity. Thus, they entertain prejudices against the
   whole notion of a revelation, and miraculous interpositions. They find
   things in Scripture, whether in incidental passages, or in the general
   scheme of it, which appear to them unreasonable. They take for granted,
   that if Christianity were true, the light of it must have been more
   general, and the evidence of it more satisfactory, or rather
   overbearing: that it must and would have been. in some way, otherwise
   put and left, than it is. Now this is not imagining they see the
   evidence itself to be nothing, or inconsiderable; but quite another
   thing. It is being fortified against the evidence, in some degree
   acknowledged, by thinking they see the system of Christianity, or
   somewhat which appears to them necessarily connected with it, to be
   incredible or false; fortified against that evidence, which might,
   otherwise, make great impression upon them. Or, lastly, if any of these
   persons are, upon the whole, in doubt concerning the truth of
   Christianity; their behaviour seems owing to their taking for granted,
   through strange inattention, that such doubting is, in a manner, the
   same thing as being certain against it.

   To these persons, and to this state of opinion concerning religion, the
   foregoing treatise is adapted. For, all the general objections against
   the moral system of nature having been obviated, it is shown, that
   there is not any peculiar presumption at all against Christianity,
   either considered as not discoverable by reason, or as unlike to what
   is so discovered; nor any worth mentioning against it as miraculous, if
   any at all; none, certainly, which can render it in the least
   incredible. It is shown, that, upon supposition of a divine revelation,
   the analogy of nature renders it beforehand highly credible, I think
   probable, that many things in it must appear liable to great
   objections; and that we must be incompetent judges of it, to a great
   degree. This observation is, I think, unquestionably true, and of the
   very utmost importance: but it is urged, as I hope it will be
   understood, with great caution of not vilifying the faculty of reason,
   which is the candle of the Lord within us; [236] though it can afford
   no light, where it does not shine; nor judge, where it has no
   principles to judge upon. The objections here spoken of; being first
   answered in the view of objections against Christianity as a matter of
   fact, are in the next place considered as urged more immediately
   against the wisdom, justice, and goodness of the Christian
   dispensation. And it is fully made out, that they admit of exactly the
   like answer, in every respect, to what the like objections against the
   constitution of nature admit of: that, as partial views give the
   appearance of wrong to things, which, upon further consideration and
   knowledge of their relations to other things, are found just and good;
   so it is perfectly credible, that the things objected against the
   wisdom and goodness of the Christian dispensation, may be rendered
   instances of wisdom and goodness, by their reference to other things
   beyond our view: because Christianity is a scheme as much above our
   comprehension, as that of nature; and like that, a scheme in which
   means are made use of to accomplish ends, and which, as is most
   credible, may be carried on by general laws. And it ought to be
   attended to, that this is not an answer taken merely or chiefly from
   our ignorance; but from somewhat positive, which our observation shows
   us. For, to like objections, the like answer is experienced to be just,
   in numberless parallel cases. The objections against the Christian
   dispensation, and the method by which it is carried on, having been
   thus obviated, in general and together; the chief of them are
   considered distinctly, and the particular things objected to are shown
   credible, by their perfect analogy, each apart, to the constitution of
   nature. Thus, if man be fallen from his primitive state, and to be
   restored, and infinite wisdom and power engages in accomplishing our
   recovery: it were to have been expected, it is said, that this should
   have been effected at once; and not by such a long series of means, and
   such a various economy of persons and things; one dispensation
   preparatory to another, this to a further one, and so on through an
   indefinite number of ages, before the end of the scheme proposed can be
   completely accomplished; a scheme conducted by infinite wisdom, and
   executed by almighty power. But now, on the contrary, our finding that
   every thing in the constitution and course of nature is 1lus carried
   on, shows such expectations concerning revelation to be highly
   unreasonable; and is a satisfactory answer to them, when urged as
   objections against the credibility, that the great scheme of Providence
   in the redemption of the world may be of this kind, and to be
   accomplished in this manner. As to the particular method of our
   redemption, the appointment of a Mediator between God and man: this has
   been shown to be most obviously analogous to the general conduct of
   nature, i. e. the God of nature, in appointing others to be the
   instruments of his mercy, as we experience in the daily course of
   providence. The condition of this world, which the doctrine of our
   redemption by Christ presupposes, so much falls in with natural
   appearances, that heathen moralists inferred it from those appearances:
   Inferred, that human nature was fallen from its original rectitude, and
   in consequence of this, degraded from its primitive happiness. Or,
   however this opinion came into the world, these appearances must have
   kept up the tradition, and confirmed the belief of it. And as it was
   the general opinion under the light of nature, that repentance and
   reformation, alone and by itself, was not sufficient to do away sin,
   and procure a full remission of the penalties annexed to it; and as the
   reason of the thing does not at all lead to any such conclusion; so
   every day's experience shows us, that reformation is not, in any sort,
   sufficient to prevent the present disadvantages and miseries, which, in
   the natural course of things, God has annexed to folly and
   extravagance. Yet there may be ground to think, that the punishments,
   which, by the general laws of divine government, are annexed to vice,
   may be prevented: that provision may have been, even originally, made,
   that they should be prevented by some means or other, though they could
   not by reformation alone. For we have daily instances of such mercy, in
   the general conduct of nature: compassion provided for misery, [237]
   medicines for diseases, friends against enemies. There is provision
   made, in the original constitution of the world, that much of the
   natural bad consequences of our follies, which persons themselves alone
   cannot prevent, may be prevented by the assistance of others;
   assistance, which nature enables, and disposes, and appoints them to
   afford. By a method of goodness analog6us to this, when the world lay
   in wickedness, and consequently in ruin, God so loved the world, that
   he gave his only begotten Son to save it: and he being made perfect by
   suffering, became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey
   him. [238] Indeed neither reason nor analogy would lead us to think, in
   particular, that the interposition of Christ, in the manner in which he
   did interpose, would be of that efficacy for recovery of the world,
   which the Scripture teaches us it was: but neither would reason nor
   analogy lead us to think, that other particular means would be of the
   efficacy, which experience shows they are, in numberless instances. And
   therefore, as the case before us does not admit of experience; so, that
   neither reason nor analogy can show how, or in what particular way, the
   interposition of Christ, as revealed in Scripture, is of that efficacy,
   which it is there represented to be; this is no kind nor degree of
   presumption against its being really of that efficacy. Further: the
   objections against Christianity, from the light of it not being
   universal, nor its evidence sc strong as might possibly be given us,
   have been answered by the general analogy of nature. That God has made
   such variety of creatures, is indeed an answer to the former: but that
   he dispenses his gifts in such variety, both of degrees and kinds,
   amongst creatures of the same species, and even to the same individuals
   at different times; is a more obvious and full answer to it And it is
   so far from being the method of Providence in other cases, to afford us
   such overbearing evidence, as some require in proof of Christianity;
   that on the contrary, the evidence upon which we are naturally
   appointed to act in common matters, throughout a very great part of
   life, is doubtful in a high degree. And admitting the fact, that God
   has afforded to some no more than doubtful evidence of religion; the
   same account may be given of it, as of difficulties and temptations
   with regard to practice. But as it is not impossible, [239] surely,
   that this alleged doubtfulness may be men's own fault; it deserves
   their most serious consideration, whether it be not so. However, it is
   certain, that doubting implies a degree of evidence for that of which
   we doubt: and that this degree of evidence as really lays us under
   obligations as demonstrative evidence.

   The whole then of religion is throughout credible: nor is there, I
   think, any thing relating to the revealed dispensation of things, more
   different from the experienced constitution and course of nature, than
   some parts of the constitution of nature are from other parts of it.
   And if so, the only question which remains is, what positive evidence
   can be alleged for the truth of Christianity. This too in general has
   been considered, and the objections against it estimated. Deduct,
   therefore, what is to be deducted from that evidence, upon account of
   any weight which may be thought to remain in these objections, after
   what the analogy of nature has suggested in answer to them: and then
   consider, what are the practical consequences from all this, upon the
   most sceptical principles one can argue upon (for I am writing to
   persons who entertain these principles): and upon such consideration it
   will be obvious, that immorality, as little excuse as it admits of in
   itself, is greatly aggravated, in persons who have been made acquainted
   with Christianity, whether they believe it or not: because the moral
   system of nature, or natural religion, which Christianity lays before
   us, approves itself, almost intuitively, to a reasonable mind, upon
   seeing it proposed. In the next place, with regard to Christianity, it
   will be observed; that there is a middle between a full satisfaction of
   the truth of it, and a satisfaction of the contrary. The middle state
   of mind between these two consists in a serious apprehension, that it
   may be true, joined with doubt whether it be so. And this, upon the
   best judgment I am able to make, is as far towards speculative
   infidelity, as any sceptic can at all be supposed to go, who has had
   true Christianity, with the proper evidences' of it, laid before him,
   and has in any tolerable measure considered them. For I would not be
   mistaken to comprehend all who have ever heard of it: because it seems
   evident, that in many countries called Christian, neither Christianity,
   nor its evidence, are fairly laid before men And in places where both
   are, there appear to be some who have very little attended to either,
   and who reject Christianity with a scorn proportionate to their
   inattention; and yet are by no means without understanding in other
   matters. Now it has been shown, that a serious apprehension that
   Christianity may be true, lays persons under the strictest obligations
   of a serious regard to it, throughout the whole of their life; a regard
   not the same exactly, but in many respects nearly the same with what a
   full conviction of its truth would lay them under Lastly, it will
   appear, that blasphemy and profaneness, I mean with regard to
   Christianity, are absolutely without excuse. For there is no temptation
   to it, but from the wantonness of vanity or mirth; and these,
   considering the infinite importance of the subject, are no such
   temptations as to afford any excuse for it.. If this be a just account
   of things, and yet men can go on to vilify or disregard Christianity,
   which is to talk and act as if they had a demonstration of its
   falsehood; there is no reason to think they would alter their behaviour
   to any purpose, though there were a demonstration of its truth.

DISSERTATION I.

  OF PERSONAL IDENTITY.

   WHETHER we are to live in a future state, as it is the most important
   question which can possibly be asked, so it is the most intelligible
   one which can be expressed in language. Yet strange perplexities have
   been raised about the meaning of that identity or sameness of person,
   which is implied in the notion of our living now and hereafter, or in
   any two successive moments. And the solution of these difficulties hath
   been stranger than the difficulties themselves. For, personal identity
   has been explained so by some, as to render the inquiry concerning a
   future life of no consequence at all to us the persons who are making
   it. And though few men can be misled by such subtleties; yet it may be
   proper a little to consider them.

   Now, when it is asked wherein personal identity consists, the answer
   should be the same, as if it were asked wherein consists similitude, or
   equality; that all attempts to define would but perplex it. Yet there
   is no difficulty at all in ascertaining the idea. For as, upon two
   triangles being compared or viewed together, there arises to the mind
   the idea of similitude; or upon twice two and four, the idea of
   equality: so likewise, upon comparing the consciousness of one's self,
   or one's own existence, in any two moments, there as immediately arises
   to the mind the idea of personal identity. And as the two former
   comparisons not only give us the ideas of similitude and equality; but
   also show us, that two triangles are alike, and twice two and four are
   equal: so the latter comparison not only gives us the idea of personal
   identity, but also shows us the identity of ourselves in those two
   moments; the present, suppose, and that immediately past; or the
   present, and that a month, a year, or twenty years past. Or in other
   words, by reflecting upon that which is myself now, and that which was
   myself twenty years ago, I discern they are not two, but one and the
   same self.

   But though consciousness of what is past does thus ascertain our
   personal identity to ourselves, yet to say, that it makes personal
   identity, or is necessary to our being the same persons, is to say,
   that a person has not existed a single moment, nor done one action, but
   what he can remember; indeed none but what he reflects upon. And one
   should really think it self-evident, that consciousness of personal
   identity presupposes, and therefore cannot constitute, personal
   identity; any more than knowledge, in any other case, can constitute
   truth, which it presupposes.

   This wonderful mistake may possibly have arisen from hence; that to be
   endued with consciousness is inseparable from the idea of a person, or
   intelligent being. For, this might be expressed inaccurately thus, that
   consciousness makes personality: and from hence it might be concluded
   to make personal identity. But though present consciousness of what we
   at present do and feel is necessary to our being the persons we now
   are; yet present consciousness of past actions or feelings is not
   necessary to our being the same persons who performed those actions, or
   had those feelings.

   The inquiry, what makes vegetables the same in the common acceptation
   of the word, does not appear to have any relation to this of personal
   identity: because, the word same, when applied to them and to person,
   is not only applied to different subjects, but it is also used in
   different senses. For when a man swears to the same tree, as having
   stood fifty years in the same place, he means only the same as to all
   the purposes of property and uses of common life, and not that the tree
   has been all that time the same in the strict philosophical sense of
   the word. For he does not know, whether any one particle of the present
   tree be the same with any one particle of the tree which stood in the
   same place fifty years ago. And if they have not one common particle of
   matter, they cannot be the same tree in the proper philosophic sense of
   the word same: it being evidently a contradiction in terms, to say they
   are, when no part of their substance, and no one of their properties is
   the same: no part of their substance, by the supposition; no one of
   their properties, because it is allowed, that the same property cannot
   be transferred from one substance to another. And therefore when we say
   the identity or sameness of a plant consists in a continuation of the
   same life, communicated under the same organization, to a number of
   particles of matter, whether the same or not; the word same, when
   applied to life and to organization, cannot possibly be understood to
   signify, what it signifies in this very sentence, when applied to
   matter. In a loose and popular sense then, the life and the
   organization and the plant are justly said to be the same,
   notwithstanding the perpetual change of the parts. But in a strict and
   philosophical manner of speech, no man, no being, no mode of being, no
   anything, can be the same with that, with which it has indeed nothing
   the same. Now sameness is used in this latter sense, when applied to
   persons. The identity of these, therefore, cannot subsist with
   diversity of substance.

   The thing here considered, and demonstratively, as I think, determined,
   is proposed by Mr Locke in these words, Whether it, i. e. the same self
   or person, be the same identical substance? And he has suggested what
   is a much better answer to the question, than that which he gives it in
   form. For he defines Person, a thinking intelligent being, &c., and
   personal identity, the sameness of a rational Being. [240] The question
   then is, whether the same rational being is the same substance: which
   needs no answer, because Being and Substance, in this place, stand for
   the same idea. The ground of the doubt, whether the same person be the
   same substance, is said to be this; that the consciousness of our own
   existence, in youth and in old age, or in any two joint successive
   moments, is not the same individual action, [241] i. e. not the same
   consciousness, but different successive consciousnesses. Now it is
   strange that this should have occasioned such perplexities. For it is
   surely conceivable, that a person may hare a capacity of knowing some
   object or other to be the same now, which it was when he contemplated
   it formerly yet in this case, where, by the supposition, the object is
   perceived to be the same, the perception of it in any two moments
   cannot be one and the same perception. And thus, though the successive
   consciousnesses, which we have of our own existence, are not the same,
   yet are they consciousnesses of one and the same thing or object; of
   the same person, self, or living agent. The person, of whose existence
   the consciousness is felt now, and was felt an hour or a year ago, is
   discerned to be, not two persons, but one and the same person; and
   therefore is one and the same.

   Mr Locke's observations upon this subject appear hasty: and he seems to
   profess himself dissatisfied with suppositions, which he has made
   relating to it. [242] But some of those hasty observations have been
   carried to a strange length by others; whose notion, when traced and
   examined to the bottom, amounts, I think, to this: [243] "That
   Personality is not a permanent, but a transient thing: that it lives
   and dies, begins and ends continually: that no one can any more remain
   one and the same person two moments together, than two successive
   moments can be one and the same moment: that our substance is indeed
   continually changing; but whether this be so or not, is, it seems,
   nothing to the purpose; since it is not substance, but consciousness
   alone, which constitutes personality: which consciousness, being
   successive, cannot be the same in any two moments, nor consequently the
   personality constituted by it." And from hence it must follow, that it
   is a fallacy upon ourselves, to charge our present selves with any
   thing we did, or to imagine our present selves interested in any thing
   which befell us yesterday; or that our present self will be interested
   in what will befall us to-morrow: since our present self is not, in
   reality, the same with the self of yesterday, but another like self or
   person coming in its room, and mistaken for it; to which another self
   will succeed to-morrow. This, I say, must follow: for if the self or
   person of to-day, and that of to-morrow, are not the same, but only
   like persons; the person of to-day is really no more interested in what
   will befall the person of to morrow, than in what will befall any other
   person. It may be thought, perhaps, that this is not a just
   representation of the opinion we are speaking of: because those who
   maintain it allow, that a person is the same as far back as his
   remembrance reaches. And indeed they do use the words, identity, and
   same person. Nor will language permit these words to be laid aside;
   since if they were, there must be I know not what ridiculous
   periphrasis substituted in the room of them. But they cannot
   consistently with themselves, mean, that the person is really the same.
   For it is self-evident, that the personality cannot be really the same,
   if, as they expressly assert, that in which it consists is not the
   same. And as, consistently with themselves, they cannot, so, I think it
   appears, they do not, mean, that the person is really the same, but
   only that he is so in a fictitious sense: in such a sense only as they
   assert, for this they do assert, that any number of persons whatever
   may be the same person. The bare unfolding this notion, and laying it
   thus naked and open, seems the best confutation of it. However, since
   great stress is said to be put upon it, I add the following things.

   First, This notion is absolutely contradictory to that certain
   conviction, which necessarily and every moment rises within us, when we
   turn our thoughts upon ourselves, when we reflect upon what is past,
   and look forward upon what is to come. All imagination of a daily
   change of that living agent which each man calls himself, for another,
   or of any such change throughout our whole present life, is entirely
   borne down by our natural sense of things. Nor is it possible for a
   person in his wits to alter his conduct, with regard to his health or
   affairs, from a suspicion, that, though he should live to-morrow, he
   should not, however, be the same person he is to-day. And yet, if it be
   reasonable to act, with respect to a future life, upon this notion,
   that personality is transient; it is reasonable to act upon it, with
   respect to the present. Here then is a notion equally applicable to
   religion and to our temporal concerns; and every one sees and feels the
   inexpressible absurdity of it in the latter case; if, therefore, any
   can take up with it in the former, this cannot proceed from the reason
   of the thing, but must be owing to an inward unfairness, and secret
   corruption of heart.

   Secondly, It is not an idea, or abstract notion, or quality, but a
   being only, which is capable of life and action, of happiness and
   misery. Now all beings confessedly continue the same, during the whole
   time of their existence. Consider then a living being now existing, and
   which has existed for any time alive: this living being must have done
   and suffered and enjoyed, what it has done and suffered and enjoyed
   formerly (this living being, I say, and not another), as really as it
   does and suffers and enjoys, what it does and suffers and enjoys this
   instant. All these successive actions, enjoyments, and sufferings, are
   actions, enjoyments, and sufferings, of the same living being. And they
   are so, prior to all consideration of its remembering or forgetting:
   since remembering or forgetting can make no alteration in the truth of
   past matter of fact. And suppose this being endued with limited powers
   of knowledge and memory, there is no more difficulty in conceiving it
   to have a power of knowing itself to be the same living being which it
   was some time ago, of remembering some of its actions, sufferings, and
   enjoyments, and forgetting others, than in conceiving it to know or
   remember or forget any thing else.

   Thirdly, Every person is conscious, that he is now the same person or
   self he was as far back as his remembrance reaches: since when any one
   reflects upon a past action of his own, he is just as certain of the
   person who did that action, namely, himself, the person who now
   reflects upon it, as he is certain that the action was at all done.
   Nay, very often a person's assurance of an action having been done, of
   which he is absolutely assured, arises wholly from the consciousness
   that he himself did it. And this he, person, or self, must either be a
   substance, or the property of some substance. If he, if person, be a
   substance; then consciousness that he is the same person is
   consciousness that he is the same substance. If the person, or he, be
   the property of a substance, still consciousness that he is the same
   property is as certain a proof that his substance remains the same, as
   consciousness that he remains the same sub. stance would be: since the
   same property cannot be transferred from one substance to another.

   But though we are thus certain, that we are the same agents, living
   beings, or substances, now, which we were as far back as our
   remembrance reaches; yet it is asked, whether we may not possibly be
   deceived in it? And this question may be asked at the end of any
   demonstration whatever: because it is a question concerning the truth
   of perception by memory. And he who can doubt, whether perception by
   memory can in this case be depended upon, may doubt also, whether
   perception by deduction and reasoning, which also include memory, or
   indeed whether intuitive perception can. Here then we can go no
   further. For it is ridiculous to attempt to prove the truth of those
   perceptions, whose truth we can no otherwise prove, than by other
   perceptions of exactly the same kind with them, and which there is just
   the same ground to suspect; or to attempt to prove the truth of our
   faculties, which can no otherwise be proved, than by the use or means
   of those very suspected faculties themselves.

DISSERTATION II.

  OF THE NATURE OF VIRTUE.

   THAT which renders beings capable of moral government, is their having
   a moral nature, and moral faculties of perception and of action. Brute
   creatures are impressed and actuated by various instincts and
   propensions: so also are we. But additional to this, we have a capacity
   of reflecting upon actions and characters, and making them an object to
   our thought: and on doing this, we naturally and unavoidably approve
   some actions, under the peculiar view of their being virtuous and of
   good desert; and disapprove others, as vicious and of ill desert. That
   we have this moral approving and disapproving [244] faculty, is certain
   from our experiencing it in ourselves, and recognizing it in each
   other. It appears from our exercising it unavoidably, in the
   approbation and disapprobation even of feigned characters: from the
   words right and wrong, odious and amiable, base and worthy, with many
   others of like signification in all languages applied to actions and
   characters: from the many written systems of morals' which suppose it;
   since it cannot be imagined, that all these authors, throughout all
   these treatises, had absolutely no meaning at all to their words, or a
   meaning merely chimerical: from our natural sense of gratitude, which
   implies a distinction between merely being the instrument of good, and
   intending it: from the like distinction every one makes between injury
   and mere harm, which, Hobbes says, is peculiar to mankind; and between
   injury and just punishment, a distinction plainly natural, prior to the
   consideration of human laws. It is manifest great part of common
   language, and of common behaviour over the world, is formed upon
   supposition of such a moral faculty; whether called conscience, moral
   reason, moral sense, or divine reason; whether considered as a
   sentiment of the understanding, or as a perception of the heart; or,
   which seems the truth, as including both. Nor is it at all doubtful in
   the general, what course of action this faculty, or practical
   discerning power within us, approves and what it disapproves. For, as
   much as it has been disputed wherein virtue consists, or whatever
   ground for doubt there may be about particulars; yet, in general, there
   is in reality a universally acknowledged standard of it. It is that,
   which all ages and all countries have made profession of in public: it
   is that, which every man you meet puts on the show of: it is that which
   the primary and fundamental laws of all civil constitutions over the
   face of the earth make it their business and endeavour to enforce the
   practice of upon mankind: namely justice, veracity, and regard to
   common good. It being manifest then, in general, that we have such a
   faculty or discernment as this, it may be of use to remark some things
   more distinctly concerning it.

   First, It ought to be observed, that the object of this faculty is
   actions, [245] comprehending under that name active or practical
   principles: those principles from which men would act, if occasions and
   circumstances gave them power; and which, when fixed and habitual in
   any per son, we call his character. It does not appear, that brutes
   have the least reflex sense of actions, as distinguished from events:
   or that will and design, which constitute the very nature of actions as
   such, are at all an object to their perception. But to ours they are:
   and they are the object, and the only one, of the approving and
   disapproving faculty. Acting conduct, behaviour, abstracted from all
   regard to what is in fact and event, the consequence of it, is itself
   the natural object of the moral discernment; as speculative truth and
   falsehood is of speculative reason. Intention of such and such
   consequences, indeed, is always included; for it is part of the action
   itself: but though the intended good or bad consequences do not follow,
   we have exactly the same sense of the action as if they did. In like
   manner we think well or ill of characters, abstracted from all
   consideration of the good or the evil, which persons of such characters
   have it actually in their power to do. We never, in the moral way,
   applaud or blame either ourselves or others, for what we enjoy or what
   we suffer, or for having impressions made upon us which we consider as
   altogether out of our power: but only for what we do, or would have
   done, had it been in our power: or for what we leave undone, which we
   might have done, or would have left undone, though we could have done
   it.

   Secondly, Our sense or discernment of actions as morally good or evil,
   implies in it a sense or discernment of them as of good or ill
   discernment. It may be difficult to explain this perception, so as to
   answer all the questions which may be asked concerning it: but every
   one speaks of such and such actions as deserving punishment; and it is
   not, I suppose, pretended, that they have absolutely no meaning at all
   to the expression. Now the meaning plainly is not, that we conceive it
   for the good of society, that the doer of such actions should be made
   to suffer. For if, unhappily, it were resolved, that a man, who, by
   some innocent action, was infected with the plague, should be left to
   perish, lest, by other people's coming near him, the infection should
   spread; no one would say he deserved this treatment. Innocence and ill
   desert are inconsistent ideas. Ill desert always supposes guilt: and if
   one be no part of the other, yet they are evidently and naturally
   connected in our mind. The sight of a man in misery raises our
   compassion towards him; and, if this misery be inflicted on him by
   another, our indignation against the author of it. But when we are
   informed, that the sufferer is a villain, and is punished only for his
   treachery or cruelty; our compassion exceedingly lessens, and in many
   instances our indignation wholly subsides. Now what produces this
   effect is the conception of that in the sufferer, which we call ill
   desert. Upon considering then, or viewing together, our notion of vice
   and that of misery, there results a third, that of ill desert. And thus
   there is in human creatures an association of the two ideas, natural
   and moral evil, wickedness and punishment. If this association were
   merely artificial or accidental, it were nothing: but being most
   unquestionably natural, it greatly concerns us to attend to it, instead
   of endeavouring to explain it away.

   It may be observed further, concerning our perception of good and of
   ill desert, that the former is very weak with respect to common
   instances of virtue. One reason of which may be, that it does not
   appear to a spectator, how far such instances of virtue proceed from a
   virtuous principle, or in what degree this principle is prevalent:
   since a very weak regard to virtue may be sufficient to make men act
   well in many common instances. And on the other hand, our perception of
   ill desert in vicious actions lessens, in proportion to the temptations
   men are thought to have had to such vices. For, vice in human creatures
   consisting chiefly in the absence or want of the virtuous principle;
   though a man be overcome, suppose, by tortures, it does not from thence
   appear to what degree the virtuous principle was wanting. All that
   appears is, that he had it not in such a degree, as to prevail over the
   temptation; but possibly he had it in a degree, which would have
   rendered him proof against common temptations.

   Thirdly, Our perception of vice and ill desert arises from, and is the
   result of, a comparison of actions with the nature and capacities of
   the agent. For the mere neglect of doing what we ought to do, would, in
   many cases, be determined by all men to be in the highest degree
   vicious. And this determination must arise from such comparison, and be
   the result of it; because such neglect would not be vicious in
   creatures of other natures and capacities, as brutes. And it is the
   same also with respect to positive vices, or such as consist in doing
   what we ought not. For, every one has a different sense of harm done by
   an idiot, madman, or child, and by one of mature and common
   understanding; though the action of both, including the intention,
   which is part of the action, be the same: as it may be, since idiots
   and madmen, as well as children, are capable not only of doing
   mischief, but also of intending it. Now this difference must arise from
   somewhat discerned in the nature or capacities of one, which renders
   the action vicious; and the want of which, in the other, renders the
   same action innocent or less vicious: and this plainly supposes a
   comparison, whether reflected upon or not, between the action and
   capacities of the agent, previous to our determining an action to be
   vicious. And hence arises a proper application of the epithets,
   incongruous, unsuitable, disproportionate, unfit, to actions which our
   moral faculty determines to be vicious.

   Fourthly, It deserves to be considered, whether men are more at
   liberty, in point of morals, to make themselves miserable without
   reason, than to make other people so: or dissolutely to neglect their
   own greater good, for the sake of a present lesser gratification, than
   they are to neglect the good of others, whom nature has committed to
   their care. It should seem, that a due concern about our own interest
   or happiness, and a reasonable endeavour to secure and promote it,
   which is, I think, very much the meaning of the word prudence, in our
   language; it should seem, that this is virtue, and the contrary
   behaviour faulty and blamable; since, in the calmest way of reflection,
   we approve of the first, and condemn the other conduct, both in
   ourselves and others. This approbation and disapprobation are
   altogether different from mere desire of our own, or of their
   happiness, and from sorrow upon missing it. For the object or occasion
   of this last kind of perception is satisfaction or uneasiness: whereas
   the object of the first is active behaviour. In one case, what our
   thoughts fix upon is our condition: in the other, our conduct. It is
   true indeed, that nature has not given us so sensible a disapprobation
   of imprudence and folly, either in ourselves or others, as of
   falsehood, injustice, and cruelty: I suppose, because that constant
   habitual sense of. private interest and good, which we always carry
   about with us, renders such sensible disapprobation less necessary,
   less wanting, to keep us from imprudently neglecting our own happiness,
   and foolishly injuring ourselves, than it is necessary and wanting to
   keep us from injuring others, to whose good we cannot have so strong
   and constant a regard: and also because imprudence and folly, appearing
   to bring its own punishment more immediately and constantly than
   injurious behaviour, it less needs the additional punishment, which
   would be inflicted upon it by others, had they the same sensible
   indignation against it, as against injustice, and fraud, and cruelty.
   Besides, unhappiness being in itself the natural object of compassion;
   the unhappiness which people bring upon themselves, though it be
   wilfully, excites in us some pity for them: and this of course lessens
   our displeasure against them. But still it is matter of experience,
   that we are formed so as to reflect very severely upon the greater
   instances of imprudent neglect and foolish rashness, both in ourselves
   and others. In instances of this kind, men often say of themselves with
   remorse, and of others with some indignation, that they deserved to
   suffer such calamities, because they brought them upon themselves, and
   would not take warning. Particularly, when persons come to poverty and
   distress by a long course of extravagance, and after frequent
   admonitions, though without falsehood or injustice; we plainly, do not
   regard such people as alike objects of compassion with those, who are
   brought into the same condition by unavoidable accidents. From these
   things it appears, that prudence is a species of virtue, and folly of
   vice: meaning by folly, somewhat quite different from mere incapacity;
   a thoughtless want of that regard and attention to our own happiness,
   which we had capacity for. And this the word properly includes; and, as
   it seems, in its usual acceptation: for we scarcely apply it to brute
   creatures.

   However, if any person be disposed to dispute the matter, I shall very
   willingly give him up the words Virtue and Vice, as not applicable to
   prudence and folly: but must beg leave to insist, that the faculty
   within us, which is the judge of actions, approves of prudent actions,
   and disapproves imprudent ones: I say prudent and imprudent actions as
   such, and considered distinctly from the happiness or misery which they
   occasion. And, by the way, this observation may help to determine what
   justness there is in that objection against religion, that it teaches
   us to be interested and selfish.

   Fifthly, Without inquiring how far, and in what sense, virtue is
   resolvable into benevolence, and vice into the want of it; it may be
   proper to observe, that benevolence, and the want of it, singly
   considered, are in no sort the whole of virtue and vice. For if this
   were the case, in the review of one's own character, or that of others,
   our moral understanding and moral sense would be indifferent to every
   thing, but the degrees in which benevolence prevailed, and the degrees
   in which it was wanting. That is, we should neither approve of
   benevolence to some persons rather than to others, nor disapprove
   injustice and falsehood upon any other account, than merely as an
   overbalance of happiness was foreseen likely to be produced by the
   first, and of misery by the second. But now, on the contrary, suppose
   two men competitors for any thing whatever, which would be of equal
   advantage to each of them; though nothing indeed would be more
   impertinent, than for a stranger to busy himself to get one of them
   preferred to the other; yet such endeavour would be virtue, in behalf
   of a friend or benefactor, abstracted from all consideration of distant
   consequence: as that examples of gratitude, and the cultivation of
   friendship, would be of general good to the world. Again, suppose one
   man should, by fraud or violence, take from another the fruit of his
   labour, with intent to give it to a third, who he thought would have as
   much pleasure from it as would balance the pleasure which the first
   possessor would have had in the enjoyment, and his vexation in the loss
   of it; suppose also that no bad consequences would follow: yet such an
   action would surely be vicious. Nay, further, were treachery, violence,
   and injustice, no otherwise vicious, than as foreseen likely to produce
   an overbalance of misery to society; then, if in any case a man could
   procure to himself as great advantage by an act of injustice, as the
   whole foreseen inconvenience, likely to be brought upon others by it,
   would amount to; such a piece of injustice would not be faulty or
   vicious at all: because it would be no more than, in any other case,
   for a man to prefer his own satisfaction to another's in equal degrees.
   The fact, then, appears to be, that we are constituted so as to condemn
   falsehood, unprovoked violence, injustice, and to approve of
   benevolence to some preferably to others, abstracted from all
   consideration, which conduct is likeliest to produce an overbalance of
   happiness or misery. And therefore, were the Author of nature to
   propose nothing to himself as an end but the production of happiness,
   were his moral character merely that of benevolence; yet ours is not
   so. Upon that supposition indeed, the only reason of his giving us the
   above mentioned approbation of benevolence to some persons rather than
   others, and disapprobation of falsehood, unprovoked violence, and
   injustice, must be, that he foresaw this constitution of our nature
   would produce more happiness, than forming us with a temper of mere
   general benevolence. But still, since this is our constitution;
   falsehood, violence, injustice, must be vice in us, and benevolence to
   some, preferably to others, virtue; abstracted from all consideration
   of the overbalance of evil or good, which they may appear likely to
   produce.

   Now if human creatures are endued with such a moral nature as we have
   been explaining, or with a moral faculty, the natural object of which
   is actions: moral government must consist in rendering them happy and
   unhappy, in rewarding and punishing them, as they follow, neglect, or
   depart from, the moral rule of action interwoven in their nature, or
   suggested and enforced by this moral faculty; [246] in rewarding and
   punishing them upon account of their so doing.

   I am not sensible that I have, in this fifth observation, contradicted
   what any author designed to assert. But some of great and distinguished
   merit, have, I think, expressed themselves in a manner, which may
   occasion some danger, to careless readers, of imagining the whole of
   virtue to consist in singly aiming, according to the best of their
   judgment, at promoting the happiness or mankind in the present state;
   and the whole of vice, in doing what they foresee, or might foresee, is
   likely to produce an overbalance of unhappiness in it: than which
   mistakes, none can be conceived more terrible. For it is certain, that
   some of the most shocking instances of injustice, adultery, murder,
   perjury, and even of persecution, may, in many supposable cases, not
   have the appearance of being likely to produce an overbalance of misery
   in the present state; perhaps sometimes may leave the contrary
   appearance. For this reflection might easily be carried on, but I
   forbear.--The happiness of the world is the concern of him who is the
   lord and the proprietor of it: nor do we know what we are about, when
   we endeavour to promote the good of mankind in any ways, but those
   which he has directed; that is indeed in all ways not contrary to
   veracity and justice. I speak thus upon supposition of persons really
   endeavouring, in some sort, to do good without regard to these. But the
   truth seems to be, that such supposed endeavours proceed, almost
   always, from ambition, the spirit of party, or some indirect principle,
   concealed perhaps in great measure from persons themselves. And though
   it is our business and our duty to endeavour, within the bounds of
   veracity and justice, to contribute to the ease, convenience, and even
   cheerfulness and diversion of our fellow creatures: yet, from our short
   views, it is greatly uncertain, whether this endeavour will, in
   particular instances, produce an overbalance of happiness upon the
   whole; since so many and distant things must come into the. account.
   And that which makes it our duty is, that there is some appearance that
   it will, and no positive appearance sufficient to balance this, on the
   contrary side; and also, that such benevolent endeavour is a
   cultivation of that most excellent of all virtuous principles, the
   active principle of benevolence.

   However, though veracity, as well as justice, is to be our rule of
   life; it must be added, otherwise a snare will be laid in the way of
   some plain men, that the use of common forms of speech, generally
   understood, cannot be falsehood; and, in general, that there can be no
   designed falsehood without designing to deceive. It must likewise be
   observed, that in numberless cases, a man may be under the strictest
   obligations to what he foresees will deceive, without his intending it.
   For it is impossible not to foresee, that the words and actions of men,
   in different ranks and employments, and of different educations, will
   perpetually be mistaken by each other: and it cannot but be so, whilst
   they will judge with the utmost carelessness, as they daily do, of what
   they are not, perhaps, enough informed to be competent judges of, even
   though they considered it with great attention.

  END OF ANALOGY.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [244] This way of speaking is taken from Epictetus [Arr. Epict. lib. 1.
   cap. I.], and is made use of as seeming the most full, and least liable
   to cavil. And the moral faculty may be understood to have these two
   epithets, dokimastike and apodokimastike, upon a double account;
   because, upon a survey of actions, whether before or after they are
   done, it determines them to be good or evil; and also because it
   determines itself to be the guide of action and of life, in
   contradistinction from all other faculties, or natural principles of
   action; in the very same manner as speculative reason directly and
   naturally judges of speculative truth and falsehood: and at the same
   time is attended with a consciousness upon reflection, that the natural
   right to judge of them belongs to it.
