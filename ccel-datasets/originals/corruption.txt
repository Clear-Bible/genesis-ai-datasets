PREFACE

   THE reception given by the learned world to the First Volume of this
   work, as expressed hitherto in smaller reviews and notices, has on the
   whole been decidedly far from discouraging. All have had some word of
   encomium on our efforts. Many have accorded praise and signified their
   agreement, sometimes with unquestionable ability. Some have pronounced
   adverse opinions with considerable candour and courtesy. Others in
   opposing have employed arguments so weak and even irrelevant to the
   real question at issue, as to suggest that there is not after all so
   much as I anticipated to advance against our case. Longer examinations
   of this important matter are doubtless impending, with all the interest
   attaching to them and the judgements involved: but I beg now to offer
   my acknowledgements for all the words of encouragement that have been
   uttered.

   Something however must be said in reply to an attack made in the
   Guardian newspaper on May 20, because it represents in the main the
   position occupied by some members of an existing School. I do not
   linger over an offhand stricture upon my adhesion to the extravagant
   claim of a second-century origin for the Peshitto,' because I am
   content with the companionship of some of the very first Syriac
   scholars, and with the teaching given in an unanswered article in the
   Church Quarterly Review for April, 1895. Nor except in passing do I
   remark upon a fanciful censure of my account of the use of papyrus in
   MSS. before the tenth century--as to which the reviewer is evidently
   not versed in information recently collected, and described for example
   in Sir E. Maunde Thompson's Greek and Latin Palaeography, or in Mr. F.
   G. Kenyon's Our Bible and the Ancient Manuscripts, and in an article in
   the just mentioned Review which appeared in October, 1894. These
   observations and a large number of inaccuracies shew that he was at the
   least not posted up to date. But what will be thought, when attention
   is drawn to the fact that in a question whether a singular set of
   quotations from the early Fathers refer to a passage in St. Matthew or
   the parallel one in St. Luke, the peculiar characteristic of St.
   Matthew--them that persecute you'--is put out of sight, and both
   passages (taking the lengthened reading of St. Matthew) are represented
   as having equally only four clauses? And again, when quotations going
   on to the succeeding verse in St. Matthew (v. 45) are stated
   dogmatically to have been wrongly referred by me to that Evangelist?
   But as to the details of this point in dispute, I beg to refer our
   readers to pp. 144-153 of the present volume. The reviewer appears also
   to be entirely unacquainted with the history of the phrase monogenes
   Theos. in St. John i. 18, which, as may be read on pp. 215-218, was
   introduced by heretics and harmonized with Arian tenets, and was
   rejected on the other side. That some orthodox churchmen fell into the
   trap, and like those who in these days are not aware of the pedigree
   and use of the phrase, employed it even for good purposes, is only an
   instance of a strange phenomenon. We must not be led only by first
   impressions as to what is to be taken for the genuine words of the
   Gospels. Even if phrases or passages make for orthodoxy, to accept them
   if condemned by evidence and history is to alight upon the quicksands
   of conjecture.

   A curious instance of a fate like this has been supplied by a critic in
   the Athenaeum, who, when contrasting Dean Burgon's style of writing
   with mine to my discredit, quotes a passage of some length as the
   Dean's which was really written by me. Surely the principle upheld by
   our opponents, that much more importance than we allow should be
   attributed to the Internal evidence of Readings and Documents,' might
   have saved him from error upon a piece of composition which
   characteristically proclaimed its own origin. At all events, after this
   undesigned support, I am the less inclined to retire from our vantage
   ground.

   But it is gratifying on all accounts to say now, that such
   interpolations as in the companion volume I was obliged frequently to
   supply in order to fill up gaps in the several MSS. and in integral
   portions of the treatise, which through their very frequency would have
   there made square brackets unpleasant to our readers, are not required
   so often in this part of the work. Accordingly, except in instances of
   pure editing or in simple bringing up to date, my own additions or
   insertions have been so marked off. It will doubtless afford great
   satisfaction to others as well as the admirers of the Dean to know what
   was really his own writing: and though some of the MSS., especially
   towards the end of the volume, were not left as he would have prepared
   them for the press if his life had been prolonged, yet much of the book
   will afford, on what he regarded as the chief study of his life,
   excellent examples of his style, so vigorously fresh and so happy in
   idiomatic and lucid expression.

   But the Introduction, and Appendix II on Conflation' and the Neutral
   Text,' have been necessarily contributed by me. I am anxious to invite
   attention particularly to the latter essay, because it has been
   composed upon request, and also because--unless it contains some
   extraordinary mistake--it exhibits to a degree which has amazed me the
   baselessness of Dr. Hort's theory.

   The manner in which the Dean prepared piecemeal for his book, and the
   large number of fragments in which he left his materials, as has been
   detailed in the Preface to the former volume, have necessarily produced
   an amount of repetition which I deplore. To have avoided it entirely,
   some of the MSS. must have been rewritten. But in one instance I
   discovered when it was too late that after searching for, and finding
   with difficulty and treating, an example which had not been supplied, I
   had forestalled a subsequent examination of the same passage from his
   abler hand. However I hope that in nearly all, if not all cases, each
   treatment involves some new contribution to the question discussed; and
   that our readers will kindly make allowance for the perplexity which
   such an assemblage of separate papers could not but entail.

   My thanks are again due to the Rev. G. H. Gwilliam, B.D., Fellow of
   Hertford College, for much advice and suggestion, which he is so
   capable of giving, and for his valuable care in looking through all the
   first proofs of this volume; to M. W.,' Dean Burgon's indefatigable
   secretary, who in a pure labour of love copied out the text of the MSS.
   before and after his death; also to the zealous printers at the
   Clarendon Press, for help in unravelling intricacies still remaining in
   them.

   This treatise is now commended to the fair and candid consideration of
   readers and reviewers. The latter body of men should remember that
   there was perhaps never a time when reviewers were themselves reviewed
   by many intelligent readers more than they are at present. I cannot
   hope that all that we have advanced will be finally adopted, though my
   opinion is unfaltering as resting in my belief upon the Rock; still
   less do I imagine that errors may not be discovered in our work. But I
   trust that under Divine Blessing some not unimportant contribution has
   been made towards the establishment upon sound principles of the
   reverent criticism of the Text of the New Testament. And I am sure
   that, as to the Dean's part in it, this trust will be ultimately
   justified.

INTRODUCTION.

   IN the companion volume to this, the Traditional Text, that is, the
   Text of the Gospels which is the resultant of all the evidence
   faithfully and exhaustively presented and estimated according to the
   best procedure of the courts of law, has been traced back to the
   earliest ages in the existence of those sacred writings. We have shewn,
   that on the one hand, amidst the unprecedented advantages afforded by
   modern conditions of life for collecting all the evidence bearing upon
   the subject, the Traditional Text must be found, not in a mere
   transcript, but in a laborious revision of the Received Text; and that
   on the other hand it must, as far as we can judge, differ but slightly
   from the Text now generally in vogue, which has been generally received
   during the last two and a half centuries.

   The strength of the position of the Traditional Text lies in its being
   logically deducible and to be deduced from all the varied evidence
   which the case supplies, when it has been sifted, proved, passed,
   weighed, compared, compounded, and contrasted with dissentient
   testimony. The contrast is indeed great in almost all instances upon
   which controversy has gathered. On one side the vast mass of
   authorities is assembled: on the other stands a small group. Not
   inconsiderable is the advantage possessed by that group, as regards
   numerous students who do not look beneath the surface, in the general
   witness in their favour borne by the two oldest MSS. of the Gospels in
   existence. That advantage however shrinks into nothing under the light
   of rigid examination. The claim for the Text in them made at the
   Semiarian period was rejected when Semiarianism in all its phases fell
   into permanent disfavour. And the argument advanced by Dr. Hort that
   the Traditional Text was a new Text formed by successive recensions has
   been refuted upon examination of the verdict of the Fathers in the
   first four centuries, and of the early Syriac and Latin Versions.
   Besides all this, those two manuscripts have been traced to a local
   source in the library of Caesarea. And on the other hand a Catholic
   origin of the Traditional Text found on later vellum manuscripts has
   been discovered in the manuscripts of papyrus which existed all over
   the Roman Empire, unless it was in Asia, and were to some degree in use
   even as late as the ninth century before and during the employment of
   vellum in the Caesarean school, and in localities where it was used in
   imitation of the mode of writing books which was brought well-nigh to
   perfection in that city.

   It is evident that the turning-point of the controversy between
   ourselves and the Neologian school must lie in the centuries before St.
   Chrysostom. If, as Dr. Hort maintains, the Traditional Text not only
   gained supremacy at that era but did not exist in the early ages, then
   our contention is vain. That Text can be Traditional only if it goes
   back without break or intermission to the original autographs, because
   if through break or intermission it ceased or failed to exist, it loses
   the essential feature of genuine tradition. On the other hand, if it is
   proved to reach back in unbroken line to the time of the Evangelists,
   or to a period as near to them as surviving testimony can prove, then
   Dr. Hort's theory of a Syrian' text formed by recension or otherwise
   just as evidently falls to the ground. Following mainly upon the lines
   drawn by Dean Burgon, though in a divergence of my own devising, I
   claim to have proved Dr. Hort to have been conspicuously wrong, and our
   maintenance of the Traditional Text in unbroken succession to be
   eminently right. The school opposed to us must disprove our arguments,
   not by discrediting the testimony of the Fathers to whom all Textual
   Critics have appealed including Dr. Hort, but by demonstrating if they
   can that the Traditional Text is not recognized by them, or they must
   yield eventually to us [1] .

   In this volume, the other half of the subject will be discussed.
   Instead of exploring the genuine Text, we shall treat of the
   corruptions of it, and shall track error in its ten thousand forms to a
   few sources or heads. The origination of the pure Text in the inspired
   writings of the Evangelists will thus be vindicated anew by the evident
   paternity of deflections from it discoverable in the natural defects or
   iniquities of men. Corruption will the more slim itself in true
   colours:--

   Quinquaginta atris immanis hiatibus hydra [2] :

   and it will not so readily be mistaken for genuineness, when the real
   history is unfolded, and the mistakes are accounted for. It seems clear
   that corruption arose in the very earliest age. As soon as the Gospel
   was preached, the incapacity of human nature for preserving accuracy
   until long years of intimate acquaintance have bred familiarity must
   have asserted itself in constant distortion more or less of the sacred
   stories, as they were told and retold amongst Christians one to another
   whether in writing or in oral transmission. Mistakes would inevitably
   arise from the universal tendency to mix error with truth which Virgil
   has so powerfully depicted in his description of Fame':--

   Tam ficti pravique tenax, quam nuntia veri [3] .

   And as soon as inaccuracy had done its baleful work, a spirit of
   infidelity and of hostility either to the essentials or the details of
   the new religion must have impelled such as were either imperfect
   Christians, or no Christians at all, to corrupt the sacred stories.

   Thus it appears that errors crept in at the very first commencement of
   the life of the Church. This is a matter so interesting and so
   important in the history of corruption, that I must venture to place it
   again before our readers.

   Why was Galilee chosen before Judea and Jerusalem as the chief scene of
   our Lord's Life and Ministry, at least as regards the time spent there?
   Partly, no doubt, because the Galileans were more likely than the other
   inhabitants of Palestine to receive Him. But there was as I venture to
   think also another very special reason.

   Galilee of the nations' or the Gentiles,' not only had a mixed
   population [4] and a provincial dialect [5] , but lay contiguous to the
   rest of Palestine on the one side, and on others to two districts in
   which Greek was largely spoken, namely, Decapolis and the parts of Tyre
   and Sidon, and also to the large country of Syria. Our Lord laid
   foundations for a natural growth in these parts of the Christian
   religion after His death almost independent as it seems of the centre
   of the Church at Jerusalem. Hence His crossings of the lake, His
   miracles on the other side, His retirement in that little understood
   episode in His life when He shrank from persecution [6] , and remained
   secretly in the parts of Tyre and Sidon, about the coasts of Decapolis,
   on the shores of the lake, and in the towns of Caesarea Philippi, where
   the traces of His footsteps are even now indicated by tradition. [7]
   His success amongst these outlying populations is proved by the unique
   assemblage of the crowds of 5000 and 4000 men besides women and
   children. What wonder then if the Church sprang up at Damascus, and
   suddenly as if without notice displayed such strength as to draw
   persecution upon it! In the same way the Words of life appear to have
   passed throughout Syria over congenial soil, and Antioch became the
   haven whence the first great missionaries went out for the conversion
   of the world. Such were not only St. Paul, St. Peter, and St. Barnabas,
   but also as is not unreasonable to infer many of that assemblage of
   Christians at Rome whom St. Paul enumerates to our surprise in the last
   chapter of his Epistle to the Romans. Many no doubt were friends whom
   the Apostle of the Gentiles had met in Greece and elsewhere: but there
   are reasons to shew that some at least of them, such as Andronicus and
   Junias or Junia [8] and Herodion, may probably have passed along the
   stream of commerce that flowed between Antioch and Rome*1*, and that
   this interconnexion between the queen city of the empire and the
   emporium of the East may in great measure account for the number of
   names well known to the apostle, and for the then flourishing condition
   of the Church which they adorned.

   It has been shewn in our first volume that, as is well known to all
   students of Textual Criticism, the chief amount of corruption is to be
   found in what is termed the Western Text; and that the corruption of
   the West is so closely akin to the corruption which is found in Syriac
   remains, that practically they are included under one head of
   classification. What is the reason of this phenomenon? It is evidently
   derived from the close commercial alliance which subsisted between
   Syria and Italy. That is to say, the corruption produced in Syria made
   its way over into Italy, and there in many instances gathered fresh
   contributions. For there is reason to suppose, that it first arose in
   Syria.

   We have seen how the Church grew of itself there without regular
   teaching from Jerusalem in the first beginnings, or any regular
   supervision exercised by the Apostles. In fact, as far as the Syrian
   believers in Christ at first consisted of Gentiles, they must perforce
   have been regarded as being outside of the covenant of promise. Yet
   there must have been many who revered the stories told about our Lord,
   and felt extreme interest and delight in them. The story of King Abgar
   illustrates the history: but amongst those who actually heard our Lord
   preach there must have been very many, probably a majority, who were
   uneducated. They would easily learn from the Jews, because the Aramaic
   dialects spoken by Hebrews and Syrians did not greatly differ the one
   from the other. What difference there was, would not so much hinder the
   spread of the stories, as tend to introduce alien forms of speech and
   synonymous words, and so to hinder absolute accuracy from being
   maintained. Much time must necessarily have elapsed, before such
   familiarity with the genuine accounts of our Lord's sayings and doings
   grew up, as would prevent mistakes being made and disseminated in
   telling or in writing.

   The Gospels were certainly not written till some thirty years after the
   Ascension. More careful examination seems to place them later rather
   than earlier. For myself, I should suggest that the three first were
   not published long before the year 70 A.D. at the earliest; and that
   St. Matthew's Gospel was written at Pella during the siege of Jerusalem
   amidst Greek surroundings, and in face of the necessity caused by new
   conditions of life that Greek should become the ecclesiastical
   language. The Gospels would thus be the authorized versions in their
   entirety of the stories constituting the Life of our Lord; and
   corruption must have come into existence, before the antidote was found
   in complete documents accepted and commissioned by the authorities in
   the Church.

   I must again remark with much emphasis that the foregoing suggestions
   are offered to account for what may now be regarded as a fact, viz.,
   the connexion between the Western Text, as it is called, and Syriac
   remains in regard to corruption in the text of the Gospels and of the
   Acts of the Apostles. If that corruption arose at the very first spread
   of Christianity, before the record of our Lord's Life had assumed
   permanent shape in the Four Gospels, all is easy. Such corruption,
   inasmuch as it beset the oral and written stories which were afterwards
   incorporated in the Gospels, would creep into the authorized
   narrations, and would vitiate them till it was ultimately cast out
   towards the end of the fourth and in the succeeding centuries. Starting
   from the very beginning, and gaining additions in the several ways
   described in this volume by Dean Burgon, it would possess such vigour
   as to impress itself on Low-Latin manuscripts and even on parts of the
   better Latin ones, perhaps on Tatian's Diatessaron, on the Curetonian
   and Lewis manuscripts of the fifth century, on the Codex Bezae of the
   sixth; also on the Vatican and the Sinaitic of the fourth, on the
   Dublin Palimpsest of St. Matthew of the sixth, on the Codex Regius or L
   of the eighth, on the St. Gall MS. of the ninth in St. Mark, on the
   Codex Zacynthius of the eighth in St. Luke, and a few others. We on our
   side admit that the corruption is old even though the manuscripts
   enshrining it do not date very far back, and cannot always prove their
   ancestry. And it is in this admission that I venture to think there is
   an opening for a meeting of opinions which have been hitherto opposed.

   In the following treatise, the causes of corruption are divided into
   (I) such as proceeded from Accident, and (II) those which were
   Intentional. Under the former class we find (1) those which were
   involved in pure Accident, or (2) in what is termed Homoeoteleuton
   where lines or sentences ended with the same word or the same syllable,
   or (3) such as arose in writing from Uncial letters, or (4) in the
   confusion of vowels and diphthongs which is called Itacism, or (5) in
   Liturgical Influence. The remaining instances may be conveniently
   classed as Intentional, not because in all cases there was a settled
   determination to alter the text, for such if any was often of the
   faintest character, but because some sort of design was to a greater or
   less degree embedded in most of them. Such causes were (1) Harmonistic
   Influence, (2) Assimilation, (3) Attraction; such instances too in
   their main character were (4) Omissions, (5) Transpositions, (6)
   Substitutions, (7) Additions, (8) Glosses, (9) Corruption by Heretics,
   (10) Corruption by Orthodox.

   This dissection of the mass of corruption, or as perhaps it may be
   better termed, this classification made by Dean Burgon of the numerous
   causes which are found to have been at work from time to time, appears
   to me to be most interesting to the inquirer into the hidden history of
   the Text of the Gospels, because by revealing the influences which have
   been at work it sheds light upon the entire controversy, and often
   enables the student to see clearly how and why certain passages around
   which dispute has gathered are really corrupt. Indeed, the vast and
   mysterious ogre called corruption assumes shape and form under the
   acute penetration and the deft handling of the Dean, whose great
   knowledge of the subject and orderly treatment of puzzling details is
   still more commended by his interesting style of writing. As far as has
   been possible, I have let him in the sequel, except for such clerical
   corrections as were required from time to time and have been much fewer
   than his facile pen would have made, speak entirely for himself.

CHAPTER I.

  GENERAL CORRUPTION.

   § 1.

   WE hear sometimes scholars complain, and with a certain show of reason,
   that it is discreditable to us as a Church not to have long since put
   forth by authority a revised Greek Text of the New Testament. The chief
   writers of antiquity, say they, have been of late years re-edited by
   the aid of the best Manuscripts. Why should not the Scriptures enjoy
   the same advantage? Men who so speak evidently misunderstand the
   question. They assume that the case of the Scriptures and that of other
   ancient writings are similar.

   Such remonstrances are commonly followed up by statements like the
   following:--That the received Text is that of Erasmus:--that it was
   constructed in haste, and without skill:--that it is based on a very
   few, and those bad Manuscripts:--that it belongs to an age when
   scarcely any of our present critical helps were available, and when the
   Science of Textual Criticism was unknown. To listen to these advocates
   for Revision, you would almost suppose that it fared with the Gospel at
   this instant as it had fared with the original Copy of the Law for many
   years until the days of King Josiah [9] .

   Yielding to no one in my desire to see the Greek of the New Testament
   judiciously revised, I freely avow that recent events have convinced
   me, and I suppose they have convinced the public also, that we have not
   among us the men to conduct such an undertaking. Better a thousand
   times in my judgement to leave things as they are, than to risk having
   the stamp of authority set upon such an unfortunate production as that
   which appeared on the 17th May, 1881, and which claims at this instant
   to represent the combined learning of the Church, the chief Sects, and
   the Socinian [10] body.

   Now if the meaning of those who desire to see the commonly received
   text of the New Testament made absolutely faultless, were something of
   this kind:--That they are impatient for the collation of the copies
   which have become known to us within the last two centuries, and which
   amount already in all to upwards of three thousand: that they are bent
   on procuring that the ancient Versions shall be re-edited;--and would
   hail with delight the announcement that a band of scholars had combined
   to index every place of Scripture quoted by any of the Fathers:--if
   this were meant, we should all be entirely at one; especially if we
   could further gather from the programme that a fixed intention was
   cherished of abiding by the result of such an appeal to ancient
   evidence. But unfortunately something entirely different is in
   contemplation.

   Now I am bent on calling attention to certain features of the problem
   which have very generally escaped attention. It does not seem to be
   understood that the Scriptures of the New Testament stand on an
   entirely different footing from every other ancient writing which can
   be named. A few plain remarks ought to bring this fact, for a fact it
   is, home to every thoughtful person. And the result will be that men
   will approach the subject with more caution,--with doubts and
   misgivings,--with a fixed determination to be on their guard against
   any form of plausible influence. Their prejudices they will scatter to
   the winds. At every step they will insist on proof.

   In the first place, then, let it be observed that the New Testament
   Scriptures are wholly without a parallel in respect of their having
   been so frequently multiplied from the very first. They are by
   consequence contained at this day in an extravagantly large number of
   copies [probably, if reckoned under the six classes of Gospels, Acts
   and Catholic Epistles, Pauline Epistles, Apocalypse, Evangelistaries,
   and Apostolos, exceeding the number of four thousand]. There is nothing
   like this, or at all approaching to it, in the case of any profane
   writing that can be named [11] .

   And the very necessity for multiplying copies,--a necessity which has
   made itself felt in every age and in every clime,--has perforce
   resulted in an immense number of variants. Words have been inevitably
   dropped,--vowels have been inadvertently confounded by copyists more or
   less competent:--and the meaning of Scripture in countless places has
   suffered to a surprising degree in consequence. This first.

   But then further, the Scriptures for the very reason because they were
   known to be the Word of God became a mark for the shafts of Satan from
   the beginning. They were by consequence as eagerly solicited by
   heretical teachers on the one hand, as they were hotly defended by the
   orthodox on the other. Alike from friends and from foes therefore, they
   are known to have experienced injury, and that in the earliest age of
   all. Nothing of the kind can be predicated of any other ancient
   writings. This consideration alone should suggest a severe exercise of
   judicial impartiality, in the handling of ancient evidence of whatever
   sort.

   For I request it may be observed that I have not said--and I certainly
   do not mean--that the Scriptures themselves have been permanently
   corrupted either by friend or foe. Error was fitful and uncertain, and
   was contradicted by other error: besides that it sank eventually before
   a manifold witness to the truth. Nevertheless, certain manuscripts
   belonging to a few small groups--particular copies of a
   Version--individual Fathers or Doctors of the Church,--these do, to the
   present hour, bear traces incontestably of ancient mischief.

   But what goes before is not nearly all. The fourfold structure of the
   Gospel has lent itself to a certain kind of licentious handling--of
   which in other ancient writings we have no experience. One critical
   owner of a Codex considered himself at liberty to assimilate the
   narratives: another to correct them in order to bring them into (what
   seemed to himself) greater harmony. Brevity is found to have been a
   paramount object with some, and Transposition to have amounted to a
   passion with others. Conjectural Criticism was evidently practised
   largely: and almost with as little felicity as when Bentley held the
   pen. Lastly, there can be no question that there was a certain school
   of Critics who considered themselves competent to improve the style of
   the Holy Ghost throughout. [And before the members of the Church had
   gained a familiar acquaintance with the words of the New Testament,
   blunders continually crept into the text of more or less heinous
   importance.] All this, which was chiefly done during the second and
   third centuries, introduces an element of difficulty in the handling of
   ancient evidence which can never be safely neglected: and will make a
   thoughtful man suspicious of every various reading which comes in his
   way, especially if it is attended with but slender attestation. [It has
   been already shewn in the companion volume] that the names of the
   Codexes chiefly vitiated in this sort prove to be B'CDL; of the
   Versions,--the two Coptic, the Curetonian, and certain specimens of the
   Old Latin; of the Fathers,--Origen, Clement of Alexandria, and to some
   extent Eusebius.

   Add to all that goes before the peculiar subject-matter of the New
   Testament Scriptures, and it will become abundantly plain why they
   should have been liable to a series of assaults which make it
   reasonable that they should now at last be approached by ourselves as
   no other ancient writings are, or can be. The nature of God,--His Being
   and Attributes:--the history of Man's Redemption:--the soul's eternal
   destiny:--the mysteries of the unseen world:--concerning these and
   every other similar high doctrinal subject, the sacred writings alone
   speak with a voice of absolute authority. And surely by this time
   enough has been said to explain why these Scriptures should have been
   made a battle-field during some centuries, and especially in the
   fourth; and having thus been made the subject of strenuous contention,
   that copies of them should exhibit to this hour traces of those many
   adverse influences. I say it for the last time,--of all such causes of
   depravation the Greek Poets, Tragedians, Philosophers, Historians,
   neither knew nor could know anything. And it thus plainly appears that
   the Textual Criticism of the New Testament is to be handled by
   ourselves in an entirely different spirit from that of any other book.

   § 2.

   I wish now to investigate the causes of the corruption of the Text of
   the New Testament. I do not entitle the present a discussion of Various
   Readings,' because I consider that expression to be incorrect and
   misleading [12] . Freely allowing that the term variae lectiones,' for
   lack of a better, may be allowed to stand on the Critic's page, I yet
   think it necessary even a second time to call attention to the
   impropriety which attends its use. Thus Codex B differs from the
   commonly received Text of Scripture in the Gospels alone in 7578
   places; of which no less than 2877 are instances of omission. In fact
   omissions constitute by far the larger number of what are commonly
   called Various Readings.' How then can those be called various
   readings' which are really not readings at all? How, for example, can
   that be said to be a various reading' of St. Mark xvi. 9-20, which
   consists in the circumstance that the last 12 verses are left out by
   two MSS.? Again,--How can it be called a various reading' of St. John
   xxi. 25, to bring the Gospel abruptly to a close, as Tischendorf does,
   at v. 24? These are really nothing else but indications either of a
   mutilated or else an interpolated text. And the question to be resolved
   is,--On which side does the corruption lie? and, How did it originate?

   Waiving this however, the term is objectionable on other grounds. It is
   to beg the whole question to assume that every irregularity in the text
   of Scripture is a various reading.' The very expression carries with it
   an assertion of importance; at least it implies a claim to
   consideration. Even might it be thought that, because it is termed a
   various reading,' therefore a critic is entitled to call in question
   the commonly received text. Whereas, nine divergences out of ten are of
   no manner of significance and are entitled to no manner of
   consideration, as every one must see at a glance who will attend to the
   matter ever so little. Various readings' in fact is a term which
   belongs of right to the criticism of the text of profane authors: and,
   like many other notions which have been imported from the same region
   into this department of inquiry, it only tends to confuse and perplex
   the judgement.

   No variety in the Text of Scripture can properly be called a various
   reading,' of which it may be safely declared that it never has been,
   and never will be, read. In the case of profane authors, where the MSS.
   are for the most part exceedingly few, almost every plausible
   substitution of one word for another, if really entitled to alteration,
   is looked upon as a various reading of the text. But in the Gospels, of
   which the copies are so numerous as has been said, the case is far
   otherwise. We are there able to convince ourselves in a moment that the
   supposed various reading' is nothing else but an instance of
   licentiousness or inattention on the part of a previous scribe or
   scribes, and we can afford to neglect it accordingly [13] . It follows
   therefore,--and this is the point to which I desire to bring the reader
   and to urge upon his consideration,--that the number of various
   readings' in the New Testament properly so called has been greatly
   exaggerated. They are, in reality, exceedingly few in number; and it is
   to be expected that, as sound (sacred) Criticism advances, and
   principles are established, and conclusions recognized, instead of
   becoming multiplied they will become fewer and fewer, and at last will
   entirely disappear. We cannot afford to go on disputing for ever; and
   what is declared by common consent to be untenable ought to be no
   longer reckoned. That only in short, as I venture to think, deserves
   the name of a Various Reading which comes to us so respectably
   recommended as to be entitled to our sincere consideration and respect;
   or, better still, which is of such a kind as to inspire some degree of
   reasonable suspicion that after all it may prove to be the true way of
   exhibiting the text.

   The inquiry therefore on which we are about to engage, grows naturally
   out of the considerations which have been already offered. We propose
   to ascertain, as far as is practicable at the end of so many hundred
   years, in what way these many strange corruptions of the text have
   arisen. Very often we shall only have to inquire how it has come to
   pass that the text exhibits signs of perturbation at a certain place.
   Such disquisitions as those which follow, let it never be forgotten,
   have no place in reviewing any other text than that of the New
   Testament, because a few plain principles would suffice to solve every
   difficulty. The less usual word mistaken for the word of mare frequent
   occurrence;--clerical carelessness;--a gloss finding its way from the
   margin into the text;--such explanations as these would probably in
   other cases suffice to account for every ascertained corruption of the
   text. But it is far otherwise here, as I propose to make fully apparent
   by and by. Various disturbing influences have been at work for a great
   many years, of which secular productions know absolutely nothing, nor
   indeed can know.

   The importance of such an inquiry will become apparent as we proceed;
   but it may be convenient that I should call attention to the matter
   briefly at the outset. It frequently happens that the one remaining
   plea of many critics for adopting readings of a certain kind, is the
   inexplicable nature of the phenomena which these readings exhibit. How
   will you possibly account for such a reading as the present,' (say
   they,) if it be not authentic?' Or they say nothing, but leave it to be
   inferred that the reading they adopt,--in spite of its intrinsic
   improbability, in spite also of the slender amount of evidence on which
   it rests,--must needs be accepted as true. They lose sight of the
   correlative difficulty:--How comes it to pass that the rest of the
   copies read the place otherwise? On all such occasions it is impossible
   to overestimate the importance of detecting the particular cause which
   has brought about, or which at least will fully account for, this
   depravation. When this has been done, it is hardly too much to say that
   a case presents itself like as when a pasteboard mask has been torn
   away, and the ghost is discovered with a broad grin on his face behind
   it.

   The discussion on which I now enter is then on the Causes of the
   various Corruptions of the Text. [The reader shall be shewn with
   illustrations to what particular source they are to be severally
   ascribed. When representative passages have been thus labelled, and the
   causes are seen in operation, he will be able to pierce the mystery,
   and all the better to winnow the evil from among the good.]

   § 3.

   When I take into my hands an ancient copy of the Gospels, I expect that
   it will exhibit sundry inaccuracies and imperfections: and I am never
   disappointed in my expectation. The discovery however creates no
   uneasiness, so long as the phenomena evolved are of a certain kind and
   range within easily definable limits. Thus:--

   1. Whatever belongs to peculiarities of spelling or fashions of
   writing, I can afford to disregard. For example, it is clearly
   consistent with perfect good faith, that a scribe should spell
   krabatton [14] in several different ways: that he should write houto
   for houtos, or the contrary: that he should add or omit what
   grammarians call the n ephelkustikon. The questions really touched by
   irregularities such as these concern the date and country where the MS.
   was produced; not by any means the honesty or animus of the copyist.
   The man fell into the method which was natural to him, or which he
   found prevailing around him; and that was all. Itacisms' therefore, as
   they are called, of whatever kind,--by which is meant the interchange
   of such vowels and diphthongs as i-ei, ai-e, e-i, e-oi-u, o-o,
   e-ei,--need excite no uneasiness. It is true that these variations may
   occasionally result in very considerable inconvenience: for it will
   sometimes happen that a different reading is the consequence. But the
   copyist may have done his work in perfect good faith for all that. It
   is not he who is responsible for the perplexity he occasions me, but
   the language and the imperfect customs amidst which he wrote.

   2. In like manner the reduplication of syllables, words, clauses,
   sentences, is consistent with entire sincerity of purpose on the part
   of the copyist. This inaccuracy is often to be deplored; inasmuch as a
   reduplicated syllable often really affects the sense. But for the most
   part nothing worse ensues than that the page is disfigured with errata.

   3. So, on the other hand,--the occasional omission of words, whether
   few or many,--especially that passing from one line to the
   corresponding place in a subsequent line, which generally results from
   the proximity of a similar ending,--is a purely venial offence. It is
   an evidence of carelessness, but it proves nothing worse.

   4. Then further,--slight inversions, especially of ordinary words; or
   the adoption of some more obvious and familiar collocation of particles
   in a sentence; or again, the occasional substitution of one common word
   for another, as eipe for elege, phonesan for kraxan, and the
   like;--need not provoke resentment. It is an indication, we are willing
   to hope, of nothing worse than slovenliness on the part of the writer
   or the group or succession of writers.

   5. I will add that besides the substitution of one word for another,
   cases frequently occur, where even the introduction into the text of
   one or more words which cannot be thought to have stood in the original
   autograph of the Evangelist, need create no offence. It is often
   possible to account for their presence in a strictly legitimate way.

   But it is high time to point out, that irregularities which fall under
   these last heads are only tolerable within narrow limits, and always
   require careful watching; for they may easily become excessive or even
   betray an animus; and in either case they pass at once into quite a
   different category. From cases of excusable oscitancy they degenerate,
   either into instances of inexcusable licentiousness, or else into cases
   of downright fraud.

   6. Thus, if it be observed in the case of a Codex (a) that entire
   sentences or significant clauses are habitually omitted:--(b) that
   again and again in the course of the same page the phraseology of the
   Evangelist has upon clear evidence been seriously tampered with: and
   (c) that interpolations here and there occur which will not admit of
   loyal interpretation:--we cannot but learn to regard with habitual
   distrust the Codex in which all these notes are found combined. It is
   as when a witness, whom we suspected of nothing worse than a bad memory
   or a random tongue or a lively imagination, has been at last convicted
   of deliberate suppression of parts of his evidence, misrepresentation
   of facts,--in fact, deliberate falsehood.

   7. But now suppose the case of a MS. in which words or clauses are
   clearly omitted with design; where expressions are withheld which are
   confessedly harsh or critically difficult,--whole sentences or parts of
   them which have a known controversial bearing;--Suppose further that
   the same MS. abounds in worthless paraphrase, and contains apocryphal
   additions throughout:--What are we to think of our guide then? There
   can be but one opinion on the subject. From habitually trusting, we
   shall entertain inveterate distrust. We have ascertained his character.
   We thought he was a faithful witness, but we now find from experience
   of his transgressions that we have fallen into bad company. His witness
   may be false no less than true: confidence is at an end.

   § 4.

   It may be regarded as certain that most of the aberrations discoverable
   in Codexes of the Sacred Text have arisen in the first instance from
   the merest inadvertency of the scribes. That such was the case in a
   vast number of cases is in fact demonstrable. [Inaccuracy in the
   apprehension of the Divine Word, which in the earliest ages was
   imperfectly understood, and ignorance of Greek in primitive Latin
   translators, were prolific sources of error. The influence of
   Lectionaries, in which Holy Scripture was cut up into separate Lections
   either with or without an introduction, remained with habitual hearers,
   and led them off in copying to paths which had become familiar.
   Acquaintance with Harmonies' or Diatessarons caused copyists insensibly
   to assimilate one Gospel to another. And doctrinal predilections, as in
   the case of those who belonged to the Origenistic school, were the
   source of lapsing into expressions which were not the verba ipsissima
   of Holy Writ. In such cases, when the inadvertency was genuine and was
   unmingled with any overt design, it is much to be noted that the error
   seldom propagated itself extensively.]

   But next, well-meant endeavours must have been made at a very early
   period to rectify' (diorthoun) the text thus unintentionally corrupted;
   and so, what began in inadvertence is sometimes found in the end to
   exhibit traces of design, and often becomes in a high degree
   perplexing. Thus, to cite a favourite example, it is clear to me that
   in the earliest age of all (A.D. 100?) some copyist of St. Luke ii. 14
   (call him X) inadvertently omitted the second EN in the Angelic Hymn.
   Now if the persons (call them Y and Z) whose business it became in turn
   to reproduce the early copy thus inadvertently depraved, had but been
   content both of them to transcribe exactly what they saw before them,
   the error of their immediate predecessor (X) must infallibly have
   speedily been detected, remedied, and forgotten,--simply because, as
   every one must have seen as well as Y and Z, it was impossible to
   translate the sentence which results,--epi ges eirene anthropois
   eudokia. Reference would have been made to any other copy of the third
   Gospel, and together with the omitted preposition (en) sense would have
   been restored to the passage. But unhappily one of the two supposed
   Copyists being a learned grammarian who had no other copy at hand to
   refer to, undertook, good man that he was, proprio Marte to force a
   meaning into the manifestly corrupted text of the copy before him: and
   he did it by affixing to eudokia the sign of the genitive case (s).
   Unhappy effort of misplaced skill! That copy [or those copies] became
   the immediate progenitor [or progenitors] of a large family,--from
   which all the Latin copies are descended; whereby it comes to pass that
   Latin Christendom sings the Hymn Gloria in excelsis' incorrectly to the
   present hour, and may possibly sing it incorrectly to the end of time.
   The error committed by that same venerable Copyist survives in the four
   oldest copies of the passage extant, B* and '*, A and D,--though
   happily in no others,--in the Old Latin, Vulgate, and Gothic, alone of
   Versions; in Irenaeus and Origen (who contradict themselves), and in
   the Latin Fathers. All the Greek authorities, with the few exceptions
   just recorded, of which A and D are the only consistent witnesses,
   unite in condemning the evident blunder [15] .

   I once hoped that it might be possible to refer all the Corruptions of
   the Text of Scripture to ordinary causes: as, careless
   transcription,--divers accidents,--misplaced critical
   assiduity,--doctrinal animus,--small acts of unpardonable licence.

   But increased attention and enlarged acquaintance with the subject,
   have convinced me that by far the larger number of the omissions of
   such. Codexes as 'BLD must needs be due to quite a different cause.
   These MSS. omit so many words, phrases, sentences, verses of
   Scripture,--that it is altogether incredible that the proximity of like
   endings can have much to do with the matter. Inadvertency may be made
   to bear the blame of some omissions: it cannot bear the blame of shrewd
   and significant omissions of clauses, which invariably leave the sense
   complete. A systematic and perpetual mutilation of the inspired Text
   must needs be the result of design, not of accident [16] .

   [It will be seen therefore that the causes of the Corruptions of the
   Text class themselves under two main heads, viz. (I.) Those which arose
   from Inadvertency, and (II.) Those which took their origin in Design.]

   [13] [Perhaps this point may be cleared by dividing readings into two
   classes, viz. (1) such as really have strong evidence for their
   support, and require examination before we can be certain that they are
   corrupt; and (2) those which afford no doubt as to their being
   destitute of foundation, and are only interesting as specimens of the
   modes in which error was sometimes introduced. Evidently, the latter
   class are not various' at all.]

   [14] [I.e. generally krabatton, or else krabaton, or even krabakton;
   seldom found as krabbatton, or spelt in the corrupt form krabbaton.]

   [15] I am inclined to believe that in the age immediately succeeding
   that of the Apostles, some person or persons of great influence and
   authority executed a Revision of the N. T. and gave the world the
   result of such labours in a corrected Text.' The guiding principle
   seems to have been to seek to abridge the Text, to lop off whatever
   seemed redundant, or which might in any way be spared, and to eliminate
   from one Gospel whatever expressions occurred elsewhere in another
   Gospel. Clauses which slightly obscured the speaker's meaning; or which
   seemed to hang loose at the end of a sentence; or which introduced a
   consideration of difficulty:--words which interfered with the easy flow
   of a sentence:--every thing of this kind such a personage seems to have
   held himself free to discard. But what is more serious, passages which
   occasioned some difficulty, as the pericope de adultera; physical
   perplexity, as the troubling of the water; spiritual revulsion, as the
   agony in the garden:--all these the reviser or revisers seem to have
   judged it safest simply to eliminate. It is difficult to understand how
   any persons in their senses could have so acted by the sacred deposit;
   but it does not seem improbable that at some very remote period there
   were found some who did act in some such way. Let it be observed,
   however, that unlike some critics I do not base my real argument upon
   what appears to me to be a not unlikely supposition.

   corruption, as described in The Traditional Text.]

CHAPTER II.

  ACCIDENTAL CAUSES OF CORRUPTION.

  I. PURE ACCIDENT.

   [IT often happens that more causes than one are combined in the origin
   of the corruption in any one passage. In the following history of a
   blunder and of the fatal consequences that ensued upon it, only the
   first step was accidental. But much instruction may be derived from the
   initial blunder, and though the later stages in the history come under
   another head, they nevertheless illustrate the effects of early
   accident, besides throwing light upon parts of the discussion which are
   yet to come.]

   § 1.

   We are sometimes able to trace the origin and progress of accidental
   depravations of the text: and the study is as instructive as it is
   interesting. Let me invite attention to what is found in St. John x.
   29; where,--instead of, My Father, who hath given them [viz. My sheep]
   to Me, is greater than all,'--Tischendorf, Tregelles, Alford, are for
   reading, That thing which My (or the) Father hath given to Me is
   greater (i.e. is a greater thing) than all.' A vastly different
   proposition, truly; and, whatever it may mean, wholly inadmissible
   here, as the context proves. It has been the result of sheer accident
   moreover,--as I proceed to explain.

   St. John certainly wrote the familiar words,--o pate'r mou o`s de'doke'
   moi, meizon esti. But, with the licentiousness [or inaccuracy] which
   prevailed in the earliest age, some remote copyist is found to have
   substituted for o`s de'doke, its grammatical equivalent os dedokos. And
   this proved fatal; for it was only necessary that another scribe should
   substitute meizon for meizon (after the example of such places as St.
   Matt. xii. 6, 41, 42, &c.), and thus the door had been opened to at
   least four distinct deflections from the evangelical verity, -- which
   straightway found their way into manuscripts:--(1) o dedokos . . .
   meizon--of which reading at this day D is the sole representative: (2)
   os dedoke . . . . meizon--which survives only in AX: (3) o dedoke . . .
   . meizon--which is only found in 'L: (4) o dedoke . . . . meizon--which
   is the peculiar property of B. The 1st and 2nd of these sufficiently
   represent the Evangelist's meaning, though neither of them is what he
   actually wrote; but the 3rd is untranslatable: while the 4th is nothing
   else but a desperate attempt to force a meaning into the 3rd, by
   writing meizon for meizon; treating o not as the article but as the
   neuter of the relative hos.

   This last exhibition of the text, which in fact scarcely yields an
   intelligible meaning and rests upon the minimum of manuscript evidence,
   would long since have been forgotten, but that, calamitously for the
   Western Church, its Version of the New Testament Scriptures was
   executed from MSS. of the same vicious type as Cod. B [17] .
   Accordingly, all the Latin copies, and therefore all the Latin Fathers
   [18] , translate,--Pater [meus] quod dedit mihi, majus omnibus est [19]
   .' The Westerns resolutely extracted a meaning from whatever they
   presumed to be genuine Scripture: and one can but admire the piety
   which insists on finding sound Divinity in what proves after all to be
   nothing else but a sorry blunder. What, asks Augustine, was the thing,
   greater than all,' which the Father gave to the Son? To be the Word of
   the Father (he answers), His only-begotten Son and the brightness of
   His glory [20] . The Greeks knew better. Basil [21] , Chrysostom [22] ,
   Cyril on nine occasions [23] , Theodoret [24] --as many as quote the
   place--invariably exhibit the textus receptus o`s . . . meizon, which
   is obviously the true reading and may on no account suffer molestation.

   But,'--I shall perhaps be asked,--although Patristic and manuscript
   evidence are wanting for the reading o` dedoke' moi. . . meizon,--is it
   not a significant circumstance that three translations of such high
   antiquity as the Latin, the Bohairic, and the Gothic, should concur in
   supporting it? and does it not inspire extraordinary confidence in B to
   find that B alone of MSS. agrees with them?' To which I answer,--It
   makes me, on the contrary, more and more distrustful of the Latin, the
   Bohairic and the Gothic versions to find them exclusively siding with
   Cod. B on such an occasion as the present. It is obviously not more
   significant' that the Latin, the Bohairic, and the Gothic, should here
   conspire with--than that the Syriac, the Sahidic, and the Ethiopic,
   should here combine against B. On the other hand, how utterly
   insignificant is the testimony of B when opposed to all the uncials,
   all the cursives, and all the Greek fathers who quote the place. So far
   from inspiring me with confidence in B, the present indication of the
   fatal sympathy of that Codex with the corrupt copies from which
   confessedly many of the Old Latin were executed, confirms me in my
   habitual distrust of it. About the true reading of St. John x. 29,
   there really exists no manner of doubt. As for the old uncials' they
   are (as usual) hopelessly at variance on the subject. In an easy
   sentence of only 9 words,--which however Tischendorf exhibits in
   conformity with no known Codex, while Tregelles and Alford blindly
   follow Cod. B,--they have contrived to invent five various readings,'
   as may be seen at foot [25] . Shall we wonder more at the badness of
   the Codexes to which we are just now invited to pin our faith; or at
   the infatuation of our guides?

   § 2.

   I do not find that sufficient attention has been paid to grave
   disturbances of the Text which have resulted from a slight clerical
   error. While we are enumerating the various causes of Textual
   depravity, we may not fail to specify this. Once trace a serious
   Textual disturbance back to (what for convenience may be called) a
   clerical error,' and you are supplied with an effectual answer to a
   form of inquiry which else is sometimes very perplexing: viz. If the
   true meaning of this passage be what you suppose, for what conceivable
   reason should the scribe have misrepresented it in this strange
   way,--made nonsense, in short, of the place? . . . I will further
   remark, that it is always interesting, sometimes instructive, after
   detecting the remote origin of an ancient blunder, to note what has
   been its subsequent history and progress.

   Some specimens of the thing referred to I have already given in another
   place. The reader is invited to acquaint himself with the strange
   process by which the 276 souls' who suffered shipwreck with St. Paul
   (Acts xxvii. 37), have since dwindled down to about 76 [26] .'--He is
   further requested to note how a certain man' who in the time of St.
   Paul bore the name of Justus' (Acts xviii. 7), has been since
   transformed into Titus,' Titus Justus,' and even "Titius Justus [27]
   .'--But for a far sadder travestie of sacred words, the reader is
   referred to what has happened in St. Matt. xi. 23 and St. Luke x.
   15,--where our Saviour is made to ask an unmeaning question--instead of
   being permitted to announce a solemn fact--concerning Capernaum [28]
   .--The newly-discovered ancient name of the Island of Malta, Melitene
   [29] , (for which geographers are indebted to the adventurous spirit of
   Westcott and Hort), may also be profitably considered in connexion with
   what is to be the subject of the present chapter. And now to break up
   fresh ground.

   Attention is therefore invited to a case of attraction in Acts xx. 24.
   It is but the change of a single letter (logoU for logoN), yet has that
   minute deflection from the truth led to a complete mangling of the most
   affecting perhaps of St. Paul's utterances. I refer to the famous words
   all' oudeno`s lo'gon poioumai, oude echo te`n psuchen mou timi'an
   emauto, os teleiosai to`n dro'mon mou meta charas: excellently, because
   idiomatically, rendered by our Translators of 1611,--But none of these
   things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I
   might finish my course with joy.'

   For oudeno`s loGON, (the accusative after poioumai), some one having
   substituted oudeno`s loGOU,--a reading which survives to this hour in B
   and C [30] ,--it became necessary to find something else for the verb
   to govern. Ten psuchen was at hand, but oude echo stood in the way.
   Oude echo must therefore go [31] ; and go it did,--as B, C, and '
   remain to attest. Timi'an should have gone also, if the sentence was to
   be made translatable but timi'an was left behind [32] . The authors of
   ancient embroilments of the text were sad bunglers. In the meantime,
   Cod. ' inadvertently retained St. Luke's word, LOGON; and because '
   here follows B in every other respect, it exhibits a text which is
   simply unintelligible [33] .

   Now the second clause of the sentence, viz. the words oude echo te`n
   psuchen mou timi'an emauto, may on no account be surrendered. It is
   indeed beyond the reach of suspicion, being found in Codd. A, D, E, H,
   L, 13, 31,--in fact in every known copy of the Acts, except the
   discordant 'BC. The clause in question is further witnessed to by the
   Vulgate [34] ,--by the Harkleian [35] ,--by Basil [36] ,--by Chrysostom
   [37] ,--by Cyril [38] ,--by Euthalius [39] ,--and by the interpolator
   of Ignatius [40] . What are we to think of our guides (Tischendorf,
   Tregelles, Westcott and Hort, and the Revisers) who have nevertheless
   surrendered the Traditional Text and presented us instead with what Dr.
   Field,--who is indeed a Master in Israel,--describes as the impossible
   all' oudeno`s lo'gou poioumai te`n psuche`n timi'an emauto [41] ?

   The words of the last-named eminent scholar on the reading just cited
   are so valuable in themselves, and are observed to be so often in
   point, that they shall find place here:--Modern Critics,' he says, in
   deference to the authority of the older MSS., and to certain critical
   canons which prescribe that preference should be given to the shorter
   and more difficult reading over the longer and easier one, have decided
   that the T. R. in this passage is to be replaced by that which is
   contained in those older MSS.

   In regard to the difficulty of this reading, that term seems hardly
   applicable to the present case. A difficult reading is one which
   presents something apparently incongruous in the sense, or anomalous in
   the construction, which an ignorant or half-learned copyist would
   endeavour, by the use of such critical faculty as he possessed, to
   remove; but which a true critic is able, by probable explanation, and a
   comparison of similar cases, to defend against all such fancied
   improvements. In the reading before us, all' oudeno`s lo'gou poioumai
   te`n psuche`n timi'an emauto, it is the construction, and not the
   sense, which is in question; and this is not simply difficult, but
   impossible. There is really no way of getting over it; it baffles
   novices and experts alike [42] : When will men believe that a reading
   vouched for by only B'C is safe to be a fabrication [43] ? But at least
   when Copies and Fathers combine, as here they do, against those three
   copies, what can justify critics in upholding a text which carries on
   its face its own condemnation?

   § 3.

   We now come to the inattention of those long-since-forgotten Ist or
   IInd century scribes who, beguiled by the similarity of the letters EN
   and AN (in the expression EN AN-thropois eudokia, St. Luke ii. 14),
   left out the preposition. An unintelligible clause was the consequence,
   as has been explained above (p. 21): which some one next sought to
   remedy by adding to eudokia the sign of the genitive (C). Thus the Old
   Latin translations were made.

   That this is the true history of a blunder which the latest Editors of
   the New Testament have mistaken for genuine Gospel, is I submit certain
   [44] . Most Latin copies (except 14 [45] ) exhibit pax hominibus bonae
   voluntatis,' as well as many Latin Fathers [46] . On the other hand,
   the preposition EN is retained in every known Greek copy of St. Luke
   without exception, while the reading eudokias is absolutely limited to
   the four uncials AB'D. The witness of antiquity on this head is thus
   overwhelming and decisive.

   § 4.

   In other cases the source, the very progress of a blunder,--is
   discoverable. Thus whereas St. Mark (in xv. 6) certainly wrote e'na
   de'smion, ONPER etounto, the scribe of D who evidently derived his text
   from an earlier copy in uncial letters is found to have divided the
   Evangelist's syllables wrongly, and to exhibit in this place ON .
   PERETOUNTO. The consequence might have been predicted. 'AB transform
   this into ON . PARETOUNTO: which accordingly is the reading adopted by
   Tischendorf and by Westcott and Hort.

   Whenever in fact the final syllable of one word can possibly be
   mistaken for the first syllable of the next, or vice versa, it is safe
   sooner or later to have misled somebody. Thus, we are not at all
   surprised to find St. Mark's a` pare'labon (vii. 4) transformed into
   haper elabon, but only by B.

   [Another startling instance of the same phenomenon is supplied by the
   substitution in St. Mark vi. 22 of tes thugatro`s autou Herodia'dos.
   for tes thugatro`s autes tes Herodia'dos. Here a first copyist left out
   tes as being a repetition of the last syllable of autes, and afterwards
   a second attempted to improve the Greek by putting the masculine
   pronoun for the feminine (AUTOU for AUTEC). The consequence was hardly
   to have been foreseen.]

   Strange to say it results in the following monstrous figment:--that the
   fruit of Herod's incestuous connexion with Herodias had been a
   daughter, who was also named Herodias; and that she,--the King's own
   daughter,--was the immodest one [47] who came in and danced before him,
   his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee,' as they sat at
   the birthday banquet. Probability, natural feeling, the obvious
   requirements of the narrative, History itself--, for Josephus expressly
   informs us that Salome,' not Herodias,' was the name of Herodias'
   daughter [48] ,--all reclaim loudly against such a perversion of the
   truth. But what ought to be in itself conclusive, what in fact settles
   the question, is the testimony of the MSS.,--of which only seven ('BDLD
   with two cursive copies) can be found to exhibit this strange mistake.
   Accordingly the reading AUTOU is rejected by Griesbach, Lachmann,
   Tregelles, Tischendorf and Alford. It has nevertheless found favour
   with Dr. Hort; and it has even been thrust into the margin of the
   revised Text of our Authorized Version, as a reading having some
   probability.

   This is indeed an instructive instance of the effect of accidental
   errors--another proof that 'BDL cannot be trusted.

   Sufficiently obvious are the steps whereby the present erroneous
   reading was brought to perfection. The immediate proximity in MSS. of
   the selfsame combination of letters is observed invariably to result in
   a various reading. AUTECTEC was safe to part with its second TEC on the
   first opportunity, and the definitive article (tes) once lost, the
   substitution of AUTOU for AUTEC is just such a mistake as a copyist
   with ill-directed intelligence would be sure to fall into if he were
   bestowing sufficient attention on the subject to be aware that the
   person spoken of in verses 20 and 21 is Herod the King.

   [This recurrence of identical or similar syllables near together was a
   frequent source of error. Copying has always a tendency to become
   mechanical: and when the mind of the copyist sank to sleep in his
   monotonous toil, as well as if it became too active, the sacred Text
   suffered more or less, and so even a trifling mistake might be the seed
   of serious depravation.]

   § 5.

   Another interesting and instructive instance of error originating in
   sheer accident, is supplied by the reading in certain MSS. of St. Mark
   viii. 1. That the Evangelist wrote pampollou o'chlou the multitude
   being very great,' is certain. This is the reading of all the uncials
   but eight, of all the cursives but fifteen. But instead of this, it has
   been proposed that we should read, when there was again a great
   multitude,' the plain fact being that some ancient scribe mistook, as
   he easily might, the less usual compound word for what was to himself a
   far more familiar expression: i.e. he mistook PAMRPOLLOU for PALIN
   POLLOU.

   This blunder must date from the second century, for iterum' is met with
   in the Old Latin as well as in the Vulgate, the Gothic, the Bohairic,
   and some other versions. On the other hand, it is against every true
   principle of Textual Criticism' (as Dr. Tregelles would say), that the
   more difficult expression should be abandoned for the easier, when
   forty-nine out of every fifty MSS. are observed to uphold it; when the
   oldest version of all, the Syriac, is on the same side; when the source
   of the mistake is patent; and when the rarer word is observed to be in
   St. Mark's peculiar manner. There could be in fact no hesitation on
   this subject, if the opposition had not been headed by those notorious
   false witnesses 'BDL, which it is just now the fashion to uphold at all
   hazards. They happen to be supported on this occasion by GMND and
   fifteen cursives: while two other cursives look both ways and exhibit
   pa'lin pampollou.

   In St. Mark vii. 14, pa'lin irciaLv was similarly misread by some
   copyists for panta, and has been preserved by 'BDLD (PALIN for PANTA)
   against thirteen uncials, all the cursives, the Peshitto and Armenian.

   So again in St. John xiii. 37. A reads du'nasai' soi by an evident slip
   of the pen for du'namai' soi. And in xix. 31 megalE E Emera has become
   mega'le eme'ra in 'AEG and some cursive copies.

   105.

   [31] I look for an approving word from learned Dr. Field, who wrote in
   1875--The real obstacle to our acquiescing in the reading of the T. R.
   is, that if the words oude echo had once formed apart of the original
   text, there is no possibility of accounting for the subsequent omission
   of them.' The same remark, but considerably toned down, is found in his
   delightful Otium Norvicense, P. iii, p. 84.

   [32] B and C read--all? oudeno`s lo'gon poioumai te`n psuche`n timi'an
   emauto?: which is exactly what Lucifer Calarit. represents,--sed pro
   nihilo aestimo animam meam carom esse mihi' (Galland. vi. 241).

   [33] ' reads--all' oudeno`s lo'gon poioumai te`n psuchen timi'an emauto
   os teleiosai ton dro'mon mou.

   [34] Sed nihil horum [touton, is found in many Greek Codd.] vereor, nec
   facio animam meam pretiosiorem quam me.' So, the Cod. Amiat. It is
   evident then that when Ambrose (ii. 1040) writes nec facio animam meam
   cariorem mihi,' he is quoting the latter of these two clauses.
   Augustine (iii^1. 516), when he cites the place thus, Non enim facio
   animam meam pretiosiorem quam me'; and elsewhere (iv. 268) pretiosam
   mihi'; also Origen (interp. iv. 628 c), sed ego non facio cariorem
   animam meam mihi'; and even the Coptic, sed anima mea, dico, non est
   pretiosa mihi in aliquo verbo':--these evidently summarize the place,
   by making a sentence out of what survives of the second clause. The
   Latin of D exhibits Sed nihil horum cura est mihi: neque habeo ipsam
   animam caram mihi.'

   [35] Dr. Field says that it may be thus Graecized--all' oudena lo'gon
   poioumai, oude lelogistai moi psuche mou ti timion.

   [36] ii. 296 e,--exactly as the T. R.

   [37] Exactly as the T. R., except that he writes te`n psuchen, without
   mou (ix. 332). So again, further on (334 b), ouk echo timian ten
   emautou psuchen. This latter place is quoted in Cramer's Cat. 334.

   [38] Ap. Mai ii. 336 edei kai tes zoes kataphronein huper tou teleiosai
   ton dromon, oude ten psuchen ephe poieisthai timian heauto.

   [39] logon echo, oude poioumai ten psuchen timian emauto, hoste k.t.l.
   (ap. Galland. x. 222).

   [40] all' oudeno`s lo'gou poioumai ton deinon, oude echo te`n psuche`n
   timi'an emauto. Epist. ad Tars. c. 1 (Dressel, p. 255).

   [41] The whole of Dr. Field's learned annotation deserves to be
   carefully read and pondered. I speak of it especially in the shape in
   which it originally appeared, viz. in 1875.

   [42] Ibid. p. 2 and 3.

   [43] Surprising it is how largely the text of this place has suffered
   at the hands of Copyists and Translators. In A and D, the words
   poioumai and echo have been made to change places. The latter Codex
   introduces moi after echo,--for emauto, writes emautou,--and exhibits
   tou teleiosai without hos. C writes hos to teleiosai. 'B alone of
   Codexes present us with teleioso for teleiosai, and are followed by
   Westcott and Hort alone of Editors. The Peshitto (sed mihi nihili
   aestimatur anima mea'), the Sahidic (sed non facio animam meam in ullâ
   re'), and the Aethiopic (sed non reputo animam means nihil quidquam'),
   get rid of timi'an as well as of oude echo. So much diversity of text,
   and in such primitive witnesses, while it points to a remote period as
   the date of the blunder to which attention is called in the text,
   testifies eloquently to the utter perplexity which that blunder
   occasioned from the first.

   [44] Another example of the same phenomenon, (viz. the absorption of EN
   by the first syllable of ANthropois) is to be seen in Acts iv.
   12,--where however the error has led to no mischievous results.

CHAPTER III.

  ACCIDENTAL CAUSES OF CORRUPTION.

  II. HOMOEOTELEUTON.

   NO one who finds the syllable OI recurring six times over in about as
   many words,--e. g. kai egeneto, hos apelthon . . . OI angelOI, kai OI
   anthropOI OI pOImenes eipon,--is surprised to learn that MSS. of a
   certain type exhibit serious perturbation in that place. Accordingly,
   BLX: leave out the words kai hoi anthropoi; and in that mutilated form
   the modern critical editors are contented to exhibit St. Luke ii. 15.
   One would have supposed that Tischendorf's eyes would have been opened
   when he noticed that in his own Codex (') one word more (hoi) is
   dropped,--whereby nonsense is made of the passage (viz. of oi a'ngeloi
   poime'nes). Self-evident it is that a line with a like ending' has been
   omitted by the copyist of some very early codex of St. Luke's Gospel;
   which either read,--

   OI AGGELOI
   [KAI OI ANOI OI]
   POIMENEC        }or else{ OI AGGELOI
                             [KAI OI ANOI]
                             OI POIMENEC

   Another such place is found in St. John vi. 11. The Evangelist
   certainly described the act of our Saviour on a famous occasion in the
   well-known words,--kai` euchariste'sas

           die'doken

   tois [mathetais,

   oi de mathetai

   tois] anakeimenois.

   The one sufficient proof that St. John did so write, being the
   testimony of the MSS. Moreover, we are expressly assured by St. Matthew
   (xiv. 19), St. Mark (vi. 41), and St. Luke (ix. 16), that our Saviour's
   act was performed in this way. It is clear however that some scribe has
   suffered his eye to wander from tois in l. 2 to tois in l. 4,--whereby
   St. John is made to say that our Saviour himself distributed to the
   5000. The blunder is a very ancient one; for it has crept into the
   Syriac, Bohairic, and Gothic versions, besides many copies of the. Old
   Latin; and has established itself in the Vulgate. Moreover some good
   Fathers (beginning with Origen) so quote the place. But such evidence
   is unavailing to support 'ABLP, the early reading of being also
   contradicted by the fourth hand in the seventh century against the
   great cloud of witnesses,--beginning with D and including twelve other
   uncials, beside the body of the cursives, the Ethiopic and two copies
   of the Old Latin, as well as Cyril Alex.

   Indeed, there does not exist a source of error which has proved more
   fatal to the transcribers of MSS. than the proximity of identical, or
   nearly identical, combinations of letters. And because these are
   generally met with in the final syllables of words, the error referred
   to is familiarly known by a Greek name which denotes likeness of
   ending' (Homoeoteleuton). The eye of a scribe on reverting from his
   copy to the original before him is of necessity apt sometimes to alight
   on the same word, or what looks like the same word, a little lower
   down. The consequence is obvious. All that should have come in between
   gets omitted, or sometimes duplicated.

   It is obvious, that however inconvenient it may prove to find oneself
   in this way defrauded of five, ten, twenty, perhaps thirty words, no
   very serious consequence for the most part ensues. Nevertheless, the
   result is often sheer nonsense. When this is the case, it is loyally
   admitted by all. A single example may stand for a hundred. [In St. John
   vi. 55, that most careless of careless transcripts, the Sinaitic '
   omits on a most sacred subject seven words, and the result hardly
   admits of being characterized. Let the reader judge for himself. The
   passage stands thus:--e ga`r sa'rx mou alethos esti brosis, kai` to`
   haima' mou alethos estin po'sis The transcriber of ' by a very easy
   mistake let his eye pass from one alethos to another, and
   characteristically enough the various correctors allowed the error to
   remain till it was removed in the seventh century, though the error
   issued in nothing less than My Flesh is drink indeed.' Could that MS.
   have undergone the test of frequent use?]

   But it requires very little familiarity with the subject to be aware
   that occasions must inevitably be even of frequent occurrence when the
   result is calamitous, and even perplexing, in the extreme. The writings
   of Apostles and Evangelists, the Discourses of our Divine Lord Himself,
   abound in short formulae; and the intervening matter on such occasions
   is constantly an integral sentence, which occasionally may be
   discovered from its context without evident injury to the general
   meaning of the place. Thus [ver. 14 in St. Matt. xxiii. was omitted in
   an early age, owing to the recurrence of ouai` umin at the beginning,
   by some copyists, and the error was repeated in the Old Latin versions.
   It passed to Egypt, as some of the Bohairic copies, the Sahidic, and
   Origen testify. The Vulgate is not quite consistent: and of course
   'BDLZ, a concord of bad witnesses especially in St. Matthew, follow
   suit, in company with the Armenian, the Lewis, and five or more
   cursives, enough to make the more emphatic the condemnation by the main
   body of them. Besides the verdict of the cursives, thirteen uncials (as
   against five) including Ph and S, the Peshitto, Harkleian, Ethiopic,
   Arabian, some MSS. of the Vulgate, with Origen (iii. 838 (only in
   Lat.)); Chrysostom (vii. 707 (bis); ix. 755); Opus Imperf. 185 (bis);
   186 (bis); John Damascene (ii. 517); Theophylact (i. 124); Hilary (89;
   725); Jerome (iv. 276; v. 52; vi. 138; vii. 185)].

   Worst of all, it will sometimes of necessity happen that such an
   omission took place at an exceedingly remote period; (for there have
   been careless scribes in every age:) and in consequence the error is
   pretty sure to have propagated itself widely. It is observed to exist
   (suppose) in several of the known copies; and if,--as very often is the
   case,--it is discoverable in two or more of the old uncials,' all hope
   of its easy extirpation is at an end. Instead of being loyally
   recognized as a blunder,--which it clearly is,--it is forthwith charged
   upon the Apostle or Evangelist as the case may be. In other words, it
   is taken for granted that the clause in dispute can have had no place
   in the sacred autograph. It is henceforth treated as an unauthorized
   accretion to the text. Quite idle henceforth becomes the appeal to the
   ninety-nine copies out of a hundred which contain the missing words. I
   proceed to give an instance of my meaning.

   Our Saviour, having declared (St. Matt. xix. 9) that whosoever putteth
   away his wife ei me` epi` pornei'a kai` game'se a'llen, moichatai.
   Those five words are not found in Codd. 'DLS, nor in several copies of
   the Old Latin nor in some copies of the Bohairic, and the Sahidic.
   Tischendorf and Tregelles accordingly reject them.

   And yet it is perfectly certain that the words are genuine. Those
   thirty-one letters probably formed three lines in the oldest copies of
   all. Hence they are observed to exist in the Syriac (Peshitto,
   Harkleian and Jerusalem), the Vulgate, some copies of the Old Latin,
   the Armenian, and the Ethiopic, besides at least seventeen uncials
   (including BPhS), and the vast majority of the cursives. So that there
   can be no question of the genuineness of the clause.

   A somewhat graver instance of omission resulting from precisely the
   same cause meets us a little further on in the same Gospel. The
   threefold recurrence of ton in the expression ToN psichion ToN pipton
   ToN (St. Luke xvi. 20, has (naturally enough) resulted in the dropping
   of the words psichion ton out of some copies. Unhappily the sense is
   not destroyed by the omission. We are not surprised therefore to
   discover that the words are wanting in--'BL: or to find that 'BL are
   supported here by copies of the Old Latin, and (as usual) by the
   Egyptian versions, nor by Clemens Alex. [49] and the author of the
   Dialogus [50] . Jerome, on the other hand, condemns the Latin reading,
   and the Syriac Versions are observed to approve of Jerome's verdict, as
   well as the Gothic. But what settles the question is the fact that
   every known Greek MS., except those three, witnesses against the
   omission: besides Ambrose [51] , Jerome [52] , Eusebius [53] Alex.,
   Gregory [54] Naz., Asterius [55] , Basil [56] , Ephraim [57] Syr.,
   Chrysostom [58] , and Cyril [59] of Alexandria. Perplexing it is
   notwithstanding to discover, and distressing to have to record, that
   all the recent Editors of the Gospels are more or less agreed in
   abolishing the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table.'

   [The foregoing instances afford specimens of the influence of
   accidental causes upon the transmission from age to age of the Text of
   the Gospels. Before the sense of the exact expressions of the Written
   Word was impressed upon the mind of the Church,--when the Canon was not
   definitely acknowledged, and the halo of antiquity had not yet gathered
   round writings which had been recently composed,--severe accuracy was
   not to be expected. Errors would be sure to arise, especially from
   accident, and early ancestors would be certain to have a numerous
   progeny; besides that evil would increase, and slight deviations would
   give rise in the course of natural development to serious and
   perplexing corruptions.

   In the next chapter, other kinds of accidental causes will come under
   consideration.]

CHAPTER IV.

  ACCIDENTAL CAUSES OF CORRUPTION.

  III. FROM WRITING IN UNCIALS.

   § 1.

   CORRUPT readings have occasionally resulted from the ancient practice
   of writing Scripture in the uncial character, without accents,
   punctuation, or indeed any division of the text. Especially are they
   found in places where there is something unusual in the structure of
   the sentence.

   St. John iv. 35-6 (leukai' eisi pro`s therismo'n e'de) has suffered in
   this way,--owing to the unusual position of e'de. Certain of the
   scribes who imagined that e'de might belong to ver. 36, rejected the
   kai as superfluous; though no Father is known to have been guilty of
   such a solecism. Others, aware that e'de can only belong to ver. 35,
   were not unwilling to part with the copula at the beginning of ver. 36.
   A few, considering both words of doubtful authority, retained neither
   [60] . In this way it has come to pass that there are four ways of
   exhibiting this place:--(a) pro`s therismon e'de. Kai ho therizon:--(b)
   pro`s therismo'n Ede ho th.:--(c) pro`s therismon e'de. Ho
   therizon:--(d) pro`s therismo'n. Ho therizon, k.t.l..

   The only point of importance however is the position of e'de: which is
   claimed for ver. 35 by the great mass of the copies: as well as by
   Origen [61] , Eusebius [62] , Chrysostom [63] , Cyril [64] , the
   Vulgate, Jerome of course, and the Syriac. The Italic copies are
   hopelessly divided here [65] : and Codd. 'BMP do not help us. But e'de
   is claimed for ver. 36 by CDEL, 33, and by the Curetonian and Lewis (=
   kai e'de ho therizon): while Codex A is singular in beginning ver. 36,
   e'de kai--which shews that some early copyist, with the correct text
   before him, adopted a vicious punctuation. For there can be no manner
   of doubt that the commonly received text and the usual punctuation is
   the true one: as, on a careful review of the evidence, every
   unprejudiced reader will allow. But recent critics are for leaving out
   kai (with 'BCDL): while Tischendorf, Westcott and Hort, Tregelles
   (marg.), are for putting the full stop after pro`s therismo'n and (with
   ACDL) making e'de begin the next sentence,-- which (as Alford finds
   out) is clearly inadmissible.

   § 2.

   Sometimes this affects the translation. Thus, the Revisers propose in
   the parable of the prodigal And I perish here with hunger!' But why
   here?' Because I answer, whereas in the earliest copies of St. Luke the
   words stood thus,--EGoDELIMoAPOLLUMAI, some careless scribe after
   writing EGoDE, reduplicated the three last letters (oDE): he mistook
   them for an independent word. Accordingly in the Codex Bezae, in R and
   U and about ten cursives, we encounter ego de ode. The inventive
   faculty having thus done its work it remained to superadd
   transposition,' as was done by 'BL. From ego de ode limo the sentence
   has now developed into ego de limo ode: which approves itself to
   Griesbach and Schultz, to Lachmann and Tischendorf and Tregelles, to
   Alford and Westcott and Hort, and to the Revisers. A very ancient
   blunder, certainly, ego de hode is: for it is found in the Latin [66]
   and the Syriac translations. It must therefore date from the second
   century. But it is a blunder notwithstanding: a blunder against which
   16 uncials and the whole body of the cursives bear emphatic witness
   [67] . Having detected its origin, we have next to trace its progress.

   The inventors of hode or other scribes quickly saw that this word
   requires a correlative in the earlier part of the sentence.
   Accordingly, the same primitive authorities which advocate here,' are
   observed also to advocate, above, in my Father's house.' No extant
   Greek copy is known to contain the bracketed words in the sentence [en
   to oiko tou patros mou: but such copies must have existed in the second
   century. The Peshitto, the Cureton and Lewis recognize the three words
   in question; as well as copies of the Latin with which Jerome [68] ,
   Augustine [69] and Cassian [70] were acquainted. The phrase in domo
   patris mei' has accordingly established itself in the Vulgate. But
   surely we of the Church of England who have been hitherto spared this
   second blunder, may reasonably (at the end of 1700 years) refuse to
   take the first downward step. Our Lord intended no contrast whatever
   between two localities--but between two parties. The comfortable estate
   of the hired servants He set against the abject misery of the Son: not
   the house wherein the servants dwelt, and the spot where the poor
   prodigal was standing when he came to a better mind.--These are many
   words; but I know not how to be briefer. And,--what is worthy of
   discussion, if not the utterances of the Word made flesh?'

   If hesitation to accept the foregoing verdict lingers in any quarter,
   it ought to be dispelled by a glance at the context in 'BL. What else
   but the instinct of a trained understanding is it to survey the
   neighbourhood of a place like the present? Accordingly, we discover
   that in ver. 16, for gemisai ten koilian autou apo, 'BDLR present us
   with chortasthenai ek: and in ver. 22, the prodigal, on very nearly the
   same authority ('BDUX), is made to say to his father,--Poieson me hos
   e'na ton misthi'on sou:

   Which certainly he did not say [71] . Moreover, 'BLX and the Old Latin
   are for thrusting in tachu (D tacheos) after exene'nkate. Are not these
   one and all confessedly fabricated readings? the infelicitous attempts
   of some well-meaning critic to improve upon the inspired original?

   From the fact that three words in St. John v. 44 were in the oldest
   MSS. written thus,--MONOUThUOU (i.e. mo'nou Theou ou), the middle word
   (theou) got omitted from some very early copies; whereby the sentence
   is made to run thus in English,--And seek not the honour which cometh
   from the only One.' It is so that Origen [72] , Eusebius [73] , Didymus
   [74] , besides the two best copies of the Old Latin, exhibit the place.
   As to Greek MSS., the error survives only in B at the present day, the
   preserver of an Alexandrian error.

   § 3.

   St. Luke explains (Acts xxvii. 14) that it was the typhonic wind called
   Euroclydon' which caused the ship in which St. Paul and he sailed past
   Crete to incur the harm and loss' so graphically described in the last
   chapter but one of the Acts. That wind is mentioned nowhere but in this
   one place. Its name however is sufficiently intelligible; being
   compounded of Euros, the south-east wind,' and kludon, a tempest:' a
   compound which happily survives intact in the Peshitto version. The
   Syriac translator, not knowing what the word meant, copied what he
   saw,--the blast' (he says) of the tempest [75] , which [blast] is
   called Tophonikos Euroklidon.' Not so the licentious scribes of the
   West. They insisted on extracting out of the actual Euroclydon,' the
   imaginary name Euro-aquilo,' which accordingly stands to this day in
   the Vulgate. (Not that Jerome himself so read the name of the wind, or
   he would hardly have explained Eurielion' or Euriclion' to mean
   commiscens, sive deorsum ducens [76] .') Of this feat of theirs,
   Codexes ' and A (in which EUROKLUDoN has been perverted into EURAKULoN)
   are at this day the sole surviving Greek witnesses. Well may the
   evidence for Euro-aquilo' be scanty! The fabricated word collapses the
   instant it is examined. Nautical men point out that it is inconsistent
   in its construction with the principles on which the names of the
   intermediate or compound winds are framed:'--

   Euornotus is so called as intervening immediately between Eurus and
   Notus, and as partaking, as was thought, of the qualities of both. The
   same holds true of Libonotus, as being interposed between Libs and
   Notus. Both these compound winds lie in the same quarter or quadrant of
   the circle with the winds of which they are composed, and no other wind
   intervenes. But Eurus and Aquilo are at 90° distance from one another;
   or according to some writers, at 105°; the former lying in the
   south-east quarter, and the latter in the north-east: and two winds,
   one of which is the East cardinal point, intervene, as Caecias and
   Subsolanus [77] .'

   Further, why should the wind be designated by an impossible Latin name?
   The ship was a ship of Alexandria' (ver. 6). The sailors were Greeks.
   What business has Aquilo' here? Next, if the wind did bear the name of
   Euro-aquilo,' why is it introduced in this marked way (a'nemos
   tuphoniko`s, o kalou'menos) as if it were a kind of curiosity? Such a
   name would utterly miss the point, which is the violence of the wind as
   expressed in the term Euroclydon. But above all, if St. Luke wrote
   EURAK-, how has it come to pass that every copyist but three has
   written EUROK-? The testimony of B is memorable. The original scribe
   wrote EURAKUDoN [78] : the secunda manus has corrected this into
   EURUKLUDoN,--which is also the reading of Euthalius [79] . The
   essential circumstance is, that not ULoN but UDoN has all along been
   the last half of the word in Codex B [80] .

   In St. John iv. 15, on the authority of 'B, Tischendorf adopts
   die'rchesthai (in place of the uncompounded verb), assigning as his
   reason, that If St. John had written erchesthai, no one would ever have
   substituted die'rchesthai for it.' But to construct the text of
   Scripture on such considerations, is to build a lighthouse on a
   quicksand. I could have referred the learned Critic to plenty of places
   where the thing he speaks of as incredible has been done. The proof
   that St. John used the uncompounded verb is the fact that it is found
   in all the copies except our two untrustworthy friends. The explanation
   of DIerchomai is sufficiently accounted for by the final syllable (DE)
   of mede` which immediately precedes. Similarly but without the same
   excuse,

   St. Mark x. 16 eulogei has     become kateulogei ('BC)
       ?    " xii. 17 thaaumasan  "      exethaumasan ('B)
       ?    " xiv. 40 bebaremenoi "      katabebaremenoi (A'B)

   It is impossible to doubt that kai (in modern critical editions of St.
   Luke xvii. 37) is indebted for its existence to the same cause. In the
   phrase ekei sunachthesontai hoi aetoi it might have been predicted that
   the last syllable of ekei would some day be mistaken for the
   conjunction. And so it has actually come to pass. KAI oi aetoi is met
   with in many ancient authorities. But 'LB also transposed the clauses,
   and substituted episunachthesontai for sunachthe'sontai. The self-same
   casualty, viz. kai elicited out of the insertion of ekei and the
   transposition of the clauses, is discoverable among the Cursives at St.
   Matt. xxiv. 28,--the parallel place: where by the way the old uncials
   distinguish themselves by yet graver eccentricities [81] . How can we
   as judicious critics ever think of disturbing the text of Scripture on
   evidence so precarious as this?

   It is proposed that we should henceforth read St. Matt. xxii. 23 as
   follows:--On that day there came to Him Sadducecs saying that there is
   no Resurrection.' A new incident would be in this way introduced into
   the Gospel narrative: resulting from a novel reading of the passage.
   Instead of hoi le'gontes, we are invited to read le'gontes, on the
   authority of n 'BDMSZP and several of the Cursives, besides Origen,
   Methodius, Epiphanius. This is a respectable array. There is
   nevertheless a vast preponderance of numbers in favour of the usual
   reading, which is also found in the Old Latin copies and in the
   Vulgate. But surely the discovery that in the parallel Gospels it is--

     oi'tines le'gousin ana'stasin me` einai (St. Mark xii. 18) and
     oi antile'gontes ana'stasin me` einai (St. Luke xx. 27)

   may be considered as decisive in a case like the present. Sure I am
   that it will be so regarded by any one who has paid close attention to
   the method of the Evangelists. Add that the origin of the mistake is
   seen, the instant the words are inspected as they must have stood in an
   uncial copy:

   CADDOUKAIOIOILEGONTES

   and really nothing more requires to be said. The second OI was safe to
   be dropped in a collocation of letters like that. It might also have
   been anticipated, that there would be found copyists to be confused by
   the antecedent KAI. Accordingly the Peshitto, Lewis, and Curetonian
   render the place et dicentes;' shewing that they mistook KAI OI
   LEGONTES for a separate phrase.

   § 4.

   The termination TO (in certain tenses of the verb), when followed by
   the neuter article, naturally leads to confusion; sometimes to
   uncertainty. In St. John v. 4 for instance, where we read in our copies
   kai etarasse to hudor but so many MSS. read etarasseto, that it becomes
   a perplexing question which reading to follow. The sense in either case
   is excellent: the only difference being whether the Evangelist actually
   says that the Angel troubled' the water, or leaves it to be inferred
   from the circumstance that after the Angel had descended, straightway
   the water was troubled.'

   The question becomes less difficult of decision when (as in St. Luke
   vii. 21) we have to decide between two expressions echari'sato ble'pein
   (which is the reading of '*ABDEG and 11 other uncials) and echari'sato
   to ble'pein which is only supported by '^bELVA. The bulk of the
   Cursives faithfully maintain the former reading, and merge the article
   in the verb.

   Akin to the foregoing are all those instances,--and they are literally
   without number--, where the proximity of a like ending has been the
   fruitful cause of error. Let me explain: for this is a matter which
   cannot be too thoroughly apprehended.

   Such a collection of words as the following two instances exhibit will
   shew my meaning.

   In the expression estheta lampra`n ane'pempsen (St. Luke xxiii. 11), we
   are not surprised to find the first syllable of the verb (an) absorbed
   by the last syllable of the immediately preceding lampran. Accordingly,
   'LR supported by one copy of the Old Latin and a single cursive MS.
   concur in displaying epempsen in this place.

   The letters NAIKoNAIKAI in the expression (St. Luke xxiii. 27) gunaikon
   ai` kai` were safe to produce confusion. The first of these three words
   could of course take care of itself. (Though D, with some of the
   Versions, make it into gunaikes.) Not so however what follows. ABCDLX
   and the Old Latin (except c) drop the kai: ' and C drop the ai. The
   truth rests with the fourteen remaining uncials and with the cursives.

   Thus also the reading en ole te Galilaia (B) in St. Matt. iv. 23,
   (adopted by Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles, Alford, Westcott and Hort
   and the Revisers,) is due simply to the reduplication on the part of
   some inattentive scribe of the last two letters of the immediately
   preceding word,--periegen. The received reading of the place is the
   correct one,--kai` periegen o'len te Galilai'an o Iesous because the
   first five words are so exhibited in all the Copies except B'C; and
   those three MSS. are observed to differ as usual from one
   another,--which ought to be deemed fatal to their evidence. Thus,

   B reads kai periegen en o'le te Galilai'a.

   '    ?"?   kai periegen ho i?s? en te Galilai'a.

   C    ?"?   kai periegen ho i?s? en o'le te Galilai'a.

   But--(I shall be asked)--what about the position of the Sacred Name?
   How comes it to pass that o Iesous, which comes after Galilai'an in
   almost every other known copy, should come after riegen ho in three of
   these venerable authorities (in D as well as in ' and C), and in the
   Latin, Peshitto, Lewis, and Harkleian? Tischendorf, Alford, Westcott
   and Hort and the Revisers at all events (who simply follow B in leaving
   out o Iesous altogether) will not ask me this question: but a
   thoughtful inquirer is sure to ask it.

   The phrase (I reply) is derived by 'CD from the twin place in St.
   Matthew (ix. 35) which in all the MSS. begins kai` perie;gen o i?s?. So
   familiar had this order of the words become, that the scribe of ', (a
   circumstance by the way of which Tischendorf takes no notice,) has even
   introduced the expression into St. Mark vi. 6,--the parallel place in
   the second Gospel,--where o i?s? is clearly has no business. I enter
   into these minute details because only in this way is the subject
   before us to be thoroughly understood. This is another instance where
   the Old Uncials' shew their text to be corrupt; so for assurance in
   respect of accuracy of detail we must resort to the Cursive Copies.

   § 5.

   The introduction of apo in the place of a'gioi made by the Revisers'
   into the Greek Text of 2 Peter i. 27,--derives its origin from the same
   prolific source. [1] some very ancient scribe mistook the first four
   letters of agioi, for apo. It was but the mistaking of AGIO for APO. At
   the end of 1700 years, the only Copies which witness to this deformity
   are BP with four cursives,--in opposition to 'AKL and the whole body of
   the cursives, the Vulgate [82] and the Harkleian. Euthalius knew
   nothing of it [83] . Obvious it was, next, for some one in
   perplexity,--[2] to introduce both readings (apo and a'gioi) into the
   text. Accordingly apo Theou a'gioi, is found in C, two cursives, and
   Didymus [84] . Then, [3], another variant crops up, (viz. hupo for
   apo--but only because hupo went immediately before); of which fresh
   blunder hupo Theou a'gioi) Theophylact is the sole patron [85] . The
   consequence of all this might have been foreseen: [4] it came to pass
   that from a few Codexes, both apo and agioi were left out,--which
   accounts for the reading of certain copies of the Old Latin [86] .
   Unaware how the blunder began, Tischendorf and his followers claim
   [1],' [3],' and [4],' as proofs that [1]' is the right reading: and, by
   consequence, instead of holy men of God spake,' require us to read men
   spake from God,' which is wooden and vapid. Is it not clear that a
   reading attested by only BP and four cursive copies must stand
   self-condemned?

   Another excellent specimen of this class of error is furnished by Heb.
   vii. 1. Instead of Ho sunante'sas Abraa'm--said of Melchizedek,--'ABD
   exhibit OC. The whole body of the copies, headed by CLP, are against
   them [87] , -- besides Chrysostom [88] , Theodoret [89] , Damascene
   [90] . It is needless to do more than state how this reading arose. The
   initial letter of sunante'sas has been reduplicated through careless
   transcription: OCCUN--instead of OCUN--. That is all. But the
   instructive feature of the case is that it is in the four oldest of the
   uncials that this palpable blunder is found.

   § 6.

   I have reserved for the last a specimen which is second to none in
   suggestiveness. Whom will ye that I release unto you?' asked Pilate on
   a memorable occasion [91] : and we all remember how his enquiry
   proceeds. But the discovery is made that, in an early age there existed
   copies of the Gospel which proceeded thus,--Jesus [who is called [92] ]
   Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?' Origen so quotes the place,
   but In many copies,' he proceeds, mention is not made that Barabbas was
   also called Jesus: and those copies may perhaps be right,--else would
   the name of Jesus belong to one of the wicked,--of which no instance
   occurs in any part of the Bible: nor is it fitting that the name of
   Jesus should like Judas have been borne by saint and sinner alike. I
   think,' Origen adds, something of this sort must have been an
   interpolation of the heretics [93] .' From this we are clearly intended
   to infer that Jesus Barabbas' was the prevailing reading of St. Matt.
   xxvii. 17 in the time of Origen, a circumstance which--besides that a
   multitude of copies existed as well as those of Origen--for the best of
   reasons, we take leave to pronounce incredible [94] .

   The sum of the matter is probably this:--Some inattentive second
   century copyist [probably a Western Translator into Syriac who was an
   indifferent Greek scholar] mistook the final syllable of unto you'
   (UMIN) for the word Jesus' (I?N?): in other words, carelessly
   reduplicated the last two letters of UMIN,--from which, strange to say,
   results the form of inquiry noticed at the outset. Origen caught sight
   of the extravagance, and condemned it though he fancied it to be
   prevalent, and the thing slept for 1500 years. Then about just fifty
   years ago Drs. Lachmann, Tischendorf and Tregelles began to construct
   that fabric of Textual Criticism' which has been the cause of the
   present treatise [though indeed Tischendorf does not adopt the
   suggestion of those few aberrant cursives which is supported by no
   surviving uncial, and in fact advocates the very origin of the mischief
   which has been just described]. But, as every one must see, such things
   as these are not readings' at all, nor even the work of the heretics;'
   but simply transcriptional mistakes. How Dr. Hort, admitting the
   blunder, yet pleads that this remarkable reading is attractive by the
   new and interesting fact which it seems to attest, and by the
   antithetic force which it seems to add to the question in ver. 17,' [is
   more than we can understand. To us the expression seems most repulsive.
   No antithetic force' can outweigh our dislike to the idea that Barabbas
   was our Saviour'S namesake! We prefer Origen's account, though he
   mistook the cause, to that of the modern critic.]

   than by Birch,--from whom Tregelles and Tischendorf copy it.
   Theophylact (p. 156 a) must have seen the place as quoted by
   Gallandius. The only evidence, so far as I can find, for reading Jesus
   Barabbas' (in St. Matt. xxvii. 16, 17) are five disreputable Evangelia
   1, 118, 209, 241, 299,--the Armenian Version, the Jerusalem Syriac,
   [and the Sinai Syriac]; (see Adler, pp. 172-3).

CHAPTER V.

  ACCIDENTAL CAUSES OF CORRUPTION.

  IV. ITACISM.

   [IT has been already shewn in the First Volume that the Art of
   Transcription on vellum did not reach perfection till after the lapse
   of many centuries in the life of the Church. Even in the minute
   elements of writing much uncertainty prevailed during a great number of
   successive ages. It by no means followed that, if a scribe possessed a
   correct auricular knowledge of the Text, he would therefore exhibit it
   correctly on parchment. Copies were largely disfigured with misspelt
   words. And vowels especially were interchanged; accordingly, such
   change became in many instances the cause of corruption, and is known
   in Textual Criticism under the name Itacism.']

   § I.

   It may seem to a casual reader that in what follows undue attention is
   being paid to minute particulars. But it constantly happens,--and this
   is a sufficient answer to the supposed objection,--that, from
   exceedingly minute and seemingly trivial mistakes, there result
   sometimes considerable and indeed serious misrepresentations of the
   Spirit's meaning. New incidents:--unheard-of statements:--facts as yet
   unknown to readers of Scripture:--perversions of our Lord's Divine
   sayings:--such phenomena are observed to follow upon the omission of
   the article,--the insertion of an expletive,--the change of a single
   letter. Thus palin, thrust in where it has no business, makes it appear
   that our Saviour promised to return the ass on which He- rode in
   triumph into Jerusalem [95] . By writing o for o, many critics have
   transferred some words from the lips of Christ to those of His
   Evangelist, and made Him say what He never could have dreamed of saying
   [96] . By subjoining s to a word in a place which it has no right to
   fill, the harmony of the heavenly choir has been marred effectually,
   and a sentence produced which defies translation [97] . By omitting to
   and Kurie, the repenting malefactor is made to say, Jesus! remember me,
   when Thou comest in Thy kingdom [98] .'

   Speaking of our Saviour's triumphal entry into Jerusalem, which took
   place the day after' they made Him a supper,' and Lazarus which had
   been dead, whom He raised from the dead,' sat at the table with Him'
   (St. John xii. 1, 2), St. John says that the multitude which had been
   with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised Him from the
   dead bare testimony' (St. John xii. 17). The meaning of this is best
   understood by a reference to St. Luke xix. 37, 38, where it is
   explained that it was the sight of so many acts of Divine Power, the
   chiefest of all being the raising of Lazarus, which moved the crowds to
   yield the memorable testimony recorded by St. Luke in ver. 38,--by St.
   John in ver. 13 [99] . But Tischendorf and Lachmann, who on the
   authority of D and four later uncials read hoti instead of hote, import
   into the Gospel quite another meaning. According to their way of
   exhibiting the text, St. John is made to say that the multitude which
   was with Jesus, testified that He called Lazarus out of the tomb and
   raised him from the dead': which is not only an entirely different
   statement, but also the introduction of a highly improbable
   circumstance. That many copies of the Old Latin (not of the Vulgate)
   recognize On, besides the Peshitto and the two Egyptian versions, is
   not denied. This is in fact only one more proof of the insufficiency of
   such collective testimony. 'AB with the rest of the uncials and, what
   is of more importance, the whole body of the cursive, exhibit
   hote,--which, as every one must see, is certainly what St. John wrote
   in this place. Tischendorf's assertion that the prolixity of the
   expression ephonesen ek tou mnemei'ou kai` e'geiren auto`n ek nekron is
   inconsistent with o'te [100] ,--may surprise, but will never convince
   any one who is even moderately acquainted with St. John's peculiar
   manner.

   The same mistake--of o'ti for o'te--is met with at ver. 41 of the same
   chapter. These things said Isaiah because he saw His glory' (St. John
   xii. 41). And why not when he saw His glory'? which is what the
   Evangelist wrote according to the strongest attestation. True, that
   eleven manuscripts (beginning with 'ABL) and the Egyptian versions
   exhibit o'ti: also Nonnus, who lived in the Thebaid (A.D. 410): but all
   other MSS., the Latin, Peshitto, Gothic, Ethiopic, Georgian, and one
   Egyptian version:--Origen [101] ,-- Eusebius in four places [102]
   ,--Basil [103] ,--Gregory of Nyssa twice [104] , --Didymus three times
   [105] ,--Chrysostom twice [106] ,--Severianus of Gabala [107] ;--these
   twelve Versions and Fathers constitute a body of ancient evidence which
   is overwhelming. Cyril three times reads hoti [108] , three times hote
   [109] , and once enika [110] , which proves at least how he understood
   the place.

   § 2.

   [A suggestive example [111] of the corruption introduced by a petty
   Itacism may be found in Rev. i. 5, where the beautiful expression which
   has found its way into so many tender passages relating to Christian
   devotion, Who hath washed [112] us from our sins in His own blood'
   (A.V.), is replaced in many critical editions (R.V.) by, Who hath
   loosed [113] us from our sins by His blood.' In early times a purist
   scribe, who had a dislike of anything that savoured of provincial
   retention of Aeolian or Dorian pronunciations, wrote from unconscious
   bias u for ou, transcribing lusanti for lousanti (unless he were not
   Greek scholar enough to understand the difference): and he was followed
   by others, especially such as, whether from their own prejudices or
   owing to sympathy with the scruples of other people, but at all events
   under the influence of a slavish literalism, hesitated about a passage
   as to which they did not rise to the spiritual height of the precious
   meaning really conveyed therein. Accordingly the three uncials, which
   of those that give the Apocalypse date nearest to the period of
   corruption, adopt u, followed by nine cursives, the Harkleian Syriac,
   and the Armenian versions. On the other side, two uncials--viz. B^2 of
   the eighth century and P of the ninth--the Vulgate, Bohairic, and
   Ethiopic, write lousanti; and--what is most important--all the other
   cursives except the handful just mentioned, so far as examination has
   yet gone, form a barrier which forbids intrusion.

   An instance where an error from an Itacism has crept into the Textus
   Receptus may be seen in St. Luke xvi. 25. Some scribes needlessly
   changed hode into hode, misinterpreting the letter which served often
   for both the long and the short o, and thereby cast out some
   illustrative meaning, since Abraham meant to lay stress upon the
   enjoyment in his bosom' of comfort by Lazarus. The unanimity of the
   uncials, a majority of the cursives, the witness of the versions, that
   of the Fathers quote the place being uncertain, are sufficient to prove
   that hode is the genuine word.

   Again, in St. John xiii. 25, ou'tos has dropped out of many copies and
   so out of the Received Text because by an Itacism it was written houtos
   in many manuscripts. Therefore ekeinos houtos was thought to be a clear
   mistake, and the weaker word was accordingly omitted. No doubt Latins
   and others who did not understand Greek well considered also that
   ou'tos was redundant, and this was the cause of its being omitted in
   the Vulgate. But really ou'tos, being sufficiently authenticated [114]
   , is exactly in consonance with Greek usage and St. John's style [115]
   , and adds considerably to the graphic character of the sacred
   narrative. St. John was reclining (anakeimenos) on his left arm over
   the bosom of the robe (en to ko'lpo ) of the Saviour. When St. Peter
   beckoned to him he turned his head for the moment and sank (epipeson,
   not anapeson which has the testimony only of B and about twenty-five
   uncials, ' and C being divided against themselves) on the breast of the
   Lord, being still in the general posture in which he was (ou'tos [116]
   ), and asked Him in a whisper LORD, who is it?'

   Another case of confusion between o and o may be seen in St. Luke xv.
   24, 32, where apololo's has gained so strong a hold that it is found in
   the Received Text for apololo's, which last being the better attested
   appears to be the right reading [117] . But the instance which requires
   the most attention is katha'rizon in St. Mark vii. 19, and all the more
   because in The Last Twelve Verses of St. Mark, the alteration into
   katha'rizon is advocated as being no part of the Divine discourse, but
   the Evangelist's inspired comment on the Saviour's words [118] :' Such
   a question must be decided strictly by the testimony, not upon internal
   evidence--which in fact is in this case absolutely decisive neither
   way, for people must not be led by the attractive view opened by
   kathari'zon, and katha'rizon bears a very intelligible meaning. When we
   find that the uncial evidence is divided, there being eight against the
   change (PhSKMUVGP), and eleven for it ('ABEFGHLSXD);--that not much is
   advanced by the versions, though the Peshitto, the Lewis Codex, the
   Harkleian (?), the Gothic, the Old Latin [119] . the Vulgate, favour
   katha'rizon;--nor by the Fathers:--since Aphraates [120] , Augustine
   (?) [121] , and Novatian [122] are contradicted by Origen [123] ,
   Theophylact [124] , and Gregory Thaumaturgus [125] . we discover that
   we have not so far made much way towards a satisfactory conclusion. The
   only decided element of judgement, so far as present enquiries have
   reached, since suspicion is always aroused by the conjunction of 'AB,
   is supplied by the cursives which with a large majority witness to the
   received reading. It is not therefore safe to alter it till a much
   larger examination of existing evidence is made than is now possible.
   If difficulty is felt in the meaning given by katha'rizon,--and that
   there is such difficulty cannot candidly be denied,--this is balanced
   by the grammatical difficulty introduced by kathari'zon, which would be
   made to agree in the same clause with a verb separated from it by
   thirty-five parenthetic words, including two interrogations and the
   closing sentence. Those people who form their judgement from the
   Revised Version should bear in mind that the Revisers, in order to make
   intelligible sense, were obliged to introduce three fresh English words
   that have nothing to correspond to them in the Greek; being a
   repetition of what the mind of the reader would hardly bear in memory.
   Let any reader who doubts this leave out the words in italics and try
   the effect for himself. The fact is that to make this reading
   satisfactory, another alteration is required. Kathari'zon pa'nta ta`
   bro'mata ought either to be transferred to the 20th verse or to the
   beginning of the 18th. Then all would be clear enough, though destitute
   of a balance of authority: as it is now proposed to read, the passage
   would have absolutely no parallel in the simple and transparent
   sentences of St. Mark. We must therefore be guided by the balance of
   evidence, and that is turned by the cursive testimony.]

   § 3.

   Another minute but interesting indication of the accuracy and fidelity
   with which the cursive copies were made, is supplied by the constancy
   with which they witness to the preposition en (not the numeral e`n) in
   St. Mark iv. 8. Our Lord says that the seed which fell into the good
   ground' yielded by (en) thirty, and by (en) sixty, and by (en) an
   hundred.' Tischendorf notes that besides all the uncials which are
   furnished with accents and breathings (viz. EFGHKMUVP) nearly 100
   cursives' exhibit en here and in ver. 20. But this is to misrepresent
   the case. All the cursives may be declared to exhibit en, e.g. all
   Matthaei's and all Scrivener's. I have myself with this object examined
   a large number of Evangelia, and found en in all. The Basle MS. from
   which Erasmus derived his text [126] exhibits en,--though he printed
   e`n out of respect for the Vulgate. The Complutensian having e`n, the
   reading of the Textus Receptus follows in consequence: but the
   Traditional reading has been shewn to be en,--which is doubtless
   intended by EN in Cod. A.

   Codd. 'CA (two ever licentious and D similarly so throughout St. Mark)
   substitute for the preposition en the preposition eis,--(a sufficient
   proof to me that they understand EN to represent en, not e`n): and are
   followed by Tischendorf, Tregelles, and the Revisers. As for the
   chartered libertine B (and its servile henchman L), for the first en
   (but not for the second and third) it substitutes the preposition EIC:
   while, in ver. 20, it retains the first en, but omits the other two. In
   all these vagaries Cod. B is followed by Westcott and Hort [127] .

   § 4.

   St. Paul [128] in his Epistle to Titus [ii. 5] directs that young women
   shall be keepers at home,' oikourou`s. So, (with five exceptions,)
   every known Codex [129] , including the corrected ' and D,--HKLP;
   besides 17, 37, 47. So also Clemens Alex. [130] (A.D. 180),--Theodore
   of Mopsuestia [131] ,--Basil [132] ,--Chrysostom [133] ,--Theodoret
   [134] ,--Damascene [135] . So again the Old Latin (domum custodientes
   [136] ),--the Vulgate (domus curam habentes [137] ), -- and Jerome
   (habentes domus diligentiam [138] ): and so the Peshitto and the
   Harkleian versions,--besides the Bohairic. There evidently can be no
   doubt whatever about such a reading so supported. To be oikourou`s was
   held to be a woman's chiefest praise [139] : kalliston ergon gune
   oikouros, writes Clemens Alex. [140] ; assigning to the wife oikouria
   as her proper province [141] . On the contrary, gadding about from
   house to house' is what the Apostle, writing to Timothy [142] ,
   expressly condemns. But of course the decisive consideration is not the
   support derived from internal evidence; but the plain fact that
   antiquity, variety, respectability, numbers, continuity of attestation,
   are all in favour of the Traditional reading.

   Notwithstanding this, Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles, Westcott and
   Hort, because they find oikourgous in '*ACD*F-G, are for thrusting that
   barbarous and scarcely intelligible' word, if it be not even a
   non-existent [143] , into Titus ii. 5. The Revised Version in
   consequence exhibits workers at home,'--which Dr. Field may well call
   an unnecessary and most tasteless innovation.' But it is insufficiently
   attested as well, besides being a plain perversion of the Apostle's
   teaching. [And the error must have arisen from carelessness and
   ignorance, probably in the West where Greek was not properly
   understood.]

   So again, in the cry of the demoniacs, ti' emin kai` soi', Iesou, huie
   tou Theou (St. Matt. viii. 29) the name Iesou is omitted by B'.

   The reason is plain the instant an ancient MS. is
   inspected:--KAICOIIUUIETOUThU:--the recurrence of the same letters
   caused too great a strain to scribes, and the omission of two of them
   was the result of ordinary human infirmity.

   Indeed, to this same source are to be attributed an extraordinary
   number of so-called various readings'; but which in reality, as has
   already been shewn, are nothing else but a collection of mistakes,--the
   surviving tokens that anciently, as now, copying clerks left out words;
   whether misled by the fatal proximity of a like ending, or by the
   speedy recurrence of the like letters, or by some other phenomenon with
   which most men's acquaintance with books have long since made them
   familiar.

   corrected text, and on account of other indications which caused me to
   doubt whether he retained the opinion of his earlier years, I applied
   to the Rev. W. F. Rose, who answered as follows:--I am thankful to say
   that I can resolve all doubt as to my uncle's later views of St. Mark
   vii. 29. In his annotated copy of the Twelve Verses he deletes the
   words in his note p. 179, "This appears to be the true reading," and
   writes in the margin, "The old reading is doubtless the true one," and
   in the margin of the paragraph referring to kathari'zon, on p. 180 he
   writes, "Alter the wording of this." This entirely agrees with my own
   recollection of many conversations with him on the subject. I think he
   felt that the weight of the cursive testimony to the old reading was
   conclusive,--at least that he was not justified in changing the text in
   spite of it.' These last words of Mr. Rose express exactly the
   inference that I had drawn.

   [119] The majority of the Old Latin MSS. have "in secessum uadit (or

CHAPTER VI.

  ACCIDENTAL CAUSES OF CORRUPTION.

  V. LITURGICAL INFLUENCE.

    §. 1.

   THERE is one distinct class of evidence provided by Almighty God for
   the conservation of the deposit in its integrity [144] which calls for
   special notice in this place. The Lectionaries of the ancient Church
   have not yet nearly enjoyed the attention they deserve, or the
   laborious study which in order to render them practically available
   they absolutely require. Scarcely any persons, in fact, except
   professed critics, are at all acquainted with the contents of the very
   curious documents alluded to: while collations of any of them which
   have been hitherto effected are few indeed. I speak chiefly of the
   Books called Evangelistaria (or Evangeliaria), in other words, the
   proper lessons collected out of the Gospels, and transcribed into a
   separate volume. Let me freely admit that I subjoin a few observations
   on this subject with unfeigned diffidence; having had to teach myself
   throughout the little I know;--and discovering in the end how very
   insufficient for my purpose that little is. Properly handled, an
   adequate study of the Lectionaries of the ancient Church would become
   the labour of a life. We require exact collations of at least too of
   them. From such a practical acquaintance with about a tenth of the
   extant copies some very interesting results would infallibly be
   obtained [145] .

   As for the external appearance of these documents, it may be enough to
   say that they range, like the mass of uncial and cursive copies, over a
   space of about 700 years,--the oldest extant being of about the eighth
   century, and the latest dating in the fifteenth. Rarely are any so old
   as the former date,--or so recent as the last named. When they began to
   be executed is not known; but much older copies than any which at
   present exist must have perished through constant use: [for they are in
   perfect order when we first become acquainted with them, and as a whole
   they are remarkably consistent with one another]. They are almost
   invariably written in double columns, and not unfrequently are
   splendidly executed. The use of Uncial letters is observed to have been
   retained in documents of this class to a later period than in the case
   of the Evangelia, viz. down to the eleventh century. For the most part
   they are furnished with a kind of musical notation executed in
   vermilion; evidently intended to guide the reader in that peculiar
   recitative which is still customary in the oriental Church.

   In these books the Gospels always stand in the following order: St.
   John: St. Matthew: St. Luke: St. Mark. The lessons are
   brief,--resembling the Epistles and Gospels in our Book of Common
   Prayer.

   They seem to me to fall into two classes: (a) Those which contain a
   lesson for every day in the year: (b) Those which only contain [lessons
   for fixed Festivals and] the Saturday-Sunday lessons (sabbatokuriakai).
   We are reminded by this peculiarity that it was not till a very late
   period in her history that the Eastern Church was able to shake herself
   clear of the shadow of the old Jewish Sabbath [146] . [To these
   Lectionaries Tables of the Lessons were often added, of a similar
   character to those which we have in our Prayer-books. The Table of
   daily Lessons went under the title of Synaxarion (or Eclogadion); and
   the Table of the Lessons of immovable Festivals and Saints' days was
   styled Menologion [147] .]

   Liturgical use has proved a fruitful source of textual perturbation.
   Nothing less was to have been expected,--as every one must admit who
   has examined ancient Evangelia with any degree of attention. For a
   period before the custom arose of writing out the Ecclesiastical
   Lections in the Evangelistaries,' and Apostolos,' it may be regarded as
   certain that the practice generally prevailed of accommodating an
   ordinary copy, whether of the Gospels or of the Epistles, to the
   requirements of the Church. This continued to the last to be a
   favourite method with the ancients [148] . Not only was it the
   invariable liturgical practice to introduce an ecclesiastical lection
   with an ever-varying formula,--by which means the holy Name is often
   found in MSS. where it has no proper place,--but notes of time, &c.,
   [like the unique and indubitably genuine word deuteroproto [149] ,' are
   omitted as carrying no moral lesson, as well as longer passages like
   the case of the two verses recounting the ministering Angel with the
   Agony and the Bloody Sweat [150] .

   That Lessons from the New Testament were probably read in the
   assemblies of the faithful according to a definite scheme, and on an
   established system, at least as early as the fourth century, has been
   shewn to follow from plain historical fact in the tenth chapter of the
   Twelve Last Verses of St. Mark's Gospel, to which the reader is
   referred for more detailed information. Cyril, at Jerusalem,--and by
   implication, his namesake at Alexandria,--Chrysostom, at Antioch and at
   Constantinople,--Augustine, in Africa,--all four expressly witness to
   the circumstance. In other words, there is found to have been at least
   at that time fully established throughout the Churches of Christendom a
   Lectionary, which seems to have been essentially one and the same in
   the West and in the East. That it must have been of even Apostolic
   antiquity may be inferred from several considerations [151] . For
   example, Marcion, in A. D. 140, would hardly have constructed an
   Evangelistarium and Apostolicon of his own, as we learn from Epiphanius
   [152] , if he had not been induced by the Lectionary System prevailing
   around him to form a counterplan of teaching upon the same model.]

  § 2.

   Indeed, the high antiquity of the Church's Lectionary System is
   inferred with certainty from many a textual phenomenon with which
   students of Textual Science are familiar.

   It may be helpful to a beginner if I introduce to his notice the class
   of readings to be discussed in the present chapter, by inviting his
   attention to the first words of the Gospel for St. Philip and St.
   James' Day in our own English Book of Common Prayer,--And Jesus said
   unto His disciples.' Those words he sees at a glance are undeniably
   nothing else but an Ecclesiastical accretion to the Gospel,--words
   which breed offence in no quarter, and occasion error to none. They
   have nevertheless stood prefixed to St. John xiv. 1 from an exceedingly
   remote period; for, besides establishing themselves in every Lectionary
   of the ancient Church [153] , they are found in Cod. D [154] ,--in
   copies of the Old Latin [155] as the Vercellensis, Corbeiensis, Aureus,
   Bezae,-- and in copies of the Vulgate. They may be of the second or
   third, they must be as old as the fourth century. It is evident that it
   wants but a very little for those words to have established their claim
   to a permanent place in the Text. Readings just as slenderly supported
   have been actually adopted before now [156] .

   I proceed to cite another instance; and here the success of an ordinary
   case of Lectionary licence will be perceived to have been complete: for
   besides recommending itself to Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles, and
   Westcott and Hort, the blunder in question has established itself in
   the pages of the Revised Version. Reference is made to an alteration of
   the Text occurring in certain copies of Acts iii. 1, which will be
   further discussed below [157] . When it has been stated that these
   copies are 'ABCG,--the Vulgate,--the two Egyptian versions,--besides
   the Armenian,--and the Ethiopic,--it will be admitted that the
   Ecclesiastical practice which has resulted in so widespread a reading,
   must be primitive indeed. To some persons such a formidable array of
   evidence may seem conclusive in favour of any reading: but it can only
   seem so to those who do not realize the weight of counter-testimony.

   But by far the most considerable injury which has resulted to the
   Gospel from this cause is the suspicion which has alighted in certain
   quarters on the last twelve verses of the Gospel according to St. Mark.
   [Those verses made up by themselves a complete Lection. The preceding
   Lection, which was used on the Second Sunday after Easter, was closed
   with the Liturgical note The End,' or TO TELOC, occurring after the
   eighth verse. What more probable, nay, more certain result could there
   be, than that some scribe should mistake the end of the Lection for the
   end of St. Mark's Gospel, if the last leaf should chance to have been
   torn off, and should then transcribe no more [158] ? How natural that
   St. Mark should express himself in a more condensed and abrupt style
   than usual. This of course is only put forward as an explanation, which
   leaves the notion of another writer and a later date unnecessary. If it
   can be improved upon, so much the better. Candid critics ought to study
   Dean Burgon's elaborate chapter already referred to before rejecting
   it.]

  3.

   And there probably does not exist, in the whole compass of the Gospel,
   a more interesting instance of this than is furnished by the words eipe
   de` o Ku'rios, in St. Luke vii. 31. This is certainly derived from the
   Lectionaries; being nothing else but the formula with which it was
   customary to introduce the lection that begins at this place.
   Accordingly, only one out of forty copies which have been consulted for
   the purpose contains them. But the circumstance of interest remains to
   be stated. When these four unauthorized words have been thus got rid
   of, the important discovery is made that the two preceding verses
   (verses 28 and 29) must needs form a part of our Lord's
   discourse,--which it is perceived flows on unbroken from v. 24 to v.
   35. This has been seen already by some [159] , though denied by others.
   But the fact does not admit of rational doubt; though it is certainly
   not as yet generally known. It is not generally known, I mean, that the
   Church has recovered a piece of knowledge with which she was once
   familiar [160] , but which for many centuries she has forgotten, viz.
   that thirty-two words which she supposed to be those of the Evangelist
   are in reality those of her Lord.

   Indeed, when the expressions are considered, it is perceived that this
   account of them must needs be the true one. Thus, we learn from the
   24th verse that our Saviour was at this time addressing the crowds' or
   multitudes.' But the four classes specified in verses 29, 30, cannot
   reasonably be thought to be the Evangelist's analysis of those crowds.
   In fact what is said of the Pharisees and Lawyers' in ver. 30 is
   clearly not a remark made by the Evangelist on the reception which our
   Saviour's words were receiving at the hands of his auditory; but our
   Saviour's own statement of the reception which His Forerunner's
   preaching had met with at the hands of the common people and the
   publicans on the one hand,--the Pharisees and the Scribes on the other.
   Hence the inferential particle oun in the 31st verse; and the use in
   ver. 35 of the same verb (edikaio'the) which the Divine Speaker had
   employed in ver. 29: whereby He takes up His previous statement while
   He applies and enforces it.

   Another specimen of unauthorized accretion originating in the same way
   is found a little farther on. In St. Luke ix. 1 (And having called
   together His twelve Disciples'), the words matheta`s autou are
   confessedly spurious: being condemned by nearly every known cursive and
   uncial. Their presence in the meantime is fully accounted for by the
   adjacent rubrical direction how the lesson is to be introduced: viz. At
   that time Jesus having called together His twelve Disciples.'
   Accordingly we are not surprised to find the words ho Iesous also
   thrust into a few of the MSS.: though we are hardly prepared to
   discover that the words of the Peshitto, besides the Latin and
   Cureton's Syriac, are disfigured in the same way. The admirers of the
   old uncials' will learn with interest that, instead of matheta`s autou,
   'C with LXAX and a choice assortment of cursives exhibit
   apostolous,--being supported in this manifestly spurious reading by the
   best copies of the Old Latin, the Vulgate, Gothic, Harkleian, Bohairic,
   and a few other translations.

   Indeed, it is surprising what a fertile source of corruption Liturgical
   usage has proved. Every careful student of the Gospels remembers that
   St. Matthew describes our Lord's first and second missionary journey in
   very nearly the same words. The former place (iv. 23) ending kai` pasan
   malaki'an en to lao used to conclude the lesson for the second Sunday
   after Pentecost,--the latter (ix. 35) ending kai` pasan malaki'an
   occupies the same position in the Gospel for the seventh Sunday. It
   will not seem strange to any one who considers the matter, that en to
   lao has in consequence not only found its way into ix. 35, but has
   established itself there very firmly: and that from a very early time.
   The spurious words are first met with in the Codex Sinaiticus [161] .

   But sometimes corruptions of this class are really perplexing. Thus '
   testifies to the existence of a short additional clause (kai polloi
   hekolouthesan auto) at the end, as some critics say, of the same 35th
   verse. Are we not rather to regard the words as the beginning of ver.
   36, and as being nothing else but the liturgical introduction to the
   lection for the Twelve Apostles, which follows (ix. 36-x. 8), and whose
   Festival falls on the 30th June? Whatever its origin, this confessedly
   spurious accretion to the Text, which exists besides only in L and six
   cursive copies, must needs be of extraordinary antiquity, being found
   in the two oldest copies of the Old Latin:--a sufficient indication, by
   the way, of the utter insufficiency of such an amount of evidence for
   the genuineness of any reading.

   This is the reason why, in certain of the oldest documents accessible,
   such a strange amount of discrepancy is discoverable in the text of the
   first words of St. Luke x. 25 (kai` idou` nomiko's tis ane'ste,
   ekpeira'zon auto`n, kai` le'gon). Many of the Latin copies preface this
   with et haec eo dicente. Now, the established formula of the
   lectionaries here is,--nomiko's tis proselthen to I. which explains why
   the Curetonian, the Lewis, with 33, the queen of the cursives,' as
   their usual leader in aberrant readings is absurdly styled. so read the
   place: while D, with one copy of the Old Latin, stands alone in
   exhibiting,--ane'ste de tis nomikos. Four Codexes ('BLX) with the
   Curetonian omit the second kai` which is illegible in the Lewis. To
   read this place in its purity you have to take up any ordinary cursive
   copy.

  4.

   Take another instance. St. Mark xv. 28 has been hitherto read in all
   Churches as follows And the Scripture was fulfilled, which saith, "And
   He was numbered with the transgressors."' In these last days however
   the discovery is announced that every word of this is an unauthorized
   addition to the inspired text. Griesbach indeed only marks the verse as
   probably spurious; while Tregelles is content to enclose it in
   brackets. But Alford, Tischendorf, Westcott and Hort, and the Revisers
   eject the words kai eplerothe he graphe he legousa, kai meta anomon
   elogisthe from the text altogether. What can be the reason for so
   extraordinary a proceeding?

   Let us not be told by Schulz (Griesbach's latest editor) that the
   quotation is not in Mark's manner; that the formula which introduces it
   is John's: and that it seems to be a gloss taken from Luke xxii. 37.'
   This is not criticism but dictation,--imagination, not argument. Men
   who so write forget that they are assuming the very point which they
   are called upon to prove.

   Now it happens that all the Uncials but six and an immense majority of
   the Cursive copies contain the words before us:--that besides these,
   the Old Latin, the Syriac, the Vulgate, the Gothic and the Bohairic
   versions, all concur in exhibiting them:--that the same words are
   expressly recognized by the Sectional System of Eusebius;--having a
   section (sis/e i.e. 216/8) to themselves--which is the weightiest
   sanction that Father had it in his power to give to words of Scripture.
   So are they also recognized by the Syriac sectional system (260/8),
   which is diverse from that of Eusebius and independent of it. What then
   is to be set against such a weight of ancient evidence? The fact that
   the following six Codexes are without this 28th verse, 'ABCDX, together
   with the Sahidic and Lewis. The notorious Codex k (Bobiensis) is the
   only other ancient testimony producible; to which Tischendorf adds
   about forty-five cursive copies.' Will it be seriously pretended that
   this evidence for omitting ver. 28 from St. Mark's Gospel can compete
   with the evidence for retaining it?

   Let it not be once more insinuated that we set numbers before
   antiquity. Codex D is of the sixth century; Cod. X not older than the
   ninth: and not one of the four Codexes which remain is so old, within
   perhaps two centuries, as either the Old Latin or the Peshitto
   versions. We have Eusebius and Jerome's Vulgate as witnesses on the
   same side, besides the Gothic version, which represents a Codex
   probably as old as either. To these witnesses must be added Victor of
   Antioch, who commented on St. Mark's Gospel before either A or C were
   written [162] .

   It will be not unreasonably asked by those who have learned to regard
   whatever is found in B or ' as oracular,-- But is it credible that on a
   point like this such authorities as 'ABCD should all be in error?'

   It is not only credible, I answer, but a circumstance of which we meet
   with so many undeniable examples that it ceases to be even a matter of
   surprise. On the other hand, what is to be thought of the credibility
   that on a point like this all the ancient versions (except the Sahidic)
   should have conspired to mislead mankind? And further, on what
   intelligible principle is the consent of all the other uncials, and the
   whole mass of cursives, to be explained, if this verse of Scripture be
   indeed spurious?

   I know that the rejoinder will be as follows:--Yes, but if the ten
   words in dispute really are part of the inspired verity, how is their
   absence from the earliest Codexes to be accounted for?' Now it happens
   that for once I am able to assign the reason. But I do so under
   protest, for I insist that to point out the source of the mistakes in
   our oldest Codexes is no part of a critic's business. It would not only
   prove an endless, but also a hopeless task. This time, however, I am
   able to explain.

   If the reader will take the trouble to inquire at the Bibliotheque at
   Paris for a Greek Codex numbered 71,' an Evangelium will be put into
   his hands which differs from any that I ever met with in giving
   singularly minute and full rubrical directions. At the end of St. Mark
   xv. 27, he will read as follows:--When thou readest the sixth Gospel of
   the Passion,--also when thou readest the second Gospel of the Vigil of
   Good Friday,--stop here: skip verse 28: then go on at verse 29.' The
   inference from this is so obvious, that it would be to abuse the
   reader's patience if I were to enlarge upon it, or even to draw it out
   in detail. Very ancient indeed must the Lectionary practice in this
   particular have been that it should leave so fatal a trace of its
   operation in our four oldest Codexes: but it has left it [163] . The
   explanation is evident, the verse is plainly genuine, and the Codexes
   which leave it out are corrupt.

   One word about the evidence of the cursive copies on this occasion.
   Tischendorf says that about forty-five' of them are without this
   precious verse of Scripture. I venture to say that the learned critic
   would be puzzled to produce forty-five copies of the Gospels in which
   this verse has no place. But in fact his very next statement (viz. that
   about half of these are Lectionaries),--satisfactorily explains the
   matter. Just so. From every Lectionary in the world, for the reason
   already assigned, these words are away; as well as in every MS. which,
   like B and ', has been depraved by the influence of the Lectionary
   practice.

   And now I venture to ask,--What is to be thought of that Revision of
   our Authorized Version which omits ver. 28 altogether; with a marginal
   intimation that many ancient authorities insert it'? Would it not have
   been the course of ordinary reverence,--I was going to say of truth and
   fairness,--to leave the text unmolested: with a marginal memorandum
   that just a very few ancient authorities leave it out'?

  5.

   A gross depravation of the Text resulting from this cause, which
   nevertheless has imposed on several critics, as has been already said,
   is furnished by the first words of Acts iii. The most ancient witness
   accessible, namely the Peshitto, confirms the usual reading of the
   place, which is also the text of the cursives: viz. Epi` to` auto' de`
   Pe'tros kai` Ioa'nnes k.t.l.So the Harkleian and Bede. So Codex E.

   The four oldest of the six available uncials conspire however in
   representing the words which immediately precede in the following
   unintelligible fashion:--ho de Kurios prosetithei tous sozomenous kath'
   hemeran ?pi to auto. Petros de k.t.l. How is it to be thought that this
   strange and vapid presentment of the passage had its beginning? It
   results, I answer, from the ecclesiastical practice of beginning a
   fresh lection at the name of Peter,' prefaced by the usual formula In
   those days.' It is accordingly usual to find the liturgical word
   arche--indicative of the beginning of a lection,--thrust in between
   epi` to` auto` de and Petros. At a yet earlier period I suppose some
   more effectual severance of the text was made in that place, which
   unhappily misled some early scribe [164] . And so it came to pass that
   in the first instance the place stood thus: ho de Kurios prosetithei
   tous sozomenous kath' hemeran te ekklesia epi to auto,--which was
   plainly intolerable.

   What I am saying will commend itself to any unprejudiced reader when it
   has been stated that Cod. D in this place actually reads as
   follows:--kathemeran epi to auto en te ekklesia. En de tais hemerais
   tautais Petros k.t.l.: the scribe with simplicity both giving us the
   liturgical formula with which it was usual to introduce the Gospel for
   the Friday after Easter, and permitting us to witness the perplexity
   with which the evident surplusage of te ekklesia epi to auto occasioned
   him. He inverts those two expressions and thrusts in a preposition. How
   obvious it now was to solve the difficulty by getting rid of te
   ekklesia.

   It does not help the adverse case to shew that the Vulgate as well as
   the copy of Cyril of Alexandria are disfigured with the same corrupt
   reading as 'ABC. It does but prove how early and how widespread is this
   depravation of the Text. But the indirect proof thus afforded that the
   actual Lectionary System must needs date from a period long anterior to
   our oldest Codexes is a far more important as well as a more
   interesting inference. In the meantime I suspect that it was in Western
   Christendom that this corruption of the text had its beginning: for
   proof is not wanting that the expression epi to auto seemed hard to the
   Latins [165] .

   Hence too the omission of palin from 'BD (St. Matt. xiii. 43). A glance
   at the place in an actual Codex [166] will explain the matter to a
   novice better than a whole page of writing:--

   akoueto. telos
   palin. arche. eipen o Kurios ten parbolen tauten.
   Omoia estin k.t.l.

   The word palin, because it stands between the end (telos) of the lesson
   for the sixth Thursday and the beginning (arche) of the first Friday
   after Pentecost, got left out [though every one acquainted with Gospel
   MSS. knows that arche and telos were often inserted in the text]. The
   second of these two lessons begins with homoia [because palin, at the
   beginning of a lesson is not wanted]. Here then is a singular token of
   the antiquity of the Lectionary System in the Churches of the East: as
   well as a proof of the untrustworthy character of Codd. 'BD. The
   discovery that they are supported this time by copies of the Old Latin
   (a c e ff^1.2 g^1.2 k l), Vulgate, Curetonian, Bohairic, Ethiopic, does
   but further shew that such an amount of evidence in and by itself is
   wholly insufficient to determine the text of Scripture.

   When therefore I see Tischendorf, in the immediately preceding verse
   (xiii. 43) on the sole authority of 'B and a few Latin copies, omitting
   the word akou'ein,--and again in the present verse on very similar
   authority (viz. 'D, Old Latin, Vulgate, Peshitto, Curetonian, Lewis,
   Bohairic, together with five cursives of aberrant character)
   transposing the order of the words pa'nta o'sa e'chei polei,--I can but
   reflect on the utterly insecure basis on which the Revisers and the
   school which they follow would remodel the inspired Text.

   It is precisely in this way and for the selfsame reason, that the
   clause elupe'thesan spho'dra (St. Matt. xvii. 23) comes to be omitted
   in K and several other copies. The previous lesson ends at
   egerthe'setai,--the next lesson begins at proselthon.

  6.

   Indeed, the Ancient Liturgy of the Church has frequently exercised a
   corrupting influence on the text of Scripture. Having elsewhere
   considered St. Luke's version of the Lord's Prayer [167] , I will in
   this place discuss the genuineness of the doxology with which the
   Lord's Prayer concludes in St. Matt. vi. 13 [168] ,--o'ti sou estin e
   basilei'a kai` e du'namis kai` e do'xa eis tous aionas. ame'n.--words
   which for 360 years have been rejected by critical writers as spurious,
   notwithstanding St. Paul's unmistakable recognition of them in 2 Tim.
   iv. 18,--which alone, one would have thought, should have sufficed to
   preserve them from molestation.

   The essential note of primitive antiquity at all events these fifteen
   words enjoy in perfection, being met with in all copies of the
   Peshitto:--and this is a far weightier consideration than the fact that
   they are absent from most of the Latin copies. Even of these however
   four (k f g^l q) recognize the doxology, which is also found in
   Cureton's Syriac and the Sahidic version; the Gothic, the Ethiopic,
   Armenian, Georgian, Slavonic, Harkleian, Palestinian, Erpenius' Arabic,
   and the Persian of Tawos; as well as in the Didache (with variations);
   Apostolical Constitutions (iii. 18-vii. 25 with variations); in St.
   Ambrose (De Sacr. vi. 5. 24), Caesarius (Dial. i. 29). Chrysostom
   comments on the words without suspicion, and often quotes them (In
   Orat. Dom., also see Horn. in Matt. xiv. 13): as does Isidore of
   Pelusium (Ep. iv. 24). See also Opus Imperfectum (Hom. in Matt. xiv),
   Theophylact on this place, and Euthymius Zigabenus (in Matt. vi. 13 and
   C. Massal. Anath. 7). And yet their true claim to be accepted as
   inspired is of course based on the consideration that they are found in
   ninety-nine out of a hundred of the Greek copies, including Ph and S of
   the end of the fifth and beginning of the sixth centuries. What then is
   the nature of the adverse evidence with which they have to contend and
   which is supposed to be fatal to their claims?

   Four uncial MSS. ('BDZ), supported by five cursives of bad character
   (I, 17 which gives amen, 118, 130, 209), and, as we have seen, all the
   Latin copies but four, omit these words; which, it is accordingly
   assumed, must have found their way surreptitiously into the text of all
   the other copies in existence. But let me ask,--Is it at all likely, or
   rather is it any way credible, that in a matter like this, all the MSS.
   in the world but nine should have become corrupted? No hypothesis is
   needed to account for one more instance of omission in copies which
   exhibit a mutilated text in every page. But how will men pretend to
   explain an interpolation universal as the present; which may be traced
   as far back as the second century; which has established itself without
   appreciable variety of reading in all the MSS.; which has therefore
   found its way from the earliest time into every part of Christendom; is
   met with in all the Lectionaries, and in all the Greek Liturgies; and
   has so effectually won the Church's confidence that to this hour it
   forms part of the public and private devotions of the faithful all over
   the world?

   One and the same reply has been rendered to this inquiry ever since the
   days of Erasmus. A note in the Complutensian Polyglott (1514) expresses
   it with sufficient accuracy. In the Greek copies, after And deliver us
   from evil, follows For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the
   glory, for ever. But it is to be noted that in the Greek liturgy, after
   the choir has said And deliver us from evil, it is the Priest who
   responds as above: and those words, according to the Greeks, the priest
   alone may pronounce. This makes it probable that the words in question
   are no integral part of the Lord's Prayer: but that certain copyists
   inserted them in error, supposing, from their use in the liturgy, that
   they formed part of the text.' In other words, they represent that
   men's ears had grown so fatally familiar with this formula from its
   habitual use in the liturgy, that at last they assumed it to be part
   and parcel of the Lord's Prayer. The same statement has been repeated
   ad nauseam by ten generations of critics for 360 years. The words with
   which our Saviour closed His pattern prayer are accordingly rejected as
   an interpolation resulting from the liturgical practice of the
   primitive Church. And this slipshod account of the matter is
   universally acquiesced in by learned and unlearned readers alike at the
   present day.

   From an examination of above fifty ancient oriental liturgies, it is
   found then that though the utmost variety prevails among them, yet that
   not one of them exhibits the evangelical formula as it stands in St.
   Matt. vi. 13; while in some instances the divergences of expression are
   even extraordinary. Subjoined is what may perhaps be regarded as the
   typical eucharistic formula, derived from the liturgy which passes as
   Chrysostom's. Precisely the same form recurs in the office which is
   called after the name of Basil: and it is essentially reproduced by
   Gregory of Nyssa, Cyril of Jerusalem, and pseudo-Caesarius; while
   something very like it is found to have been in use in more of the
   Churches of the East.

   For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, Father, Son and
   Holy Ghost, now and always and for ever and ever. Amen.'

   But as every one sees at a glance, such a formula as the
   foregoing,--with its ever-varying terminology of praise,--its constant
   reference to the blessed Trinity,--its habitual nun kai aei,--and its
   invariable eis tous aionas ton aionon, (which must needs be of very
   high antiquity, for it is mentioned by Irenaeus, [169] and may be as
   old as 2 Tim. iv. 18 itself;)--the doxology, I say, which formed part
   of the Church's liturgy, though transcribed 10,000 times, could never
   by possibility have resulted in the unvarying doxology found in MSS. of
   St. Matt. vi. 13,--For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the
   glory, for ever. Amen.'

   On the other hand, the inference from a careful survey of so many
   Oriental liturgies is inevitable. The universal prevalence of a
   doxology of some sort at the end of the Lord's Prayer; the general
   prefix for thine'; the prevailing mention therein of the kingdom and
   the power and the glory'; the invariable reference to Eternity:--all
   this constitutes a weighty corroboration of the genuineness of the form
   in St. Matthew. Eked out with a confession of faith in the Trinity, and
   otherwise amplified as piety or zeal for doctrinal purity suggested,
   every liturgical formula of the kind is clearly derivable from the form
   of words in St. Matt. vi. 13. In no conceivable way, on the other hand,
   could that briefer formula have resulted from the practice of the
   ancient Church. The thing, I repeat, is simply impossible.

   What need to point out in conclusion that the Church's peculiar method
   of reciting the Lord's Prayer in the public liturgy does
   notwithstanding supply the obvious and sufficient explanation of all
   the adverse phenomena of the case? It was the invariable practice from
   the earliest time for the Choir to break off at the words But deliver
   us from evil.' They never pronounced the doxology. The doxology must
   for that reason have been omitted by the critical owner of the
   archetypal copy of St. Matthew from which nine extant Evangelia,
   Origen, and the Old Latin version originally derived their text. This
   is the sum of the matter. There can be no simpler solution of the
   alleged difficulty. That Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambrose recognize no more
   of the Lord's Prayer than they found in their Latin copies, cannot
   create surprise. The wonder would have been if they did.

   Much stress has been laid on the silence of certain of the Greek
   Fathers concerning the doxology although they wrote expressly on the
   Lord's Prayer; as Origen, Gregory of Nyssa [170] , Cyril of Jerusalem,
   Maximus. Those who have attended most to such subjects will however
   bear me most ready witness, that it is never safe to draw inferences of
   the kind proposed from the silence of the ancients. What if they
   regarded a doxology, wherever found, as hardly a fitting subject for
   exegetical comment? But however their silence is to be explained, it is
   at least quite certain that the reason of it is not because their
   copies of St. Matthew were unfurnished with the doxology. Does any one
   seriously imagine that in A. D. 650, when Maximus wrote, Evangelia
   were, in this respect, in a different state from what they are at
   present?

   The sum of what has been offered may be thus briefly stated:--The
   textual perturbation observable at St. Matt. vi. 13 is indeed due to a
   liturgical cause, as the critics suppose. But then it is found that not
   the great bulk of the Evangelia, but only Codd. 'BDZ 1, 17, 118, 130,
   209, have been victims of the corrupting influence. As usual, I say, it
   is the few, not the many copies, which have been led astray. Let the
   doxology at the end of the Lord's Prayer be therefore allowed to retain
   its place in the text without further molestation. Let no profane hands
   be any more laid on these fifteen precious words of the Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   There yet remains something to be said on the same subject for the
   edification of studious readers; to whom the succeeding words are
   specially commended. They are requested to keep their attention
   sustained, until they have read what immediately follows.

   The history of the rejection of these words is in a high degree
   instructive. It dates from 1514, when the Complutensian editors, whilst
   admitting that the words were found in their Greek copies, banished
   them from the text solely in deference to the Latin version. In a
   marginal annotation they started the hypothesis that the doxology is a
   liturgical interpolation. But how is that possible, seeing that the
   doxology is commented on by Chrysostom? We presume,' they say, that
   this corruption of the original text must date from an antecedent
   period.' The same adverse sentence, supported by the same hypothesis,
   was reaffirmed by Erasmus, and on the same grounds; but in his edition
   of the N.T. he suffered the doxology to stand. As the years have rolled
   out, and Codexes DBZ' have successively come to light, critics have
   waxed bolder and bolder in giving their verdict. First, Grotius,
   Hammond, Walton; then Mill and Grabe; next Bengel, Wetstein, Griesbach;
   lastly Scholz, Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles, Alford, Westcott and
   Hort, and the Revisers have denounced the precious words as spurious.

   But how does it appear that tract of time has strengthened the case
   against the doxology? Since 1514, scholars have become acquainted with
   the Peshitto version; which by its emphatic verdict, effectually
   disposes of the evidence borne by all but three of the Old Latin
   copies. The Litbaxi of the first or second century, the Sahidic version
   of the third century, the Apostolic Constitutions (2), follow on the
   same side. Next, in the fourth century come Chrysostom, Ambrose,
   ps.-Caesarius, the Gothic version. After that Isidore, the Ethiopic,
   Cureton's Syriac. The Harkleian, Armenian, Georgian, and other
   versions, with Chrysostom (2), the Opus Imperfectum, Theophylact, and
   Euthymius (2), bring up the rear [171] . Does any one really suppose
   that two Codexes of the fourth century (B'), which are even notorious
   for their many omissions and general accuracy, are any adequate set-off
   against such an amount of ancient evidence? L and 33, generally the
   firm allies of BD and the Vulgate, forsake them at St. Matt. vi. 13:
   and dispose effectually of the adverse testimony of D and Z, which are
   also balanced by Ph and S. But at this juncture the case for rejecting
   the doxology breaks down: and when it is discovered that every other
   uncial and every other cursive in existence may be appealed to in its
   support, and that the story of its liturgical origin proves to be a
   myth,-- what must be the verdict of an impartial mind on a survey of
   the entire evidence?

   The whole matter may be conveniently restated thus:--Liturgical use has
   indeed been the cause of a depravation of the text at St. Matt. vi. 13;
   but it proves on inquiry to be the very few MSS.,--not the very
   many,--which have been depraved.

   Nor is any one at liberty to appeal to a yet earlier period than is
   attainable by existing liturgical evidence; and to suggest that then
   the doxology used by the priest may have been the same with that which
   is found in the ordinary text of St. Matthew's Gospel. This may have
   been the case or it may not. Meanwhile, the hypothesis, which fell to
   the ground when the statement on which it rested was disproved, is not
   now to be built up again on a mere conjecture. But if the fact could be
   ascertained,--and I am not at all concerned to deny that such a thing
   is possible,--I should regard it only as confirmatory of the
   genuineness of the doxology. For why should the liturgical employment
   of the last fifteen words of the Lord's Prayer be thought to cast
   discredit on their genuineness? In the meantime, the undoubted fact,
   that for an indefinitely remote period the Lord's Prayer was not
   publicly recited by the people further than But deliver us from
   evil,'-- a doxology of some sort being invariably added, but pronounced
   by the priest alone,--this clearly ascertained fact is fully sufficient
   to account for a phenomenon so ordinary [found indeed so commonly
   throughout St. Matthew, to say nothing of occurrences in the other
   Gospels] as really not to require particular explanation, viz. the
   omission of the last half of St. Matthew vi. 13 from Codexes 'BDZ.

CHAPTER VII.

  CAUSES OF CORRUPTION CHIEFLY INTENTIONAL.

  I. HARMONISTIC INFLUENCE.

   [IT must not be imagined that all the causes of the depravation of the
   text of Holy Scripture were instinctive, and that mistakes arose solely
   because scribes were overcome by personal infirmity, or were
   unconsciously the victims of surrounding circumstances. There was often
   more design and method in their error. They, or those who directed
   them, wished sometimes to correct and improve the copy or copies before
   them. And indeed occasionally they desired to make the Holy Scriptures
   witness to their own peculiar belief. Or they had their ideas of taste,
   and did not scruple to alter passages to suit what they fancied was
   their enlightened judgement.

   Thus we can trace a tendency to bring the Four Records into one
   harmonious narrative, or at least to excise or vary statements in one
   Gospel which appeared to conflict with parallel statements in another.
   Or else, some Evangelical Diatessaron, or Harmony, or combined
   narrative now forgotten, exercised an influence over them, and whether
   consciously or not,--since it is difficult always to keep designed and
   unintentional mistakes apart, and we must not be supposed to aim at
   scientific exactness in the arrangement adopted in this
   analysis,--induced them to adopt alterations of the pure Text.

   We now advance to some instances which will severally and conjointly
   explain themselves.]

  § 1.

   Nothing can be more exquisitely precise than St. John's way of
   describing an incident to which St. Mark (xvi. 9) only refers; viz. our
   Lord's appearance to Mary Magdalene,--the first of His appearances
   after His Resurrection. The reason is discoverable for every word the
   Evangelist uses:--its form and collocation. Both St. Luke (xxiv. 3) and
   previously St. Mark (xvi. 5) expressly stated that the women who
   visited the Sepulchre on the first Easter morning, after they had
   entered in' (eiselthousai), saw the Angels. St John explains that at
   that time Mary was not with them. She had separated herself from their
   company;--had gone in quest of Simon Peter and the other disciple.'
   When the women, their visit ended, had in turn departed from the
   Sepulchre, she was left in the garden alone. Mary was standing [with
   her face] towards the sepulchre weeping,--outside [172] .'

   All this, singular to relate, was completely misunderstood by the
   critics of the two first centuries. Not only did they identify the
   incident recorded in St. John xx. 12 with St. Mark xv. 5 and St. Luke
   xxiv. 3, 4, from which, as we have seen, the first-named Evangelist is
   careful to distinguish it;--not only did they further identify both
   places with St. Matt. xxviii. 2, 3 [173] , from which they are clearly
   separate;--but they considered themselves at liberty to tamper with the
   inspired text in order to bring it into harmony with their own
   convictions. Some of them accordingly altered pro`s to` mnemeion into
   pro`s to mnemei'o (which is just as ambiguous in Greek as at the
   sepulchre' in English [174] ), and e'xo they boldly erased. It is thus
   that Codex A exhibits the text. But in fact this depravation must have
   begun at a very remote period and prevailed to an extraordinary extent:
   for it disfigures the best copies of the Old Latin, (the Syriac being
   doubtful): a memorable circumstance truly, and in a high degree
   suggestive. Codex B, to be sure, reads heistekei pros to mnemeio exo
   klaiousa,--merely transposing (with many other authorities) the last
   two words. But then Codex B substitutes elthousai for for eiselthousai
   in St. Mark xvi. 5, in order that the second Evangelist may not seem to
   contradict St. Matt. xxviii. 2, 3. So that, according to this view of
   the matter, the Angelic appearance was outside the sepulchre [175] .
   Codex ', on the contrary, is thorough. Not content with omitting
   e'xo,--(as in the next verse it leaves out du'o, in order to prevent
   St. John xx. 12 from seeming to contradict St. Matt. xxviii. 2, 3, and
   St. Mark xvi. 5),--it stands alone in reading EN to mnemeio. (C and D
   are lost here.) When will men learn that these old uncials' are ignes
   fatui,-- not beacon lights; and admit that the texts which they exhibit
   are not only inconsistent but corrupt?

   There is no reason for distrusting the received reading of the present
   place in any particular. True, that most of the uncials and many of the
   cursives read pros to mnemeio: but so did neither Chrysostom [176] nor
   Cyril [177] read the place. And if the Evangelist himself had so
   written, is it credible that a majority of the copies would have
   forsaken the easier and more obvious, in order to exhibit the less
   usual and even slightly difficult expression? Many, by writing pros to
   mnemeio, betray themselves; for they retain a sure token that the
   accusative ought to end the sentence. I am not concerned however just
   now to discuss these matters of detail. I am only bent on illustrating
   how fatal to the purity of the Text of the Gospels has been the desire
   of critics, who did not understand those divine compositions, to bring
   them into enforced agreement with one another. The sectional system of
   Eusebius, I suspect, is not so much the cause as the consequence of the
   ancient and inveterate misapprehensions which prevailed in respect of
   the history of the Resurrection. It is time however to proceed.

  § 2.

   Those writers who overlook the corruptions which the text has actually
   experienced through a mistaken solicitude on the part of ancient
   critics to reconcile what seemed to them the conflicting statements of
   different Evangelists, are frequently observed to attribute to this
   kind of officiousness expressions which are unquestionably portions of
   the genuine text. Thus, there is a general consensus amongst critics of
   the destructive school to omit the words kai tines sun autais from St.
   Luke xxiv. 1. Their only plea is the testimony of 'BCL and certain of
   the Latin copies,--a conjunction of authorities which, when they stand
   alone, we have already observed to bear invariably false witness.
   Indeed, before we proceed to examine the evidence, we discover that
   those four words of St. Luke are even required in this place. For St.
   Matthew (xxvii. 61), and St. Mark after him (xv. 47), had distinctly
   specified two women as witnesses of how and where our Lord's body was
   laid. Now they were the same women apparently who prepared the spices
   and ointment and hastened therewith at break of day to the sepulchre.
   Had we therefore only St. Matthew's. Gospel we should have assumed that
   the ointment-bearers,' for so the ancients called them, were but two
   (St. Matt. xxviii. 1). That they were at least three, even St. Mark
   shews by adding to their number Salome (xvi. 1). But in fact their
   company consisted of more than four; as St. Luke explains when he
   states that it was the same little band of holy women who had
   accompanied our Saviour out of Galilee (xxiii. 55, cf. viii. 2). In
   anticipation therefore of what he will have to relate in ver. 10, he
   says in ver. 1, and certain with them.'

   But how, I shall be asked, would you explain the omission of these
   words which to yourself seem necessary? And after insisting that one is
   never bound to explain how the text of any particular passage came to
   be corrupted, I answer, that these words were originally ejected from
   the text in order to bring St. Luke's statement into harmony with that
   of the first Evangelist, who mentions none but Mary Magdalene and Mary
   the mother of James and Joses. The proof is that four of the same Latin
   copies which are for the omission of kai tines sun autais are observed
   to begin St. Luke xxiii. 55 as follows,--katakolouthe'sasai de` DUO
   gunaikes. The same fabricated reading is found in D. It exists also in
   the Codex which Eusebius employed when he wrote his Demonstratio
   Evangelica. Instead therefore of wearying the reader with the evidence,
   which is simply overwhelming, for letting the text alone, I shall
   content myself with inviting him to notice that the tables have been
   unexpectedly turned on our opponents. There is indeed found to have
   been a corruption of the text hereabouts, and of the words just now
   under discussion; but it belongs to an exceedingly remote age; and
   happily the record of it survives at this day only in 'BCDL and certain
   of the Old Latin copies. Calamitous however it is, that what the Church
   has long since deliberately refused to part with should, at the end of
   so many centuries, by Lachmann and Tregelles and Tischendorf, by Alford
   and Westcott and Hort, be resolutely thrust out of place; and indeed
   excluded from the Sacred Text by a majority of the Revisers.

   [A very interesting instance of such Harmonistic Influence may be found
   in the substitution of wine' (oinon) for vinegar (oxos), respecting
   which the details are given in the second Appendix to the Traditional
   Text.]

   [Observe yet another instance of harmonizing propensities in the
   Ancient Church.]

   In St. Luke's Gospel iv. 1-13, no less than six copies of the Old Latin
   versions (b c f g^1 l q) besides Ambrose (Com. St. Luke, 1340), are
   observed to transpose the second and third temptations; introducing
   verses 9-12 between verses 4 and 5; in order to make the history of the
   Temptation as given by St. Luke correspond with the account given by
   St. Matthew.

   The scribe of the Vercelli Codex (a) was about to do the same thing;
   but he checked himself when he had got as far as the pinnacle of the
   temple,'--which he seems to have thought as good a scene for the third
   temptation as a high mountain,' and so left it.

  § 3.

   A favourite, and certainly a plausible, method of accounting for the
   presence of unauthorized matter in MSS. is to suggest that, in the
   first instance, it probably existed only in the shape of a marginal
   gloss, which through the inadvertence of the scribes, in process of
   time, found its way into the sacred text. That in this way some
   depravations of Scripture may possibly have arisen, would hardly I
   presume be doubted. But I suspect that the hypothesis is generally a
   wholly mistaken one; having been imported into this subject-matter
   (like many other notions which are quite out of place here), from the
   region of the Classics,--where (as we know) the phenomenon is even
   common. Especially is this hypothesis resorted to (I believe) in order
   to explain those instances of assimilation which are so frequently to
   be met with in Codd. B and '.

   Another favourite way of accounting for instances of assimilation, is
   by taking for granted that the scribe was thinking of the parallel or
   the cognate place. And certainly (as before) there is no denying that
   just as the familiar language of a parallel place in another Gospel
   presents itself unbidden to the memory of a reader, so may it have
   struck a copyist also with sufficient vividness to persuade him to
   write, not the words which he saw before him, but the words which he
   remembered. All this is certainly possible.

   But I strongly incline to the suspicion that this is not by any means
   .the right way to explain the phenomena under discussion. I am of
   opinion that such depravations of the text were in the first instance
   intentional. I do not mean that they were introduced with any sinister
   motive. My meaning is that [there was a desire to remove obscurities,
   or to reconcile incongruous passages, or generally to improve the style
   of the authors, and thus to add to the merits of the sacred writings,
   instead of detracting from them. Such a mode of dealing with the holy
   deposit evinced no doubt a failure in the part of those who adopted it
   to understand the nature of the trust committed to the Church, just as
   similar action at the present day does in the case of such as load the
   New Testament with various readings,' and illustrate it as they imagine
   with what are really insinuations of doubt, in the way that they
   prepare an edition of the classics for the purpose of enlarging and
   sharpening the minds of youthful students. There was intention, and the
   intention was good: but it was none the less productive of corruption.]

   I suspect that if we ever obtain access to a specimen of those
   connected Gospel narratives called Diatessarons, which are known to
   have existed anciently in the Church, we shall be furnished with a clue
   to a problem which at present is shrouded in obscurity,--and concerning
   the solution of which, with such instruments of criticism as we at
   present possess, we can do little else but conjecture. I allude to
   those many occasions on which the oldest documents extant, in narrating
   some incident which really presents no special difficulty, are observed
   to diverge into hopeless variety of expression. An example of the thing
   referred to will best explain my meaning. Take then the incident of our
   Lord's paying tribute,--set down in St. Matt. xvii. 25, 26.

   The received text exhibits,--And when he [Peter] had entered ( o'te
   eiselthen) into the house, Jesus was beforehand with him, saying, What
   thinkest thou, Simon? Of whom do earthly kings take toll or tribute? of
   their sons or of strangers?' Here, for o'te eiselthen, Codex B (but no
   other uncial) substitutes elthonta: Codex ' (but no other) eiselthonta
   Codex D (but no other) eiselthonti: Codex C (but no other) ote elthon:
   while a fifth lost copy certainly contained eiselthonton; and a sixth,
   elthonton auton. A very fair specimen this, be it remarked in passing,
   of the concordia discors which prevails in the most ancient uncial
   copies [178] . How is all this discrepancy to be accounted for?

   The Evangelist proceeds,--Peter saith unto Him (Le'gei auto o Pe'tros),
   Of strangers.' These four words C retains, but continues--Now when he
   had said, Of strangers' (Eipontos de autou, apo ton allotrion);--which
   unauthorized clause, all but the word autou, is found also in ', but in
   no other uncial. On the other hand, for Le'gei auto o Pe'tros, ' (alone
   of uncials) substitutes Ho de ephe: and B (also alone of uncials)
   substitutes Eipontos de,--and then proceeds exactly like the received
   text: while D merely omits o Pe'tros. Again I ask,--How is all this
   discrepancy to be explained [179] ?

   As already hinted, I suspect that it was occasioned in the first
   instance by the prevalence of harmonized Gospel narratives. In no more
   loyal way can I account for the perplexing phenomenon already
   described, which is of perpetual recurrence in such documents as
   Codexes B'D, Cureton's Syriac, and copies of the Old Latin version. It
   is well known that at a very remote period some eminent persons
   occupied themselves in constructing such exhibitions of the Evangelical
   history: and further, that these productions enjoyed great favour, and
   were in general use. As for their contents,--the notion we form to
   ourselves of a Diatessaron, is that it aspired to be a weaving of the
   fourfold Gospel into one continuous narrative: and we suspect that in
   accomplishing this object, the writer was by no means scrupulous about
   retaining the precise words of the inspired original. He held himself
   at liberty, on the contrary, (a) to omit what seemed to himself
   superfluous clauses: (b) to introduce new incidents: (c) to supply
   picturesque details: (d) to give a new turn to the expression: (e) to
   vary the construction at pleasure: (f) even slightly to paraphrase.
   Compiled after some such fashion as I have been describing, at a time
   too when the preciousness of the inspired documents seems to have been
   but imperfectly apprehended,--the works I speak of, recommended by
   their graphic interest, and sanctioned by a mighty name, must have
   imposed upon ordinary readers. Incautious owners of Codexes must have
   transferred without scruple certain unauthorized readings to the
   margins of their own copies. A calamitous partiality for the fabricated
   document may have prevailed with some for whom copies were executed.
   Above all, it is to be inferred that licentious and rash Editors of
   Scripture,--among whom Origen may be regarded as a prime
   offender,--must have deliberately introduced into their recensions many
   an unauthorized gloss, and so given it an extended circulation.

   Not that we would imply that permanent mischief has resulted to the
   Deposit from the vagaries of individuals in the earliest age. The
   Divine Author of Scripture hath abundantly provided for the safety of
   His Word written. In the multitude of copies,--in Lectionaries,--in
   Versions,--in citations by the Fathers, a sufficient safeguard against
   error hath been erected. But then, of these multitudinous sources of
   protection we must not be slow to avail ourselves impartially. The
   prejudice which would erect Codexes B and ' into an authority for the
   text of the New Testament from which there shall be no appeal:--the
   superstitious reverence which has grown up for one little cluster of
   authorities, to the disparagement of all other evidence wheresoever
   found; this, which is for ever landing critics in results which are
   simply irrational and untenable, must be unconditionally abandoned, if
   any real progress is to be made in this department of inquiry. But when
   this has been done, men will begin to open their eyes to the fact that
   the little handful of documents recently so much in favour, are, on the
   contrary, the only surviving witnesses to corruptions of the Text which
   the Church in her corporate capacity has long since deliberately
   rejected. But to proceed.

   [From the Diatessaron of Tatian and similar attempts to harmonize the
   Gospels, corruption of a serious nature has ensued in some well-known
   places, such as the transference of the piercing of the Lord's side
   from St. John xix. 34 to St. Matt. xxvii. 49 [180] , and the omission
   of the words and of an honeycomb' (kai apo tou melissiou keriou [181]
   ).]

   Hence also, in Cureton's Syriac [182] , the patch-work supplement to
   St. Matt. xxi. 9: viz.:--polloi de (St. Mark xi. 8) exelthon eis
   upa'ntesin autu. kai` (St. John xii. 13) e'rxanto . . . chai'rontes
   ainein to`n Theo`n . . . peri` pason hon eidon (St. Luke xix. 37). This
   self-evident fabrication, if it be not a part of the original Aramaic
   of St. Matthew,' remarks Dr. Cureton, would appear to have been
   supplied from the parallel passages of Luke and John conjointly.' How
   is it that even a sense of humour did not preserve that eminent scholar
   from hazarding the conjecture, that such a self-evident deflection of
   his corrupt Syriac Codex from the course all but universally pursued is
   a recovery of one more genuine utterance of the Holy Ghost?

CHAPTER VIII.

  CAUSES OF CORRUPTION CHIEFLY INTENTIONAL.

  II. ASSIMILATION.

  § 1.

   THERE results inevitably from the fourfold structure of the
   Gospel,.--from the very fact that the story of Redemption is set forth
   in four narratives, three of which often ran parallel,--this practical
   inconvenience: namely, that sometimes the expressions of one Evangelist
   get improperly transferred to another. This is a large and important
   subject which calls for great attention, and requires to be separately
   handled. The phenomena alluded to, which are similar to some of those
   which have been treated in the last chapter, may be comprised under the
   special head of Assimilation.

   It will I think promote clearness in the ensuing discussion if we
   determine to consider separately those instances of Assimilation which
   may rather be regarded as deliberate attempts to reconcile one Gospel
   with another: indications of a fixed determination to establish harmony
   between place and place. I am saying that between ordinary cases of
   Assimilation such as occur in every page, and extraordinary instances
   where per fas et nefas an enforced Harmony has been established,--which
   abound indeed, but are by no means common,--I am disposed to draw a
   line.

   This whole province is beset with difficulties: and the matter is in
   itself wondrously obscure. I do not suppose, in the absence of any
   evidence direct or indirect on the subject,--at all events I am not
   aware--that at any time has there been one definite authoritative
   attempt made by the Universal Church in her corporate capacity to
   remodel or revise the Text of the Gospels. An attentive study of the
   phenomena leads me, on the contrary, to believe that the several
   corruptions of the text were effected at different times, and took
   their beginning in widely different ways. I suspect that Accident was
   the parent of many; and well meant critical assiduity of more. Zeal for
   the Truth is accountable for not a few depravations: and the Church's
   Liturgical and Lectionary practice must insensibly have produced
   others. Systematic villainy I am persuaded has had no part or lot in
   the matter. The decrees of such an one as Origen, if there ever was
   another like him, will account for a strange number of aberrations from
   the Truth: and if the Diatessaron of Tatian could be recovered [183] ,
   I suspect that we should behold there the germs at least of as many
   more. But, I repeat my conviction that, however they may have
   originated, the causes [are not to be found in bad principle, but
   either in infirmities or influences which actuated scribes
   unconsciously, or in a want of understanding as to what is the Church's
   duty in the transmission from generation to generation of the sacred
   deposit committed to her enlightened care.]

  § 2.

   1. When we speak of Assimilation, we do not mean that a writer while
   engaged in transcribing one Gospel was so completely beguiled and
   overmastered by his recollections of the parallel place in another
   Gospel,--that, forsaking the expressions proper to the passage before
   him, he unconsciously adopted the language which properly belongs to a
   different Evangelist. That to a very limited extent this may have
   occasionally taken place, I am not concerned to deny: but it would
   argue incredible inattention to what he was professing to copy, on the
   one hand,--astonishing familiarity with what he was not professing to
   copy, on the other,--that a scribe should have been capable of
   offending largely in this way. But in fact a moderate acquaintance with
   the subject is enough to convince any thoughtful person that the
   corruptions in MSS. which have resulted from accidental Assimilation
   must needs be inconsiderable in bulk, as well as few in number. At all
   events, the phenomenon referred to, when we speak of Assimilation,' is
   not to be so accounted for: it must needs be explained in some entirely
   different way. Let me make my meaning plain:

   (a) We shall probably be agreed that when the scribe of Cod. ', in
   place of basani'sai emas (in St. Matt. viii. 29), writes hemas
   apolesai,--it may have been his memory which misled him. He may have
   been merely thinking of St. Mark i. 24, or of St. Luke iv. 34.

   (b) Again, when in Codd. 'B we find tassomenos thrust without warrant
   into St. Matt. viii. 9, we see that the word has lost its way from St.
   Luke vii. 8; and we are prone to suspect that only by accident has it
   crept into the parallel narrative of the earlier Evangelist.

   (c) In the same way I make no doubt that potamo (St. Matt. iii. 6) is
   indebted for its place in 'BC, &c., to the influence of the parallel
   place in St. Mark's Gospel (i. 5); and I am only astonished that
   critics should have been beguiled into adopting so clear a corruption
   of the text as part of the genuine Gospel.

   (d) To be brief:--the insertion by ' of adelphe (in St. Matt. vii. 4)
   is confessedly the result of the parallel passage in St. Luke vi. 42.
   The same scribe may be thought to have written to anemo instead of tois
   anemois in St. Matt. viii. 26, only because he was so familiar with to
   anemo in St. Luke viii. 24 and in St. Mark iv. 39.--The author of the
   prototype of 'BD (with whom by the way are some of the Latin versions)
   may have written echete in St. Matt. xvi. 8, only because he was
   thinking of the parallel place in St. Mark viii. 17.--Erxanto
   aganaktein (St. Matt. xx. 24) can only have been introduced into ' from
   the parallel place in St. Mark x. 41, and may have been supplied
   memoriter.-- St. Luke xix. 21 is clearly not parallel to St. Matt. xxv.
   24; yet it evidently furnished the scribe of ' with the epithet
   austeros; in place of skleros.--The substitution by ' of o`n paretounto
   in St. Matt. xxvii. 15 for o`n e'thelon may seem to be the result of
   inconvenient familiarity with the parallel place in St. Mark xv. 6;
   where, as has been shewn [184] , instead of onper etounto, 'AB
   viciously exhibit o`n paretounto, which Tischendorf besides Westcott
   and Hort mistake for the genuine Gospel. Who will hesitate to admit
   that, when 'L exhibit in St. Matt. xix. 16,--instead of the words
   poie'so i'na echo zoe`n aio'nion,--the formula which is found in the
   parallel place of St. Luke xviii. 18, viz. poie'sas zoe`n aio'nion
   kleronome'so,--those unauthorized words must have been derived from
   this latter place? Every ordinary reader will be further prone to
   assume that the scribe who first inserted them into St. Matthew's
   Gospel did so because, for whatever reason, he was more familiar with
   the latter formula than with the former.

   (e) But I should have been willing to go further. I might have been
   disposed to admit that when 'DL introduce into St. Matt. x. 12 the
   clause legontes, eire'ne to oi'ko tou'to (which last four words
   confessedly belong exclusively to St. Luke x. 5), the author of the
   depraved original from which 'DL were derived may have been only
   yielding to the suggestions of an inconveniently good memory:--may have
   succeeded in convincing himself from what follows in verse 13 that St.
   Matthew must have written, Peace be to this house;' though he found no
   such words in St. Matthew's text. And so, with the best intentions, he
   may most probably have inserted them.

   (f) Again. When ' and Evan. 61 thrust into St. Matt. ix. 24 (from the
   parallel place in St. Luke viii. 53) the clause eido'tes o'ti
   ape'thanen, it is of course conceivable that the authors of those
   copies were merely the victims of excessive familiarity with the third
   Gospel. But then,--although we are ready to make every allowance that
   we possibly can for memories so singularly constituted, and to imagine
   a set of inattentive scribes open to inducements to recollect or
   imagine instead of copying, and possessed of an inconvenient
   familiarity with one particular Gospel,--it is clear that our
   complaisance must stop somewhere. Instances of this kind of licence at
   last breed suspicion. Systematic assimilation' cannot be the effect of
   accident. Considerable interpolations must of course be intentional.
   The discovery that Cod. D, for example, introduces at the end of St.
   Luke v. 14 thirty-two words from St. Mark's Gospel (i. 45-ii. 1, o de`
   exeltho'n down to Kapharnaou'm), opens our eyes. This wholesale
   importation suggests the inquiry,--How did it come about? We look
   further, and we find that Cod. D abounds in instances of Assimilation'
   so unmistakably intentional, that this speedily becomes the only
   question, How may all these depravations of the sacred text be most
   satisfactorily accounted for? [And the answer is evidently found in the
   existence of extreme licentiousness in the scribe or scribes
   responsible for Codex D, being the product of ignorance and
   carelessness combined with such looseness of principle, as permitted
   the exercise of direct attempts to improve the sacred Text by the
   introduction of passages from the three remaining Gospels and by other
   alterations.]

  § 3.

   Sometimes indeed the true Text bears witness to itself, as may be seen
   in the next example.

   The little handful of well-known authorities ('BDL, with a few copies
   of the Old Latin, and one of the Egyptian Versions [185] ), conspire in
   omitting from St. John xvi. 16 the clause o'ti ego` upa'go pro`s to`n
   Pate'ra: for which reason Tischendorf, Tregelles, Alford, Westcott and
   Hort omit those six words, and Lachmann puts them into brackets. And
   yet, let the context be considered. Our Saviour had said (ver. 16),--A
   little while, and ye shall not see Me: and again, a little while, and
   ye shall see Me, because I go to the Father; It follows (ver.
   17),--Then said some of His disciples among themselves, What is this
   that He saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see Me: and
   again, a little while, and ye shall see Me: and, Because I go to the
   Father?'--Now, the context here,--the general sequence of words and
   ideas--in and by itself, creates a high degree of probability that the
   clause is genuine. It must at all events be permitted to retain its
   place in the Gospel, unless there is found to exist an overwhelming
   amount of authority for its exclusion. What then are the facts? All the
   other uncials, headed by A and I^b (both of the fourth century),--
   every known Cursive--all the Versions, (Latin, Syriac, Gothic, Coptic,
   &c.)--are for retaining the clause. Add, that Nonnus [186] (A.D. 400)
   recognizes it: that the texts of Chrysostom [187] and of Cyril [188] do
   the same; and that both those Fathers (to say nothing of Euthymius and
   Theophylact) in their Commentaries expressly bear witness to its
   genuineness:--and, With what shew of reason can it any longer be
   pretended that some Critics, including the Revisers, are warranted in
   leaving out the words? . . . It were to trifle with the reader to
   pursue this subject further. But how did the words ever come to be
   omitted? Some early critic, I answer, who was unable to see the
   exquisite proprieties of the entire passage, thought it desirable to
   bring ver. 16 into conformity with ver. 19, where our Lord seems at
   first sight to resyllable the matter. That is all !

   Let it be observed--and then I will dismiss the matter--that the
   selfsame thing has happened in the next verse but one (ver. 18), as
   Tischendorf candidly acknowledges. The touto ti' estin of the
   Evangelist has been tastelessly assimilated by BDLY to the ti' estin
   touto, which went immediately before.

  § 4.

   Were I invited to point to a beautifully described incident in the
   Gospel, I should find it difficult to lay my finger on anything more
   apt for my purpose than the transaction described in St. John xiii.
   21-25. It belongs to the closing scene of our Saviour's Ministry.
   Verily, verily, I say unto you,' (the words were spoken at the Last
   Supper), one of you will betray Me. The disciples therefore looked one
   at another, wondering of whom He spake. Now there was reclining in the
   bosom of Jesus (en de anakeimenos en to kolpo tou I..) one of His
   disciples whom Jesus loved. To him therefore Simon Peter motioneth to
   inquire who it may be concerning whom He speaketh. He then, just
   sinking on the breast of Jesus (epipeson de ekeinos ou'tos epi` to`
   stethos tou I.) [i. e. otherwise keeping his position, see above, p.
   6o], saith unto Him, Lord, who is it?'

   The Greek is exquisite. At first, St. John has been simply reclining
   (anakeimenos) in the bosom' of his Divine Master: that is, his place at
   the Supper is the next adjoining His,--for the phrase really means
   little more. But the proximity is of course excessive, as the sequel
   shews. Understanding from St. Peter's gesture what is required of him,
   St. John merely sinks back, and having thus let his head fall
   (epipeson) on (or close to) His Master's chest (epi` to` stethos), he
   says softly,--Lord, who is it?' . . . The moment is perhaps the most
   memorable in the Evangelist's life: the position, one of unutterable
   privilege. Time, place, posture, action,--all settle so deep into his
   soul, that when, in his old age, he would identify himself, he
   describes himself as the disciple whom Jesus loved; who also at the
   Supper' (that memorable Supper !) lay (anepesen [189] ) on Jesus'
   breast,' (literally, upon His chest,'--epi` to` stethos autou;), and
   said, Lord, who is it that is to betray Thee?' (ch. xxi. 20). . . .
   Yes, and the Church was not slow to take the beautiful hint. His
   language so kindled her imagination that the early Fathers learned to
   speak of St. John the Divine, as ho epistethios,--the (recliner) on the
   chest [190] .'

   Now, every delicate discriminating touch in this sublime picture is
   faithfully retained throughout by the cursive copies in the proportion
   of about eighty to one. The great bulk of the MSS., as usual, uncial
   and cursive alike, establish the undoubted text of the Evangelist,
   which is here the Received Text. Thus, a vast majority of the MSS.,
   with 'AD at their head, read epipeson in St. John xiii. 25. Chrysostom
   [191] and probably Cyril [192] confirm the same reading. So also Nonnus
   [193] . Not so B and C with four other uncials and about twenty
   cursives (the vicious Evan. 33 being at their head), besides Origen
   [194] in two places and apparently Theodorus of Mopsuestia [195] .
   These by mischievously assimilating the place in ch. xiii to the later
   place in ch. xxi in which such affecting reference is made to it,
   hopelessly obscure the Evangelist's meaning. For they substitute
   anapeson oun ekeinos k.t.l. It is exactly as when children, by way of
   improving the sketch of a great Master, go over his matchless outlines
   with a clumsy pencil of their own.

   That this is the true history of the substitution of anapeson in St.
   John xiii. 25 for the less obvious epipeson is certain. Origen, who was
   probably the author of all the mischief, twice sets the two places side
   by side and elaborately compares them; in the course of which
   operation, by the way, he betrays the viciousness of the text which he
   himself employed. But what further helps to explain how easily anapeson
   might usurp the place of epipeson [196] , is the discovery just
   noticed, that the ancients from the earliest period were in the habit
   of identifying St. John, as St. John had identified himself, by calling
   him the one that lay (ho anapeson) upon the Lord's chest.' The
   expression, derived from St. John xxi. 20, is employed by Irenaeus
   [197] (A.D. 178) and by Polycrates [198] (Bp. of Ephesus A.D. 196); by
   Origen [199] and by Ephraim Syrus [200] : by Epiphanius [201] and by
   Palladius [202] : by Gregory of Nazianzus [203] and by his namesake of
   Nyssa [204] : by pseudo-Eusebius [205] , by pseudo-Caesarius [206] ,
   and by pseudo-Chrysostom [207] . The only wonder is, that in spite of
   such influences all the MSS. in the world except about twenty-six have
   retained the true reading.

   Instructive in the meantime it is to note the fate which this word has
   experienced at the hands of some Critics. Lachmann, Tischendorf,
   Tregelles, Alford, Westcott and Hort, have all in turn bowed to the
   authority of Cod. B and Origen. Bishop Lightfoot mistranslates [208]
   and contends on the same side. Alford informs us that epipeson has
   surreptitiously crept in from St. Luke xv. 20': (why should it? how
   could it?) anapeson not seeming appropriate.' Whereas, on the contrary,
   anapeson is the invariable and obvious expression,--epipeson the
   unusual, and, till it has been explained, the unintelligible word.
   Tischendorf,--who had read epipeson in 1848 and anapeson in 1859,--in
   1869 reverts to his first opinion advocating with parental partiality
   what he had since met with in Cod. '. Is then the truth of Scripture
   aptly represented by that fitful beacon-light somewhere on the French
   coast,--now visible, now eclipsed, now visible again,--which benighted
   travellers amuse themselves by watching from the deck of the Calais
   packet?

   It would be time to pass on. But because in this department of study
   men are observed never to abandon a position until they are fairly
   shelled out and left without a pretext for remaining, I proceed to shew
   that anapeson (for epipeson) is only one corrupt reading out of many
   others hereabouts. The proof of this statement follows. Might it not
   have been expected that the old uncials' ('ABCD) would exhibit the
   entire context of such a passage as the present with tolerable
   accuracy? The reader is invited to attend to the results of
   collation:--

   xiii. 21. --o 'B: umin lego tr. B.
   22. --oun BC: + oi Ioudaioi ': aporountei D.
   23. --de B: + ek 'ABCD: -- o B: + kai D.

   In these seven verses therefore, (which present no special difficulty
   to a transcriber,) the Codexes in question are found to exhibit at
   least thirty-five varieties,--for twenty-eight of which (jointly or
   singly) B is responsible: ' for twenty-two: C for twenty-one: D for
   nineteen: A for three. It is found that twenty-three words have been
   added to the text: fifteen substituted: fourteen taken away; and the
   construction has been four times changed. One case there has been of
   senseless transposition. Simon, the father of Judas, (not Judas the
   traitor), is declared by 'BCD to have been called Iscariot.' Even this
   is not all. What St. John relates concerning himself is hopelessly
   obscured; and a speech is put into St. Peter's mouth which he certainly
   never uttered. It is not too much to say that every delicate lineament
   has vanished from the picture. What are we to think of guides like
   'BCD, which are proved to be utterly untrustworthy?

  § 5.

   The first two verses of St. Mark's Gospel have fared badly. Easy of
   transcription and presenting no special difficulty, they ought to have
   come down to us undisfigured by any serious variety of reading. On the
   contrary. Owing to entirely different causes, either verse has
   experienced calamitous treatment. I have elsewhere [209] proved that
   the clause huiou tou Theou; in verse 1 is beyond suspicion. Its removal
   from certain copies of the Gospel was originally due to heretical
   influence. But because Origen gave currency to the text so mutilated,
   it re-appears mechanically in several Fathers who are intent only on
   reproducing a certain argument of Origen's against the Manichees in
   which the mutilated text occurs. The same Origen is responsible to,
   some extent, and in the same way, for the frequent introduction of
   Isaiah's' name into verse 21--whereas in the prophets' is what St. Mark
   certainly wrote; but the appearance of Isaiah' there in the first
   instance was due to quite a different cause. In the meantime, it is
   witnessed to by the Latin, Syriac [210] , Gothic, and Egyptian
   versions, as well as by 'BDLA, and (according to Tischendorf) by nearly
   twenty-five cursives; besides the following ancient writers: Irenaeus,
   Origen, Porphyry, Titus, Basil, Serapion, Epiphanius, Severianus,
   Victor, Eusebius, Victorinus, Jerome, Augustine. I proceed to shew that
   this imposing array of authorities for reading en to Esaia to prophe'te
   instead of en tois prophe'tais in St. Mark i. 2, which has certainly
   imposed upon every recent editor and critic [211] ,--has been either
   overestimated or else misunderstood.

   1. The testimony of the oldest versions, when attention is paid to
   their contents, is discovered to be of inferior moment in minuter
   matters of this nature. Thus, copies of the Old Latin version thrust
   Isaiah's name into St. Matt. i. 22, and Zechariah's name into xxi. 4:
   as well as thrust out Jeremiah's name from xxvii. 9:--the first, with
   Curetonian, Lewis, Harkleian, Palestinian, and D,--the second, with
   Chrysostom and Hilary,--the third, with the Peshitto. The Latin and the
   Syriac further substitute tou prophetou for ton propheton in St. Matt.
   ii. 23,--through misapprehension of the Evangelist's meaning. What is
   to be thought of Cod. ' for introducing the name of Isaiah' into St.
   Matt. xiii. 35,--where it clearly cannot stand, the quotation being
   confessedly from Ps. lxxviii. 2; but where nevertheless Porphyry [212]
   , Eusebius [213] , and pseudo-Jerome [214] certainly found it in many
   ancient copies?

   2. Next, for the testimony of the Uncial Codexes 'BDLD:--If any one
   will be at the pains to tabulate the 900 [215] new readings' adopted by
   Tischendorf in editing St. Mark's Gospel, he will discover that for
   450, or just half of them,--all the 450, as I believe, being
   corruptions of the text,--'BL are responsible: and further, that their
   responsibility is shared on about 200 occasions by D: on about 265 by
   C: on about 350 by D [216] . some very remote period therefore there
   must have grown up a vicious general reading of this Gospel which
   remains in the few bad copies: but of which the largest traces (and
   very discreditable traces they are) at present survive in 'BCDLA. After
   this discovery the avowal will not be thought extraordinary that I
   regard with unmingled suspicion readings which are exclusively vouched
   for by five of the same Codexes: e. g. by 'BDLD.

   3. The cursive copies which exhibit Isaiah' in place of the prophet,'
   reckoned by Tischendorf at nearly twenty-five,' are probably less than
   fifteen [217] , and those, almost all of suspicious character. High
   time it is that the inevitable consequence of an appeal to such
   evidence were better understood.

   4. From Tischendorf's list of thirteen Fathers, serious deductions have
   to be made. Irenaeus and Victor of Antioch are clearly with the Textus
   Receptus. Serapion, Titus, Basil do but borrow from Origen; and, with
   his argument, reproduce his corrupt text of St. Mark i. 2. The
   last-named Father however saves his reputation by leaving out the
   quotation from Malachi; so, passing directly from the mention of Isaiah
   to the actual words of that prophet. Epiphanius (and Jerome too on one
   occasion [218] ) does the same thing. Victorinus and Augustine, being
   Latin writers, merely quote the Latin version (sicut scriptum est in
   Isaiâ propheta'), which is without variety of reading. There remain
   Origen (the faulty character of whose Codexes has been remarked upon
   already), Porphyry [219] the heretic (who wrote a book to convict the
   Evangelists of mis-statements [220] , and who is therefore scarcely a
   trustworthy witness), Eusebius, Jerome and Severianus. Of these,
   Eusebius [221] and Jerome [222] deliver it as their opinion that the
   name of Isaiah' had obtained admission into the text through the
   inadvertency of copyists. Is it reasonable, on the slender residuum of
   evidence, to insist that St. Mark has ascribed to Isaiah words
   confessedly written by Malachi? The fact,' writes a recent editor in
   the true spirit of modern criticism, will not fail to be observed by
   the careful and honest student of the Gospels.' But what if the fact'
   should prove to be a fiction' only? And (I venture to ask) would not
   carefulness' be better employed in scrutinizing the adverse testimony?
   honesty' in admitting that on grounds precarious as the present no
   indictment against an Evangelist can be seriously maintained? This
   proposal to revive a blunder which the Church in her corporate capacity
   has from the first refused to sanction (for the Evangelistaria know
   nothing of it) carries in fact on its front its own sufficient
   condemnation. Why, in the face of all the copies in the world (except a
   little handful of suspicious character), will men insist on imputing to
   an inspired writer a foolish mis-statement, instead of frankly
   admitting that the text must needs have been corrupted in that little
   handful of copies through the officiousness of incompetent criticism?

   And do any inquire,--How then did this perversion of the truth arise?
   In the easiest way possible, I answer. Refer to the Eusebian tables,
   and note that the foremost of his sectional parallels is as follows:--

   St. Matt.    St. Mark.    St. Luke.           St. John.
   e (i. e. 3). b (i. e. 3). z (i. e. iii. 3-6). i (i. e. 23) [223] .

   Now, since the name of Isaiah occurs in the first, the third and the
   fourth of these places in connexion with the quotation from Is. xl. 3,
   what more obvious than that some critic with harmonistic proclivities
   should have insisted on supplying the second also, i. e. the parallel
   place in St. Mark's Gospel, with the name of the evangelical prophet,
   elsewhere so familiarly connected with the passage quoted? This is
   nothing else in short but an ordinary instance of Assimilation, so
   unskilfully effected however as to betray itself. It might have been
   passed by with fewer words, for the fraud is indeed transparent, but
   that it has so largely imposed upon learned men, and established itself
   so firmly in books. Let me hope that we shall not hear it advocated any
   more.

   Regarded as an instrument of criticism, Assimilation requires to be
   very delicately as well as very skilfully handled. If it is to be
   applied to determining the text of Scripture, it must be employed, I
   take leave to say, in a very different spirit from what is met with in
   Dr. Tischendorf's notes, or it will only mislead. Is a word--a
   clause--a sentence--omitted by his favourite authorities 'BDL? It is
   enough if that learned critic finds nearly the same word,--a very
   similar clause,-- a sentence of the same general import,--in an account
   of the same occurrence by another Evangelist, for him straightway to
   insist that the sentence, the clause, the word, has been imported into
   the commonly received Text from such parallel place; and to reject it
   accordingly.

   But, as the thoughtful reader must see, this is not allowable, except
   under peculiar circumstances. For first, whatever a priori
   improbability might be supposed to attach to the existence of identical
   expressions in two Evangelical records of the same transaction, is
   effectually disposed of by the discovery that very often identity of
   expression actually does occur. And (2), the only condition which could
   warrant the belief that there has been assimilation, is observed to be
   invariably away from Dr. Tischendorf's instances,--viz. a sufficient
   number of respectable attesting witnesses: it being a fundamental
   principle in the law of Evidence, that the very few are rather to be
   suspected than the many. But further (3), if there be some marked
   diversity of expression discoverable in the two parallel places; and if
   that diversity has been carefully maintained all down the ages in
   either place;--then it may be regarded as certain, on the contrary,
   that there has not been assimilation; but that this is only one more
   instance of two Evangelists saying similar things or the same thing in
   slightly different language. Take for example the following
   case:--Whereas St. Matt. (xxiv. 15) speaks of the abomination of
   desolation to` rethe`n DIA Danie`l tou prophe'tou, standing (estos) in
   the holy place'; St. Mark (xiii. 14) speaks of it as to` rethe`n UPO
   Danie`l tou prophe'tou. standing (estos) where it ought not.' Now,
   because 'BDL with copies of the Italic, the Vulgate, and the Egyptian
   versions omit from St. Mark's Gospel the six words written above in
   Greek, Tischendorf and his school are for expunging those six words
   from St. Mark's text, on the plea that they are probably an importation
   from St. Matthew. But the little note of variety which the Holy Spirit
   has set on the place in the second Gospel (indicated above in capital
   letters) suggests that these learned men are mistaken. Accordingly, the
   other fourteen uncials and all the cursives,--besides the Peshitto,
   Harkleian, and copies of the Old Latin--a much more weighty body of
   evidence--are certainly right in retaining the words in St. Mark xiii.
   14.

   Take two more instances of misuse in criticism of Assimilation.

   St. Matthew (xii. 10), and St. Luke in the parallel place of his Gospel
   (xiv. 3), describe our Lord as asking,--Is it lawful to heal on the
   sabbath day?' Tischendorf finding that his favourite authorities in
   this latter place continue the sentence with the words or not?' assumes
   that those two words must have fallen out of the great bulk of the
   copies of St. Luke, which, according to him, have here assimilated
   their phraseology to that of St. Matthew. But the hypothesis is clearly
   inadmissible,--though it is admitted by most modern critics. Do not
   these learned persons see that the supposition is just as lawful, and
   the probability infinitely greater, that it is on the contrary the few
   copies which have here undergone the process of assimilation; and that
   the type to which they have been conformed, is to be found in St. Matt.
   xxii. 17; St. Mark xii. 14; St. Luke xx. 22?

   It is in fact surprising how often a familiar place of Scripture has
   exerted this kind of assimilating influence over a little handful of
   copies. Thus, some critics are happily agreed in rejecting the proposal
   of 'BDLR, (backed scantily by their usual retinue of evidence) to
   substitute for gemi'sai te`n koili'an autou apo, in St. Luke xv. 16,
   the words chortasthenai ek. But editors have omitted to point out that
   the words epethu'mei chortasthenai, introduced in defiance of the best
   authorities into the parable of Lazarus (xvi. 20), have simply been
   transplanted thither out of the parable of the prodigal son.

   The reader has now been presented with several examples of
   Assimilation. Tischendorf, who habitually overlooks the phenomenon
   where it seems to be sufficiently conspicuous, is observed constantly
   to discover cases of Assimilation where none exist. This is in fact his
   habitual way of accounting for not a few of the omissions in Cod. '.
   And because he has deservedly enjoyed a great reputation, it becomes
   the more necessary to set the reader on his guard against receiving
   such statements without a thorough examination of the evidence on which
   they rest.

  § 6.

   The value--may I not say, the use?--of these delicate differences of
   detail becomes apparent whenever the genuineness of the text is called
   in question. Take an example. The following fifteen words are
   deliberately excluded from St. Mark's Gospel (vi. 11) by some critics
   on the authority of 'BCDLD,--a most suspicious company, and three
   cursives; besides a few copies of the Old Latin, including the
   Vulgate:--ame`n le'go umin, anektoteron e'stai Sodo'mois e Gomo'rrois
   en heme'ra kri'seos, e te po'lei ekei'ne. It is pretended that this is
   nothing else but an importation from the parallel place of St.
   Matthew's Gospel (x. 15). But that is impossible: for, as the reader
   sees at a glance, a delicate but decisive note of discrimination has
   been set on the two places. St. Mark writes, Sodo'mOIS E Gomo'rrOIS:
   St. Matthew, GE? Sodo'mON KAI Gomo'rrON. And this threefold, or rather
   fourfold, diversity of expression has existed from the beginning; for
   it has been faithfully retained all down the ages: it exists to this
   hour in every known copy of the Gospel,--except of course those nine
   which omit the sentence altogether. There can be therefore no doubt
   about its genuineness. The critics of the modern school (Lachmann,
   Tischendorf, Tregelles, Alford, Westcott and Hort) seek in vain to put
   upon us a mutilated text by omitting those fifteen words. The two
   places are clearly independent of each other.

   It does but remain to point out that the exclusion of these fifteen
   words from the text of St. Mark, has merely resulted from the influence
   of the parallel place in St. Luke's Gospel (ix. 5),--where nothing
   whatever is found [224] corresponding with St. Matt. x. 5--St. Mark vi.
   11. The process of Assimilation therefore has been actively at work
   here, although not in the way which some critics suppose. It has
   resulted, not in the insertion of the words in dispute in the case of
   the very many copies; but on the contrary in their omission from the
   very few. And thus, one more brand is set on 'BCDLA and their Latin
   allies,--which will be found never to conspire together exclusively
   except to mislead.

  § 7.

   Because a certain clause (e.g. kai` e lalia' sou omoia'zei in St. Mark
   xiv. 70) is absent from Codd. 'BCDL, Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles,
   Alford, Westcott and Hort entirely eject these five precious words from
   St. Mark's Gospel, Griesbach having already voted them probably
   spurious.' When it has been added that many copies of the Old Latin
   also, together with the Vulgate and the Egyptian versions, besides
   Eusebius, ignore their existence, the present writer scarcely expects
   to be listened to if he insists that the words are perfectly genuine
   notwithstanding. The thing is certain however, and the Revisers are to
   blame for having surrendered five precious words of genuine Scripture,
   as I am going to shew.

   1. Now, even if the whole of the case were already before the reader,
   although to some there might seem to exist a prima facie probability
   that the clause is spurious, yet even so,--it would not be difficult to
   convince a thoughtful man that the reverse must be nearer the truth.
   For let the parallel places in the first two Gospels be set down side
   by side:--

   St. Matt. xxvi. 73.                St. Mark xiv. 70.
     (1) Alethos kai` su`               (1) Alethos
     (2) ex auton ei;                   (2) ex auto?n ei;
     (3) kai` ga`r

                                        (3) kai` ga`r Galilai?os ei,

     (4) e lalia' sou delo'n se poiei.

                                        (4) kai` e lalia' sou omoia'zei

   What more clear than that the later Evangelist is explaining what his
   predecessor meant by thy speech bewrayeth thee' [or else is giving an
   independent account of the same transaction derived from the common
   source]? To St. Matthew,--a Jew addressing Jews,--it seemed superfluous
   to state that it was the peculiar accent of Galilee which betrayed
   Simon Peter. To St. Mark,--or rather to the readers whom St. Mark
   specially addressed,--the point was by, no means so obvious.
   Accordingly, he paraphrases,--for thou art a Galilean and thy speech
   correspondeth.' Let me be shewn that all down the ages, in ninety-nine
   copies out of every hundred, this peculiar diversity of expression has
   been faithfully retained, and instead of assenting to the proposal to
   suppress St. Mark's (fourth) explanatory clause with its unique verb
   omoia'zei, I straightway betake myself to the far more pertinent
   inquiry,--What is the state of the text hereabouts? What, in fact, the
   context? This at least is not a matter of opinion, but a matter of
   fact.

   1. And first, I discover that Cod. D, in concert with several copies of
   the Old Latin (a b c ff^2 h q, &c.), only removes clause (4) from its
   proper place in St. Mark's Gospel, in order to thrust it into the
   parallel place in St. Matthew,--where it supplants the e lalia' sou
   delo'n se poiei of the earlier Evangelist; and where it clearly has no
   business to be.

   Indeed the object of D is found to have been to assimilate St.
   Matthew's Gospel to St. Mark,--for D also omits kai` su in clause (1).

   2. The Ethiopic version, on the contrary, is for assimilating St. Mark
   to St. Matthew, for it transfers the same clause (4) as it stands in
   St. Matthew's Gospel (kai e lalia' sou delo'n se poiei) to St. Mark.

   3. Evan. 33 (which, because it exhibits an ancient text of a type like
   B, has been styled [with grim irony] the Queen of the Cursives') is
   more brilliant here than usual; exhibiting St. Mark's clause (4)
   thus,--kai gar e lalia' sou delo'n se homoiazei.

   4. In C (and the Harkleian) the process of Assimilation is as
   conspicuous as in D, for St. Mark's third clause (3) is imported bodily
   into St. Matthew's Gospel. C further omits from St. Mark clause (4).

   5. In the Vercelli Codex (a) however, the converse process is
   conspicuous. St. Mark's Gospel has been assimilated to St. Matthew's by
   the unauthorized insertion into clause (1) of kai` su, (which by the
   way is also found in M), and (in concert with the Gothic and Evann. 73,
   131, 142*) by the entire suppression of clause (3).

   6. Cod. L goes beyond all. [True to the craze of omission], it further
   obliterates as well from St. Matthew's Gospel as from St. Mark's all
   trace of clause (4).

   7. ' and B alone of Codexes, though in agreement with the Vulgate and
   the Egyptian version, do but eliminate the final clause (4) of St.
   Mark's Gospel. But note, lastly, that--

   8. Cod. A, together with the Syriac versions, the Gothic, and the whole
   body of the cursives, recognizes none of these irregularities: but
   exhibits the commonly received text with entire fidelity.

   On a survey of the premisses, will any candid person seriously contend
   that kai` e lalia' sou omoia'zei is no part of the genuine text of St.
   Mark xiv. 70? The words are found in what are virtually the most
   ancient authorities extant: the Syriac versions (besides the Gothic and
   Cod. A), the Old Latin (besides Cod. D)--retain them;--those in their
   usual place,--these, in their unusual. Idle it clearly is in the face
   of such evidence to pretend that St. Mark cannot have written the words
   in question [225] . It is too late to insist that a man cannot have
   lost his watch when his watch is proved to have been in his own pocket
   at eight in the morning, and is found in another man's pocket at nine.
   As for C and L, their handling of the Text hereabouts clearly
   disqualifies them from being cited in evidence. They are condemned
   under the note of Context. Adverse testimony is borne by B and ': and
   by them only. They omit the words in dispute,--the ordinary habit of
   theirs, and most easily accounted for. But how is the punctual
   insertion of the words in every other known copy to be explained? In
   the meantime, it remains to be stated,--and with this I shall take
   leave of the discussion,--that hereabouts we have a set of passages
   which bear clear marks of wilful and critical correction, thoroughly
   carried out in Cod. ', and only partially in Cod. B and some of its
   compeers; the object being so far to assimilate the narrative of
   Peter's denials with those of the other Evangelists, as to suppress the
   fact, vouched for by St. Mark only, that the cock crowed twice [226] .'
   That incident shall be treated of separately. Can those principles
   stand, which in the face of the foregoing statement, and the evidence
   which preceded it, justify the disturbance of the text in St. Mark xiv.
   70?

   [We now pass on to a kindred cause of adulteration of the text of the
   New Testament.]

CHAPTER IX.

  CAUSES OF CORRUPTION CHIEFLY INTENTIONAL.

  III. ATTRACTION.

  § 1.

   THERE exist not a few corrupt Readings,--and they have imposed largely
   on many critics,--which, strange to relate, have arisen from nothing
   else but the proneness of words standing side by side in a sentence to
   be attracted into a likeness of ending,--whether in respect of
   grammatical form or of sound; whereby sometimes the sense is made to
   suffer grievously,--sometimes entirely to disappear. Let this be called
   the error of Attraction. The phenomena of Assimilation' are entirely
   distinct. A somewhat gross instance, which however has imposed on
   learned critics, is furnished by the Revised Text and Version of St.
   John vi. 71 and xiii. 26.

   Judas Iscariot' is a combination of appellatives with which every
   Christian ear is even awfully familiar. The expression Iou'das
   Iskario'tes is found in St. Matt. x. 4 and xxvi. 14: in St. Mark iii.
   19 and xiv. 10: in St. Luke vi. 16, and in xxii. 31 with the express
   statement added that Judas was so surnamed.' So far happily we are all
   agreed. St. John's invariable practice is to designate the traitor,
   whom he names four times, as Judas Iscariot, the son of
   Simon;'--jealous doubtless for the honour of his brother Apostle, Jude
   (Ioudas) the brother of James [227] ': and resolved that there shall be
   no mistake about the traitor's identity. Who does not at once recall
   the Evangelist's striking parenthesis in St. John xiv. 22,--Judas (not
   Iscariot)'? Accordingly, in St. John xiii. 2 the Revisers present us
   with Judas Iscariot, Simon's son': and even in St. John xii. 4 they are
   content to read Judas Iscariot.'

   But in the two places of St. John's Gospel which remain to be noticed,
   viz. vi. 71 and xiii. 26, instead of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon,'
   the Revisers require us henceforth to read, Judas the son of Simon
   Iscariot.' And why? Only, I answer, because--in place of Iou'dan
   Si'monos Iskario'TEN (in vi. 71) and Iou'da Si'monos Iskario'TE (in
   xiii. 26)--a little handful of copies substitute on both occasions
   Iskario'TOU. Need I go on? Nothing else has evidently happened but
   that, through the oscitancy of some very early scribe, the Iskario'TEN,
   Iskario'TE, have been attracted into concord with the immediately
   preceding genitive SImoNOC . . . So transparent a blunder would have
   scarcely deserved a passing remark at our hands had it been suffered to
   remain,--where such bêtises are the rule and not the exception,--viz.
   in the columns of Codexes B and '. But strange to say, not only have
   the Revisers adopted this corrupt reading in the two passages already
   mentioned, but they have not let so much as a hint fall that any
   alteration whatsoever has been made by them in the inspired Text.

  § 2.

   Another and a far graver case of Attraction' is found in Acts xx. 24.
   St. Paul, in his address to the elders of Ephesus, refers to the
   discouragements he has had to encounter. But none of these things move
   me,' he grandly exclaims, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so
   that I might finish my course with joy.' The Greek for this begins all'
   oudeno`s lo'gon poioumai where some second or third century copyist
   (misled by the preceding genitive) in place of lo'goN writes lo'goU
   with what calamitous consequence, has been found largely explained
   elsewhere [228] . Happily, the error survives only in Codd. B and C:
   and their character is already known by the readers of this book and
   the Companion Volume. So much has been elsewhere offered on this
   subject that I shall say no more about it here: but proceed to present
   my reader with another and more famous instance of attraction.

   St. Paul in a certain place (2 Cor. iii. 3) tells the Corinthians, in
   allusion to the language of Exodus xxxi. 12, xxxiv. 1, that they are an
   epistle not written on stony tables (en plaxi` lithi'nais),' but on
   fleshy tables of the heart (en plaxi`n kardi'as sarki'nais).' The one
   proper proof that this is what St. Paul actually wrote, is not only (1)
   That the Copies largely preponderate in favour of so exhibiting the
   place: but (2) That the Versions, with the single exception of that
   abject slave of manuscripts the Philoxenian [or Harkleian] Syriac,' are
   all on the same side: and lastly (3) That the Fathers are as nearly as
   possible unanimous. Let the evidence for kardi'as (unknown to
   Tischendorf and the rest) be produced in detail:--

   In the second century, Irenaeus [229] ,--the Old Latin,--the Peshitto.

   In the third century, Orison seven times [230] ,--the Coptic version.

   In the fourth century, the Dialogus [231] ,--Didymus [232] ,--Basil
   [233] ,--Gregory Nyss. [234] ,--Marcus the Monk [235] ,--Chrysostom in
   two places [236] ,--Nilus [237] ,--the Vulgate,--and the Gothic
   versions.

   In the fifth century, Cyril [238] ,--Isidorus [239] ,--Theodoret [240]
   , --the Armenian--and the Ethiopic versions.

   In the seventh century, Victor, Bp. of Carthage addressing Theodorus P.
   [241]

   In the eighth century, J. Damascene [242] . . . Besides, of the Latins,
   Hilary [243] ,--Ambrose [244] ,--Optatus [245] ,--Jerome [246]
   ,--Tichonius [247] ,--Augustine thirteen times [248] ,--Fulgentius
   [249] , and others [250] . . . If this be not overwhelming evidence,
   may I be told what is [251] ?

   But then it so happens that--attracted by the two datives between which
   kardias stands, and tempted by the consequent jingle, a surprising
   number of copies are found to exhibit the perfectly absurd' and wholly
   unnatural reading [252] ,' plaxi`n kardi'AIC sarki'nAIC. And because
   (as might have been expected from their character) A [253] B'CD [254]
   are all five of the number,--Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles, Alford,
   Westcott and Hort, one and all adopt and advocate the awkward blunder
   [255] . Kardi'ais is also adopted by the Revisers of 1881 without so
   much as a hint let fall in the margin that the evidence is
   overwhelmingly against themselves and in favour of the traditional Text
   of the Authorized Version [256] .

   expository remarks they contrast kardi'ai sarki'nai (or logikai) with
   plakes lithinai: as if it were not the word plaxi which alone occasions
   difficulty. Again, Tischendorf enumerates Cod. E (Paul) among his
   authorities. Had he then forgotten that E is nothing better than a
   transcript of Cod. D (Claromontanus), made by some ignorant person'?
   that the Greek is manifestly worthless, and that it should long since
   have been removed from the list of authorities'? (Scrivener's Introd.,
   4th edit., i. 177. See also Traditional Text, p. 65, and note.

   [255] That I may not be accused of suppressing what is to be said on
   the other side, let it be here added that the sum of the adverse
   evidence (besides the testimony of many MSS.) is the Harkleian
   version:--the doubtful testimony of Eusebius (for, though Valerius
   reads kardi'as, the MSS. largely preponderate which read kardi'aisin H.
   E. Mart. Pal. cxiii. § 6. See Burton's ed. p. 637):--Cyril in one
   place, as explained above:--and lastly, a quotation from Chrysostom on
   the Maccabees, given in Cramer's Catena, vii. 595 (en plaxi` kardi'ais
   sarki'nais), which reappears at the end of eight lines without the word
   plaxi.

CHAPTER X.

  CAUSES OF CORRUPTION CHIEFLY INTENTIONAL.

  IV. OMISSION.

   [WE have now to consider the largest of all classes of corrupt
   variations from the genuine Text [257] ,--the omission of words and
   clauses and sentences,--a truly fertile province of inquiry. Omissions
   are much in favour with a particular school of critics; though a habit
   of admitting them whether in ancient or modern times cannot but be
   symptomatic of a tendency to scepticism.]

  § 1.

   Omissions are often treated as Various Readings.' Yet only by an
   Hibernian licence can words omitted be so reckoned: for in truth the
   very essence of the matter is that on such occasions nothing is read.
   It is to the case of words omitted however that this chapter is to be
   exclusively devoted. And it will be borne in mind that I speak now of
   those words alone where the words are observed to exist in ninety-nine
   MSS. out of a hundred, so to speak;--being away only from that
   hundredth copy.

   Now it becomes evident, as soon as attention has been called to the
   circumstance, that such a phenomenon requires separate treatment. Words
   so omitted labour prima facie under a disadvantage which is all their
   own. My meaning will be best illustrated if I may be allowed to adduce
   and briefly discuss a few examples. And I will begin with a crucial
   case;--the most conspicuous doubtless within the whole compass of the
   New Testament. I mean the last twelve verses of St. Mark's Gospel;
   which verses are either bracketed off, or else entirely severed from
   the rest of the Gospel, by Tischendorf, Tregelles, Alford and others.

   The warrant of those critics for dealing thus unceremoniously with a
   portion of the sacred deposit is the fact that whereas Eusebius, for
   the statement rests solely with him, declares that anciently many
   copies were without the verses in question, our two oldest extant MSS.
   conspire in omitting them. But, I reply, the latter circumstance does
   not conduct to the inference that those verses are spurious. It only
   proves that the statement of Eusebius was correct. The Father cited did
   not, as is evident from his words [258] , himself doubt the genuineness
   of the verses in question; but admitted them to be genuine. [He quotes
   two opinions; --the opinion of an advocate who questions their
   genuineness, and an opposing opinion which he evidently considers the
   better of the two, since he rests upon the latter and casts a slur upon
   the former as being an off-hand expedient; besides that he quotes
   several words out of the twelve verses, and argues at great length upon
   the second hypothesis.

   On the other hand, one and that the least faulty of the two MSS.
   witnessing for the omission confesses mutely its error by leaving a
   vacant space where the omitted verses should have come in; whilst the
   other was apparently copied from an exemplar containing the verses
   [259] . And all the other copies insert them, except L and a few
   cursives which propose a manifestly spurious substitute for the
   verses,--together with all the versions, except one Old Latin (k), the
   Lewis Codex, two Armenian MSS. and an Arabic Lectionary,--besides more
   than ninety testimonies in their favour from more than forty-four'
   ancient witnesses [260] ; --such is the evidence which weighs down the
   conflicting testimony over and over and over again. Beyond all this,
   the cause of the error is patent. Some scribe mistook the Telos
   occurring at the end of an Ecclesiastical Lection at the close of
   chapter xvi. 8 for the End' of St. Mark's Gospel [261] .

   That is the simple truth: and the question will now be asked by an
   intelligent reader, If such is the balance of evidence, how is it that
   learned critics still doubt the genuineness of those verses?'

   To this question there can be but one answer, viz. Because those
   critics are blinded by invincible prejudice in favour of two unsafe
   guides, and on behalf of Omission.'

   We have already seen enough of the character of those guides, and are
   now anxious to learn what there can be in omissions which render them
   so acceptable to minds of the present day. And we can imagine nothing
   except the halo which has gathered round the detection of spurious
   passages in modern times, and has extended to a supposed detection of
   passages which in fact are not spurious. Some people appear to feel
   delight if they can prove any charge against people who claim to be
   orthodox; others without any such feeling delight in superior
   criticism; and the flavour of scepticism especially commends itself to
   the taste of many. To the votaries of such criticism, omissions of
   passages which they style interpolations,' offer temptingly spacious
   hunting-fields.

   Yet the experience of copyists would pronounce that Omission is the
   besetting fault of transcribers. It is so easy under the influence of
   the desire of accomplishing a task, or at least of anxiety for making
   progress, to pass over a word, a line, or even more lines than one. As
   has been explained before, the eye readily moves from one ending to a
   similar ending with a surprising tendency to pursue the course which
   would lighten labour instead of increasing it. The cumulative result of
   such abridgement by omission on the part of successive scribes may be
   easily imagined, and in fact is just what is presented in Codex B [262]
   . Besides these considerations, the passages which are omitted, and
   which we claim to be genuine, bear in themselves the character
   belonging to the rest of the Gospels, indeed--in Dr. Hort's expressive
   phrase--have the true ring of genuineness.' They are not like some
   which some critics of the same school would fain force upon us [263] .
   But beyond all,--and this is the real source and ground of attestation,
   --they enjoy superior evidence from copies, generally beyond comparison
   with the opposing testimony, from Versions, and from Fathers.]

  § 2.

   The fact seems to be all but overlooked that a very much larger amount
   of proof than usual is required at the hands of those who would
   persuade us to cancel words which have been hitherto by all
   persons,--in all ages,--in all countries,--regarded as inspired
   Scripture. They have (1) to account for the fact of those words'
   existence: and next (2), to demonstrate that they have no right to
   their place in the sacred page. The discovery that from a few copies
   they are away, clearly has very little to do with the question. We may
   be able to account for the omission from those few copies: and the
   instant we have done this, the negative evidence--the argument e
   silentio--has been effectually disposed of. A very different task--a
   far graver responsibility--is imposed upon the adverse party, as may be
   easily shewn. [They must establish many modes of accounting for many
   classes and groups of evidence. Broad and sweeping measures are now out
   of date. The burden of proof lies with them.]

  § 3.

   The force of what I am saying will be best understood if a few actual
   specimens of omission may he adduced, and individually considered. And
   first, let us take the case of an omitted word. In St. Luke vi. 1
   deuteropro'to is omitted from some MSS. Westcott and Hort and the
   Revisers accordingly exhibit the text of that place as
   follows:--Ege'neto de` en sabba'to diaporeu'esthai auto`n dia`
   spori'mon

   Now I desire to be informed how it is credible that so very difficult
   and peculiar a word as this,--for indeed the expression has never yet
   been satisfactorily explained,--should have found its way into every
   known Evangelium except 'BL and a few cursives, if it be spurious? How
   it came to be here and there omitted, is intelligible enough. (a) One
   has but to glance at the Cod. ',

   TO eN CABBATo
   DeUTROPRoTo

   in order to see that the like ending (To) in the superior line, fully
   accounts for the omission of the second line. (b) A proper lesson
   begins at this place; which by itself would explain the phenomenon. (c)
   Words which the copyists were at a loss to understand, are often
   observed to be dropped: and there is no harder word in the Gospels than
   deuteroprotos. But I repeat,--will you tell us how it is conceivable
   that [a word nowhere else found, and known to be a crux to commentators
   and others, should have crept into all the copies except a small
   handful?]

   In reply to all this, I shall of course be told that really I must
   yield to what is after all the weight of external evidence: that Codd.
   'BL are not ordinary MSS. but first-class authorities, of sufficient
   importance to outweigh any number of the later cursive MSS.

   My rejoinder is plain:--Not only am I of course willing to yield to
   external evidence, but it is precisely external evidence' which makes
   me insist on retaining deuteroproto--apo melissiou keri'ou--aras ton
   st9auron--kai anephereto eis ton ouranon--hotan \eklipete--the 14th
   verse of St. Matthew's xxiiird chapter--and the last twelve verses of
   St. Mark's Gospel. For my own part, I entirely deny the cogency of the
   proposed proof, and I have clearly already established the grounds of
   my refusal. Who then is to be the daysman between us? We are driven
   back on first principles, in order to ascertain if it may not be
   possible to meet on some common ground, and by the application of
   ordinary logical principles of reasoning to clear our view. [As to
   these we must refer the reader to the first volume of this work.
   Various cases of omission have been just quoted, and many have been
   discussed elsewhere. Accordingly, it will not be necessary to exhibit
   this large class of corruptions at the length which it would otherwise
   demand. But a few more instances are required, in order that the reader
   may see in this connexion that many passages at least which the
   opposing school designate as Interpolations are really genuine, and
   that students may be placed upon their guard against the source of
   error that we are discussing.]

  § 4.

   And first as to the rejection of an entire verse.

   The 44th verse of St. Matt. xxi, consisting of the fifteen words
   printed at foot [264] , is marked as doubtful by Tregelles, Westcott
   and Hort, and the Revisers:--by Tischendorf it is rejected as spurious.
   We insist that, on the contrary, it is indubitably genuine; reasoning
   from the antiquity, the variety, the respectability, the largeness, or
   rather, the general unanimity of its attestation.

   For the verse is found in the Old Latin, and in the Vulgate,--in the
   Peshitto, Curetonian, and Harkleian Syriac,--besides in the Coptic,
   Armenian, and Ethiopic versions. It is found also in Origen [265]
   ,--ps.-Tatian [266] --Aphraates [267] ,--Chrysostom [268] ,--Cyril
   Alex. [269] ,--the Opus Imperfectum [270] ,--Jerome [271] ,--Augustine
   [272] :--in Codexes B'CPhSChZDPEFGHKLMSUV,--in short, it is attested by
   every known Codex except two of bad character, viz.--D, 33; together
   with five copies of the Old Latin, viz.--a b e ff^1 ff^2. There have
   therefore been adduced for the verse in dispute at least five witnesses
   of the second or third century:--at least eight of the fourth:--at
   least seven if not eight of the fifth: after which date the testimony
   in favour of this verse is overwhelming. How could we be justified in
   opposing to such a mass of first-rate testimony the solitary evidence
   of Cod. D (concerning which see above, Vol. I. c. viii.) supported only
   by a single errant Cursive and a little handful of copies of the Old
   Latin versions, [even although the Lewis Codex has joined this petty
   band?]

   But, says Tischendorf,--the verse is omitted by Origen and by
   Eusebius,--by Irenaeus and by Lucifer of Cagliari,--as well as by Cyril
   of Alexandria. I answer, this most insecure of arguments for mutilating
   the traditional text is plainly inadmissible on the present occasion.
   The critic refers to the fact that Irenaeus [273] , Origen [274] ,
   Eusebius [275] and Cyril [276] having quoted the parable of the wicked
   husband-men' in extenso (viz. from verse 33 to verse 43). leave off at
   verse 43. Why may they not leave off where the parable leaves off? Why
   should they quote any further? Verse 44 is nothing to their purpose.
   And since the Gospel for Monday morning in Holy Week [verses 18-43], in
   every known copy of, the Lectionary actually ends at verse 43,--why
   should not their quotation of it end at the same verse? But,
   unfortunately for the critic, Origen and Cyril (as we have seen,--the
   latter expressly,) elsewhere actually quote the verse in dispute. And
   how can Tischendorf maintain that Lucifer yields adverse testimony
   [277] ? That Father quotes nothing but verse 43, which is all he
   requires for his purpose [278] . Why should he have also quoted verse
   44, which he does not require? As well might it be maintained that
   Macarius Egyptius [279] and Philo of Carpasus [280] omit verse 44,
   because (like Lucifer) they only quote verse 43.

   I have elsewhere explained what I suspect occasioned the omission of
   St. Matt.xxi. 44 from a few Western copies of the Gospels [281] .
   Tischendorf's opinion that this verse is a fabricated imitation of the
   parallel verse in St. Luke's Gospel [282] (xx. 18) is clearly
   untenable. Either place has its distinctive type, which either has
   maintained all down the ages. The single fact that St. Matt. xxi. 44 in
   the Peshitto version has a sectional number to itself [283] is far too
   weighty to be set aside on nothing better than suspicion. If a verse so
   elaborately attested as the present be not genuine, we must abandon all
   hope of ever attaining to any certainty concerning the Text of
   Scripture.

   In the meantime there emerges from the treatment which St. Matt. xxi.
   44 has experienced at the hands of Tischendorf, the discovery that, in
   the estimation of Tischendorf, Cod. D [is a document of so much
   importance as occasionally to outweigh almost by itself the other
   copies of all ages and countries in Christendom.]

  § 5.

   I am guided to my next example, viz. the text of St. Matt. xv. 8, by
   the choice deliberately made of that place by Dr. Tregelles in order to
   establish the peculiar theory of Textual Revision which he advocates so
   strenuously; and which, ever since the days of Griesbach, has it must
   be confessed enjoyed the absolute confidence of most of the illustrious
   editors of the New Testament. This is, in fact, the second example on
   Tregelles' list. In approaching it, I take leave to point out that that
   learned critic unintentionally hoodwinks his readers by not setting
   before them in full the problem which he proposes to discuss.
   Thoroughly to understand this matter, the student should be reminded
   that there is found in St. Matt. xv. 8,--and parallel to it in St. Mark
   vii. 6,--

   ST. MATT. ST. MARK

   Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you saying, "This people
   draweth nigh unto Me with their mouth and honoureth me with their lips
   (engi'zei moi o lao`s houtos to sto'mati auton, kai` tois chei'lesi' me
   tima;), but their

   Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, hypocrites, as it is written, "This
   people honoureth Me with their lips (houtos o lao`s tois chei'lesi' me
   tima, but their heart is far from Me."'

   heart is far from Me."'

   The place of Isaiah referred to, viz. ch. xxix. 13, reads as follows in
   the ordinary editions of the LXX:--kai` eipe Ku'rios, engi'zei moi o
   lao`s houtos en to stomati autou, kai en tois chei'lesin auton timosi'n
   me.

   Now, about the text of St. Mark in this place no question is raised.
   Neither is there any various reading worth speaking of in ninety-nine
   MSS. out of a hundred in respect of the text in St. Matthew. But when
   reference is made to the two oldest copies in existence, B and ', we
   are presented with what, but for the parallel place in St. Mark, would
   have appeared to us a strangely abbreviated reading. Both MSS. conspire
   in exhibiting St. Matt. xv. 8, as follows:--ho lao`s houtos tois
   chei'lesi'n me tima. So that six words (engi'zei moi and to sto'mati
   auton, kai`) are not recognized by them: in which peculiarity they are
   countenanced by DLT^c, two cursive copies, and the following
   versions:--Old Latin except f, Vulgate, Curetonian, Lewis, Peshitto,
   and Bohairic, (Cod. A, the Sahidic and Gothic versions, being imperfect
   here.) To this evidence, Tischendorf adds a phalanx of
   Fathers:--Clemens Romanus (A.D. 70), Ptolemaeus the Gnostic (A.D. 150),
   Clemens Alexandrinus (A.D. 190), Origen in three places (A.D. 210),
   Eusebius (A.D. 325), Basil, Cyril of Alexandria, Chrysostom: and Alford
   supplies also Justin Martyr (A.D. 150). The testimony of Didymus (A.D.
   350), which has been hitherto overlooked, is express. Tertullian,
   Cyprian, Hilary, are naturally found to follow the Latin copies. Such a
   weight of evidence may not unreasonably inspire Dr. Tregelles with an
   exceeding amount of confidence. Accordingly he declares that this one
   passage might be relied upon as an important proof that it is the few
   MSS. and not the many which accord with ancient testimony.' Availing
   himself of Dr. Scrivener's admission of the possibility that the
   disputed words in the great bulk of the MSS. were inserted from the
   Septuagint of Isaiah xxix. 13 [284] ,' Dr. Tregelles insists that on
   every true principle of textual criticism, the words must be regarded
   as an amplification borrowed from the Prophet. This naturally explains
   their introduction,' (he adds); and when once they had gained a footing
   in the text, it is certain that they would be multiplied by copyists,
   who almost always preferred to make passages as full and complete as
   possible' (p. 139). Dr. Tregelles therefore relies upon this one
   passage,--not so much as a proof that it is the few MSS. and not the
   many which accord with ancient testimony';--for one instance cannot
   possibly prove that; and that is after all beside the real
   question;--but, as a proof that we are to regard the text of Codd. B'
   in this place as genuine, and the text of all the other Codexes in the
   world as corrupt.

   The reader has now the hypothesis fully before him by which from the
   days of Griesbach it has been proposed to account for the discrepancy
   between the few copies' on the one hand, and the whole torrent of
   manuscript evidence on the other.

   Now, as I am writing a book on the principles of Textual Criticism, I
   must be allowed to set my reader on his guard against all such
   unsupported dicta as the preceding, though enforced with emphasis and
   recommended by a deservedly respected name. I venture to think that the
   exact reverse will be found to be a vast deal nearer the truth: viz.
   that undoubtedly spurious readings, although they may at one time or
   other have succeeded in obtaining a footing in MSS., and to some extent
   may be observed even to have propagated themselves, are yet discovered
   to die out speedily; seldom indeed to leave any considerable number of
   descendants. There has always in fact been a process of elimination
   going on, as well as of self-propagation: a corrective force at work,
   as well as one of deterioration. How else are we to account for the
   utter disappearance of the many monstra potius quam variae lectiones
   which the ancients nevertheless insist were prevalent in their times?
   It is enough to appeal to a single place in Jerome, in illustration of
   what I have been saying [285] . To return however from this digression.

   We are invited then to believe,--for it is well to know at the outset
   exactly what is required of us,--that from the fifth century downwards
   every extant copy of the Gospels except five (DLT^c, 33, 124) exhibits
   a text arbitrarily interpolated in order to bring it into conformity
   with the Greek version of Isa. xxix. 13. On this wild hypothesis I have
   the following observations to make:--

   1. It is altogether unaccountable, if this be indeed a true account of
   the matter, how it has come to pass that in no single MS. in the world,
   so far as I am aware, has this conformity been successfully achieved:
   for whereas the Septuagintal reading is engi'zei moi o lao`s houtos EN
   to stomati AUTOU, kai EN tois chei'lesin AUTON TIMOSI me,--the
   Evangelical Text is observed to differ therefrom in no less than six
   particulars.

   2. Further,--If there really did exist this strange determination on
   the part of the ancients in general to assimilate the text of St.
   Matthew to the text of Isaiah, how does it happen that not one of them
   ever conceived the like design in respect of the parallel place in St.
   Mark?

   3. It naturally follows to inquire,--Why are we to suspect the mass of
   MSS. of having experienced such wholesale depravation in respect of the
   text of St. Matthew in this place, while yet we recognize in them such
   a marked constancy to their own peculiar type; which however, as
   already explained, is not the text of Isaiah?

   4. Further,--I discover in this place a minute illustration of the
   general fidelity of the ancient copyists: for whereas in St. Matthew it
   is invariably o lao`s houtos, I observe that in the copies of St.
   Mark,--except to be sure in (a) Codd. B and D, (b) copies of the Old
   Latin, (c) the Vulgate, and (d) the Peshitto (all of which are
   confessedly corrupt in this particular,)--it is invariably houtos o
   lao's. But now,--Is it reasonable that the very copies which have been
   in this way convicted of licentiousness in respect of St. Mark vii. 6
   should be permitted to dictate to us against the great heap of copies
   in respect of their exhibition of St. Matt. xv. 8?

   And yet, if the discrepancy between Codd. B and ' and the great bulk of
   the copies in this place did not originate in the way insisted on by
   the critics, how is it to be accounted for? Now, on ordinary occasions,
   we do not feel ourselves called upon to institute any such inquiry,--as
   indeed very seldom would it be practicable to do. Unbounded licence of
   transcription, flagrant carelessness, arbitrary interpolations,
   omissions without number, disfigure those two ancient MSS. in every
   page. We seldom trouble ourselves to inquire into the history of their
   obliquities. But the case is of course materially changed when so many
   of the oldest of the Fathers and all the oldest Versions seem to be at
   one with Codexes B and '. Let then the student favour me with his
   undivided attention for a few moments, and I will explain to him how
   the misapprehension of Griesbach, Tischendorf, Tregelles and the rest,
   has arisen. About the MSS. and the Versions these critics are
   sufficiently accurate: but they have fatally misapprehended the import
   of the Patristic evidence; as I proceed to explain.

   The established Septuagintal rendering of Isa. xxix. 13 in the
   Apostolic age proves to have been this,--Engi'zei moi o lao`s houtos
   tois chei'lesin auton timosi me: the words en to stomati auton, kai en
   being omitted. This is certain. Justin Martyr [286] and Cyril of
   Alexandria in two places [287] so quote the passage. Procopius Gazaeus
   in his Commentary on Origen's Hexapla of Isaiah says expressly that the
   six words in question were introduced into the text of the Septuagint
   by Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion. Accordingly they are often
   observed to be absent from MSS. [288] They are not found, for example,
   in the Codex Alexandrinus.

   But the asyndeton resulting from the suppression of these words was
   felt to be intolerable. In fact, without a colon point between houtos
   and tois, the result is without meaning. When once the complementary
   words have been withdrawn, engi'zei moi at the beginning of the
   sentence is worse than superfluous. It fatally encumbers the sense. To
   drop those two words, after the example of the parallel place in St.
   Mark's Gospel, became thus an obvious proceeding. Accordingly the
   author of the (so-called) second Epistle of Clemens Romanus (§ 3),
   professing to quote the place in the prophet Isaiah, exhibits it
   thus,--Ho lao`s houtos tois chei'lesin me tima. Clemens Alexandrinus
   certainly does the same thing on at least two occasions [289] . So does
   Chrysostom [290] . So does Theodoret [291] .

   Two facts have thus emerged, which entirely change the aspect of the
   problem: the first, (a) That the words en to stomati auton, kai en,
   were anciently absent from the Septuagintal rendering of Isaiah xxix.
   13: the second, (b) that the place of Isaiah was freely quoted by the
   ancients without the initial words engi'zei moi.

   And after this discovery will any one be so perverse as to deny that on
   the contrary it must needs be Codexes B and ', and not the great bulk
   of the MSS., which exhibit a text corrupted by the influence of the
   Septuagint rendering of Isaiah xxix. 13? The precise extent to which
   the assimilating influence of the parallel place in St. Mark's Gospel
   has been felt by the copyists, I presume not to determine. The
   essential point is that the omission from St. Matthew xv. 8 of the
   words To stomati auton, kai is certainly due in the first instance to
   the ascertained Septuagint omission of those very words in Isaiah xxix.
   13.

   But that the text of St. Mark vii. 6 has exercised an assimilating
   influence on the quotation from Isaiah is demonstrable. For there can
   be no doubt that Isaiah's phrase (retained by St. Matthew) is ho lao`s
   houtos,--St. Mark's houtos o lao's. And yet, when Clemens Romanus
   quotes Isaiah, he begins--houtos o lao's [292] ; and so twice does
   Theodoret [293] .

   The reader is now in a position to judge how much attention is due to
   Dr. Tregelles' dictum that this one passage may be relied upon' in
   support of the peculiar views he advocates: as well as to his confident
   claim that the fuller text which is found in ninety-nine MSS. out of a
   hundred must be regarded as an amplification borrowed from the
   prophet.' It has been shewn in answer to the learned critic that in the
   ancient Greek text of the prophet the amplification' he speaks of did
   not exist: it was the abbreviated text which was found there. So that
   the very converse of the phenomenon he supposes has taken place. Freely
   accepting his hypothesis that we have here a process of assimilation,
   occasioned by the Septuagintal text of Isaiah, we differ from him only
   as to the direction in which that process has manifested itself. He
   assumes that the bulk of the MSS. have been conformed to the generally
   received reading of Isaiah xxix. 13. But it has been shewn that, on the
   contrary, it is the two oldest MSS. which have experienced
   assimilation. Their prototypes were depraved in this way at an
   exceedingly remote period.

   To state this matter somewhat differently.--In all the extant uncials
   but five, and in almost every known cursive copy of the Gospels, the
   words to sto'mati auton, kai' are found to belong to St. Matt. xv. 8.
   How is the presence of those words to be accounted for? The reply is
   obvious:--By the fact that they must have existed in the original
   autograph of the Evangelist. Such however is not the reply of Griesbach
   and his followers. They insist that beyond all doubt those words must
   have been imported into the Gospel from Isaiah xxix. But I have shewn
   that this is impossible because, at the time spoken of, the words in
   question had no place in the Greek text of the prophet. And this
   discovery exactly reverses the problem, and brings out the directly
   opposite result. For now we discover that we have rather to inquire how
   is the absence of the words in question from those few MSS. out of the
   mass to be accounted for? The two oldest Codexes are convicted of
   exhibiting a text which has been corrupted by the influence of the
   oldest Septuagint reading of Isaiah xxix. 13.

   I freely admit that it is in a high degree remarkable that five ancient
   Versions, and all the following early writers,--Ptolemaeus [294] ,
   Clemens Alexandrinus [295] , Origen [296] , Didymus [297] , Cyril [298]
   , Chrysostom [299] , and possibly three others of like antiquity [300]
   ,--should all quote St. Matthew in this place from a faulty text. But
   this does but prove at how extremely remote a period the corruption
   must have begun. It probably dates from the first century. Especially
   does it seem to shew how distrustful we should be of our oldest
   authorities when, as here, they are plainly at variance with the whole
   torrent of manuscript authority. This is indeed no ordinary case. There
   are elements of distrust here, such as are not commonly encountered.

  § 6.

   What I have been saying is aptly illustrated by a place in our Lord's
   Sermon on the Mount: viz. St. Matt. v. 44; which in almost every MS. in
   existence stands as follows:

   (1) agapate tou`s echthrou`s umon

   (2) eulogeite tou`s katarome'nous umas

   (3) kalos poieite tois misousin [301] umas

   (4) kai` proseu'chesthe upe`r ton epereazo'nton umas

   (5) kai dioko'nton umas [302] .

   On the other hand, it is not to be denied that there exists an
   appreciable body of evidence for exhibiting the passage in a shorter
   form. The fact that Origen six times [303] reads the place thus:

   agapate tou`s echthrou`s umon

   kai` proseu'chesthe upe`r ton diokonton umas

   (which amounts to a rejection of the second, third, and fourth
   clauses;)--and that he is supported therein by B', (besides a few
   cursives) the Curetonian, the Lewis, several Old Latin MSS., and the
   Bohairic [304] , seems to critics of a certain school a circumstance
   fatal to the credit of those clauses. They are aware that Cyprian [305]
   , and they are welcome to the information that Tertullian [306] once
   and Theodoret once [307] [besides Irenaeus [308] , Eusebius [309] , and
   Gregory of Nyssa [310] ] exhibit the place in the same way. So does the
   author of the Dialogus contra Marcionitas [311] ,--whom however I take
   to be Origen. Griesbach, on far slenderer evidence, was for obelizing
   all the three clauses. But Lachmann, Tregelles, Tischendorf and the
   Revisers reject them entirely. I am persuaded that they are grievously
   mistaken in so doing, and that the received text represents what St.
   Matthew actually wrote. It is the text of all the uncials but two, of
   all the cursives but six or seven; and this alone ought to be decisive.
   But it is besides the reading of the Peshitto, the Harkleian, and the
   Gothic; as well as of three copies of the Old Latin.

   Let us however inquire more curiously for the evidence of Versions and
   Fathers on this subject; remembering that the point in dispute is
   nothing else but the genuineness of clauses 2, 3, 4. And here, at
   starting, we make the notable discovery that Origen, whose practice was
   relied on for retaining none but the first and the fifth
   clauses,--himself twice [312] quotes the first clause in connexion with
   the fourth: while Theodoret, on two occasions [313] , connects with
   clause 1 what he evidently means for clause 2; and Tertullian once if
   not twice connects closely clauses 1, 2; and once, clauses 1, 2, 5
   [314] . From which it is plain that neither Origen nor Theodoret, least
   of all Tertullian, can be held to disallow the clauses in question.
   They recognize them on the contrary, which is simply a fatal
   circumstance, and effectively disposes of their supposed hostile
   evidence.

   But in fact the Western Church yields unfaltering testimony. Besides
   the three copies of the Old Latin which exhibit all the five clauses,
   the Vulgate retains the first, third, fifth and fourth. Augustine [315]
   quotes consecutively clauses I, 3, 5: Ambrose [316] clauses 1, 3, 4,
   5--1, 4, 5: Hilary [317] , clauses 1, 4, 5, and (apparently) 2, 4, 5:
   Lucifer [318] , clauses I, 2, 3 (apparently), 5: pseudo-Epiphanius
   [319] a connects clauses 1, 3,--1, 3, 5: and Pacian [320] , clauses 5,
   2. Next we have to ascertain what is the testimony of the Greek
   Fathers.

   And first we turn to Chrysostom [321] who (besides quoting the fourth
   clause from St. Matthew's Gospel by itself five times) quotes
   consecutively clauses 1, 3--iii. 167; 1, 4--iv. 619; 2, 4--v. 436; 4,
   3--ii. 340, v. 56, xii. 654; 4, 5--ii. 258, iii. 341; 1, 2, 4--iv. 267;
   1, 3, 4, 5--xii. 425; thus recognizing them all.

   Gregory Nyss. [322] quotes connectedly clauses 3, 4, 5.

   Eusebius [323] , clauses 4, 5--2, 4, 5--1, 3, 4, 5.

   The Apostolic Constitutions [324] (third century), clauses 1, 3, 4, 5
   (having immediately before quoted clause 2,)--also clauses 2, 4, 1.

   Clemens Alex. [325] (A.D. 192), clauses 1, 2, 4.

   Athenagoras [326] (A.D. 177), clauses 1, 2, 5.

   Theophilus [327] (A.D. 168), clauses 1, 4.

   While Justin M. [328] (A. D. 140) having paraphrased clause 1, connects
   therewith clauses 2 and 4.

   And Polycarp [329] (A.D. 108) apparently connects clauses 4 and 5.

   Didache [330] (A.D. 100?) quotes 2, 4, 5 and combines 1 and 3 (pp. 5,
   6).

   In the face of all this evidence, no one it is presumed will any more
   be found to dispute the genuineness of the generally received reading
   in St. Matt. v. 44. All must see that if the text familiarly known in
   the age immediately after that of the Apostles had been indeed the
   bald, curt thing which the critics imagine, viz.

   agapate tou`s echthrou`s umon

   kai` proseu'chesthe upe`r ton dioko'nton umas.--

   by no possibility could the men of that age in referring to St. Matt.
   v. 44 have freely mentioned blessing those who curse,--doing good to
   those who hate,--and praying for those who despitefully use.' Since
   there are but two alternative readings of the passage,--one longer, one
   briefer,--every clear acknowledgement of a single disputed clause in
   the larger reading necessarily carries with it all the rest.

   This result of comparative criticism' is therefore respectfully
   recommended to the notice of the learned. If it be not decisive of the
   point at issue to find such a torrent of primitive testimony at one
   with the bulk of the Uncials and Cursives extant, it is clear that
   there can be no Science of Textual Criticism. The Law of Evidence must
   be held to be inoperative in this subject-matter. Nothing deserving of
   the name of proof' will ever be attainable in this department of
   investigation.

   But if men admit that the ordinarily received text of St. Matt. v. 44
   has been clearly established, then let the legitimate results of the
   foregoing discussion be loyally recognized. The unique value of
   Manuscripts in declaring the exact text of Scripture--the conspicuous
   inadequacy of Patristic evidence by themselves,--have been made
   apparent: and yet it has been shewn that Patristic quotations are
   abundantly sufficient for their proper purpose,--which is, to enable us
   to decide between conflicting readings. One more indication has been
   obtained of the corruptness of the text which Origen
   employed,--concerning which he is so strangely communicative,--and of
   which B' are the chief surviving examples; and the probability has been
   strengthened that when these are the sole, or even the principal
   witnesses, for any particular reading, that reading will prove to be
   corrupt.

   Mill was of opinion, (and of course his opinion finds favour with
   Griesbach, Tischendorf, and the rest,) that these three clauses have
   been imported hither from St. Luke vi. 27, 28. But, besides that this
   is mere unsupported conjecture, how comes it then to pass that the
   order of the second and third clauses in St. Matthew's Gospel is the
   reverse of the order in St. Luke's? No. I believe that there has been
   excision here: for I hold with Griesbach that it cannot have been the
   result of accident [331] .

   [I take this opportunity to reply to a reviewer in the Guardian
   newspaper, who thought that he had reduced the authorities quoted from
   before A.D. 400 on page 103 of The Traditional Text to two on our side
   against seven, or rather six [332] , on the other. Let me first say
   that on this perilous field I am not surprised at being obliged to
   re-judge or withdraw some authorities. I admit that in the middle of a
   long catena of passages, I did not lay sufficient stress, as I now
   find, upon the parallel passage in St. Luke vi. 27, 28. After fresh
   examination, I withdraw entirely Clemens Alex., Paed. i. 8,--Philo of
   Carpasus, I. 7,--Ambrose, De Abrahamo ii. 30, Ps. cxviii. 12. 51, and
   the two referred to Athanasius. Also I do not quote Origen, Cels. viii.
   41,--Eusebius in Ps. iii.,--Apost. Const. vii. 4,--Greg. Nyss., In S.
   Stephanum, because they may be regarded as doubtful, although for
   reasons which I proceed to give they appear to witness in favour of our
   contention. It is necessary to add some remarks before dealing with the
   rest of the passages.

   1. It must be borne in mind, that this is a question both negative and
   positive:--negative on the side of our opponents, with all the
   difficulties involved in establishing a negative conclusion as to the
   non-existence in St. Matthew's Gospel of clauses 2, 3, and 5,--and
   positive for us, in the establishment of those clauses as part of the
   genuine text in the passage which we are considering. If we can so
   establish the clauses, or indeed any one of them, the case against us
   fails: but unless we can establish all, we have not proved everything
   that we seek to demonstrate. Our first object is to make the adverse
   position untenable: when we have done that, we fortify our own.
   Therefore both the Dean and myself have drawn attention to the fact
   that our authorities are summoned as witnesses to the early existence
   in each case of some of the clauses,' if they do not depose to all of
   them. We are quite aware of the reply: but we have with us the
   advantage of positive as against negative evidence. This advantage
   especially rules in such an instance as the present, because alien
   circumstances govern the quotation, and regulate particularly the
   length of it. Such quotation is always liable to shortening, whether by
   leaving out intermediate clauses, or by sudden curtailment in the midst
   of the passage. Therefore, actual citation of separate clauses, being
   undesigned and fortuitous, is much more valuable than omission arising
   from what cause soever.

   2. The reviewer says that all four clauses are read by both texts,' i.
   e. in St. Matthew and St. Luke, and appears to have been unaware as
   regards the present purpose of the existence of the fifth clause, or
   half-clause, in St. Matthew. Yet the words--huper . . . to diokonton
   humas are a very label, telling incontestibly the origin of many of the
   quotations. Sentences so distinguished with St. Matthew's label cannot
   have come from St. Luke's Gospel. The reviewer has often gone wrong
   here. The huper--instead of the peri after 'BLX in St. Luke--should be
   to our opponents a sign betraying the origin, though when it stands by
   itself--as in Eusebius, In Ps. iii.--I do not press the passage.

   3. Nor again does the reviewer seem to have noticed the effects of the
   context in shewing to which source a quotation is to be referred. It is
   a common custom for Fathers to quote v. 45 in St. Matthew, which is
   hardly conceivable if they had St. Luke vi. 27, 28 before them, or even
   if they were quoting from memory. Other points in the context of
   greater or less importance are often found in the sentence or sentences
   preceding or following the words quoted, and are decisive of the
   reference.

   The references as corrected are given in the note [333] . It will be
   seen by any one who compares the verifications with the reviewer's
   list, how his failure to observe the points just explained has led him
   astray. The effect upon the list given in The Traditional Text will be
   that before the era of St. Chrysostom twenty-five testimonies are given
   in favour of the Traditional Text of St. Matt. v. 44, and adding
   Tertullian from the Dean nine against it. And the totals on page 102,
   lines 2 and 3 will be 522 and 171 respectively.]

  § 7.

   Especially have we need to be on our guard against conniving at the
   ejection of short clauses consisting of from twelve to fourteen
   letters,--which proves to have been the exact length of a line in the
   earliest copies. When such omissions leave the sense manifestly
   imperfect, no evil consequence can result. Critics then either take no
   notice of the circumstance, or simply remark in passing that the
   omission has been the result of accident. In this way, [oi pate'res
   auton, though it is omitted by Cod. B in St. Luke vi. 26, is retained
   by all the Editors: and the strange reading of Cod. ' in St. John vi.
   55, omitting two lines, was corrected on the manuscript in the seventh
   century, and has met with no assent in modern times].

   But when, notwithstanding the omission of two or three words, the sense
   of the context remains unimpaired,--the clause being of independent
   signification,--then great danger arises lest an attempt should be made
   through the officiousness of modern Criticism to defraud the Church of
   a part of her inheritance. Thus [kai hoi sun hauto (St. Luke viii. 45)
   is omitted by Westcott and Hort, and is placed in the margin by the
   Revisers and included in brackets by Tregelles as if the words were of
   doubtful authority, solely because some scribe omitted a line and was
   followed by B, a few cursives, the Sahidic, Curetonian, Lewis, and
   Jerusalem Versions].

   When indeed the omission dates from an exceedingly remote period; took
   place, I mean, in the third, or more likely still in the second
   century; then the fate of such omitted words may be predicted with
   certainty. Their doom is sealed. Every copy made from that defective
   original of necessity reproduced the defects of its prototype: and if
   (as often happens) some of those copies have descended to our times,
   they become quoted henceforward as if they were independent witnesses
   [334] . Nor is this all. Let the taint have been communicated to
   certain copies of the Old Latin, and we find ourselves confronted with
   formidable because very venerable foes. And according to the recently
   approved method of editing the New Testament, the clause is allowed no
   quarter. It is declared without hesitation to be a spurious accretion
   to the Text. Take, as an instance of this, the following passage in St.
   Luke xii. 39. If' (says our Lord) the master of the house had known in
   what hour

   OKLePTEC

   eRCheTAI [eGREGOR

   ECeNKAI] OUKANA

   PhEKeN

   his house to be broken through.' Here, the clause within brackets,
   which has fallen out for an obvious reason, does not appear in Codd. '
   and D. But the omission did not begin with '. Two copies of the Old
   Latin are also without the words egrego'resen kai`,--which are wanting
   besides in Cureton's Syriac. Tischendorf accordingly omits them. And
   yet, who sees not that such an amount of evidence as this is wholly
   insufficient to warrant the ejection of the clause as spurious? What is
   the Science' worth which cannot preserve to the body a healthy limb
   like this?

   [The instances of omission which have now been examined at some length
   must by no means be regarded as the only specimens of this class of
   corrupt passages [335] . Many more will occur to the minds of the
   readers of the present volume and of the earlier volume of this work.
   In fact, omissions are much more common than Additions, or
   Transpositions, or Substitutions: and this fact, that omissions, or
   what seem to be omissions, are apparently so common,--to say nothing of
   the very strong evidence wherewith they are attested--when taken in
   conjunction with the natural tendency of copyists to omit words and
   passages, cannot but confirm the general soundness of the position. How
   indeed can it possibly be more true to the infirmities of copyists, to
   the verdict of evidence on the several passages, and to the origin of
   the New Testament in the infancy of the Church and amidst associations
   which were not literary, to suppose that a terse production was first
   produced and afterwards was amplified in a later age with a view to
   lucidity and completeness [336] ,' rather than that words and clauses
   and sentences were omitted upon definitely understood principles in a
   small class of documents by careless or ignorant or prejudiced scribes?
   The reply to this question must now be left for candid and thoughtful
   students to determine].
     __________________________________________________________________

   [257] It will be observed that these are empirical, not logical,
   classes. Omissions are found in many of the rest.

   art thou if thou knowest what thou doest; but if thou knowest not, thou
   art cursed and a transgressor of the law"' (Scrivener's translation,

   after St. Matt. xx. 28. These are condemned by internal evidence as

   [265] iv. 25 d, 343 d.--What proves these two quotations to be from St.
   Matt. xxi. 44, and not from St. Luke xx. 18, is, that they alike
   exhibit expressions which are peculiar to the earlier Gospel. The first
   is introduced by the formula oude'pote ane'gnote (ver. 42: comp. Orig.
   ii. 794 c), and both exhibit the expression epi` to`n li'thon touton
   (ver. 44), not ep' ekeinon to`n li'thon. Vainly is it urged on the
   opposite side, that war pas o peso`n belongs to St. Luke,--whereas kai`
   o peso'n, is the phrase found in St. Matthew's Gospel. Chrysostom (vii.
   672) writes pas o pipton while professing to quote from St. Matthew;
   and the author of Cureton's Syriac, who had this reading in his
   original, does the same.

   [331] Theodoret once (iv. 946) gives the verse as Tischendorf gives it:
   but on two other occasions (i. 827: ii. 399) the same Theodoret
   exhibits the second member of the sentence thus,--eulogeite tou`s
   diokontas umas (so pseud.-Athan. ii. 95), which shews how little stress
   is to be laid on such evidence as the first-named place furnishes.
   Origen also (iv. 324 bis, 329 bis, 351) repeatedly gives the place as
   Tischendorf gives it--but on one occasion, which it will be observed is
   fatal to his evidence (i. 768), he gives the second member thus,--iv.
   353: kai` proseu'chesthe upe`r ton epereazo'nton umas. .^.. 1. 4. Next
   observe how Clemens Al. (605) handles the same place:-- agapate tou`s
   echthrou`s umon, eulogeite tou`s katarome'nous umas, kai`
   proseu'chesthe upe`r ton epereazo'nton umin, kai ta homoia .^.. 1, 2,
   4.--3, 5. Justin M. (i. 40) quoting the same place from memory (and
   with exceeding licence), yet is observed to recognize in part both the
   clauses which labour under suspicion: .^.. 1, 2, 4.--3, 5. euchesthe
   huper ton echthron humon kai agapate tou`s umas, which roughly
   represents kai eulogeite tou`s katarome'nous umin, kai` euchesthe upe`r
   ton epereazo'nton umas. The clause which hitherto lacks support is that
   which regards tous misountas umas. But the required help is supplied by
   Irenaeus (i. 521), who (loosely enough) quotes the place thus,--
   Diligite inimicos vestros, et orate pro eis, qui vos oderunt. .^..
   (made up of 3, 4).--2, 5. And yet more by the most venerable witness of
   all, Polycarp, who writes:--ad Philipp. c. 12:-- Orate pro
   persequentibus et odientibus vos. .^.. 4, 5.--1, 2, 3. I have examined

   Hilary, 297. Cyril Al. twice (i. 270: 807) quotes the place thus,-- eu
   poieite tous echthrous humon, kai proseuchesthe huper ton epereazonton

CHAPTER XI.

  CAUSES OF CORRUPTION CHIEFLY INTENTIONAL.

  V. TRANSPOSITION, VI. SUBSTITUTION,
  AND VII. ADDITION.

  § 1.

   ONE of the most prolific sources of Corrupt Readings, is Transposition,
   or the arbitrary inversion of the order of the sacred words,--generally
   in the subordinate clauses of a sentence. The extent to which this
   prevails in Codexes of the type of B'CD passes belief. It is not merely
   the occasional writing of tauta panta for panta tauta,--or ho laos
   houtos for houtos ho laos, to which allusion is now made: for if that
   were all, the phenomenon would admit of loyal explanation and excuse.
   But what I speak of is a systematic putting to wrong of the inspired
   words throughout the entire Codex; an operation which was evidently
   regarded in certain quarters as a lawful exercise of critical
   ingenuity,--perhaps was looked upon as an elegant expedient to be
   adopted for improving the style of the original without materially
   interfering with the sense.

   Let me before going further lay before the reader a few specimens of
   Transposition.

   Take for example St. Mark i. 5,--kai` ebapti'zonto pa'ntes,--is
   unreasonably turned into pa'ntes kai ebapti'zonto; whereby the meaning
   of the Evangelical record becomes changed, for pa'ntes is now made to
   agree with Hierosolumitai, and the Evangelist is represented as making
   the very strong assertion that all the people of Jerusalem came to St.
   John and were baptized. This is the private property of BDLD.

   And sometimes I find short clauses added which I prefer to ascribe to
   the misplaced critical assiduity of ancient Critics. Confessedly
   spurious, these accretions to the genuine text often bear traces of
   pious intelligence, and occasionally of considerable ability. I do not
   suppose that they crept in' from the margin: but that they were
   inserted by men who entirely failed to realize the wrongness of what
   they did,--the mischievous consequences which might possibly ensue from
   their well-meant endeavours to improve the work of the Holy Ghost.

   [Take again St. Mark ii. 3, in which the order in pro`s auto`n,
   paralutiko`n phe'rontes,--is changed by 'BL into phe'rontes pro`s
   auto`n paralutiko'n. A few words are needed to explain to those who
   have not carefully examined the passage the effect of this apparently
   slight alteration. Our Lord was in a house at Capernaum with a thick
   crowd of people around Him: there was no room even at the door. Whilst
   He was there teaching, a company of people come to Him (e'rchontai
   pro`s auto`n), four of the party carrying a paralytic on a bed. When
   they arrive at the house, a few of the company, enough to represent the
   whole, force their way in and reach Him: but on looking back they see
   that the rest are unable to bring the paralytic near to Him
   (prosengisai auto [337] ). Upon which they all go out and uncover the
   roof, take up the sick man on his bed, and the rest of the familiar
   story unfolds itself. Some officious scribe wished to remove all
   antiquity arising from the separation of paralutikon from airomenon
   which agrees with it, and transposed pherontes to the verb it is
   attached to, thus clumsily excluding the exquisite hint, clear enough
   to those who can read between the lines, that in the ineffectual
   attempt to bring in the paralytic only some of the company reached our
   Lord's Presence. Of course the scribe in question found followers in
   'BL.]

   It will be seen therefore that some cases of transposition are of a
   kind which is without excuse and inadmissible. Such transposition
   consists in drawing back a word which occurs further on, but is thus
   introduced into a new context, and gives a new sense. It seems to be
   assumed that since the words are all there, so long as they be
   preserved, their exact collocation is of no moment. Transpositions of
   that kind, to speak plainly, are important only as affording conclusive
   proof that such copies as B'D preserve a text which has undergone a
   sort of critical treatment which is so obviously indefensible that the
   Codexes themselves, however interesting as monuments of a primitive
   age,--however valuable commercially and to be prized by learned and
   unlearned alike for their unique importance,--are yet to be prized
   chiefly as beacon-lights preserved by a watchful Providence to warn
   every voyaging bark against making shipwreck on a shore already strewn
   with wrecks [338] .

   Transposition may sometimes be as conveniently illustrated in English
   as in Greek. St. Luke relates (Acts ii. 45, 46) that the first
   believers sold their goods and parted them to all men, as every man had
   need. And they, continuing daily,' &c. For this, Cod. D reads, and
   parted them daily to all men as every man had need. And they continued
   in the temple.'

  § 2.

   It is difficult to divine for what possible reason most of these
   transpositions were made. On countless occasions they do not in the
   least affect the sense. Often, they are incapable of being
   idiomatically represented, in English. Generally speaking, they are of
   no manner of importance, except as tokens of the licence which was
   claimed by disciples, as I suspect, of the Alexandrian school [or
   exercised unintentionally by careless or ignorant Western copyists].
   But there arise occasions when we cannot afford to be so trifled with.
   An important change in the meaning of a sentence is sometimes effected
   by transposing its clauses; and on one occasion, as I venture to think,
   the prophetic intention of the Speaker is obscured in consequence. I
   allude to St. Luke xiii. 9, where under the figure of a barren
   fig-tree, our Lord hints at what is to befall the Jewish people,
   because in the fourth year of His Ministry it remained unfruitful. Lo,
   these three years,' (saith He to the dresser of His Vineyard), come I
   seeking fruit on this fig-tree, and find none; cut it down; why
   cumbereth it the ground?' Spare it for this year also,' (is the
   rejoinder), and if it bear fruit,--well: but if not, next year thou
   shalt cut it down.' But on the strength of 'BLT^w, some recent Critics
   would have us read,--And if it bear fruit next year,--well: but if not,
   thou shalt cut it down':--which clearly would add a year to the season
   of the probation of the Jewish race. The limit assigned in the genuine
   text is the fourth year: in the corrupt text of 'BLT^w, two bad
   Cursives, and the two chief Egyptian versions, this period becomes
   extended to the fifth.

   To reason about such transpositions of words, a wearisome proceeding at
   best, soon degenerates into the veriest trifling. Sometimes, the order
   of the words is really immaterial to the sense. Even when a different
   shade of meaning is the result of a different collocation, that will
   seem the better order to one man which seems not to be so to another.
   The best order of course is that which most accurately exhibits the
   Author's precise shade of meaning: but of this the Author is probably
   the only competent judge. On our side, an appeal to actual evidence is
   obviously the only resource: since in no other way can we reasonably
   expect to ascertain what was the order of the words in the original
   document. And surely such an appeal can be attended with only one
   result: viz. the unconditional rejection of the peculiar and often
   varying order advocated by the very few Codexes,--a cordial acceptance
   of the order exhibited by every document in the world besides.

   I will content myself with inviting attention to one or two samples of
   my meaning. It has been made a question whether St. Luke (xxiv. 7)
   wrote,--le'gon, Hoti dei to`n uio`n tou anthro'pou paradothenai as all
   the MSS. in the world but four, all the Versions, and all the available
   Fathers' [339] evidence from A.D. 150 downwards attest: or whether he
   wrote,--le'gon to`n uio`n tou anthro'pou o'ti dei paradothenai, as
   'BCL,--and those four documents only--would have us believe? [The point
   which first strikes a scholar is that there is in this reading a
   familiar classicism which is alien to the style of the Gospels, and
   which may be a symptom of an attempt on the part of some early critic
   who was seeking to bring them into agreement with ancient Greek
   models.] But surely also it is even obvious that the correspondence of
   those four Codexes in such a particular as this must needs be the
   result of their having derived the reading from one and the same
   original. On the contrary, the agreement of all the rest in a trifling
   matter of detail like the present can be accounted for in only one way,
   viz., by presuming that they also have all been derived through various
   lines of descent from a single document: but that document the
   autograph of the Evangelist. [For the great number and variety of them
   necessitates their having been derived through various lines of
   descent. Indeed, they must have the notes of number, variety, as well
   as continuity, and weight also.]

  § 3.

   On countless occasions doubtless, it is very difficult--perhaps
   impossible--to determine, apart from external evidence, which
   collocation of two or more words is the true one, whether e. g. echei
   zoen for instance or zoen echei [340] ,--ege'rthe euthe`os or euthe'os
   ege'rthe [341] ,--cholou's, tuphlou's--or tuphlou's, cholou's [342]
   ,--shall be preferred. The burden of proof rests evidently with
   innovators on Traditional use.

   Obvious at the same time is it to foresee that if a man sits down
   before the Gospel with the deliberate intention of improving the style
   of the Evangelists by transposing their words on an average of seven
   (B), eight ('), or twelve (D) times in every page, he is safe to
   convict himself of folly in repeated instances, long before he has
   reached the end of his task. Thus, when the scribe of ', in place of
   exousi'an e'doken auto kai kri'sin poiein [343] , presents us with kai
   kri'sin e'doken auto exousi'an poiein, we hesitate not to say that he
   has written nonsense [344] . And when BD instead of eisi tines ton hode
   esteko'ton exhibit eisi tines hode ton esteko'ton, we cannot but
   conclude that the credit of those two MSS. must be so far lowered in
   the eyes of every one who with true appreciation of the niceties of
   Greek scholarship observes what has been done.

   [This characteristic of the old uncials is now commended to the
   attention of students, who will find in the folios of those documents
   plenty of instances for examination. Most of the cases of Transposition
   are petty enough, whilst some, as the specimens already presented to
   the reader indicate, constitute blots not favourable to the general
   reputation of the copies on which they are found. Indeed, they are so
   frequent that they have grown to be a very habit, and must have
   propagated themselves. For it is in this secondary character rather
   than in any first intention, so to speak, that Transpositions, together
   with Omissions and Substitutions and Additions, have become to some
   extent independent causes of corruption. Originally produced by other
   forces, they have acquired a power of extension in themselves.

   It is hoped that the passages already quoted may be found sufficient to
   exhibit the character of the large class of instances in which the pure
   Text of the original Autographs has been corrupted by Transposition.
   That it has been so corrupted, is proved by the evidence which is
   generally overpowering in each case. There has clearly been much
   intentional perversion: carelessness also and ignorance of Greek
   combined with inveterate inaccuracy, characteristics especially of
   Western corruption as may be seen in Codex D and the Old Latin
   versions, must have had their due share in the evil work. The result
   has been found in constant slurs upon the sacred pages, lessening the
   beauty and often perverting the sense,--a source of sorrow to the keen
   scholar and reverent Christian, and reiterated indignity done in
   wantonness or heedlessness to the pure and easy flow of the Holy
   Books.]

  CAUSES OF CORRUPTION CHIEFLY INTENTIONAL.

  VI. SUBSTITUTION.

  § 4.

   [ALL the Corruption in the Sacred Text may be classed under four heads,
   viz. Omission, Transposition, Substitution, and Addition. We are
   entirely aware that, in the arrangement adopted in this Volume for
   purposes of convenience, Scientific Method has been neglected. The
   inevitable result must be that passages are capable of being classed
   under more heads than one. But Logical exactness is of less practical
   value than a complete and suitable treatment of the corrupted passages
   that actually occur in the four Gospels.

   It seems therefore needless to supply with a scrupulousness that might
   bore our readers a disquisition upon Substitution which has not forced
   itself into a place amongst Dean Burgon's papers, although it is found
   in a fragmentary plan of this part of the treatise. Substituted forms
   or words or phrases, such as OC (hos) for th?c? (Theos) [345] heporei
   for epoiei (St. Mark vi. 20), or euk oidate dokimazein for dokimazete
   (St. Luke xii. 56), have their own special causes of substitution, and
   are naturally and best considered under the cause which in each case
   gave them birth.

   Yet the class of Substitutions is a large one, if Modifications, as
   they well may be, are added to it [346] . It will be readily concluded
   that some substitutions are serious, some of less importance, and many
   trivial. Of the more important class, the reading of hamartematos for
   kriseos (St. Mark iii. 29) which the Revisers have adopted in
   compliance with 'BLD and three Cursives, is a specimen. It is true that
   D reads hamartias supported by the first corrector of C, and three of
   the Ferrar group (13, 69, 346) and that the change adopted is supported
   by the Old Latin versions except f, the Vulgate, Bohairic, Armenian,
   Gothic, Lewis, and Saxon. But the opposition which favours kriseos is
   made up of A, C under the first reading and the second correction, PhS
   and eleven other Uncials, the great bulk of the Cursives, f, Peshitto,
   and Harkleian, and is superior in strength. The internal evidence is
   also in favour of the Traditional reading, both as regards the usage of
   e'nocho's, and the natural meaning given by kriseos. Hamarte'matos has
   clearly crept in from ver. 28. Other instances of Substitution may be
   found in the well-known St. Luke xxiii. 45 (tou eli'ou eklipo'ntos),
   St. Matt. xi. 27 (bou'letai apokalu'psai), St. Matt. xxvii. 34 (oinon
   for oxos), St. Mark i. 2 (Esai'a for tois prophetais), St. John i. 18
   (ho Monogenes Theos being a substitution made by heretics for ho
   Monogenes Huios), St. Mark vii. 31 (dia` Sidonos for kai Sidonos).
   These instances may perhaps suffice: many more may suggest themselves
   to intelligent readers. Though most are trivial, their cumulative force
   is extremely formidable. Many of these changes arose from various
   causes which are described in many other places in this book.]

CHAPTER XI (continued).

  CAUSES OF CORRUPTION CHIEFLY INTENTIONAL.

  VII. ADDITION.

  § 5.

   [THE smallest of the four Classes, which upon a pure survey of the
   outward form divide among themselves the surface of the entire field of
   Corruption, is that of Additions [347] . And the reason of their
   smallness of number is discoverable at once. Whilst it is but too easy
   for scribes or those who have a love of criticism to omit words and
   passages under all circumstances, or even to vary the order, or to use
   another word or form instead of the right one, to insert anything into
   the sacred Text which does not proclaim too glaringly its own
   unfitness--in a word, to invent happily--is plainly a matter of much
   greater difficulty. Therefore to increase the Class of Insertions or
   Additions or Interpolations, so that it should exceed the Class of
   Omissions, is to go counter to the natural action of human forces.
   There is no difficulty in leaving out large numbers of the Sacred
   Words: but there is much difficulty in placing in the midst of them
   human words, possessed of such a character and clothed in such an
   uniform, as not to betray to keen observation their earthly origin.

   A few examples will set this truth in clearer light. It is remarkable
   that efforts at interpolation occur most copiously amongst the books of
   those who are least fitted to make them. We naturally look amongst the
   representatives of the Western school where Greek was less understood
   than in the East where Greek acumen was imperfectly represented by
   Latin activity, and where translation into Latin and retranslation into
   Greek was a prolific cause of corruption. Take then the following
   passage from the Codex D (St. Luke vi. 4):--

   On the same day He beheld a certain man working on the sabbath, and
   said to him, "Man, blessed art thou if thou knowest what thou doest;
   but if thou knowest not, thou art cursed and a transgressor of the
   law."'

   And another from the Curetonian Syriac (St. Matt. xx. 28), which occurs
   under a worse form in D.

   But seek ye from little to become greater, and not from greater to
   become less. When ye are invited to supper in a house, sit not down in
   the best place, lest some one come who is more honourable than thou,
   and the lord of the supper say to thee, "Go down below," and thou be
   ashamed in the presence of them that have sat down. But if thou sit
   down in the lower place, and one who is inferior to thee come in, the
   lord also of the supper will say to thee, "Come near, and come up, and
   sit down," and thou shalt have greater honour in the presence of them
   that have sat down.'

   Who does not see that there is in these two passages no real ring of
   genuineness'?

   Take next some instances of lesser insertions.]

  § 6.

   Conspicuous beyond all things in the Centurion of Capernaum (St. Matt.
   viii. 13) was his faith. It occasioned wonder even in the Son of Man.
   Do we not, in the significant statement, that when they who had been
   sent returned to the house, they found the servant whole that had been
   sick [348] ,' recognize by implication the assurance that the
   Centurion, because he needed no such confirmation of his belief, went
   not with them; but enjoyed the twofold blessedness of remaining with
   Christ, and of believing without seeing? I think so. Be this however as
   it may, 'CEMUX besides about fifty cursives, append to St. Matt. viii.
   13 the clearly apocryphal statement, And the Centurion returning to his
   house in that same hour found the servant whole.' It does not improve
   the matter to find that Eusebius [349] , besides the Harkleian and the
   Ethiopic versions, recognize the same appendix. We are thankful, that
   no one yet has been found to advocate the adoption of this patent
   accretion to the inspired text. Its origin is not far to seek. I
   presume it was inserted in order to give a kind of finish to the story
   [350] .

   [Another and that a most remarkable Addition may be found in St. Matt.
   xxiv. 36, into which the words oude` o Uio's, neither the Son' have
   been transferred from St. Mark xiii. 32 in compliance with a wholly
   insufficient body of authorities [351] . Lachmann was the leader in
   this proceeding, and he has been followed by Tischendorf, Westcott and
   Hort, and the Revisers. The latter body add in their margin, Many
   authorities, some ancient, omit neither the Son.' How inadequate to the
   facts of the case this description is, will be seen when the
   authorities are enumerated. But first of those who have been regarded
   by the majority of the Revisers as the disposers of their decision,
   according to the information supplied by Tischendorf.

   They are (a) of Uncials ' (in the first reading and as re-corrected in
   the seventh century) BD; (b) five Cursives (for a present of 346 may be
   freely made to Tischendorf); (c) ten Old Latin copies also the Aureus
   (Words.), some of the Vulgate (four according to Wordsworth), the
   Palestinian, Ethiopic, Armenian; (d) Origen (Lat. iii. 874), Hilary
   (733^a), Cyril Alex. (Mai Nova Pp. Bibliotheca, 481), Ambrose (i.
   I47^8f). But Irenaeus (Lat. i. 386), Cyril (Zach. 800), Chrysostom (ad
   locum) seem to quote from St. Mark. So too, as Tischendorf admits,
   Amphilochius.

   On the other hand we have, (a) the chief corrector of ' (c^a) PhS with
   thirteen other Uncials and the Greek MSS. of Adamantius and Pierius
   mentioned by Jerome [352] ; (b) all the Cursives, as far as is known
   (except the aforenamed); (c) the Vulgate, with the Peshitto, Harkleian,
   Lewis, Bohairic, and the Sahidic; (d) Jerome (in the place just now
   quoted), St. Basil who contrasts the text of St. Matthew with that of
   St. Mark, Didymus, who is also express in declaring that the three
   words in dispute are not found in St. Matthew (Trip., 195), St. John
   Damascene (ii. 346), Apollonius Philosophus (Galland. ix. 247),
   Euthymius Zigabenus (in loc.), Paulinus (iii. 12), St. Ambrose (ii.
   656^a), and Anastasius Sinaita (Migne, lxxxix. 941).

   Theophylact (i. 133), Hesychius Presb. (Migne, lxiii. 142) Eusebius
   (Galland. ix. 580), Facundus Herm. (Galland. xi. 782), Athanasius (ii.
   660), quote the words as from the Gospel without reference, and may
   therefore refer to St. Mark. Phoebadius (Galland. v. 251), though
   quoted against the Addition by Tischendorf, is doubtful.

   On which side the balance of evidence inclines, our readers will judge.
   But at least they cannot surely justify the assertion made by the
   majority of the Revisers, that the Addition is opposed only by many
   authorities, some ancient,' or at any rate that this is a fair and
   adequate description of the evidence opposed to their decision.

   An instance occurs in St. Mark iii. 16 which illustrates the
   carelessness and tastelessness of the handful of authorities to which
   it pleases many critics to attribute ruling authority. In the
   fourteenth verse, it had been already stated that our Lord ordained
   twelve,' kai` epoi'ese do'deka; but because 'BA and C (which was
   corrected in the ninth century with a MS. of the Ethiopic) reiterate
   these words two verses further on, Tischendorf with Westcott and Hort
   assume that it is necessary to repeat what has been so recently told.
   Meanwhile eighteen other uncials (including APhS and the third hand of
   C); nearly all the Cursives; the Old Latin, Vulgate, Peshitto, Lewis,
   Harkleian, Gothic, Armenian, and the other MSS. of the Ethiopic omit
   them. It is plainly unnecessary to strengthen such an opposition by
   researches in the pages of the Fathers.

   Explanation has been already given, how the introductions to Lections,
   and other Liturgical formulae, have been added by insertion to. the
   Text in various places. Thus ho Iesous has often been inserted, and in
   some places remains wrongly (in the opinion of Dean Burgon) in the
   pages of the Received Text. The three most important additions to the
   Received Text occur, as Dean Burgon thought, in St. Matt. vi. 18, where
   en to phanero has crept in from v. 6 against the testimony of a large
   majority both of Uncial and of Cursive MSS.: in St. Matt. xxv. 13,
   where the clause en he o uio`s tou anthro'oou e'rchetai seemed to him
   to be condemned by a superior weight of authority: and in St. Matt.
   xxvii. 35, where the quotation ( i'na plerothe . . . e`balon kleron)
   must be taken for similar reasons to have been originally a gloss.]

   by only B, and five cursives,--but having no other effect, if it should
   chance to be inserted, than to mar and obscure the Divine utterance.
   For when our Saviour declares Not even in Israel have I found so great
   faith,' He is clearly contrasting this proficiency of an earnest
   Gentile against whatever of a like nature lie had experienced in His
   dealing with the Jewish people; and declaring the result. He is
   contrasting Jacob's descendants, the heirs of so many lofty privileges,
   with this Gentile soldier: their spiritual attainments with his; and
   assigning the palm to him. Substitute With no one in Israel have I
   found so great faith,' and the contrast disappears. Nothing else is
   predicated but a greater measure of faith in one man than in any other.
   The author of this feeble attempt to improve upon St. Matthew's Gospel
   is found to have also tried his hand on the parallel place in St. Luke,
   but with even inferior success: for there his misdirected efforts
   survive only in certain copies of the Old Latin. Ambrose notices his
   officiousness, remarking that it yields an intelligible sense; but
   that, juxta Graecos,' the place is to be read differently (i. 1376.).
   It is notorious that a few copies of the Old Latin (Augustine once (iv.
   322), though he quotes the place nearly twenty times in the usual way.)
   and the Egyptian versions exhibit the same depravation. Cyril
   habitually employed an Evangelium which was disfigured in the same way
   (iii. 833, also Opp. v. 544, ed. Pusey.). But are we out of such
   materials as these to set about reconstructing the text of Scripture?

   [351] This disquisition is made up in part from the Dean's materials.

CHAPTER XII.

  CAUSES OF CORRUPTION CHIEFLY INTENTIONAL.

  VIII. GLOSSES.

  § 1.

   GLOSSES,' properly so called, though they enjoy a conspicuous place in
   every enumeration like the present, are probably by no means so
   numerous as is commonly supposed. For certainly every unauthorized
   accretion to the text of Scripture is not a gloss': but only those
   explanatory words or clauses which have surreptitiously insinuated
   themselves into the text, and of which no more reasonable account can
   be rendered than that they were probably in the first instance proposed
   by some ancient Critic in the way of useful comment, or necessary
   explanation, or lawful expansion, or reasonable limitation of the
   actual utterance of the Spirit. Thus I do not call the clause nekrou`s
   egei'rete in St. Matt. x. 8 a gloss.' It is a gratuitous and
   unwarrantable interpolation,--nothing else but a clumsy encumbrance of
   the text [353] .

   [Glosses, or scholia, or comments, or interpretations, are of various
   kinds, but are generally confined to Additions or Substitutions, since
   of course we do not omit in order to explain, and transposition of
   words already placed in lucid order, such as the sacred Text may be
   reasonably supposed to have observed, would confuse rather than
   illustrate the meaning. A clause, added in Hebrew fashion [354] , which
   may perhaps appear to modern taste to be hardly wanted, must not
   therefore be taken to be a gloss.]

   Sometimes a various reading' is nothing else but a gratuitous
   gloss;--the unauthorized substitution of a common for an uncommon word.
   This phenomenon is of frequent occurrence, but only in Codexes of a
   remarkable type like B'CD. A few instances follow:--

   1. The disciples on a certain occasion (St. Matt. xiii. 36), requested
   our LORD to explain' to them (PhRACON hemin, they said') the parable of
   the tares. So every known copy, except two: so, all the Fathers who
   quote the place,--viz. Origen, five times [355] ,--Basil [356] ,--J.
   Damascene [357] . And so all the Versions [358] . But because B-',
   instead of phrason, exhibit DIACAPhECON (make clear to us'),--which is
   also once the reading of Origen [359] , who was but too well acquainted
   with Codexes of the same depraved character as the archetype of B and
   ',--Lachmann, Tregelles (not Tischendorf), Westcott and Hort, and the
   Revisers of 1881, assume that diasapheson (a palpable gloss) stood in
   the inspired autograph of the Evangelist. They therefore thrust out
   phrason and thrust in diasapheson. I am wholly unable to discern any
   connexion between the premisses of these critics and their conclusions
   [360] .

   2. Take another instance. Pugme,--the obscure expression (D leaves it
   out) which St. Mark employs in vii. 3 to denote the strenuous frequency
   of the Pharisees' ceremonial washings,--is exchanged by Cod. ', but by
   no other known copy of the Gospels, for pukna, which last word is of
   course nothing else but a sorry gloss. Yet Tischendorf degrades pugme
   and promotes pukna to honour,--happily standing alone in his
   infatuation. Strange, that the most industrious of modern accumulators
   of evidence should not have been aware that by such extravagances he
   marred his pretension to critical discernment! Origen and
   Epiphanius--the only Fathers who quote the place--both read pugme. It
   ought to be universally admitted that it is a mere waste of time that
   we should argue out a point like this [361] .

  § 2.

   A gloss little suspected, which--not without a pang of regret--I
   proceed to submit to hostile scrutiny, is the expression daily' (kath'
   eme'ran) in St. Luke ix. 23. Found in the Peshitto and in Cureton's
   Syriac,--but only in some Copies of the Harkleian version [362] : found
   in most Copies of the Vulgate,--but largely disallowed by copies of the
   Old Latin [363] : found also in Ephraem Syrus [364] ,--but clearly not
   recognized by Origen [365] : found again in 'AB and six other
   uncials,--but not found in CDE and ten others: the expression referred
   to cannot, at all events, plead for its own retention in the text
   higher antiquity than can be pleaded for its exclusion. Cyril, (if in
   such a matter the Syriac translation of his Commentary on St. Luke may
   be trusted,) is clearly an authority for reading kath' eme'ran in St.
   Luke ix. 23 [366] ; but then he elsewhere twice quotes St. Luke ix. 23
   in Greek without it [367] . Timotheus of Antioch, of the fifth century,
   omits the phrase [368] . Jerome again, although he suffered quotidie'
   to stand in the Vulgate, yet, when for his own purposes he quotes the
   place in St. Luke [369] ,--ignores the word. All this is calculated to
   inspire grave distrust. On the other hand, kath' eme'ran enjoys the
   support of the two Egyptian Versions,--of the Gothic,--of the
   Armenian,--of the Ethiopic. And this, in the present state of our
   knowledge, must be allowed to be a weighty piece of evidence in its
   favour.

   But the case assumes an entirely different aspect the instant it is
   discovered that out of the cursive copies only eight are found to
   contain kath' eme'ran in St. Luke ix. 23 [370] . How is it to be
   explained that nine manuscripts out of every ten in existence should
   have forgotten how to transmit such a remarkable message, had it ever
   been really so committed to writing by the Evangelist? The omission
   (says Tischendorf) is explained by the parallel places [371] . Utterly
   incredible, I reply; as no one ought to have known better than
   Tischendorf himself. We now scrutinize the problem more closely; and
   discover that the very locus of the phrase is a matter of uncertainty.
   Cyril once makes it part of St. Matt. x. 38 [372] . Chrysostom twice
   connects it with St. Matt. xvi. 24 [373] . Jerome, evidently regarding
   the phrase as a curiosity, informs us that juxta antiqua exemplaria' it
   was met with in St. Luke xiv. 27 [374] . All this is in a high degree
   unsatisfactory. We suspect that we ourselves enjoy some slight
   familiarity with the antiqua exemplaria' referred to by the Critic; and
   we freely avow that we have learned to reckon them among the least
   reputable of our acquaintance. Are they not represented by those
   Evangelia, of which several copies are extant, that profess to have
   been transcribed from, and collated with, ancient copies at Jerusalem'?
   These uniformly exhibit kath' eme'ran in St. Luke ix. 23 [375] . But
   then, if the phrase be a gloss,--it is obvious to inquire,--how is its
   existence in so many quarters to be accounted for?

   Its origin is not far to seek. Chrysostom, in a certain place, after
   quoting our Lord's saying about taking up the cross and following Him,
   remarks that the words do not mean that we are actually to bear the
   wood upon our shoulders, but to keep the prospect of death steadily
   before us, and like St. Paul to "die daily" [376] .' The same Father,
   in the two other places already quoted from his writings, is observed
   similarly to connect the Saviour's mention of bearing the Cross' with
   the Apostle's announcement--I die daily.' Add, that Ephraem Syrus [377]
   , and Jerome quoted already,--persistently connect the same two places
   together; the last named Father even citing them in immediate
   succession;--and the inference is unavoidable. The phrase in St. Luke
   ix. 23 must needs be a very ancient as well as very interesting
   expository gloss, imported into the Gospel from 1 Cor. xv. 31,--as Mill
   [378] and Matthaei [379] long since suggested.

   Sincerely regretting the necessity of parting with an expression with
   which one has been so long familiar, we cannot suffer the sentimental
   plea to weigh with us when the Truth of the Gospel is at stake. Certain
   it is that but for Erasmus, we should never have known the regret: for
   it was he that introduced kath' eme'ran into the Received Text. The MS.
   from which he printed is without the expression: which is also not
   found in the Complutensian. It is certainly a spurious accretion to the
   inspired Text.

   [The attention of the reader is particularly invited to this last
   paragraph. The learned Dean has been sneered at for a supposed
   sentimental and effeminate attachment to the Textus Receptus. He was
   always ready to reject words and phrases, which have not adequate
   support; but he denied the validity of the evidence brought against
   many texts by the school of Westcott and Hort, and therefore he refused
   to follow them in their surrender of the passages.]

  § 3.

   Indeed, a great many various readings,' so called, are nothing else but
   very ancient interpretations,--fabricated readings therefore,--of which
   the value may be estimated by the fact that almost every trace of them
   has long since disappeared. Such is the substitution of pheugei for
   anecho'resen in St. John vi. 15;--which, by the way, Tischendorf
   thrusts into his text on the sole authority of ', some Latin copies
   including the Vulgate, and Cureton's Syriac [380] : though Tregelles
   ignores its very existence. That our Lord's withdrawal' to the mountain
   on that occasion was of the nature of flight,' or retreat' is obvious.
   Hence Chrysostom and Cyril remark that He fled to the mountain.' And
   yet both Fathers (like Origen and Epiphanius before them) are found to
   have read anecho'resen.

   Almost as reasonably in the beginning of the same verse might
   Tischendorf (with ') have substituted anadeiknunai for i'na poie'sosin
   auto`n, on the plea that Cyril [381] says, zetein auton anadeixai kai
   basile'a. We may on no account suffer ourselves to be imposed upon by
   such shallow pretences for tampering with the text of Scripture: or the
   deposit will never be safe. A patent gloss,--rather an
   interpretation,--acquires no claim to be regarded as the genuine
   utterance of the Holy Spirit by being merely found in two or three
   ancient documents. It is the little handful of documents which loses in
   reputation,--not the reading which gains in authority on such
   occasions.

   In this way we are sometimes presented with what in effect are new
   incidents. These are not unfrequently discovered to be introduced in
   defiance of the reason of the case; as where (St. John xiii. 24) Simon
   Peter is represented (in the Vulgate) as actually saying to St. John,
   Who is it concerning whom He speaks?' Other copies of the Latin
   exhibit, Ask Him who it is,' &c.: while 'BC (for on such occasions we
   are treated to any amount of apocryphal matter) would persuade us that
   St. Peter only required that the information should be furnished him by
   St. John--Say who it is of whom He speaks.' Sometimes a very little
   licence is sufficient to convert the oratio obliqua into the recta.
   Thus, by the change of a single letter (in 'BX) Mary Magdalene is made
   to say to the disciples I have seen the Lord' (St. John xx. 18). But
   then, as might have been anticipated, the new does not altogether agree
   with the old. Accordingly D and others paraphrase the remainder of the
   sentence thus,--and she signified to them what He had said unto her.'
   How obvious is it to foresee that on such occasions the spirit of
   officiousness never know when to stop! In the Vulgate and Sahidic
   versions the sentence proceeds, and He told these things unto me.'

   Take another example. The Hebraism meta` sa'lpingos phones mega'les
   (St. Matt. xxiv. 31) presents an uncongenial ambiguity to Western
   readers, as our own incorrect A.V. sufficiently shows. Two methods of
   escape from the difficulty suggested themselves to the ancients:--(a)
   Since a trumpet of great sound' means nothing else but a loud trumpet,'
   and since this can be as well expressed by sa'lpingos mega'les, the
   scribes at a very remote period are found to have omitted the word
   phones. The Peshitto and Lewis (interpreting rather than translating)
   so deal with the text. Accordingly, phones is not found in 'LD and five
   cursives. Eusebius [382] , Cyril Jerus. [383] , Chrysostom [384] ,
   Theodoret [385] , and even Cyprian [386] are also without the word. (b)
   A less violent expedient was to interpolate kai before phones. This is
   accordingly the reading of the best Italic copies, of the Vulgate, and
   of D. So Hilary [387] and Jerome [388] , Severianus [389] , Asterius
   [390] , ps.-Caesarius [391] , Damascene [392] and at least eleven
   cursive copies, so read the place.--There can be no doubt at all that
   the commonly received text is right. It is found in thirteen uncials
   with B at their head: in Cosmas [393] , Hesychius [394] , Theophylact
   [395] . But the decisive consideration is that the great body of the
   cursives have faithfully retained the uncongenial Hebraism, and
   accordingly imply the transmission of it all down the ages: a
   phenomenon which will not escape the unprejudiced reader. Neither will
   he overlook the fact that the three old uncials' (for A and C are not
   available here) advocate as many different readings: the two wrong
   readings being respectively countenanced by our two most ancient
   authorities, viz. the Peshitto version and the Italic. It only remains
   to point out that Tischendorf blinded by his partiality for ' contends
   here for the mutilated text, and Westcott and Hort are disposed to do
   the same.

  § 4.

   Recent Editors are agreed that we are henceforth to read in St. John
   xviii. 14 apo4anein instead of apole'sthai:--Now Caiaphas was he who
   counselled the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die'
   (instead of perish') for the people.' There is certainly a considerable
   amount of ancient testimony in favour of this reading: for besides 'BC,
   it is found in the Old Latin copies, the Egyptian, and Peshitto
   versions, besides the Lewis MS., the Chronicon, Cyril, Nonnus,
   Chrysostom. Yet may it be regarded as certain that St. John wrote
   apolesthai in this place. The proper proof of the statement is the
   consentient voice of all the copies,--except about nineteen of loose
   character:--we know their vagaries but too well, and decline to let
   them impose upon us. In real fact, nothing else is apothanein but a
   critical assimilation of St. John xviii. 14 to xi. 50,--somewhat as
   die' in our A.V. has been retained by King James' translators, though
   they certainly had lesthai before them.

   Many of these glosses are rank, patent, palpable. Such is the
   substitution (St. Mark vi. 11) of o`s a`n to'pos me` de'xetai umas by
   'BLD for o`soi a`n me` de'xontai umas,--which latter is the reading of
   the Old Latin and Peshitto, as well as of the whole body of uncials and
   cursives alike. Some Critic evidently considered that the words which
   follow, when you go out thence,' imply that place, not persons, should
   have gone before. Accordingly, he substituted whatsoever place' for
   whosoever [396] ': another has bequeathed to us in four uncial MSS. a
   lasting record of his rashness and incompetency. Since however he left
   behind the words mede` akou'sosin umon, which immediately follow, who
   sees not that the fabricator has betrayed himself? I am astonished that
   so patent a fraud should have imposed upon Tischendorf, and Tregelles,
   and Lachmann, and Alford, and Westcott and Hort. But in fact it does
   not stand alone. From the same copies 'BLD (with two others, CD) we
   find the woe denounced in the same verse on the unbelieving city erased
   (ame`n le'go umi?n, anektoteron e'stai Sodo'mois e' Gomo'rrois en
   heme'ra kri'seos, e' te po'lei ekei'ne). Quite idle is it to pretend
   (with Tischendorf) that these words are an importation from the
   parallel place in St. Matthew. A memorable note of diversity has been
   set on the two places, which in all the copies is religiously
   maintained, viz. Sodo'mois e' Gomo'rrois, in St. Mark: ge Sodo'mon kai
   Gomo'rron, in St. Matt. It is simply incredible that this could have
   been done if the received text in this place had been of spurious
   origin.

  § 5.

   The word apechei in St. Mark xiv. 41 has proved a stumbling-block. The
   most obvious explanation is probably the truest. After a brief pause
   [397] , during which the Saviour has been content to survey in silence
   His sleeping disciples;--or perhaps, after telling them that they will
   have time and opportunity enough for sleep and rest when He shall have
   been taken from them;-- He announces the arrival of the hour,' by
   exclaiming, Apechei,--It is enough;' or, It is sufficient;' i.e. The
   season for repose is over.

   But the Revisers' of the second century did not perceive that apechei
   is here used impersonally [398] . They understood the word to mean is
   fully come'; and supplied the supposed nominative, viz. to telos [399]
   . Other critics who rightly understood apechei to signify sufficit,'
   still subjoined finis.' The Old Latin and the Syriac versions must have
   been executed from Greek copies which exhibited,-- apechei to telos.
   This is abundantly proved by the renderings adest finis
   (f),--consummatus est finis (a); from which the change to apechei to
   telos KAI he hora (the reading of D) was obvious: sufficit finis et
   hora (d q); adest enim consummatio; et (ff^2 venit) hora (c); or, (as
   the Peshitto more fully gives it), appropinquavit finis, et venit hora
   [400] . Jerome put this matter straight by simply writing sufficit. But
   it is a suggestive circumstance, and an interesting proof how largely
   the reading apechei to telos must once have prevailed, that it is
   frequently met with in cursive copies of the Gospels to this hour [401]
   . Happily it is an old reading' which finds no favour at the present
   day. It need not therefore occupy us any longer.

   As another instance of ancient Glosses introduced to help out the
   sense, the reading of St. John ix. 22 is confessedly i'na ea'n tis
   auto`n omologe'se Christo'n. So all the MSS. but one, and so the Old
   Latin. So indeed all the ancient versions except the Egyptian. Cod. D
   alone adds einai: but einai must once have been a familiar gloss: for
   Jerome retains it in the Vulgate: and indeed Cyril, whenever he quotes
   the place [402] , exhibits ton Christon einai. Not so however
   Chrysostom [403] and Gregory of Nyssa [404] .

  § 6.

   There is scarcely to be found, amid the incidents immediately preceding
   our Saviour's Passion, one more affecting or more exquisite than the
   anointing of His feet at Bethany by Mary the sister of Lazarus, which
   received its unexpected interpretation from the lips of Christ Himself.
   Let her alone. Against the day of My embalming hath she kept it.' (St.
   John xii. 7.) He assigns to her act a mysterious meaning of which the
   holy woman little dreamt. She had treasured up that precious unguent
   against the day,--(with the presentiment of true Love, she knew that it
   could not be very far distant),--when His dead limbs would require
   embalming. But lo, she beholds Him reclining at supper in her sister's
   house: and yielding to a Divine impulse she brings forth her reserved
   costly offering and bestows it on Him at once. Ah, she little
   knew,--she could not in fact have known,--that it was the only
   anointing those sacred feet were destined ever to enjoy! . . . . In the
   meantime through a desire, as I suspect, to bring this incident into an
   impossible harmony with what is recorded in St. Mark xvi. 1, with which
   obviously it has no manner of connexion, a scribe is found at some
   exceedingly remote period to have improved our Lord's expression into
   this:--Let her alone in order that against the day of My embalming she
   may keep it.' Such an exhibition of the Sacred Text is its own
   sufficient condemnation. What that critic exactly meant, I fail to
   discover: but I am sure he has spoilt what he did not understand: and
   though it is quite true that 'BD with five other Uncial MSS. and
   Nonnus, besides the Latin and Bohairic, Jerusalem, Armenian, and
   Ethiopic versions, besides four errant cursives so exhibit the place,
   this instead of commending the reading to our favour, only proves
   damaging to the witnesses by which it is upheld. We learn that no
   reliance is to be placed even in such a combination of authorities.
   This is one of the places which the Fathers pass by almost in silence.
   Chrysostom [405] however, and evidently Cyril Alex. [406] , as well as
   Ammonius [407] convey though roughly a better sense by quoting the
   verse with epoiese for tetereken. Antiochus [408] is express. [A and
   eleven other uncials, and the cursives (with the petty exception
   already noted), together with the Peshitto, Harkleian (which only notes
   the other reading in the margin), Lewis, Sahidic, and Gothic versions,
   form a body of authority against the palpable emasculation of the
   passage, which for number, variety, weight, and internal evidence is
   greatly superior to the opposing body. Also, with reference to
   continuity and antiquity it preponderates plainly, if not so
   decisively; and the context of D is full of blunders, besides that it
   omits the next verse, and B and ' are also inaccurate hereabouts [409]
   . So that the Traditional text enjoys in this passage the support of
   all the Notes of Truth.]

   In accordance with what has been said above, for Aphes aute'n; eis te`n
   eme'ran tou entaphiasmou mou tetere'ken auto' (St. John xii. 7), the
   copies which it has recently become the fashion to adore, read aphes
   aute'n i'na . . . tere'se auto'. This startling innovation,--which
   destroys the sense of our Saviour's words, and furnishes a sorry
   substitute which no one is able to explain [410] ,--is accepted by
   recent Editors and some Critics: yet is it clearly nothing else but a
   stupid correction of the text,--introduced by some one who did not
   understand the intention of the Divine Speaker. Our Saviour is here
   discovering to us an exquisite circumstance,--revealing what until now
   had been a profound and tender secret: viz. that Mary, convinced by
   many a sad token that the Day of His departure could not be very far
   distant, had some time before provided herself with this costly
   ointment, and kept it' by her,--intending to reserve it against the
   dark day when it would be needed for the embalming' of the lifeless
   body of her Lord. And now it wants only a week to Easter. She beholds
   Him (with Lazarus at His side) reclining in her sister's house at
   supper, amid circumstances of mystery which fill her soul with awful
   anticipation. She divines, with love's true instinct, that this may
   prove her only opportunity. Accordingly, she anticipates to anoint'
   (proe'labe muri'sai, St. Mark xiv. 8) His Body: and, yielding--to-an
   overwhelming impulse, bestows upon Him all her costly offering at once!
   . . . How does it happen that some professed critics have overlooked
   all this? Any one who has really studied the subject ought to know,
   from a mere survey of the evidence, on which side the truth in respect
   of the text of this passage must needs lie.

  § 7.

   Our Lord, in His great Eucharistic address to the eternal Father, thus
   speaks:--I have glorified Thee on the earth. I have perfected the work
   which Thou gavest Me to do' (St. John xvii. 4). Two things are stated:
   first, that the result of His Ministry had been the exhibition upon
   earth of the Father's glory [411] ': next, that the work which the
   Father had given the Son to do [412] was at last finished [413] . And
   that this is what St. John actually wrote is certain: not only because
   it is found in all the copies, except twelve of suspicious character
   (headed by 'ABCL); but because it is vouched for by the Peshitto [414]
   and the Latin, the Gothic and the Armenian versions [415] : besides a
   whole chorus of Fathers; viz. Hippolytus [416] , Didymus [417] ,
   Eusebius [418] , Athanasius [419] , Basil [420] , Chrysostom [421] ,
   Cyril [422] , ps.-Polycarp [423] , the interpolator of Ignatius [424] ,
   and the authors of the Apostolic Constitutions [425] : together with
   the following among the Latins:--Cyprian [426] , Ambrose [427] , Hilary
   [428] , Zeno [429] , Cassian [430] , Novatian [431] , certain Arians
   [432] , Augustine [433] .

   But the asyndeton (so characteristic of the fourth Gospel) proving
   uncongenial to certain of old time, D inserted kai. A more popular
   device was to substitute the participle (teleiosas) for eteleiosa:
   whereby our Lord is made to say that He had glorified His Father's Name
   by perfecting' or completing'--in that He had finished'--the work which
   the Father had given Him to do; which damages the sense by limiting it,
   and indeed introduces a new idea. A more patent gloss it would be hard
   to find. Yet has it been adopted as the genuine text by all the Editors
   and all the Critics. So general is the delusion in favour of any
   reading supported by the combined evidence of 'ABCL, that the Revisers
   here translate--I glorified Thee on the earth, having accomplished
   (teleiosas) the work which Thou hast given Me to do:' without so much
   as vouchsafing a hint to the English reader that they have altered the
   text.

   When some came with the message Thy daughter is dead: why troublest
   thou the Master further?' the Evangelist relates that Jesus as soon as
   He heard (eutheos akousas) what was being spoken, said to the ruler of
   the synagogue, Fear not: only believe.' (St. Mark v. 36.) For this,
   'BLD substitute disregarding (parakousas) what was being spoken': which
   is nothing else but a sorry gloss, disowned by every other copy,
   including ACD, and all the versions. Yet does parakousas find favour
   with Tischendorf, Tregelles, and others.

  § 8.

   In this way it happened that in the earliest age the construction of
   St. Luke i. 66 became misapprehended. Some Western scribe evidently
   imagined that the popular saying concerning John Baptist,--ti' a'ra to`
   paidi'on touto e'stai, extended further, and comprised the Evangelist's
   record,:--kai` chei`r Kuri'ou en met' autou. To support this strange
   view, kai' was altered into kai` ga`r, and esti was substituted for en.
   It is thus that the place stands in the Verona copy of the Old Latin
   (b). In other quarters the verb was omitted altogether: and that is how
   D, Evan. 59 with the Vercelli (a) and two other copies of the Old Latin
   exhibit the place. Augustine [434] is found to have read
   indifferently--manus enim Domini cum illo,' and cum illo est': but he
   insists that the combined clauses represent the popular utterance
   concerning the Baptist [435] . Unhappily, there survives a notable
   trace of the same misapprehension in '-BCL which, alone of MSS., read
   kai` ga`r . . . en [436] . The consequence might have been anticipated.
   All recent Editors adopt this reading, which however is clearly
   inadmissible. The received text, witnessed to by the Peshitto,
   Harkleian, and Armenian versions, is obviously correct. Accordingly, A
   and all the uncials not already named, together with the whole body of
   the cursives, so read the place. With fatal infelicity the Revisers
   exhibit For indeed the hand of the Lord was with him.' They clearly are
   to blame: for indeed the MS. evidence admits of no uncertainty. It is
   much to be regretted that not a single very ancient Greek Father (so
   far as I can discover) quotes the place.

  § 9.

   It seems to have been anciently felt, in connexion with the first
   miraculous draught of fishes, that St. Luke's statement (v. 7) that the
   ships were so full that they were sinking' (o'ste buthi'zesthai auta')
   requires some qualification. Accordingly C inserts ede (were just'
   sinking); and D, para ti (within a little'): while the Peshitto the
   Lewis and the Vulgate, as well as many copies of the Old Latin, exhibit
   ita ut pene.' These attempts to improve upon Scripture, and these
   paraphrases, indicate laudable zeal for the truthfulness of the
   Evangelist; but they betray an utterly mistaken view of the critic's
   office. The truth is, buthi'zesthai, as the Bohairic translators
   perceived and as most of us are aware, means were beginning to sink.'
   There is no need of further qualifying the expression by the insertion
   with Eusebius [437] of any additional word.

   I strongly suspect that the introduction of the name of Pyrrhus into
   Acts xx. 4 as the patronymic of Sopater of Beraea,' is to be accounted
   for in this way. A very early gloss it certainly is, for it appears in
   the Old Latin: yet, the Peshitto knows nothing of it, and the Harkleian
   rejects it from the text, though not from the margin. Origen and the
   Bohairic recognize it, but not Chrysostom nor the Ethiopic. I suspect
   that some foolish critic of the primitive age invented Purou (or
   Purrou) out of Beroiaios (or Berroiaios) which follows. The Latin form
   of this was Pyrus [438] ,' Pyrrhus,' or Pirrus [439] .' In the Sahidic
   version he is called the son of Berus' (huios Berou),--which confirms
   me in my conjecture. But indeed, if it was with some Beracan that the
   gloss originated,--and what more likely?--it becomes an interesting
   circumstance that the inhabitants of that part of Macedonia are known
   to have confused the p and b sounds [440] . . . . This entire matter is
   unimportant in itself, but the letter of Scripture cannot be too
   carefully guarded: and let me invite the reader to consider,--If St.
   Luke actually wrote Sopatros Purrou Beroiaios, why at the present day
   should five copies out of six record nothing of that second word?

   translators had the same Greek word in each place, especially
   considering that in the only other place where, besides St. Matt. xiii.
   36, v. 1., diasaphein occurs, viz. St. Matt. xviii. 31, they render
   diesa'phesan by = they made known. Since phrazein only occurs in St.
   Matt. xiii. 36 and xv. 15, we cannot generalize about the Peshitto
   rendering of this verb. Conversely, is used as the rendering of other
   Greek words besides phrazein, e.g.

   of epiluein, St. Mark iv. 34;

   of diermeneuein, St. Luke xxiv. 27;

   of dianoigein, St. Luke xxiv. 32 and Acts xvii. 3.
   On the whole I have no doubt (though it is not susceptible of proof)

   to allow His disciples a slight prolongation of the refreshment which
   his words had already permitted them to enjoy. Presently, He is heard
   to say,--It is enough'--(that is, Ye have now slept and rested
   enough'); and adds, The hour is come. Behold, the Son of Man is
   betrayed into the hands of sinners.' Sed quia commemorata non est ipsa
   interpositio silentii Domini, propterea coartat intellectum, ut in

   [399] I retract unreservedly what I offered on this subject in a former

CHAPTER XIII.

  CAUSES OF CORRUPTION CHIEFLY INTENTIONAL.

  IX. CORRUPTION BY HERETICS.

  § 1.

   THE Corruptions of the Sacred Text which we have been hitherto
   considering, however diverse the causes from which they may have
   resulted, have yet all agreed in this: viz. that they have all been of
   a lawful nature. My meaning is, that apparently, at no stage of the
   business has there been mala fides in any quarter. We are prepared to
   make the utmost allowance for careless, even for licentious
   transcription; and we can invent excuses for the mistaken zeal, the
   officiousness if men prefer to call it so, which has occasionally not
   scrupled to adopt conjectural emendations of the Text. To be brief, so
   long as an honest reason is discoverable for a corrupt reading, we
   gladly adopt the plea. It has been shewn with sufficient clearness, I
   trust, in the course of the foregoing chapters, that the number of
   distinct causes to which various readings may reasonably be attributed
   is even extraordinary.

   But there remains after all an alarmingly large assortment of textual
   perturbations which absolutely refuse to fall under any of the heads of
   classification already enumerated. They are not to be accounted for on
   any ordinary principle. And this residuum of cases it is, which
   occasions our present embarrassment. They are in truth so exceedingly
   numerous; they are often so very considerable; they are, as a rule, so
   very licentious; they transgress to such an extent all regulations;
   they usurp so persistently the office of truth and faithfulness, that
   we really know not what to think about them. Sometimes we are presented
   with gross interpolations,--apocryphal stories: more often with
   systematic lacerations of the text, or transformations as from an angel
   of light.

   We are constrained to inquire, How all this can possibly have come
   about? Have there even been persons who made it their business of set
   purpose to corrupt the [sacred deposit of Holy Scripture entrusted to
   the Church for the perpetual illumination of all ages till the Lord
   should come?]

   At this stage of the inquiry, we are reminded that it is even notorious
   that in the earliest age of all, the New Testament Scriptures were
   subjected to such influences. In the age which immediately succeeded
   the Apostolic there were heretical teachers not a few, who finding
   their tenets refuted by the plain Word of God bent themselves against
   the written Word with all their power. From seeking to evacuate its
   teaching, it was but a single step to seeking to falsify its testimony.
   Profane literature has never been exposed to such hostility. I make the
   remark in order also to remind the reader of one more point of
   [dissimilarity between the two classes of writings. The inestimable
   value of the New Testament entailed greater dangers, as well as secured
   superior safeguards. Strange, that a later age should try to discard
   the latter].

   It is found therefore that Satan could not even wait for the grave to
   close over St. John. Many' there were already who taught that Christ
   had not come in the flesh. Gnosticism was in the world already. St.
   Paul denounces it by name [441] and significantly condemns the wild
   fancies of its professors, their dangerous speculations as well as
   their absurd figments. Thus he predicts and condemns [442] their
   pestilential teaching in respect of meats and drinks and concerning
   matrimony. In his Epistle to Timothy [443] he relates that Hymeneus and
   Philetus taught that the Resurrection was past already. What wonder if
   a flood of impious teaching [444] broke loose on the Church when the
   last of the Apostles had been gathered in, and another generation of
   men had arisen, and the age of Miracles was found to be departing if it
   had not already departed [445] , and the loftiest boast which any could
   make was that they had known those who had [seen and heard the Apostles
   of the Lord].

   The grievous wolves' whose assaults St. Paul predicted as imminent, and
   against which he warned the heads of the Ephesian Church [446] , did
   not long spare the flock.' Already, while St. John was yet alive, had
   the Nicolaitans developed their teaching at Ephesus [447] and in the
   neighbouring Church of Pergamos [448] . Our risen Lord in glory
   announced to His servant John that in the latter city Satan had
   established his dwelling-place [449] . Nay, while those awful words
   were being spoken to the Seer of Patmos, the men were already born who
   first dared to lay their impious hands on the Gospel of Christ.

   No sooner do we find ourselves out of Apostolic lines and among
   monuments of the primitive age than we are made aware that the sacred
   text must have been exposed at that very early period to disturbing
   influences which, on no ordinary principles, can be explained. Justin
   Martyr, Irenaeus, Origen, Clement of Alexandria,--among the Fathers:
   some Old Latin MSS. [450] , the Bohairic and Sahidic, and coming later
   on, the Curetonian and Lewis,--among the Versions: of the copies Codd.
   B and ': and above all, coming later down still, Cod. D:--these
   venerable monuments of a primitive age occasionally present us with
   deformities which it is worse than useless to extenuate,--quite
   impossible to overlook. Unauthorized appendixes, --tasteless and stupid
   amplifications,--plain perversions of the meaning of the
   Evangelists,--wholly gratuitous assimilations of one Gospel to
   another,--the unprovoked omission of passages of profound interest and
   not unfrequently of high doctrinal import:--How are such phenomena as
   these to be accounted for? Again, in one quarter, we light upon a
   systematic mutilation of the text so extraordinary that it is as if
   some one had amused himself by running his pen through every clause
   which was not absolutely necessary to the intelligibleness of what
   remained. In another quarter we encounter the thrusting in of fabulous
   stories and apocryphal sayings which disfigure as well as encumber the
   text.--How will any one explain all this?

   Let me however at the risk of repeating what has been already said
   dispose at once of an uneasy suspicion which is pretty sure to suggest
   itself to a person of intelligence after reading what goes before. If
   the most primitive witnesses to our hand are indeed discovered to bear
   false witness to the text of Scripture,--whither are we to betake
   ourselves for the Truth? And what security can we hope ever to enjoy
   that any given exhibition of the text of Scripture is the true one? Are
   we then to be told that in this subject-matter the maxim id verius quod
   prius' does not hold? that the stream instead of getting purer as we
   approach the fountain head, on the contrary grows more and more
   corrupt?

   Nothing of the sort, I answer. The direct reverse is the case. Our
   appeal is always made to antiquity; and it is nothing else but a truism
   to assert that the oldest reading is also the best. A very few words
   will make this matter clear; because a very few words will suffice to
   explain a circumstance already adverted to which it is necessary to
   keep always before the eyes of the reader.

   The characteristic note, the one distinguishing feature, of all the
   monstrous and palpable perversions of the text of Scripture just now
   under consideration is this:--that they are never vouched for by the
   oldest documents generally, but only by a few of them,--two, three, or
   more of the oldest documents being observed as a rule to yield
   conflicting testimony, (which in this subject-matter is in fact
   contradictory). In this way the oldest witnesses nearly always refute
   one another, and indeed dispose of one another's evidence almost as
   often as that evidence is untrustworthy. And now I may resume and
   proceed.

   I say then that it is an adequate, as well as a singularly satisfactory
   explanation of the greater part of those gross depravations of
   Scripture which admit of no legitimate excuse, to attribute them,
   however remotely, to those licentious free-handlers of the text who are
   declared by their contemporaries to have falsified, mutilated,
   interpolated, and in whatever other way to have corrupted the Gospel;
   whose blasphemous productions of necessity must once have obtained a
   very wide circulation: and indeed will never want some to recommend and
   uphold them. What with those who like Basilides and his followers
   invented a Gospel of their own:--what with those who with the Ebionites
   and the Valentinians interpolated and otherwise perverted one of the
   four Gospels until it suited their own purposes:--what with those who
   like Marcion shamefully maimed and mutilated the inspired text:--there
   must have been a large mass of corruption festering in the Church
   throughout the immediate post-Apostolic age. But even this is not all.
   There were those who like Tatian constructed Diatessarons, or attempts
   to weave the fourfold narrative into one,--Lives of Christ,' so to
   speak;--and productions of this class were multiplied to an
   extraordinary extent, and as we certainly know, not only found their
   way into the remotest corners of the Church, but established themselves
   there. And will any one affect surprise if occasionally a curious
   scholar of those days was imposed upon by the confident assurance that
   by no means were those many sources of light to be indiscriminately
   rejected, but that there must be some truth in what they advanced? In a
   singularly uncritical age, the seductive simplicity of one
   reading,--the interesting fullness of another,--the plausibility of a
   third,--was quite sure to recommend its acceptance amongst those many
   eclectic recensions which were constructed by long since forgotten
   Critics, from which the most depraved and worthless of our existing
   texts and versions have been derived. Emphatically condemned by
   Ecclesiastical authority, and hopelessly outvoted by the universal
   voice of Christendom, buried under fifteen centuries, the corruptions I
   speak of survive at the present day chiefly in that little handful of
   copies which, calamitous to relate, the school of Lachmann and
   Tischendorf and Tregelles look upon as oracular: and in conformity with
   which many scholars are for refashioning the Evangelical text under the
   mistaken title of Old Readings.' And now to proceed with my argument.

  § 2.

   Numerous as were the heresies of the first two or three centuries of
   the Christian era, they almost all agreed in this;--that they involved
   a denial of the eternal Godhead of the Son of Man: denied that He is
   essentially very and eternal God. This fundamental heresy found itself
   hopelessly confuted by the whole tenor of the Gospel, which
   nevertheless it assailed with restless ingenuity: and many are the
   traces alike of its impotence and of its malice which have survived to
   our own times. It is a memorable circumstance that it is precisely
   those very texts which relate either to the eternal generation of the
   Son,--to His Incarnation,--or to the circumstances of His Nativity,
   --which have suffered most severely, and retain to this hour traces of
   having been in various ways tampered with. I do not say that Heretics
   were the only offenders here. I am inclined to suspect that the
   orthodox were as much to blame as the impugners of the Truth. But it
   was at least with a pious motive that the latter tampered with the
   Deposit. They did but imitate the example set them by the assailing
   party. It is indeed the calamitous consequence of extravagances in one
   direction that they are observed ever to beget excesses in the opposite
   quarter. Accordingly the piety of the primitive age did not think it
   wrong to fortify the Truth by the insertion, suppression, or
   substitution of a few words in any place from which danger was
   apprehended. In this way, I am persuaded, many an unwarrantable
   reading' is to be explained. I do not mean that marginal glosses have
   frequently found their way into the text':--that points to a wholly
   improbable account of the matter. I mean, that expressions which seemed
   to countenance heretical notions, or at least which had been made a bad
   use of by evil men, were deliberately falsified. But I must not further
   anticipate the substance of the next chapter.

   The men who first systematically depraved the text of Scripture, were
   as we now must know the heresiarchs Basilides (fl. 134), Valentinus
   (fl. 140), and Marcion (fl. 150): three names which Origen is observed
   almost invariably to enumerate together. Basilides [451] and Valentinus
   [452] are even said to have written Gospels of their own. Such a
   statement is not to be severely pressed: but the general fact is
   established by the notices, and those are exceedingly abundant, which
   the writers against Heresies have cited and left on record. All that is
   intended by such statements is that these old heretics retained,
   altered, transposed, just so much as they pleased of the fourfold
   Gospel: and further, that they imported whatever additional matter they
   saw fit:--not that they rejected the inspired text entirely, and
   substituted something of their own invention in its place [453] . And
   though, in the case of Valentinus, it has been contended, apparently
   with reason, that he probably did not individually go to the same
   length as Basilides,--who, as well in respect of St. Paul's Epistles as
   of the four Gospels, was evidently a grievous offender [454] ,--yet,
   since it is clear that his principal followers, who were also his
   contemporaries, put forth a composition which they were pleased to
   style the Gospel of Truth [455] ,' it is idle to dispute as to the
   limit of the rashness and impiety of the individual author of the
   heresy. Let it be further stated, as no slight confirmation of the view
   already hazarded as to the probable contents of the (so-called) Gospels
   of Basilides and of Valentinus, that one particular Gospel is related
   to have been preferred before the rest and specially adopted by certain
   schools of ancient Heretics. Thus, a strangely mutilated and depraved
   text of St. Matthew's Gospel is related to have found especial favour
   with the Ebionites [456] , with whom the Corinthians are associated by
   Epiphanius: though Irenaeus seems to say that it was St. Mark's Gospel
   which was adopted by the heretical followers of Cerinthus. Marcion's
   deliberate choice of St. Luke's Gospel is sufficiently well known. The
   Valentinians appropriated to themselves St. John [457] . Heracleon, the
   most distinguished disciple of this school, is deliberately censured by
   Origen for having corrupted the text of the fourth Evangelist in many
   places [458] . A considerable portion of his Commentary on St. John has
   been preserved to us: and a very strange production it is found to have
   been.

   Concerning Marcion, who is a far more conspicuous personage, it will be
   necessary to speak more particularly. He has left a mark on the text of
   Scripture of which traces are distinctly recognizable at the present
   day [459] . A great deal more is known about him than about any other
   individual of his school. Justin Martyr and Irenaeus wrote against him:
   besides Origen and Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian in the West [460]
   , and Epiphanius in the East, elaborately refuted his teaching, and
   give us large information as to his method of handling Scripture.

   Another writer of this remote time who, as I am prone to think, must
   have exercised sensible influence on the text of Scripture was Ammonius
   of Alexandria.

   But Tatian beyond every other early writer of antiquity [appears to me
   to have caused alterations in the Sacred Text.]

   It is obviously no answer to anything that has gone before to insist
   that the Evangelium of Marcion (for instance), so far as it is
   recognizable by the notices of it given by Epiphanius, can very rarely
   indeed be shewn to have resembled any extant MS. of the Gospels. Let it
   be even freely granted that many of the charges brought against it by
   Epiphanius with so much warmth, collapse when closely examined and
   severely sifted. It is to be remembered that Marcion's Gospel was known
   to be an heretical production: one of the many creations of the Gnostic
   age,--it must have been universally execrated and abhorred by faithful
   men. Besides this lacerated text of St. Luke's Gospel, there was an
   Ebionite recension of St. Matthew: a Cerinthian exhibition of St. Mark:
   a Valentinian perversion of St. John. And we are but insisting that the
   effect of so many corruptions of the Truth, industriously propagated
   within far less than 100 years of the date of the inspired verities
   themselves, must needs have made itself sensibly felt. Add the
   notorious fact, that in the second and third centuries after the
   Christian era the text of the Gospels is found to have been grossly
   corrupted even in orthodox quarters,--and that traces of these gross
   corruptions are discoverable in certain circles to the present
   hour,--and it seems impossible not to connect the two phenomena
   together. The wonder rather is that, at the end of so many centuries,
   we are able distinctly to recognize any evidence whatever.

   The proneness of these early Heretics severally to adopt one of the
   four Gospels for their own, explains why there is no consistency
   observable in the corruptions they introduced into the text. It also
   explains the bringing into one Gospel of things which of right clearly
   belong to another--as in St. Mark iii. 14 ou`s kai` aposto'lous
   ono'masen.

   I do not propose (as will presently appear) in this way to explain any
   considerable number of the actual corruptions of the text: but in no
   other way is it possible to account for such systematic mutilations as
   are found in Cod. B,--such monstrous additions as are found in Cod.
   D,--such gross perturbations as are continually met with in one or
   more, but never in all, of the earliest Codexes extant, as well as in
   the oldest Versions and Fathers.

   The plan of Tatian's Diatessaron will account for a great deal. He
   indulges in frigid glosses, as when about the wine at the feast of Cana
   in Galilee he reads that the servants knew because they had drawn the
   water'; or in tasteless and stupid amplifications, as in the going back
   of the Centurion to his house. I suspect that the ti me erotas peri tou
   agathou, Why do you ask me about that which is good?' is to be referred
   to some of these tamperers with the Divine Word.

  § 3.

   These professors of Gnosticism' held no consistent theory. The two
   leading problems on which they exercised their perverse ingenuity are
   found to have been (1) the origin of Matter, and (2) the origin of
   Evil.

   (1) They taught that the world's artificer (the Word') was Himself a
   creature of the Father [461] .' Encountered on the threshold of the
   Gospel by the plain declaration that, In the beginning was the Word:
   and the Word was with God: and the Word was God': and presently, All
   things were made by Him';--they were much exercised. The expedients to
   which they had recourse were certainly extraordinary. That Beginning'
   (said Valentinus) was the first thing which the Father' created: which
   He called Only begotten Son,' and also God' and in whom he implanted
   the germ of all things. Seminally, that is, whatsoever subsequently
   came into being was in Him. The Word' (he said) was a product of this
   first-created thing. And All things were made by Him,' because in the
   Word' was the entire essence of all the subsequent worlds (Aeons), to
   which he assigned forms [462] . From which it is plain that, according
   to Valentinus, the Word' was distinct from the Son'; who was not the
   world's Creator. Both alike, however, he acknowledged to be God [463]
   ': but only, as we have seen already, using the term in an inferior
   sense.

   Heracleon, commenting on St. John i. 3, insists that all things' can
   but signify this perishable world and the things that are therein: not
   essences of a loftier nature. Accordingly, after the words and without
   Him was not anything made,' he ventures to interpolate this clause,--of
   the things that are in the world and in the creation [464] .' True,
   that the Evangelist had declared with unmistakable emphasis, and
   without Him was not anything' (literally, was not even one thing ) made
   that was made.' But instead of not even one thing,' the Valentinian
   Gnostics appear to have written nothing [465] '; and the concluding
   clause that was made,' because he found it simply unmanageable,
   Valentinus boldly severed from its context, making it the beginning of
   a fresh sentence. With the Gnostics, ver. 4 is found to have begun
   thus,-- What was made in Him was life.'

   Of the change of oude` e'n into ouden [466] traces survive in many of
   the Fathers [467] : but ' and D are the only Uncial MSS. which are
   known to retain that corrupt reading.--The uncouth sentence which
   follows (o` ge'gonen en auto? zoe` en), singular to relate, was
   generally tolerated, became established in many quarters, and meets us
   still at every step. It was evidently put forward so perseveringly by
   the Gnostics, with whom it was a kind of article of the faith, that the
   orthodox at last became too familiar with it. Epiphanius, though he
   condemns it, once employs it [468] . Occurring first in a fragment of
   Valentinus [469] : next, in the Commentary of Heracleon [470] : after
   that, in the pages of Theodotus the Gnostic (A.D. 192) [471] : then, in
   an exposure by Hippolytus of the tenets of the Naäseni [472] , (a
   subsection of the same school);--the baseness of its origin at least is
   undeniable. But inasmuch as the words may be made to bear a loyal
   interpretation, the heretical construction of St. John i. 3 was endured
   by the Church for full 200 years. Clemens Alex. is observed thrice to
   adopt it [473] : Origen [474] and Eusebius [475] fall into it
   repeatedly. It is found in Codd. 'CD: apparently in Cod. A, where it
   fills one line exactly. Cyril comments largely on it [476] . But as
   fresh heresies arose which the depraved text seemed to favour, the
   Church bestirred herself and remonstrated. It suited the Arians and the
   Macedonians [477] , who insisted that the Holy Ghost is a creature. The
   former were refuted by Epiphanius, who points out that the sense is not
   complete until you have read the words o` ge'gonen. A fresh sentence
   (he says) begins at en auto zoe` en [478] . Chrysostom deals with the
   latter. Let us beware of putting the full stop' (he says) at the words
   oude` e'n,--as do the heretics. In order to make out that the Spirit is
   a creature, they read o` ge'gonen en auto zoe` en: by which means the
   Evangelist's meaning becomes unintelligible [479] .'

   But in the meantime, Valentinus, whose example was followed by
   Theodotus and by at least two of the Gnostic sects against whom
   Hippolytus wrote, had gone further, The better to conceal St. John's
   purpose, the heresiarch falsified the inspired text. In the place of,
   What was made in Him, was life,' he substituted What was made in Him,
   is life.' Origen had seen copies so depraved, and judged the reading
   not altogether improbable. Clement, on a single occasion, even adopted
   it. It was the approved reading of the Old Latin versions,--a memorable
   indication, by the way, of a quarter from which the Old Latin derived
   their texts,--which explains why it is found in Cyprian, Hilary, and
   Augustine; and why Ambrose has so elaborately vindicated its
   sufficiency. It also appears in the Sahidic and in Cureton's Syriac;
   but not in the Peshitto, nor in the Vulgate. [Nor in the Bohairic.] In
   the meantime, the only Greek Codexes which retain this singular trace
   of the Gnostic period at the present day, are Codexes ' and D.

  § 4.

   [We may now take some more instances to shew the effects of the
   operations of Heretics.]

   The good Shepherd in a certain place (St. John x. 14, 15) says
   concerning Himself--I know My sheep and am known of Mine, even as the
   Father knoweth Me and I know the Father': by which words He hints at a
   mysterious knowledge as subsisting between Himself and those that are
   His. And yet it is worth observing that whereas He describes the
   knowledge which subsists between the Father and the Son in language
   which implies that it is strictly identical on either side, He is
   careful to distinguish between the knowledge which subsists between the
   creature and the Creator by slightly varying the expression,--thus
   leaving it to be inferred that it is not, neither indeed can be, on
   either side the same. God knoweth us with a perfect knowledge. Our
   so-called knowledge' of God is a thing different not only in degree,
   but in kind [480] . Hence the peculiar form which the sentence assumes
   [481] :--gino'sko ta` ema', kai` gino'skomai upo` ton emon And this
   delicate diversity of phrase has been faithfully retained all down the
   ages, being witnessed to at this hour by every MS. in existence except
   four now well known to us: viz. 'BDL. The Syriac also retains it,--as
   does Macarius [482] , Gregory Naz. [483] , Chrysostom [484] , Cyril
   [485] , Theodoret [486] , Maximus [487] . It is a point which really
   admits of no rational doubt: for does any one suppose that if St. John
   had written Mine own know Me,' 996 MSS. out of 1000 at the end of 1,800
   years would exhibit, I am known of Mine'?

   But in fact it is discovered that these words of our Lord experienced
   depravation at the hands of the Manichaean heretics. Besides inverting
   the clauses, (and so making it appear that such knowledge begins on the
   side of Man,) Manes (A.D. 261) obliterated the peculiarity above
   indicated. Quoting from his own fabricated Gospel, he acquaints us with
   the form in which these words were exhibited in that mischievous
   production: viz. ginoskei me ta ema, kai` gino'sko ta` ema'. This we
   learn from Epiphanius and from Basil [488] . Cyril, in a paper where he
   makes clear reference to the same heretical Gospel, insists that the
   order of knowledge must needs be the reverse of what the heretics
   pretended [489] .--But then, it is found that certain of the orthodox
   contented themselves with merely reversing the clauses, and so
   restoring the true order of the spiritual process discussed
   --regardless of the exquisite refinement of expression to which
   attention was called at the outset. Copies must once have abounded
   which represented our Lord as saying, I know My own and My own know Me,
   even as the Father knoweth Me and I know the Father'; for it is the
   order of the Old Latin, Bohairic, Sahidic, Ethiopic, Lewis, Georgian,
   Slavonic, and Gothic, though not of the Peshitto, Harkleian, and
   Armenian; and Eusebius [490] , Nonnus, and even Basil [491] so read the
   place. But no token of this clearly corrupt reading survives in any
   known copy of the Gospels,--except 'BDL. Will it be believed that
   nevertheless all the recent Editors of Scripture since Lachman insist
   on obliterating this refinement of language, and going back to the
   reading which the Church has long since deliberately rejected,--to the
   manifest injury of the deposit? Many words about a trifle,'--some will
   be found to say. Yes, to deny God's truth is a very facile proceeding.
   Its rehabilitation always requires many words. I request only that the
   affinity between 'BDL and the Latin copies which universally exhibit
   this disfigurement [492] , may be carefully noted. [Strange to say, the
   true reading receives no notice from Westcott and Hort, or the Revisers
   [493] .]

   § 5.

   DOCTRINAL.

   The question of Matrimony was one of those on which the early heretics
   freely dogmatized. Saturninus [494] (A.D. 120) and his followers taught
   that marriage was a production of Hell.

   We are not surprised after this to find that those places in the Gospel
   which bear on the relation between man and wife exhibit traces of
   perturbation. I am not asserting that the heretics themselves depraved
   the text. I do but state two plain facts: viz. (1) That whereas in the
   second century certain heretical tenets on the subject of Marriage
   prevailed largely, and those who advocated as well as those who opposed
   such teaching relied chiefly on the Gospel for their proofs: (2) It is
   accordingly found that not only does the phenomenon of various
   readings' prevail in those places of the Gospel which bear most nearly
   on the disputed points, but the readings' are exactly of that
   suspicious kind which would naturally result from a tampering with the
   text by men who had to maintain, or else to combat, opinions of a
   certain class. I proceed to establish what I have been saying by some
   actual examples [495] .

   St. Matt. xix. 29. St. Mark x. 29.  St. Luke xviii. 29.
   e gunaika,         e gunaika,       e gunaika,
   --BD abc Orig.     --'BDD, abc, &c. all allow it.

   hotan de lege; hoti "pas hostis apheke gunaika," ou touto phesin, hoste
   haplos diaspasthai tous gamous, k.t.l. Chrys. vii. 636 E.

   Paradeigmati'sai (in St. Matt. i. 19) is another of the expressions
   which have been disturbed by the same controversy. I suspect that
   Origen is the author (see the heading of the Scholion in Cramer's
   Catenae) of a certain uncritical note which Eusebius reproduces in his
   quaestiones ad Stephanum [496] ' on the difference between deigmatisai
   and paradeigmati'sai; and that with him originated the substitution of
   the uncompounded for the compounded verb in this place. Be that as it
   may, Eusebius certainly read paradeigmati'sai (Dem. 320), with all the
   uncials but two (BZ): all the cursives but one (1). Will it be believed
   that Lachmann, Tregelles, Tischendorf, Alford, Westcott and Hort, on
   such slender evidence as that are prepared to reconstruct the text of
   St. Matthew's Gospel?

   It sounds so like trifling with a reader's patience to invite his
   attention to an elaborate discussion of most of the changes introduced
   into the text by Tischendorf and his colleagues, that I knowingly pass
   over many hundreds of instances where I am nevertheless perfectly well
   aware of my own strength,--my opponent's weakness. Such discussions in
   fact become unbearable when the points in dispute are confessedly
   trivial. No one however will deny that when three consecutive words of
   our LORD are challenged they are worth contending for. We are invited
   then to believe (St. Luke xxii. 67-8) that He did not utter the
   bracketed words in the following sentence,--If I tell you, ye will not
   believe; and if I ask you, ye will not answer (Me, nor let Me go).'
   Now, I invite the reader to inquire for the grounds of this assertion.
   Fifteen of the uncials (including AD), and every known cursive, besides
   all the Latin and all the Syriac copies recognize the bracketed words.
   They are only missing in 'BLT and their ally the Bohairic. Are we
   nevertheless to be assured that the words are to be regarded as
   spurious? Let the reader then be informed that Marcion left out seven
   words more (viz. all from, And if I ask you' to the end), and will he
   doubt either that the words are genuine or that their disappearance
   from four copies of bad character, as proved by their constant
   evidence, and from one version is sufficiently explained?

CHAPTER XIV.

  CAUSES OF CORRUPTION CHIEFLY INTENTIONAL.

  X. CORRUPTION BY THE ORTHODOX.

   § 1.

   ANOTHER cause why, in very early times, the Text of the Gospels
   underwent serious depravation, was mistaken solicitude on the part of
   the ancient orthodox for the purity of the Catholic faith. These
   persons, like certain of the moderns, Beza for example, evidently did
   not think it at all wrong to tamper with the inspired Text. If any
   expression seemed to them to have a dangerous tendency, they altered
   it, or transplanted it, or removed it bodily from the sacred page.
   About the uncritical nature of what they did, they entertained no
   suspicion: about the immorality of the proceeding, they evidently did
   not trouble themselves at all. On the contrary, the piety of the motive
   seems to have been held to constitute a sufficient excuse for any
   amount of licence. The copies which had undergone this process of
   castigation were even styled corrected,'--and doubtless were popularly
   looked upon as the correct copies' [like our critical texts']. An
   illustration of this is afforded by a circumstance mentioned by
   Epiphanius.

   He states (ii. 36) that the orthodox, out of jealousy for the Lord's.
   Divinity, eliminated from St. Luke xix. 41 the record that our Saviour
   wept.' We will not pause to inquire what this statement may be worth.
   But when the same Father adds,--In the uncorrected copies (en tois
   adiorthotois antigraphois) is found "He wept,"' Epiphanius is
   instructive. Perfectly well aware that the expression is genuine, he
   goes on to state that Irenaeus quoted it in his work against Heresies,
   when he had to confute the error of the Docetae [497] .' Nevertheless,'
   Epiphanius adds, the orthodox through fear erased the record.'

   So then, the process of correction' was a critical process conducted on
   utterly erroneous principles by men who knew nothing whatever about
   Textual Criticism. Such recensions of the Text proved simply fatal to
   the Deposit. To correct' was in this and such like cases simply to
   corrupt.'

   Codexes B'D may be regarded as specimens of Codexes which have once and
   again passed through the hands of such a corrector or diorthotes.

   St. Luke (ii. 40) records concerning the infant Saviour that the child
   grew, and waxed strong in spirit.' By repeating the selfsame expression
   which already,--viz. in chap. i. 80,--had been applied to the Childhood
   of the Forerunner [498] , it was clearly the design of the Author of
   Scripture to teach that the Word made flesh' submitted to the same laws
   of growth and increase as every other Son of Adam. The body grew,'--the
   spiritual part waxed strong.' This statement was nevertheless laid hold
   of by the enemies of Christianity. How can it be pretended (they asked)
   that He was perfect God' (teleios Theos), of whom it is related in
   respect of His spirit that he waxed strong [499] '? The consequence
   might have been foreseen. Certain of the orthodox were ill-advised
   enough to erase the word pneu'mati from the copies of St. Luke ii. 40;
   and lo, at the end of 1,500 years, four corrected' copies, two
   Versions, one Greek Father, survive to bear witness to the ancient
   fraud. No need to inquire which, what, and who these be.

   But because it is 'BDL, Origen [500] , and the Latin, the Egyptian and
   Lewis which are without the word pneu'mati, Lachmann, Tregelles,
   Tischendorf, and the Revisers jump to the conclusion that pneu'mati is
   a spurious accretion to the Text. They ought to reverse their
   proceeding; and recognize in the evidence one more indication of the
   untrustworthiness of the witnesses. For,--how then is it supposed that
   the word (pneu'mati) ever obtained its footing in the Gospel? For all
   reply we are assured that it has been imported hither from St. Luke i.
   80. But, we rejoin, How does the existence of the phrase ekrataiouto
   pneu'mati in i. 80 explain its existence in ii. 40, in every known copy
   of the Gospels except four, if in these 996 places, suppose, it be an
   interpolation? This is what has to be explained. Is it credible that
   all the remaining uncials, and every known cursive copy, besides all
   the lectionaries, should have been corrupted in this way: and that the
   truth should survive exclusively at this time only in the remaining
   four; viz. in B-',--the sixth century Cod. D,--and the eighth century
   Cod. L?

   When then, and where did the work of depravation take place? It must
   have been before the sixth century, because Leontius of Cyprus [501]
   quotes it three times and discusses the expression at length:--before
   the fifth, because, besides Cod. A, Cyril [502] , Theodoret [503] and
   ps.-Caesarius [504] recognize the word:--before the fourth, because
   Epiphanius [505] , Theodore of Mopsuestia [506] , and the Gothic
   version have it:--before the third, before nearly all of the second
   century, because it is found in the Peshitto. What more plain than that
   we have before us one other instance of the injudicious zeal of the
   orthodox? one more sample of the infelicity of modern criticism?

   § 2.

   Theodotus and his followers fastened on the first part of St. John
   viii. 40, when they pretended to shew from Scripture that Christ is
   mere Man [507] . I am persuaded that the reading of My Father [508]
   ,'--which Origen [509] , Epiphanius [510] , Athanasius [511] ,
   Chrysostom [512] , Cyril Alex. [513] , and Theodoret [514] prove to
   have been acquainted,--was substituted by some of the orthodox in this
   place, with the pious intention of providing a remedy for the heretical
   teaching of their opponents. At the present day only six cursive copies
   are known to retain this trace of a corruption of Scripture which must
   date from the second century.

   We now reach a most remarkable instance. It will be remembered that St.
   John in his grand preface does not rise to the full height of his
   sublime argument until he reaches the eighteenth verse. He had said
   (ver. 14) that the Word was made flesh,' &c.; a statement which
   Valentinus was willing to admit. But, as we have seen, the heresiarch
   and his followers denied that the Word' is also the Son' of God. As if
   in order to bar the door against this pretence, St. John announces
   (ver. 18) that the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the
   Father, he hath declared him': thus establishing the identity of the
   Word and the Only begotten Son. What else could the Valentinians do
   with so plain a statement, but seek to deprave it? Accordingly, the
   very first time St. John i. 18 is quoted by any of the ancients, it is
   accompanied by the statement that the Valentinians in order to prove
   that the only begotten' is the Beginning,' and is God,' appeal to the
   words,--the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father [515]
   ,' &c. Inasmuch, said they, as the Father willed to become known to the
   worlds, the Spirit of Gnosis produced the only begotten' Gnosis,' and
   therefore gave birth to Gnosis,' that is to ;the Son': in order that by
   the Son' the Father' might be made known. While then that only begotten
   Son' abode in the bosom of the Father,' He caused that here upon earth
   should be seen, alluding to ver. 14, one as the only begotten Son.' In
   which, by the way, the reader is requested to note that the author of
   the Excerpta Theodoti (a production of the second century) reads St.
   John i. 18 as we do.

   I have gone into all these strange details,--derived, let it be
   remembered, from documents which carry us back to the former half of
   the second century,--because in no other way is the singular phenomenon
   which attends the text of St. John i. 18 to be explained and accounted
   for. Sufficiently plain and easy of transmission as it is, this verse
   of Scripture is observed to exhibit perturbations which are even
   extraordinary. Irenaeus once writes ho [?] monogene`s huios: once, ho
   [?] monogene`s Theo's: once, ho monogene`s huios Theou [516] : Clemens
   Alex., ho monogene`s huios Theo`s monos [517] ; which must be very
   nearly the reading of the Codex from which the text of the Vercelli
   Copy of the Old Latin was derived [518] . Eusebius four times writes
   6ho monogene`s huios [519] : twice, monogene`s Theo's [520] : and on
   one occasion gives his reader the choice of either expression,
   explaining why both may stand [521] . Gregory Nyss. [522] and Basil
   [523] , though they recognize the usual reading of the place, are
   evidently vastly more familiar with the reading ho monogene`s Theo's
   [524] : for Basil adopts the expression thrice [525] , and Gregory
   nearly thirty-three times as often [526] . This was also the reading of
   Cyril Alex. [527] , whose usual phrase however is ho monogenes tou
   Theou logos [528] . Didymus has only [? cp. context] ho monogenes
   Theos, --for which he once writes ho monogenes Theos logos [529] .
   Cyril of Jer. seems to have read ho monogenes monos [530] .

   [I have retained this valuable and suggestive passage in the form in
   which the Dean left it. It evidently has not the perfection that
   attends some of his papers, and would have been amplified and improved
   if his life had been spared. More passages than he noticed, though
   limited to the ante-Chrysostom period, are referred to in the companion
   volume [531] . The portentous number of mentions by Gregory of Nyssa
   escaped me, though I knew that there were several. Such repetitions of
   a phrase could only be admitted into my calculation in a restricted and
   representative number. Indeed, I often quoted at least on our side less
   than the real number of such reiterations occurring in one passage,
   because in course of repetition they came to assume for such a purpose
   a parrot-like value.

   But the most important part of the Dean's paper is found in his account
   of the origin of the expression. This inference is strongly confirmed
   by the employment of it in the Arian controversy. Arius reads Theos
   (ap. Epiph. 73--Tischendorf), whilst his opponents read Huios. So
   Faustinus seven times (I noted him only thrice), and Victorinus Afer
   six (10) times in reply to the Arian Candidus [532] . Also Athanasius
   and Hilary of Poictiers four times each, and Ambrose eight (add Epp. I.
   xxii. 5). It is curious that with this history admirers of B and '
   should extol their reading over the Traditional reading on the score of
   orthodoxy. Heresy had and still retains associations which cannot be
   ignored: in this instance some of the orthodox weakly played into the
   hands of heretics [533] . None may read Holy Scripture just as the idea
   strikes them.]

  § 3.

   All are familiar with the received text of 1 Cor. xv. 47:--o protos
   a'nthropos ek ges choiko's; o deu'teros a'nthropos ho Kurios ex
   ouranou. That this place was so read in the first age is certain: for
   so it stands in the Syriac. These early heretics however of whom St.
   John speaks, who denied that Jesus Christ had come in the flesh [534]
   ,' and who are known to have freely taken away from the words' of
   Scripture [535] , are found to have made themselves busy here. If (they
   argued) the second man' was indeed the Lord-from-Heaven,' how can it be
   pretended that Christ took upon Himself human flesh [536] ? And to
   bring out this contention of theirs more plainly, they did not hesitate
   to remove as superfluous the word man' in the second clause of the
   sentence. There resulted,--The first man [was] of the earth, earthy: ho
   deuteros Kurios ex ouranou [537] ,' It is thus that Marcion [538] (A.D.
   130) and his followers [539] read the place. But in this subject-matter
   extravagance in one direction is ever observed to beget extravagance in
   another. I suspect that it was in order to counteract the ejection by
   the heretics of anthropos in. ver. 47, that, early in the second
   century, the orthodox retaining anthropos, judged it expedient to leave
   out the expression ho Kurios, which had been so unfairly pressed
   against them; and were contented to read,--the second man [was] from
   heaven.' A calamitous exchange, truly. For first, (I), The text thus
   maimed afforded countenance to another form of misbelief. And next,
   (II), It necessitated a further change in 1 Cor. xv. 47.

   (I) It furnished a pretext to those heretics who maintained that Christ
   was Man' before He came into the World. This heresy came to a head in
   the persons of Apolinarius [540] and Photinus; in contending with whom,
   Greg. Naz. [541] and Epiphanius [542] are observed to argue with
   disadvantage from the mutilated text. Tertullian [543] , and Cyprian
   [544] after him, knew no other reading but secundus homo de
   Caelo,'--which is in fact the way this place stands in the Old Latin.
   And thus, from the second century downwards, two readings (for the
   Marcionite text was speedily forgotten) became current in the
   Church:--(1) The inspired language of the Apostle, cited at the
   outset,--which is retained by all the known copies, except nine; and is
   vouched for by Basil [545] , Chrysostom [546] , Theodotus [547] ,
   Eutherius [548] ; Theodorus Mops. [549] , Damascene [550] , Petrus
   Siculus [551] , and Theophylact [552] : and (2) The corrected (i.e. the
   maimed) text of the orthodox;--o deu'teros; a'nthropos ex ouranou: with
   which, besides the two Gregories [553] , Photinus [554] and Apolinarius
   the heretics were acquainted; but which at this day is only known to
   survive in '*BCD*EFG and two cursive copies. Origen [555] , and (long
   after him) Cyril, employed both readings [556] .

   (II) But then, (as all must see) such a maimed exhibition of the text
   was intolerable. The balance of the sentence had been destroyed.
   Against o protos a'nthropos, St. Paul had set o deu'teros a'nthropos:
   against ek ges--ex ouranou: against choiko's--o Ku'rios:. Remove o
   Ku'rios, and some substitute for it must be invented as a counterpoise
   to choiko's. Taking a hint from what is found in ver. 48, some one
   (plausibly enough,) suggested epoura'nios: and this gloss so
   effectually recommended itself to Western Christendom, that having been
   adopted by Ambrose [557] , by Jerome [558] (and later by Augustine
   [559] ,) it established itself in the Vulgate [560] , and is found in
   all the later Latin writers [561] . Thus then, a third rival reading
   enters the field,--which because it has well-nigh disappeared from
   Greek MSS., no longer finds an advocate. Our choice lies therefore
   between the two former:--viz. (a) the received, which is the only
   well-attested reading of the place: and (b) the maimed text of the Old
   Latin, which Jerome deliberately rejected (A.D. 380), and for which he
   substituted another even worse attested reading. (Note, that these two
   Western fabrications effectually dispose of one another.) It should be
   added that Athanasius [562] lends his countenance to all the three
   readings.

   But now, let me ask,--Will any one be disposed, after a careful survey
   of the premisses, to accept the verdict of Tischendorf, Tregelles and
   the rest, who are for bringing the Church back to the maimed text of
   which I began by giving the history and explaining the origin? Let it
   be noted that the one question is,--shall o Ku'rios be retained in the
   second clause, or not? But there it stood within thirty years of the
   death of St. John: and there it stands, at the end of eighteen
   centuries in every extant copy (including AK LP) except nine. It has
   been excellently witnessed to all down the ages,--viz. By Origen,
   Hippolytus, Athanasius, Basil, Chrysostom, Cyril, Theodotus, Eutherius,
   Theodore Mops., Damascene and others. On what principle would you now
   reject it? . . . With critics who assume that a reading found in
   'BCDEFG must needs be genuine,--it is vain to argue. And yet the most
   robust faith ought to be effectually shaken by the discovery that four,
   if not five ('ACFG) of these same MSS., by reading we shall all sleep;
   but we shall not all be changed,' contradict St. Paul's solemn
   announcement in ver. 51: while a sixth (D) stands alone in substituting
   we shall all rise; but we shall not all be changed.'--In this very
   verse, C is for introducing Adam into the first clause of the sentence:
   FG, for subjoining ho ouranios. When will men believe that guides like
   these are to be entertained with habitual distrust? to be listened tog
   with the greatest caution? to be followed, for their own sakes,--never?

   I have been the fuller on this place, because it affords an instructive
   example of what has occasionally befallen the words of Scripture. Very
   seldom indeed are we able to handle a text in this way. Only when the
   heretics assailed, did the orthodox defend: whereby it came to pass
   that a record was preserved of how the text was read by the ancient
   Father. The attentive reader will note (a) That all the changes which
   we have been considering belong to the earliest age of all:--(') That
   the corrupt reading is retained by 'BC and their following: the genuine
   text, in the great bulk of the copies:--(c) That the first mention of
   the text is found in the writings of an early heretic:--(d) That [the
   orthodox introduced a change in the interests, as they fancied, of
   truth, but from utter misapprehension of the nature and authority of
   the Word of God:--and (e) that under the Divine Providence that change
   was so effectually thrown out, that decisive witness is found on the
   other side].

  § 4.

   Closely allied to the foregoing, and constantly referred to in
   connexion with it by those Fathers who undertook to refute the heresy
   of Apolinarius, is our Lord's declaration to Nicodemus,--No man hath
   ascended up to heaven, but He that came down from heaven, even the Son
   of Man which is in heaven' (St. John iii. 13). Christ came down from
   heaven' when He became incarnate: and having become incarnate, is said
   to have ascended up to Heaven,' and to be in Heaven,' because the Son
   of Man,' who was not in heaven before, by virtue of the hypostatical
   union was thenceforward evermore in heaven.' But the Evangelist's
   language was very differently taken by those heretics who
   systematically maimed and misinterpreted that which belongeth to the
   human nature of Christ.' Apolinarius, who relied on the present place,
   is found to have read it without the final clause (o on en to ouranoo);
   and certain of the orthodox (as Greg. Naz., Greg. Nyssa, Epiphanius,
   while contending with him,) shew themselves not unwilling to argue from
   the text so mutilated. Origen and the author of the Dialogus once,
   Eusebius twice, Cyril not fewer than nineteen times, also leave off at
   the words even the Son of Man': from which it is insecurely gathered
   that those Fathers disallowed the clause which follows. On the other
   hand, thirty-eight Fathers and ten Versions maintain the genuineness of
   the words o on en to ouranoo [563] . But the decisive circumstance is
   that,--besides the Syriac and the Latin copies which all witness to the
   existence of the clause,--the whole body of the uncials, four only
   excepted ('BLT^b), and every known cursive but one (33)--are for
   retaining it.

   No thoughtful reader will rise from a discussion like the foregoing
   without inferring from the facts which have emerged in the course of it
   the exceeding antiquity of depravations of the inspired verity. For let
   me not be supposed to have asserted that the present depravation was
   the work of Apolinarius. Like the rest, it is probably older by at
   least 150 years. Apolinarius, in whose person the heresy which bears
   his name came to a head, did but inherit the tenets of his predecessors
   in error; and these had already in various ways resulted in the
   corruption of the deposit.

  § 5 [564]

   The matter in hand will be conveniently illustrated by inviting the
   reader's attention to another famous place. There is a singular consent
   among the Critics for eliminating from St. Luke ix. 54-6, twenty-four
   words which embody two memorable sayings of the Son of Man. The entire
   context is as follows:--Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come
   down from heaven and consume them, (as Elias did)? But he turned, and
   rebuked them. (and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.)
   (For the Son of Man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save
   them.) And they went to another village.' The three bracketed clauses
   contain the twenty-four words in dispute.

   The first of these clauses (os kai` Heli'as epoi'ese), which claims to
   be part of the inquiry of St. John and St. James, Mill rejected as an
   obvious interpolation. Res ipsa clamat. Quis enim sanus tam insignia
   deleverit [565] ?' Griesbach retained it as probably genuine.--The
   second clause (kai` eipen, Ouk oidate oi'ou pneu'mato's este umeis) he
   obelized as probably not genuine:--the third (o ga`r uio`s tou
   anthro'pou ouk elthe psucha`s anthro'pon apole'sai, alla sosai) he
   rejected entirely. Lachmann also retains the first clause, but rejects
   the other two. Alford, not without misgiving, does the same. Westcott
   and Hort, without any misgiving about the third clause, are morally
   certain' that the first and second clauses are a Western interpolation.
   Tischendorf and Tregelles are thorough. They agree, and the Revisers of
   1881, in rejecting unceremoniously all the three clauses and exhibiting
   the place curtly, thus.--Ku'rie, the'leis ei'pomen pur katabenai apo`
   tou ouranou, kai` analosai autou's? straphei`s de` epeti'mesen autois.
   kai` eporeu'thesan eis ete'ran ko'men. [566]

   Now it may as well be declared at once that Codd. 'BLX 1 g^l Cyr^luc 2,
   two MSS. of the Bohairic (d 3, d 2), the Lewis, and two cursives (71,
   157) are literally the only authority, ancient or modern, for so
   exhibiting the text [in all its bare crudeness]. Against them are
   arrayed the whole body of MSS. uncial and cursive, including ACD; every
   known lectionary; all the Latin, the Syriac (Cur. om. Clause 1), and
   indeed every other known version: besides seven good Greek Fathers
   beginning with Clemens Alex. (A.D. 190), and five Latin Fathers
   beginning with Tertullian (A.D. 190): Cyprian's testimony being in fact
   the voice of the Fourth Council of Carthage, A.D. 253. If on a survey
   of this body of evidence any one will gravely tell me that the
   preponderance of authority still seems to him to be in favour of the
   shorter reason, I can but suggest that the sooner he communicates to
   the world the grounds for his opinion, the better.

   (1) In the meantime it becomes necessary to consider the disputed
   clauses separately, because ancient authorities, rivalling modern
   critics, are unable to agree as to which they will reject, which they
   will retain. I begin with the second. What persuades so many critics to
   omit the precious words kai` eipen, Ouk oidate oi'ou pneu'mato's este
   umeis, is the discovery that these words are absent from many uncial
   MSS.,--'ABC and nine others; besides, as might have been confidently
   anticipated from that fact, also from a fair proportion of the cursive
   copies. It is impossible to deny that prima facie such an amount of
   evidence against any words of Scripture is exceedingly weighty.
   Pseudo-Basil (ii. 271) is found to have read the passage in the same
   curt way. Cyril, on the other hand, seems to have read it differently.

   And yet, the entire aspect of the case becomes changed the instant it
   is perceived that this disputed clause is recognized by Clemens [567]
   (A.D. 190); as well as by the Old Latin, by the Peshitto, and by the
   Curetonian Syriac: for the fact is thus established that as well in
   Eastern as in Western Christendom the words under discussion were
   actually recognized as genuine full a hundred and fifty years before
   the oldest of the extant uncials came into existence. When it is
   further found that (besides Ambrose, Jerome, Augustine,) the Vulgate,
   the Old Egyptian, the Harkleian Syriac and the Gothic versions also
   contain the words in question; and especially that Chrysostom in four
   places, Didymus, Epiphanius, Cyril and Theodoret, besides Antiochus,
   familiarly quote them, it is evident that the testimony of antiquity in
   their favour is even overwhelming. Add that in eight uncial MSS.
   (beginning with D) the words in dispute form part of the text of St.
   Luke, and that they are recognized by the great mass of the cursive
   copies,--(only six out of the twenty which Scrivener has collated being
   without them,)--and it is plain that at least five tests of genuineness
   have been fully satisfied.

   (2) The third clause (o ga`r uio`s tou anthro'pou ouk elthe psucha`s
   anthro'pon apole'sai, alla sosai) rests on precisely the same solid
   evidence as the second; except that the testimony of Clemens is no
   longer available,--but only because his quotation does not extend so
   far. Cod. D also omits this third clause; which on the other hand is
   upheld by Tertullian, Cyprian and Ambrose. Tischendorf suggests that it
   has surreptitiously found its way into the text from St. Luke xix. 10,
   or St. Matt. xviii. 11. But this is impossible; simply because what is
   found in those two places is essentially different: namely,--elthe ga`r
   o uio`s tou anthro'pou zetesai kai` [568] sosai to` apololo's.

   (3) We are at liberty in the meantime to note how apt an illustration
   is here afforded of the amount of consensus which subsists between
   documents of the oldest class. This divergence becomes most conspicuous
   when we direct our attention to the grounds for omitting the foremost
   clause of the three, os kai` Eli'as epoi'esen: for here we make the
   notable discovery that the evidence is not only less weighty, but also
   different. Codexes B and ' are now forsaken by all their former allies
   except LX and a single cursive copy. True, they are supported by the
   Curetonian Syriac, the Vulgate and two copies of the Old Latin. But
   this time they find themselves confronted by Codexes ACD with thirteen
   other uncials and the whole body of the cursives; the Peshitto, Coptic,
   Gothic, and Harkleian versions; by Clemens, Jerome, Chrysostom, Cyril
   and pseudo-Basil. In respect of antiquity, variety, respectability,
   numbers,. they are therefore hopelessly outvoted.

   Do any inquire, How then has all this contradiction and depravation of
   Codexes 'ABC(D) come about? I answer as follows:--

   It was a favourite tenet with the Gnostic heretics that the Law and the
   Gospel are at variance. In order to establish this, Marcion (in a work
   called Antitheses) set passages of the New Testament against passages
   of the Old; from the seeming disagreement between which his followers
   were taught to infer that the Law and the Gospel cannot have proceeded
   from one and the same author [569] . Now here was a place exactly
   suited to his purpose. The God of the Old Testament had twice sent down
   fire from heaven to consume fifty men. But the Son of Man,' said our
   Saviour, when invited to do the like, came not to destroy men's lives
   but to save them.' Accordingly, Tertullian in his fourth book against
   Marcion, refuting this teaching, acquaints us that one of Marcion's
   Contrasts' was Elijah's severity in calling down fire from Heaven,--and
   the gentleness of Christ. I acknowledge the severity of the judge,'
   Tertullian replies; but I recognize the same severity on the part of
   Christ towards His Disciples when they proposed to bring down a similar
   calamity on a Samaritan village [570] .' From all of which it is plain
   that within seventy years of the time when the Gospel was published,
   the text of St. Luke ix. 54-6 stood very much as at present.

   But then it is further discovered that at the same remote period (about
   A.D. 130) this place of Scripture was much fastened on by the enemies
   of the Gospel. The Manichaean heretics pressed believers with it [571]
   . The disciples' appeal to the example of Elijah, and the reproof they
   incurred, became inconvenient facts. The consequence might be foreseen.
   With commendable solicitude for God's honour, but through mistaken
   piety, certain of the orthodox (without suspicion of the evil they were
   committing) were so ill-advised as to erase from their copies the
   twenty-four words which had been turned to mischievous account as well
   as to cause copies to be made of the books so mutilated: and behold, at
   the end of 1,700 years, the calamitous result !

   Of these three clauses then, which are closely interdependent, and as
   Tischendorf admits [572] must all three stand or all three fall
   together, the first is found with ACD, the Old Latin, Peshitto,
   Clement, Chrysostom, Cyril, Jerome,--not with KB the Vulgate or
   Curetonian. The second and third clauses are found with Old Latin,
   Vulgate, Peshitto, Harkleian, six Greek and five Latin Fathers,--not
   with 'ABCD. While ' and B are alone in refusing to recognize either
   first, second or third clause. And this is a fair sample of that
   singular agreement' which is sometimes said to subsist between the
   lesser group of witnesses.' Is it not plain on the contrary that at a
   very remote period there existed a fierce conflict, and consequent
   hopeless divergence of testimony about the present passage; of which
   1,700 years [573] have failed to obliterate the traces? Had 'B been our
   only ancient guides, it might of course have been contended that there
   has been no act of spoliation committed: but seeing that one half of
   the missing treasure is found with their allies, ACD, Clement Alex.,
   Chrysostom, Cyril, Jerome,--the other half with their allies, Old
   Latin, Harkleian, Clement, Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambrose, Didymus,
   Epiphanius, Chrysostom, Cyril, Theodoret, Jerome, Augustine [574] ,--it
   is clear that no such pretence can any longer be set up.

   The endeavour to establish agreement among the witnesses by a skilful
   distribution or rather dislocation of their evidence, a favourite
   device with the Critics, involves a fallacy which in any other subject
   would be denied a place. I trust that henceforth St. Luke ix. 54-6 will
   be left in undisputed possession of its place in the sacred Text,--to
   which it has an undoubted right.

   A thoughtful person may still inquire, Can it however be explained
   further how it has come to pass that the evidence for omitting the
   first clause and the two last is so unequally divided? I answer, the
   disparity is due to the influence of the Lectionaries.

   Let it be observed then that an ancient Ecclesiastical Lection which
   used to begin either at St. Luke ix. 44, or else at verse 49 and to
   extend down to the end of verse 56 [575] , ended thus,--os kai` Eli'as
   epoi'ese; straphei`s de` epeti'mesen autois. kai eporeuthesan eis
   heteran komnn [576] . It was the Lection for Thursday in the fifth week
   of the new year; and as the reader sees, it omitted the two last
   clauses exactly as Codd. 'ABC do. Another Ecclesiastical. Lection began
   at verse 51 and extended down to verse 57, and is found to have
   contained the two last clauses [577] . I wish therefore to
   inquire:--May it not fairly be presumed that it is the Lectionary
   practice of the primitive age which has led to the irregularity in this
   perturbation of the sacred Text?

   pleromatos dianemei tois hagiois ta PNEUMATIKA, kai autos estin he
   SOPhIA, kai tes ChARITOS ho doter,--it is clear that pneumati must have
   stood in Cyril's text. The same is the reading of Cyril's Treatise, De
   Incarnatione (Mai, ii. 57): and of his Commentary on St. Luke (ibid. p.
   136). One is surprised at Tischendorf's perverse inference concerning
   the last-named place. Cyril had begun by quoting the whole of ver. 40
   in exact conformity with the traditional text (Mai, ii. 136). At the
   close of some remarks (found both in Mai and in Cramer's Catena), Cyril
   proceeds as follows, according to the latter:--ho Euangelistes ephe
   "euxane kai ekrataiouto" KAI TA EXES. Surely this constitutes no ground
   for supposing that he did not recognize the word pneumati, but rather
   that he did. On the other hand, it is undeniable that in V. P. ii. 138
   and 139 (= Concilia iii. 241 d, 244 a), from Pusey's account of what he
   found in the MSS. (vii. P. i. 277-8)) the word pneumati must be
   suspected of being an unauthorized addition to the text of Cyril's

   [566] The text of St. Luke ix. 51-6 prefixed to Cyril's fifty-sixth
   Sermon (p. 253) is the text of B and ',--an important testimony to what
   I suppose may be regarded as the Alexandrine Textus Receptus of this
   place in the fifth century. But then no one supposes that Cyril is
   individually responsible for the headings of his Sermons. We therefore
   refer to the body of his discourse; and discover that the Syriac
   translator has rendered it (as usual) with exceeding licence. He has
   omitted to render some such words as the following which certainly
   stood in the original text:--eidenai gar chre, hoti hos mepo tes neas

APPENDIX I.

  PERICOPE DE ADULTERA.

   I HAVE purposely reserved for the last the most difficult problem of
   all: viz. those twelve famous verses of St. John's Gospel (chap. vii.
   53 to viii. 11) which contain the history of the woman taken in
   adultery,'--the pericope de adultera, as it is called. Altogether
   indispensable is it that the reader should approach this portion of the
   Gospel with the greatest amount of experience and the largest
   preparation. Convenient would it be, no doubt, if he could further
   divest himself of prejudice; but that is perhaps impossible. Let him at
   least endeavour to weigh the evidence which shall now be laid before
   him in impartial scales. He must do so perforce, if he would judge
   rightly: for the matter to be discussed is confessedly very peculiar:
   in some respects, even unique. Let me convince him at once of the truth
   of what has been so far spoken.

   It is a singular circumstance that at the end of eighteen centuries two
   instances, and but two, should exist of a considerable portion of
   Scripture left to the mercy, so to speak, of Textual Criticism.' Twelve
   consecutive Verses in the second Gospel--as many consecutive Verses in
   the fourth--are in this predicament. It is singular, I say, that the
   Providence which has watched so marvellously over the fortunes of the,
   Deposit,-- the Divine Wisdom which has made such ample provision for
   its security all down the ages, should have so ordered the matter, that
   these two co-extensive problems have survived to our times to be tests
   of human sagacity,--trials of human faithfulness and skill. They
   present some striking features of correspondence, but far more of
   contrast,--as will presently appear. And yet the most important
   circumstance of all cannot be too soon mentioned: viz. that both alike
   have experienced the same calamitous treatment at the hands of some
   critics. By common consent the most recent editors deny that either set
   of Verses can have formed part of the Gospel as it proceeded from the
   hands of its inspired author. How mistaken is this opinion of theirs in
   respect of the Last twelve verses of the Gospel according to St. Mark,'
   has been already demonstrated in a separate treatise. I must be content
   in this place to deal in a far less ceremonious manner with the hostile
   verdict of many critics concerning St. John vii. 53-viii. 11. That I
   shall be able to satisfy those persons who profess themselves
   unconvinced by what was offered concerning St. Mark's last twelve
   verses, I am not so simple as to expect. But I trust that I shall have
   with me all candid readers who are capable of weighing evidence
   impartially, and understanding the nature of logical proof, when it is
   fully drawn out before them,--which indeed is the very qualification
   that I require of them.

   And first, the case of the pericope de adultera requires to be placed
   before the reader in its true bearings. For those who have hitherto
   discussed it are observed to have ignored certain preliminary
   considerations which, once clearly apprehended, are all but decisive of
   the point vat issue. There is a fundamental obstacle, I mean, in the
   way of any attempt to dislodge this portion of the sacred narrative
   from the context in which it stands, which they seem to have
   overlooked. I proceed to explain.

   Sufficient prominence has never yet been given to the fact that in the
   present discussion the burden of proof rests entirely with those who
   challenge the genuineness of the Pericope under review. In other words,
   the question before us is not by any means,--Shall these Twelve Verses
   be admitted--or, Must they be refused admission--into the Sacred Text?
   That point has been settled long, long ago. St. John's Twelve verses
   are in possession. Let those eject them who can. They are known to have
   occupied their present position for full seventeen hundred years. There
   never was a time--as far as is known--when they were not where,--and to
   all intents and purposes what--they now are. Is it not evident, that no
   merely ordinary method of proof,--no merely common argument,--will
   avail to dislodge Twelve such Verses as these?

   Twelve such Verses,' I say. For it is the extent of the subject-matter
   which makes the case so formidable. We have here to do with no dubious
   clause, concerning which ancient testimony is divided; no seeming
   gloss, which is suspected to have overstepped its proper limits, and to
   have crept in as from the margin; no importation from another Gospel;
   no verse of Scripture which has lost its way; no weak amplification of
   the Evangelical meaning; no tasteless appendix, which encumbers the
   narrative and almost condemns itself. Nothing of the sort. If it were
   some inconsiderable portion of Scripture which it was proposed to get
   rid of by shewing that it is disallowed by a vast amount of ancient
   evidence, the proceeding would be intelligible. But I take leave to
   point out that a highly complex and very important incident--as related
   in twelve consecutive verses of the Gospel--cannot be so dealt with.
   Squatters on the waste are liable at any moment to be served with a
   notice of ejectment: but the owner of a mansion surrounded by broad
   acres which his ancestors are known to have owned before the Heptarchy,
   may on no account be dispossessed by any such summary process. This--to
   speak without a figure--is a connected and very striking portion of the
   sacred narrative:--the description of a considerable incident, complete
   in itself, full of serious teaching, and of a kind which no one would
   have ever dared to invent. Those who would assail it successfully must
   come forward with weapons of a very different kind from those usually
   employed in textual warfare.

   It shall be presently shewn that these Twelve Verses hold their actual
   place by a more extraordinary right of tenure than any other twelve
   verses which can be named in the Gospel: but it would be premature to
   enter upon the proof of that circumstance now. I prefer to invite the
   reader's attention, next to the actual texture of the pericope de
   adultera, by which name (as already explained) the last verse of St.
   John vii. together with verses 1-11 of ch. viii. are familiarly
   designated. Although external testimony supplies the sole proof of
   genuineness, it is nevertheless reasonable to inquire what the verses
   in question may have to say for themselves. Do they carry on their
   front the tokens of that baseness of origin which their impugners so
   Confidently seek to fasten upon them? Or do they, on the contrary,
   unmistakably bear the impress of Truth?

   The first thing which strikes me in them is that the actual narrative
   concerning the woman taken in adultery' is entirely contained in the
   last nine of these verses: being preceded by two short paragraphs of an
   entirely different character and complexion. Let these be first
   produced and studied:

     and every man went to his own house: but Jesus went to the Mount of
     Olives.' And again, very early in the morning, He presented Himself
     in the Temple; and all the people came unto Him: and He sat down and
     taught them.'

   Now as every one must see, the former of these two paragraphs is
   unmistakably not the beginning but the end of a narrative. It purports
   to be the conclusion of something which went before, not to introduce
   something which conies after. Without any sort of doubt, it is St.
   John's account of what occurred at the close of the debate between
   certain members of the Sanhedrin which terminates his history of the
   last day of the Feast of Tabernacles. The verse in question marks the
   conclusion of the Feast,--implies in short that all is already
   finished. Remove it, and the antecedent narrative ends abruptly. Retain
   it, and all proceeds methodically; while an affecting contrast is
   established, which is recognized to be strictly in the manner of
   Scripture [578] . Each one had gone to his home: but the homeless One
   had repaired to the Mount of Olives. In other words, the paragraph
   under discussion is found to be an integral part of the immediately
   antecedent narrative: proves to be a fragment of what is universally
   admitted to be genuine Scripture. By consequence, itself must needs be
   genuine also [579] .

   It is vain for any one to remind us that these two verses are in the
   same predicament as those which follow: are as ill supported by MS.
   evidence as the other ten: and must therefore share the same fate as
   the rest. The statement is incorrect, to begin with; as shall presently
   be shewn. But, what is even better deserving of attention, since
   confessedly these twelve verses are either to stand or else to fall
   together, it must be candidly admitted that whatever begets a suspicion
   that certain of them, at all events, must needs be genuine, throws real
   doubt on the justice of the sentence of condemnation which has been
   passed in a lump upon all the rest.

   I proceed to call attention to another inconvenient circumstance which
   some Critics in their eagerness have overlooked.

   The reader will bear in mind that--contending, as I do, that the entire
   Pericope under discussion is genuine Scripture which has been forcibly
   wrenched away from its lawful context,--I began by examining the upper
   extremity, with a view to ascertaining whether it bore any traces of
   being a fractured edge. The result is just what might have been
   anticipated. The first two of the verses which it is the fashion to
   brand with ignominy were found to carry on their front clear evidence
   that they are genuine Scripture. How then about the other extremity?

   Note, that in the oracular Codexes B and ' immediate transition is made
   from the words out of Galilee ariseth no prophet,' in ch. vii. 52, to
   the words Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying,' in ch. viii.
   12. And we are invited by all the adverse Critics alike to believe that
   so the place stood in the inspired autograph of the Evangelist.

   But the thing is incredible. Look back at what is contained between ch.
   vii. 37 and 52, and note--(a) That two hostile parties crowded the
   Temple courts (ver. 40-42): (b) That some were for laying violent hands
   on our LORD (ver. 44): (c) That the Sanhedrin, being assembled in
   debate, were reproaching their servants for not having brought Him
   prisoner, and disputing one against another [580] (ver. 45-52). How can
   the Evangelist have proceeded,--Again therefore Jesus spake unto them,
   saying, I am the light of the world'? What is it supposed then that St.
   John meant when he wrote such words?

   But on the contrary, survey the context in any ordinary copy of the New
   Testament, and his meaning is perfectly clear. The last great day of
   the Feast of Tabernacles is ended. It is the morrow and very early in
   the morning.' The Holy One has again presented Himself in the Temple'
   where on the previous night He so narrowly escaped violence at the
   hands of His enemies, and He teaches the people. While thus
   engaged,--the time, the place, His own occupation suggesting thoughts
   of peace and holiness and love,--a rabble rout, headed by the Scribes
   and Pharisees, enter on the foulest of errands; and we all remember
   with how little success. Such an interruption need not have occupied
   much time. The Woman's accusers having departed, our Saviour resumes
   His discourse which had been broken off. Again therefore' it is said in
   ver. 12, with clear and frequent reference to what had preceded in ver.
   2--Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of the world.' And had
   not that saying of His reference as well to the thick cloud of moral
   darkness which His words, a few moments before, had succeeded in
   dispelling, as to the orb of glory which already flooded the Temple
   Court with the effulgence of its rising,--His own visible emblem and
   image in the Heavens? . . . I protest that with the incident of the
   woman taken in adultery,'--so introduced, so dismissed,--all is lucid
   and coherent: without those connecting links, the story is scarcely
   intelligible. These twelve disputed verses, so far from fatally
   interrupting the course of St. John's Gospel, if retained in the text
   [581] ,' prove to be even necessary for the logical coherency of the
   entire context in which they stand.

   But even that is not all. On close and careful inspection, the
   mysterious texture of the narrative, no less than its edifying and
   eminently Christian' character, vindicates for the Pericope de adultera
   a right to its place in the Gospel. Let me endeavour to explain what
   seems to be its spiritual significancy: in other words, to interpret
   the transaction.

   The Scribes and Pharisees bring a woman to our Saviour on a charge of
   adultery. The sin prevailed to such an extent among the Jews that the
   Divine enactments concerning one so accused had long since fallen into
   practical oblivion. On the present occasion our Lord is observed to
   revive His own ancient ordinance after a hitherto unheard of fashion.
   The trial by the bitter water, or water of conviction [582] , was a
   species of ordeal, intended for the vindication of innocence, the
   conviction of guilt. But according to the traditional belief the test
   proved inefficacious, unless the husband was himself innocent of the
   crime whereof he accused his wife.

   Let the provisions of the law, contained in Num. v. 16 to 24, be now
   considered. The accused Woman having been brought near, and set before
   the Lord, the priest took holy water in an earthen vessel,' and put of
   the dust of the, floor of the tabernacle into the water.' Then, with
   the bitter water that causeth the curse in his hand, he charged the
   woman by an oath. Next, he wrote the curses in a book and blotted them
   out with the bitter water; causing the woman to drink the bitter water
   that causeth the curse. Whereupon if she were guilty, she fell under a
   terrible penalty,--her body testifying visibly to her sin. If she was
   innocent, nothing followed.

   And now, who sees not that the Holy One dealt with His hypocritical
   assailants, as if they had been the accused parties? Into the presence
   of incarnate Jehovah verily they had been brought: and perhaps when He
   stooped down and wrote upon the ground, it was a bitter sentence
   against the adulterer and adulteress which He wrote. We have but to
   assume some connexion between the curse which He thus traced in the
   dust of the floor of the tabernacle' and the words which He uttered
   with His lips, and He may with truth be declared to have taken of the
   dust and put in on the water,' and caused them to drink of the bitter
   water which causeth the curse.' For when, by His Holy Spirit, our great
   High Priest in His human flesh addressed these adulterers,--what did He
   but present them with living water [583] in an earthen vessel [584] '?
   Did He not further charge them with an oath of cursing, saying, If ye
   have not gone aside to uncleanness, be ye free from this bitter water:
   but if ye be defiled --On being presented with which alternative, did
   they not, self-convicted, go out one by one? And what else was this but
   their own acquittal of the sinful woman, for whose condemnation they
   shewed themselves so impatient? Surely it was the water of conviction'
   (to hudor tou elegmou) as it is six times called, which they had been
   compelled to drink; whereupon, convicted (elenchomenoi) by their own
   conscience,' as St. John relates, they had pronounced the other's
   acquittal. Finally, note that by Himself declining to condemn' the
   accused woman, our Lord also did in effect blot out those curses which
   He had already written against her in the dust,--when He made the floor
   of the sanctuary His book.'

   Whatever may be thought of the foregoing exposition--and I am not
   concerned to defend it in every detail,--on turning to the opposite
   contention, we are struck with the slender amount of actual proof with
   which the assailants of this passage seem to be furnished. Their
   evidence is mostly negative--a proceeding which is constantly observed
   to attend a bad cause: and they are prone to make up for the feebleness
   of their facts by the strength of their assertions. But my experience,
   as one who has given a considerable amount of attention to such
   subjects, tells me that the narrative before us carries on its front
   the impress of Divine origin. I venture to think that it vindicates for
   itself a high, unearthly meaning. It seems to me that it cannot be the
   work of a fabricator. The more I study it, the more I am impressed with
   its Divinity. And in what goes before I have been trying to make the
   reader a partaker of my own conviction.

   To come now to particulars, we may readily see from its very texture
   that it must needs have been woven in a heavenly loom. Only too obvious
   is the remark that the very subject-matter of the chief transaction
   recorded in these twelve verses, would be sufficient in and by itself
   to preclude the suspicion that these twelve verses are a spurious
   addition to the genuine Gospel. And then we note how entirely in St.
   John's manner is the little explanatory clause in ver. 6,--This they
   said, tempting Him, that they might have to accuse Him [585] .' We are
   struck besides by the prominence given in verses 6 and 8 to the act of
   writing,--allusions to which, are met with in every work of the last
   Evangelist [586] . It does not of course escape us how utterly beyond
   the reach of a Western interpolator would have been the insertion of
   the article so faithfully retained to this hour before lithon in ver.
   7. On completing our survey, as to the assertions that the pericope de
   adultera has no right to a place in the text of the four Gospels,'-- is
   clearly a Western interpolation, though not Western of the earliest
   type [587] ,' (whatever that may mean), and so forth,--we can but
   suspect that the authors very imperfectly realize the difficulty of the
   problem with which they have to deal. Dr. Hort finally assures us that
   no accompanying marks would prevent' this portion of Scripture from
   fatally interrupting the course of St. John's Gospel if retained in the
   text': and when they relegate it accordingly to a blank page at the end
   of the Gospels within double brackets,' in order to shew its inferior
   authority';--we can but read and wonder at the want of perception, not
   to speak of the coolness, which they display. Quousque tandem?

   But it is time to turn from such considerations as the foregoing, and
   to inquire for the direct testimony, which is assumed by recent Editors
   and Critics to be fatal to these twelve verses. Tischendorf pronounces
   it absolutely certain that this narrative was not written by St. John
   [588] .' One, vastly his superior in judgement (Dr. Scrivener) declares
   that on all intelligent principles of mere Criticism, the passage must
   needs be abandoned [589] .' Tregelles is fully satisfied that this
   narrative is not a genuine part of St. John's Gospel [590] .' Alford
   shuts it up in brackets, and like Tregelles puts it into his footnotes.
   Westcott and Hort, harsher than any of their predecessors, will not, as
   we have seen, allow it to appear even at the foot of the page. To
   reproduce all that has been written in disparagement of this precious
   portion of God's written Word would be a joyless and an unprofitable
   task. According to Green, the genuineness of the passage cannot be
   maintained [591] .' Hammond is of opinion that it would be more
   satisfactory to separate it from its present context, and place it by
   itself as an appendix to the Gospel [592] .' A yet more recent critic
   sums up,' that the external evidence must be held fatal to the
   genuineness of the passage [593] .' The opinions of Bishops Wordsworth,
   Ellicott, and Lightfoot, shall be respectfully commented upon
   by-and-by. In the meantime, I venture to join issue with every one of
   these learned persons. I contend that on all intelligent principles of
   sound Criticism the passage before us must be maintained to be genuine
   Scripture; and that without a particle of doubt. I cannot even admit
   that it has been transmitted to us under circumstances widely different
   from those connected with any other passage of Scripture whatever [594]
   .' I contend that it has been transmitted in precisely the same way as
   all the rest of Scripture, and therefore exhibits the same notes of
   genuineness as any other twelve verses of the same Gospel which can be
   named: but--like countless other places--it is found for whatever
   reason to have given offence in certain quarters: and in consequence
   has experienced very ill usage at the hands of the ancients and of the
   moderns also:--but especially of the latter. In other words, these
   twelve verses exhibit the required notes of genuineness less
   conspicuously than any other twelve consecutive verses in the same
   Gospel. But that is all. The one only question to be decided is the
   following:--On a review of the whole of the evidence,--is it more
   reasonable to stigmatize these twelve verses as a spurious accretion to
   the Gospel? Or to admit that they must needs be accounted to be
   genuine? . . . I shall shew that they are at this hour supported by a
   weight of testimony which is absolutely overwhelming. I read with
   satisfaction that my own convictions were shared by Mill, Matthaei,
   Adler, Scholz, Vercellone. I have also the learned Ceriani on my side.
   I should have been just as confident had I stood alone:--such is the
   imperative strength of the evidence.

   To begin then. Tischendorf--(who may be taken as a fair sample of the
   assailants of this passage)--commences by stating roundly that the
   Pericope is omitted by 'ABCLTXD, and about seventy cursives. I will say
   at once, that no sincere inquirer after truth could so state the
   evidence. It is in fact not a true statement. A and C are hereabout
   defective. No longer possible therefore is it to know with certainty
   what they either did, or did not, contain. But this is not merely all.
   I proceed to offer a few words concerning Cod. A.

   Woide, the learned and accurate [595] editor of the Codex Alexandrinus,
   remarked (in 1785)--Historia adulterae videtur in hoc codice defuisse.'
   But this modest inference of his, subsequent Critics have represented
   as an ascertained fact, Tischendorf announces it as certissimum.' Let
   me be allowed to investigate the problem for myself. Woide's
   calculation,--(which has passed unchallenged for nearly a hundred
   years, and on the strength of which it is now-a-days assumed that Cod.
   A must have exactly resembled Codd. 'B in omitting the pericope de
   adultera,)--was far too roughly made to be of any critical use [596] .

   Two leaves of Cod. A have been here lost: viz. from the word katabainon
   in vi. 50 to the word legeis in viii. 52: a lacuna (as I find by
   counting the letters in a copy of the ordinary text) of as nearly as
   possible 8,805 letters,--allowing for contractions, and of course not
   reckoning St. John vii. 53 to viii. 11. Now, in order to estimate
   fairly how many letters the two lost leaves actually contained, I have
   inquired for the sums of the letters on the leaf immediately preceding,
   and also on the leaf immediately succeeding the hiatus; and I find them
   to be respectively 4,337 and 4,303: together, 8,640 letters. But this,
   it will be seen, is insufficient by 165 letters, or eight lines, for
   the assumed contents of these two missing leaves. Are we then to
   suppose that one leaf exhibited somewhere a blank space equivalent to
   eight lines? Impossible, I answer. There existed, on the contrary, a
   considerable redundancy of matter in at least the second of those two
   lost leaves. This is proved by the circumstance that the first column
   on the next ensuing leaf exhibits the unique phenomenon of being
   encumbered, at its summit, by two very long lines (containing together
   fifty-eight letters), for which evidently no room could be found on the
   page which immediately preceded. But why should there have been any
   redundancy of matter at all? Something extraordinary must have produced
   it. What if the Pericope de adultera, without being actually inserted
   in full, was recognized by Cod. A? What if the scribe had proceeded as
   far as the fourth word of St. John viii. 3, and then had suddenly
   checked himself? We cannot tell what appearance St. John vii. 53-viii.
   11 presented in Codex A, simply because the entire leaf which should
   have contained it is lost. Enough however has been said already to
   prove that it is incorrect and unfair to throw 'AB into one and the
   same category,--with a certissimum,'--as Tischendorf does.

   As for L and D, they exhibit a vacant space after St. John vii.
   52,--which testifies to the consciousness of the copyists that they
   were leaving out something. These are therefore witnesses for,--not
   witnesses against,--the passage under discussion.--X being a Commentary
   on the Gospel as it was read in Church, of course leaves the passage
   out.--The only uncial MSS. therefore which simply leave out the
   pericope, are the three following--'BT: and the degree of attention to
   which such an amount of evidence is entitled, has been already proved
   to be wondrous small. We cannot forget moreover that the two former of
   these copies enjoy the unenviable distinction of standing alone on a
   memorable occasion:--they alone exhibit St. Mark's Gospel mutilated in
   respect of its twelve concluding verses.

   But I shall be reminded that about seventy MSS. of later date are
   without the pericope de adultera: that the first Greek Father who
   quotes the pericope is Euthymius in the twelfth century: that
   Tertullian, Origen, Chrysostom, Cyril, Nonnus, Cosmas, Theophylact,
   knew nothing of it: and that it is not contained in the Syriac, the
   Gothic, or the Egyptian versions. Concerning every one of which
   statements I remark over again that no sincere lover of Truth,
   supposing him to understand the matter about which he is disputing,
   could so exhibit the evidence for this particular problem. First,
   because so to state it is to misrepresent the entire case. Next,
   because some of the articles of indictment are only half true:--in fact
   are untrue. But chiefly, because in the foregoing enumeration certain
   considerations are actually suppressed which, had they been fairly
   stated, would have been found to reverse the issue. Let me now be
   permitted to conduct this inquiry in my own way.

   The first thing to be done is to enable the reader clearly to
   understand what the problem before him actually is. Twelve verses then,
   which, as a matter of fact, are found dovetailed into a certain context
   of St. John's Gospel, the Critics insist must now be dislodged. But do
   the Critics in question prove that they must? For unless they do, there
   is no help for it but the pericope de adultera must be left where it
   is. I proceed to shew first, that it is im possible, on any rational
   principle to dislodge these twelve verses from their actual
   context.--Next, I shall point out that the facts adduced in evidence
   and relied on by the assailants of the passage, do not by any means
   prove the point they are intended to prove; but admit of a sufficient
   and satisfactory explanation.--Thirdly, it shall be shewn that the said
   explanation carries with it, and implies, a weight of testimony in
   support of the twelve verses in dispute, which is absolutely
   overwhelming.--Lastly, the positive evidence in favour of these twelve
   verses shall be proved to outweigh largely the negative evidence, which
   is relied upon by those who contend for their removal. To some people I
   may seem to express myself with too much confidence. Let it then be
   said once for all, that my confidence is inspired by the strength of
   the arguments which are now to be unfolded. When the Author of Holy
   Scripture supplies such proofs of His intentions, I cannot do otherwise
   than rest implicit confidence in them.

   Now I begin by establishing as my firtt proposition that,

   (1) These twelve verses occupied precisely the same position which they
   now occupy from the earliest period to which evidence concerning the
   Gospels reaches.

   And this, because it is a mere matter of fact, is sufficiently
   established by reference to the ancient Latin version of St. John's
   Gospel. We are thus carried back to the second century of our era:
   beyond which, testimony does not reach. The pericope is observed to
   stand in situ in Codd. b c e ff^2 g h j. Jerome (A.D. 385), after a
   careful survey of older Greek copies, did not hesitate to retain it in
   the Vulgate. It is freely referred to and commented on by himself [597]
   in Palestine: while Ambrose at Milan (374) quotes it at least nine
   times [598] ; as well as Augustine in North Africa (396) about twice as
   often [599] . It is quoted besides by Pacian [600] , in the north of
   Spain (370),--by Faustus [601] the African (400),--by Rufinus [602] at
   Aquileia (400),--by Chrysologus [603] at Ravenna (433),--by Sedulius
   [604] a Scot (434). The unknown authors of two famous treatises [605]
   written at the same period, largely quote this portion of the
   narrative. It is referred to by Victorius or Victorinus (457),--by
   Vigilius of Tapsus [606] (484) in North Africa,--by Gelasius [607] ,
   bp. of Rome (492),--by Cassiodorus [608] in Southern Italy,--by Gregory
   the Great [609] , and by other Fathers of the Western Church.

   To this it is idle to object that the authors cited all wrote in Latin.
   For the purpose in hand their evidence is every bit as conclusive as if
   they had written in Greek,--from which language no one doubts that they
   derived their knowledge, through a translation. But in fact we are not
   left to Latin authorities. [Out of thirty-eight copies of the Bohairic
   version the pericope de adultera is read in fifteen, but in three forms
   which will be printed in the Oxford edition. In the remaining
   twenty-three, it is left out.] How is it intelligible that this passage
   is thus found in nearly half the copies--except on the hypothesis that
   they formed an integral part of the Memphitic version? They might have
   been easily omitted: but how could they have been inserted?

   Once more. The Ethiopic version (fifth century),--the Palestinian
   Syriac (which is referred to the fifth century),--the Georgian
   (probably fifth or sixth century),--to say nothing of the Slavonic,
   Arabic and Persian versions, which are of later date,--all contain the
   portion of narrative in dispute. The Armenian version also
   (fourth-fifth century) originally contained it; though it survives at
   present in only a few copies. Add that it is found in Cod. D, and it
   will be seen that in all parts of ancient Christendom this portion of
   Scripture was familiarly known in early times.

   But even this is not all. Jerome, who was familiar with Greek MSS. (and
   who handled none of later date than B and '), expressly relates (380)
   that the pericope de adultera is found in many copies both Greek and
   Latin [610] .' He calls attention to the fact that what is rendered
   sine peccato' is anamartetos in the Greek: and lets fall an exegetical
   remark which shews that he was familiar with copies which exhibited (in
   ver. 8) egraphen enos ekastou auton tas amartias,--a reading which
   survives to this day in one uncial (U) and at least eighteen cursive
   copies of the fourth Gospel [611] . Whence is it--let me ask in
   passing--that go many Critics fail to see that positive testimony like
   the foregoing far outweighs the adverse negative testimony of
   'BT,--aye, and of AC to boot if they were producible on this point? How
   comes it to pass that the two Codexes, ' and B, have obtained such a
   mastery--rather exercise such a tyranny--over the imagination of many
   Critics as quite to overpower their practical judgement? We have at all
   events established our first proposition: viz. that from the earliest
   period to which testimony reaches, the incident of the woman taken in
   adultery' occupied its present place in St. John's Gospel. The Critics
   eagerly remind us that in four cursive copies (13, 69, 124, 346), the
   verses in question are found tacked on to the end of St. Luke xxi. But
   have they then forgotten that these four Codexes are derived from a
   common archetype,' and therefore represent one and the same ancient
   and, I may add, corrupt copy? The same Critics are reminded that in the
   same four Codexes [commonly called the Ferrar Group] the agony and
   bloody sweat' (St. Luke xxii. 43, 44) is found thrust into St.
   Matthew's Gospel between ch. xxvi. 39 and 40. Such licentiousness on
   the part of a solitary exemplar of the Gospels no more affects the
   proper place of these or of those verses than the superfluous digits of
   a certain man of Gath avail to disturb the induction that to either
   hand of a human being appertain but five fingers, and to either foot
   but five toes.

   It must be admitted then that as far back as testimony reaches the
   passage under discussion stood where it now stands in St. John's
   Gospel. And this is my first position. But indeed, to be candid, hardly
   any one has seriously called that fact in question. No, nor do any
   (except Dr. Hort [612] ) doubt that the passage is also of the remotest
   antiquity. Adverse Critics do but insist that however ancient, it must
   needs be of spurious origin: or else that it is an afterthought of the
   Evangelist:--concerning both which imaginations we shall have a few
   words to offer by-and-by.

   It clearly follows,--indeed it may be said with truth that it only
   remains,--to inquire what may have led to its so frequent exclusion
   from the sacred Text? For really the difficulty has already resolved
   itself into that.

   And on this head, it is idle to affect perplexity. In the earliest age
   of all,--the age which was familiar with the universal decay of heathen
   virtue, but which had not yet witnessed the power of the Gospel to
   fashion society afresh, and to build up domestic life on a new and more
   enduring basis;--at a time when the greatest laxity of morals
   prevailed, and the enemies of the Gospel were known to be on the look
   out for grounds of cavil against Christianity and its Author;--what
   wonder if some were found to remove the pericope de adultera from their
   copies, lest it should be pleaded in extenuation of breaches of the
   seventh commandment? The very subject-matter, I say, of St. John viii.
   3-11 would sufficiently account for the occasional omission of those
   nine verses. Moral considerations abundantly explain what is found to
   have here and there happened. But in fact this is not a mere conjecture
   of my own. It is the reason assigned by Augustine for the erasure of
   these twelve verses from many copies of the Gospel [613] . Ambrose, a
   quarter of a century earlier, had clearly intimated that danger was
   popularly apprehended from this quarter [614] : while Nicon, five
   centuries later, states plainly that the mischievous tendency of the
   narrative was the cause why it had been expunged from the Armenian
   version [615] . Accordingly, just a few Greek copies are still to be
   found mutilated in respect of those nine verses only. But in fact the
   indications are not a few that all the twelve verses under discussion
   did not by any means labour under the same degree of disrepute. The
   first three (as I shewed at the outset) clearly belong to a different
   category from the last nine,--a circumstance which has been too much
   overlooked.

   The Church in the meantime for an obvious reason had made choice of St.
   John vii. 37-viii. 12--the greater part of which is clearly descriptive
   of what happened at the Feast of Tabernacles--for her Pentecostal
   lesson: and judged it expedient, besides omitting as inappropriate to
   the occasion the incident of the woman taken in adultery, to ignore
   also the three preceding verses;--making the severance begin, in fact,
   as far back as the end of ch. vii. 52. The reason for this is plain. In
   this way the allusion to a certain departure at night, and return early
   next morning (St. John vii. 53: viii. 1), was avoided, which entirely
   marred the effect of the lection as the history of a day of great and
   special solemnity,--the great day of the Feast.' And thus it happens
   that the gospel for the day of Pentecost was made to proceed directly
   from Search and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet,' in ch.
   vii. 52,--to Then spake Jesus unto them, saying, I am the light of the
   world,' in ch. viii. 12; with which it ends. In other words, an
   omission which owed its beginning to a moral scruple was eventually
   extended for a liturgical consideration; and resulted in severing
   twelve verses of St. John's Gospel--ch. vii. 53 to viii. 11--from their
   lawful context.

   We may now proceed to the consideration of my second proposition, which
   is

   (2) That by the very construction of her Lectionary, the Church in her
   corporate capacity and official character has solemnly recognized the
   narrative in question as an integral part of St. John's Gospel, and as
   standing in its traditional place, from an exceedingly remote time.

   Take into your hands at random the first MS. copy of St. John's Gospel
   which presents itself, and turn to the place in question. Nay, I will
   instance all the four Evangelia which I call mine,--all the seventeen
   which belong to Lord Zouch,--all the thirty-nine which Baroness
   Burdett-Coutts imported from Epirus in 1870-2. Now all these
   copies--(and nearly each of them represents a different line of
   ancestry)--are found to contain the verses in question. How did the
   verses ever get there?

   But the most extraordinary circumstance of the case is behind. Some out
   of the Evangelia referred to are observed to have been prepared for
   ecclesiastical use: in other words, are so rubricated throughout as to
   shew where. every separate lection had its beginning' (arche), and
   where its end' (telos). And some of these lections are made up of
   disjointed portions of the Gospel. Thus, the lection for Whitsunday is
   found to have extended from St. John vii. 37 to St. John viii. 12;
   beginning at the words te escha'te eme'ra te mega'le, and ending--to`
   phos tes zoes: but over-leaping the twelve verses now under discussion:
   viz. vii. 53 to viii. 11. Accordingly, the word over-leap' (huperba) is
   written in all the copies after vii. 52,--whereby the reader, having
   read on to the end of that verse, was directed to skip all that
   followed down to the words kai` meke'ti ama'rtane in ch. viii. 11:
   after which he found himself instructed to "recommence' (arxai). Again
   I ask (and this time does not the riddle admit of only one
   solution?),-- When and how does the reader suppose that the narrative
   of the woman taken in adultery' first found its way into the middle of
   the lesson for Pentecost? I pause for an answer: I shall perforce be
   told that it never found its way' into the lection at all: but having
   once crept into St. John's Gospel, however that may have been effected,
   and established itself there, it left those ancient men who devised the
   Church's Lectionary without choice. They could but direct its omission,
   and employ for that purpose the established liturgical formula in all
   similar cases.

   But first,--How is it that those who would reject the narrative are not
   struck by the essential foolishness of supposing that twelve fabricated
   verses, purporting to be an integral part of the fourth Gospel, can
   have so firmly established themselves in every part of Christendom from
   the second century downwards, that they have long since become simply
   ineradicable? Did the Church then, pro hac vice, abdicate her function
   of being a witness and a keeper of Holy Writ'? Was she all of a sudden
   forsaken by the inspiring Spirit, who, as she was promised, should
   guide her into all Truth'? And has she been all down the ages guided
   into the grievous error of imputing to the disciple whom Jesus loved a
   narrative of which he knew nothing? For, as I remarked at the outset,
   this is not merely an assimilated expression, or an unauthorized
   nominative, or a weakly-supported clause, or any such trifling thing.
   Although be it remarked in passing, I am not aware of a single such
   trifling excrescence which we are not able at once to detect and to
   remove. In other words, this is not at all a question, like the rest,
   about the genuine text of a passage. Our inquiry is of an essentially
   different kind, viz. Are these twelve consecutive verses Scripture at
   all, or not? Divine or human? Which? They claim by their very structure
   and contents to be an integral part of the Gospel. And such a serious
   accession to the Deposit, I insist, can neither have crept into' the
   Text, nor have crept out' of it. The thing is unexampled, --is
   unapproached,--is impossible.

   Above all,--(the reader is entreated to give the subject his sustained
   attention),--Is it not perceived that the admission involved in the
   hypothesis before us is fatal to any rational pretence that the passage
   is of spurious origin? We have got back in thought at least to the
   third or fourth century of our era. We are among the Fathers and
   Doctors of the Eastern Church in conference assembled: and they are
   determining what shall be the Gospel for the great Festival of
   Pentecost. It shall begin' (say they) at the thirty-seventh verse of
   St. John vii, and conclude with the twelfth verse of St. John viii. But
   so much of it as relates to the breaking up of the Sanhedrin,--to the
   withdrawal of our Lord to the Mount of Olives,--and to His return next
   morning to the Temple,--had better not be read. It disturbs the unity
   of the narrative. So also had the incident of the woman taken in
   adultery better not be read. It is inappropriate to the Pentecostal
   Festival.' The Authors of the great Oriental Liturgy therefore admit
   that they find the disputed verses in their copies: and thus they vouch
   for their genuineness. For none will doubt that, had they regarded them
   as a spurious accretion to the inspired page, they would have said so
   plainly. Nor can it be denied that if in their corporate capacity they
   had disallowed these twelve verses, such an authoritative condemnation
   would most certainly have resulted in the perpetual exclusion from the
   Sacred Text of the part of these verses which was actually adopted as a
   Lection. What stronger testimony on the contrary can be imagined to the
   genuineness of any given portion of the everlasting Gospel than that it
   should have been canonized or recognized as part of Inspired Scripture
   by the collective wisdom of the Church in the third or fourth century?

   And no one may regard it as a suspicious circumstance that the present
   Pentecostal lection has been thus maimed and mutilated in respect of
   twelve of its verses. There is nothing at all extraordinary in the
   treatment which St. John vii. 37-viii. 12 has here experienced. The
   phenomenon is even of perpetual recurrence in the Lectionary of the
   East,--as will be found explained below [616] .

   Permit me to suppose that, between the Treasury and Whitehall, the
   remote descendant of some Saxon thane occupied a small tenement and
   garden which stood in the very middle of the ample highway. Suppose
   further, the property thereabouts being Government property, that the
   road on either side of this estate had been measured a hundred times,
   and jealously watched, ever since Westminster became Westminster. Well,
   an act of Parliament might no doubt compel the supposed proprietor of
   this singular estate to surrender his patrimony; but I submit that no
   government lawyer would ever think of setting up the plea that the
   owner of that peculiar strip of land was an impostor. The man might
   have no title-deeds to produce, to be sure; but counsel for the
   defendant would plead that neither did he require any. This man's
   title' (counsel would say) is--occupation for a thousand years. His
   evidences are--the allowance of the State throughout that long
   interval. Every procession to St. Stephen's--every procession to the
   Abbey--has swept by defendant's property--on this side of it and on
   that,--since the days of Edward the Confessor. And if my client refuses
   to quit the soil, I defy you--except by violence--to get rid of him.'

   In this way then it is that the testimony borne to these verses by the
   Lectionary of the East proves to be of the most opportune and
   convincing character. The careful provision made for passing by the
   twelve verses in dispute:--the minute directions which fence those
   twelve verses off on this side and on that, directions issued we may be
   sure by the highest Ecclesiastical authority, because recognized in
   every part of the ancient Church,--not only establish them effectually
   in their rightful place, but (what is at least of equal importance)
   fully explain the adverse phenomena which are ostentatiously paraded by
   adverse critics; and which, until the clue has been supplied, are
   calculated to mislead the judgement.

   For now, for the first time, it becomes abundantly plain why Chrysostom
   and Cyril, in publicly commenting on St. John's Gospel, pass straight
   from ch. vii. 52 to ch. viii. 12. Of course they do. Why should
   they,--how could they,--comment on what was not publicly read before
   the congregation? The same thing is related (in a well-known scholium')
   to have been done by Apolinarius and Theodore of Mopsuestia. Origen
   also, for aught I care,--though the adverse critics have no right to
   claim him, seeing that his commentary on all that part of St. John's
   Gospel is lost;but Origen's name, as I was saying, for aught I care,
   may be added to those who did the same thing. A triumphant refutation
   of the proposed inference from the silence of these many Fathers is
   furnished by the single fact that Theophylact must also be added to
   their number. Theophylact, I say, ignores the pericope de
   adultera--passes it by, I mean,--exactly as do Chrysostom and Cyril.
   But will any one pretend that Theophylact,--writing in A.D. 1077,--did
   not know of St. John vii. 53-viii. 11? Why, in nineteen out of every
   twenty copies within his reach, the whole of those twelve verses must
   have been to be found.

   The proposed inference from the silence of certain of the Fathers is
   therefore invalid. The argument e silentio--always an insecure
   argument,--proves inapplicable in this particular case. When the
   antecedent facts have been once explained, all the subsequent phenomena
   become intelligible. But a more effectual and satisfactory reply to the
   difficulty occasioned by the general silence of the Fathers, remains to
   be offered.

   There underlies the appeal to Patristic authority an opinion,--not
   expressed indeed, yet consciously entertained by us all,--which in fact
   gives the appeal all its weight and cogency, and which must now by all
   means be brought to the front. The fact that the Fathers of the Church
   were not only her Doctors and Teachers, but also the living voices by
   which alone her mind could be proclaimed to the world, and by which her
   decrees used to be authoritatively promulgated;--this fact, I say, it
   is which makes their words, whenever they deliver themselves, so very
   important: their approval, if they approve, so weighty; their
   condemnation, if they condemn, so fatal. But then, in the present
   instance, they do not condemn. They neither approve nor condemn. They
   simply say nothing. They are silent: and in what precedes, I have
   explained the reason why. We wish it had been otherwise. We would give
   a great deal to persuade those ancient oracles to speak on the subject
   of these twelve verses: but they are all but inexorably silent. Nay, I
   am overstating the case against myself. Two of the greatest Fathers
   (Augustine and Ambrose) actually do utter a few words; and they are to
   the effect that the verses are undoubtedly genuine:--Be it known to all
   men' (they say) that this passage is genuine: but the nature of its
   subject-matter has at once procured its ejection from MSS., and
   resulted in the silence of Commentators.' The most learned of the
   Fathers in addition practically endorses the passage; for Jerome not
   only leaves it standing in the Vulgate where he found it in the Old
   Latin version, but relates that it was supported by Greek as well as
   Latin authorities.

   To proceed however with what I was about to say.

   It is the authoritative sentence of the Church then on this difficult
   subject that we desiderate. We resorted to the Fathers for that:
   intending to regard any quotations of theirs, however brief, as their
   practical endorsement of all the twelve verses: to infer from their
   general recognition of the passage, that the Church in her collective
   capacity accepted it likewise. As I have shewn, the Fathers decline,
   almost to a man, to return any answer. But,--Are we then without the
   Church's authoritative guidance on this subject? For this, I repeat, is
   the only thing of which we are in search. It was only in order to get
   at this that we adopted the laborious expedient of watching for the
   casual utterances of any of the giants of old time. Are we, I say, left
   without the Church's opinion?

   Not so, I answer. The reverse is the truth. The great Eastern Church
   speaks out on this subject in a voice of thunder. In all her
   Patriarchates, as far back as the written records of her practice
   reach,--and they reach back to the time of those very Fathers whose
   silence we felt to be embarrassing,--the Eastern Church has selected
   nine out of these twelve verses to be the special lesson for October 8.
   A more significant circumstance it would be impossible to adduce in
   evidence. Any pretence to fasten a charge of spuriousness on a portion
   of Scripture so singled out by the Church for honour, were nothing else
   but monstrous. It would be in fact to raise quite a distinct issue:
   viz. to inquire what amount of respect is due to the Church's authority
   in determining the authenticity of Scripture? I appeal not to an
   opinion, but to a fact: and that fact is, that though the Fathers of
   the Church for a very sufficient reason are very nearly silent on the
   subject of these twelve verses, the Church herself has spoken with a
   voice of authority so loud that none can affect not to hear it: so
   plain, that it cannot possibly be misunderstood.

   And let me not be told that I am hereby setting up the Lectionary as
   the true standard of appeal for the Text of the New Testament: still
   less let me be suspected of charging on the collective body of the
   faithful whatever irregularities are discoverable in the Codexes which
   were employed for the public reading of Scripture. Such a suspicion
   could only be entertained by one who has hitherto failed to apprehend
   the precise point just now under consideration. We are not examining
   the text of St. John vii. 53-viii. 11. We are only discussing whether
   those twelve verses en bloc are to be regarded as an integral part of
   the fourth Gospel, or as a spurious accretion to it. And that is a
   point on which the Church in her corporate character must needs be
   competent to pronounce; and in respect of which her verdict must needs
   be decisive. She delivered her verdict in favour of these twelve
   verses, remember, at a time when her copies of the Gospels were of
   papyrus as well as old uncials' on vellum.--Nay, before old uncials' on
   vellum were at least in any general use. True, that the transcribers of
   Lectionaries have proved themselves just as liable to error as the men
   who transcribed Evangelia. But then, it is incredible that those men
   forged the Gospel for St. Pelagia's day: impossible, if it were a
   forgery, that the Church should have adopted it. And it is the
   significancy of the Church having adopted the pericope de adultera as
   the lection for October 8, which has never yet been sufficiently
   attended to: and which I defy the Critics to account for on any
   hypothesis but one: viz. that the pericope was recognized by the
   ancient Eastern Church as an integral part of the Gospel.

   Now when to this has been added what is implied in the rubrical
   direction that a ceremonious respect should be shewn to the Festival of
   Pentecost by dropping the twelve verses, I submit that I have fully
   established my second position, viz. That by the very construction of
   her Lectionary the Church in her corporate capacity and official
   character has solemnly recognized the narrative in question, as an
   integral part of St. John's Gospel, and as standing in its traditional
   place, from an exceedingly remote time.

   For,--(I entreat the candid reader's sustained attention),--the
   circumstances of the present problem altogether refuse to accommodate
   themselves to any hypothesis of a spurious original for these verses;
   as I proceed to shew.

   Repair in thought to any collection of MSS. you please; suppose to the
   British Museum. Request to be shewn their seventy-three copies of St.
   John's Gospel, and turn to the close of his seventh chapter. At that
   particular place you will find, in sixty-one of these copies, these
   twelve verses: and in thirty-five of them you will discover, after the
   words Prophe'tes ek tes Galilai'as ouk eg. a rubrical note to the
   effect that on Whitsunday, these twelve verses are to be dropped; and
   the reader is to go on at ch. viii. 12.' What can be the meaning of
   this respectful treatment of the Pericope in question? How can it ever
   have come to pass that it has been thus ceremoniously handled all down
   the ages? Surely on no possible view of the matter but one can the
   phenomenon just now described be accounted for. Else, will any one
   gravely pretend to tell me that at some indefinitely remote period, (1)
   These verses were fabricated: (2) Were thrust into the place they at
   present occupy in the sacred text: (3) Were unsuspectingly believed to
   be genuine by the Church; and in consequence of which they were at once
   passed over by her direction on Whitsunday as incongruous, and
   appointed by the Church to be read on October 8, as appropriate to the
   occasion?

   (3) But further. How is it proposed to explain why one of St. John's
   after-thoughts should have fared so badly at the Church's
   hands;--another, so well? I find it suggested that perhaps the
   subject-matter may sufficiently account for all that has happened to
   the pericope de adultera: And so it may, no doubt. But then, once admit
   this, and the hypothesis under consideration becomes simply nugatory:
   fails even to touch the difficulty which it professes to remove. For if
   men were capable of thinking scorn of these twelve verses when they
   found them in the second and improved edition of St. John's Gospel,'
   why may they not have been just as irreverent in respect of the same
   verses, when they appeared in the first edition? How is it one whit
   more probable that every Greek Father for a thousand years should have
   systematically overlooked the twelve verses in dispute when they
   appeared in the second edition of St. John's Gospel, than that the same
   Fathers should have done the same thing when they appeared in the first
   [617] ?

   (4) But the hypothesis is gratuitous and nugatory: for it has been
   invented in order to account for the phenomenon that whereas twelve
   verses of St. John's Gospel are found in the large majority of the
   later Copies,--the same verses are observed to be absent from all but
   one of the five oldest Codexes. But how, (I wish to be informed,) is
   that hypothesis supposed to square with these phenomena? It cannot be
   meant that the second edition' of St. John did not come abroad until
   after Codd. 'ABCT were written? For we know that the old Italic version
   (a document of the second century) contains all the three portions of
   narrative which are claimed for the second edition. But if this is not
   meant, it is plain that some further hypothesis must be invented in
   order to explain why certain Greek MSS. of the fourth and fifth
   centuries are without the verses in dispute. And this fresh hypothesis
   will render that under consideration (as I said) nugatory and shew that
   it was gratuitous.

   What chiefly offends me however in this extraordinary suggestion is its
   irreverence. It assumes that the Gospel according to St. John was
   composed like any ordinary modern book: capable therefore of being
   improved in the second edition, by recension, addition, omission,
   retractation, or what not. For we may not presume to limit the changes
   effected in a second edition. And yet the true Author of the Gospel is
   confessedly God the Holy Ghost: and I know of no reason for supposing
   that His works are imperfect when they proceed forth from His Hands.

   The cogency of what precedes has in fact weighed so powerfully with
   thoughtful and learned Divines that they have felt themselves
   constrained, as their last resource, to cast about for some hypothesis
   which shall at once account for the absence of these verses from so
   many copies of St. John's Gospel, and yet retain them for their
   rightful owner and author,--St. John. Singular to relate, the
   assumption which has best approved itself to their judgement has been,
   that there must have existed two editions of St. John's Gospel,--the
   earlier edition without, the later edition with, the incident under
   discussion. It is I presume, in order to conciliate favour to this
   singular hypothesis, that it has been further proposed to regard St.
   John v. 3, 4 and the whole of St. John xxi, (besides St. John vii.
   53-viii. 11), as after-thoughts of the Evangelist.

   1. But this is unreasonable: for nothing else but the absence of St.
   John vii. 53-viii. 11, from so many copies of the Gospel has
   constrained the Critics to regard those verses with suspicion. Whereas,
   on the contrary, there is not known to exist a copy in the world which
   omits so much as a single verse of chap. xxi. Why then are we to assume
   that the whole of that chapter was away from the original draft of the
   Gospel? Where is the evidence for so extravagant an assumption?

   2. So, concerning St. John v. 3, 4: to which there really attaches no
   manner of doubt, as I have elsewhere shewn [618] . Thirty-two precious
   words in that place are indeed omitted by 'BC: twenty-seven by D. But
   by this time the reader knows what degree of importance is to be
   attached to such an amount of evidence. On the other hand, they are
   found in all other copies: are vouched for by the Syriac [619] and the
   Latin versions: in the Apostolic Constitutions, by Chrysostom, Cyril,
   Didymus, and Ammonius, among the Greeks,--by Tertullian, Ambrose,
   Jerome, Augustine among the Latins. Why a passage so attested is to be
   assumed to be an after-thought of the Evangelist has never yet been
   explained: no, nor ever will be.

   (5) Assuming, however, just for a moment the hypothesis correct for
   argument's sake, viz. that in the second edition of St. John's Gospel
   the history of the woman taken in adultery appeared for the first time.
   Invite the authors of that hypothesis to consider what follows. The
   discovery that five out of six of the oldest uncials extant (to reckon
   here the fragment T) are without the verses in question; which yet are
   contained in ninety-nine out of every hundred of the despised
   cursives:--what other inference can be drawn from such premisses, but
   that the cursives fortified by other evidence are by far the more
   trustworthy witnesses of what St. John in his old age actually
   entrusted to the Church's keeping?

APPENDIX II.

  CONFLATION AND THE SO-CALLED NEUTRAL TEXT.

   SOME of the most courteous of our critics, in reviewing the companion
   volume to this, have expressed regret that we have not grappled more
   closely than we have done with Dr. Hort's theory. I have already
   expressed our reasons. Our object has been to describe and establish
   what we conceive to be the true principles of Sacred Textual Science.
   We are concerned only in a secondary degree with opposing principles.
   Where they have come in our way, we have endeavoured to remove them.
   But it has not entered within our design to pursue them into their
   fastnesses and domiciles. Nevertheless, in compliance with a request
   which is both proper and candid, I will do what I can to examine with
   all the equity that I can command an essential part of Dr. Hort's
   system, which appears to exercise great influence with his followers.

   § 1.

   CONFLATION.

   Dr. Hort's theory of Conflation' may be discovered on pp. 93-107. The
   want of an index to his Introduction, notwithstanding his ample
   Contents,' makes it difficult to collect illustrations of his meaning
   from the rest of his treatise. Nevertheless, the effect of Conflation
   appears to be well described in his words on p. 133:--Now however the
   three great lines were brought together, and made to contribute to a
   text different from all.' In other words, by means of a combination of
   the Western, Alexandrian, and Neutral' Texts--the great lines of
   transmission . . . to all appearance exclusively divergent,'--the
   Syrian' text was constructed in a form different from any one and all
   of the other three. Not that all these three were made to contribute on
   every occasion. We find (p. 93) Conflation, or Conflate Readings,
   introduced as proving the posteriority of Syrian to Western . . . and
   other . . . readings.' And in the analysis of eight passages, which is
   added, only in one case (St. Mark viii. 26) are more than two elements
   represented, and in that the third class consists of different
   conflations' of the first and second [620] .

   Perhaps I may present Dr. Hort's theory under the form of a diagram:--

   Our theory is the converse in main features to this. We utterly
   repudiate the term Syrian' as being a most inadequate and untrue title
   for the Text adopted and maintained by the Catholic Church with all her
   intelligence and learning, during nearly fifteen centuries according to
   Dr. Hort's admission: and we claim from the evidence that the
   Traditional Text of the Gospels, under the true name, is that which
   came fresh from the pens of the Evangelists; and that all variations
   from it, however they have been entitled, are nothing else than corrupt
   forms of the original readings. Our diagram in rough presentation will
   therefore assume this character:--

   It should be added, that w, x, y, z, &c., denote forms of corruption.
   We do not recognize the Neutral' at all, believing it to be a Caesarean
   combination or recension, made from previous texts or readings of a
   corrupt character.

   The question is, which is the true theory, Dr. Hort's or ours?

   The general points that strike us with reference to Dr. Flores theory
   are:--

   (1) That it is very vague and indeterminate in nature. Given three
   things, of which X includes what is in Y and Z, upon the face of the
   theory either X may have arisen by synthesis from Y and Z, or X and Z
   may owe their origin by analysis to X.

   (2) Upon examination it is found that Dr. Hort's arguments for the
   posteriority of D are mainly of an internal character, and are loose
   and imaginative, depending largely upon personal or literary
   predilections.

   (3) That it is exceedingly improbable that the Church of the fourth and
   fifth centuries, which in a most able period had been occupied with
   discussions on verbal accuracy, should have made the gross mistake of
   adopting (what was then) a modern concoction from the original text of
   the Gospels, which had been written less than three or four centuries
   before; and that their error should have been acknowledged as truth,
   and perpetuated by the ages that succeeded them down to the present
   time.

   But we must draw nearer to Dr. Hort's argument.

   He founds it upon a detailed examination of eight passages, viz. St.
   Mark vi. 33; viii. 26; ix. 38; ix. 49; St. Luke ix. 10; xi. 54; xii.
   18; xxiv. 53.

   1. Remark that eight is a round and divisible number. Did the author
   decide upon it with a view of presenting two specimens from each
   Gospel? To be sure, he gives four from the first two, and four from the
   two last, only that he confines the batches severally to St. Mark and
   St. Luke. Did the strong style of St. Matthew, with distinct meaning in
   every word, yield no suitable example for treatment? Could no passage
   be found in St. John's Gospel, where not without parallel, but to a
   remarkable degree, extreme simplicity of language, even expressed in
   alternative clauses, clothes soaring thought and philosophical
   acuteness? True, that he quotes St. John v. 37 as an instance of
   Conflation by the Codex Bezae which is anything but an embodiment of
   the Traditional or Syrian' Text, and xiii. 24 which is similarly
   irrelevant. Neither of these instances therefore fill up the gap, and
   are accordingly not included in the selected eight. What can we infer
   from this presentment, but that Conflation' is probably not of frequent
   occurrence as has been imagined, but may indeed be--to admit for a
   moment its existence--nothing more than an occasional incident? For
   surely, if specimens in St. Matthew and St. John had abounded to his
   hand, and accordingly Conflation' had been largely employed throughout
   the Gospels, Dr. Hort would not have exercised so restricted, and yet
   so round a choice.

   2. But we must advance a step further. Dean Burgon as we have seen has
   calculated the differences between B and the Received Text at 7,578,
   and those which divide ' and the Received Text as reaching 8,972. He
   divided these totals respectively under 2,877 and 3,455 omissions, 536
   and 839 additions, 2,098 and 2,299 transpositions, and 2,067 and 2,379
   substitutions and modifications combined. Of these classes, it is
   evident that Conflation has nothing to do with Additions or
   Transpositions. Nor indeed with Substitutions, although one of Dr.
   Hort's instances appears to prove that it has. Conflation is the
   combination of two (or more) different expressions into one. If
   therefore both expressions occur in one of the elements, the Conflation
   has been made beforehand, and a substitution then occurs instead of a
   conflation. So in St. Luke xii. 18, B, &c., read to`n siton kai` ta`
   agatha' mou, which Dr. Hort [621] considers to be made by Conflation
   into ta genemata mou kai ta agatha mou, because ta genemata mou is
   found in Western documents. The logic is strange, but as Dr. Hort has
   claimed it, we must perhaps allow him to have intended to include with
   this strange incongruity some though not many Substitutions in his
   class of instances, only that we should like to know definitely what
   substitutions were to be. comprised in this class. For I shrewdly
   suspect that there were actually none. Omissions are now left to us, of
   which the greater specimens can hardly have been produced by
   Conflation. How, for instance, could you get the last Twelve Verses of
   St. Mark's Gospel, or the Pericope de Adultera, or St. Luke xxii.
   43-44, or any of the rest of the forty-five whole verses in the Gospels
   upon which a slur is cast by the Neologian school? Consequently, the
   area of Conflation is greatly reduced. And I venture to think, that
   supposing for a moment the theory to be sound, it could not account for
   any large number of variations, but would at the best only be a sign or
   symptom found every now and then of the derivation attributed to the
   Received Text.

   3. But we must go on towards the heart of the question. And first to
   examine Dr. Hort's eight instances. Unfortunately, the early patristic
   evidence on these verses is scanty. We have little evidence of a direct
   character to light up the dark sea of conjecture.

   (1) St. Mark (vi. 33) relates that on a certain occasion the multitude,
   when they beheld our Saviour and his disciples on their way in a ship
   crossing to the other side of the lake, ran together (sune'dramon) from
   all their cities to the point which He was making for (ekei), and
   arrived there before the Lord and His followers (proelthon autou's),
   and on His approach came in a body to Him (sunelthon pros aut?n). And
   on disembarking (kai` exeltho'n, i.e. ek tou ploiou, ver. 32), &c. It
   should be observed, that it was only the Apostles who knew that His
   ultimate object was a desert place' (ver. 31, 30): the indiscriminate
   multitude could only discern the bay or cape towards which the boat was
   going: and up to what I have described as the disembarkation (ver. 34),
   nothing has been said of His movements, except that He was in the boat
   upon the lake. The account is pictorial. We see the little craft
   toiling on the lake, the people on the shores running all in one
   direction, and on their reaching the heights above the place of landing
   watching His approach, and then descending together to Him to the point
   where He is going to land. There is nothing weak or superfluous in the
   description. Though condensed (what would a modern history have made of
   it?), it is all natural and in due place.

   Now for Dr. Hort. He observes that one clause (kai` proelthon autou's)
   is attested by B' and their followers; another (kai` sunelthon autou,
   or elthon autou, which is very different from the Syrian' sunelthon
   pros auton) by some Western documents; and he argues that the entire
   form in the Received Text, kai` proelthon autou's, kai` sunelthon pros
   auton, was formed by Conflation from the other two. I cannot help
   observing that it is a suspicious mark, that even in the case of the
   most favoured of his chosen examples he is obliged to take such a
   liberty with one of his elements of Conflation as virtually to doctor
   it in order to bring it strictly to the prescribed pattern. When we
   come to his arguments he candidly admits, that it is evident that
   either d (the Received Text) is conflate from a (B') and b (Western),
   or a and b are independent simplifications of d'; and that there is
   nothing in the sense of d that would tempt to alteration,' and that
   accidental' omission of one or other clause would be easy.' But he
   argues with an ingenuity that denotes a bad cause that the difference
   between autou and pros auton is really in his favour, chiefly because
   autou would very likely if it had previously existed been changed into
   pros auton--which no one can doubt; and that sunelthon pros auton is
   certainly otiose after sunedramon ekei,' which shews that he did not
   understand the whole meaning of the passage. His argument upon what he
   terms Intrinsic Probability' leads to a similar inference. For simply
   exelthon cannot mean that He "came out" of His retirement in some
   sequestered nook to meet them,' such a nook being not mentioned by St.
   Mark, whereas ploion is; nor can ekei denote the desert region.' Indeed
   the position of that region or nook was known before it was reached
   solely to our Lord and His Apostles: the multitude was guided only by
   what they saw, or at least by vague surmise.

   Accordingly, Dr. Hort's conclusion must be reversed. The balance of
   Internal Evidence of Readings, alike from Transcriptional and from
   Intrinsic Probability, is decidedly' not in favour of d from a and b,'
   but of a and b from d.' The reading of the Traditional Text is the
   superior both as regards the meaning, and as to the probability of its
   pre-existence. The derivation of the two others from that is explained
   by that besetting fault of transcribers which is termed Omission. Above
   all, the Traditional reading is proved by a largely over-balancing
   weight of evidence.

   (2) To examine other passages equally in detail would occupy too much
   space.' So says Dr. Hort: but we must examine points that require
   attention.

   St. Mark viii. 26. After curing the blind man outside Bethsaida, our
   Lord in that remarkable period of His career directed him, according to
   the Traditional reading, (a) neither to enter into that place, mede`
   eis te`n ko'men eise'lthes, nor (a) to tell what had happened to any
   inhabitant of Bethsaida (mede eipes tini en te kome). Either some one
   who did not understand the Greek, or some matter-of-fact and officious
   scholar, or both, thought or maintained that tini en te kome must mean
   some one who was at the moment actually in the place. So the second
   clause got to be omitted from the text of B', who are followed only by
   one cursive and a half (the first reading of 1 being afterwards
   corrected), and the Bohairic version, and the Lewis MS. The Traditional
   reading is attested by ACNS and thirteen other Uncials, all Cursives
   except eight, of which six with Ph read a consolidation of both
   clauses, by several versions, and by Theophylact (i. 210) who is the
   only Father that quotes the place. This evidence ought amply to ensure
   the genuineness of this reading.

   But what says Dr. Hort? Here a is simple and vigorous, and it is unique
   in the New Testament: the peculiar Mede` has the terse force of many
   sayings as given by St. Mark, but the softening into Me by '* shews
   that it might trouble scribes.' It is surely not necessary to
   controvert this. It may be said however that a is bald as well as
   simple, and that the very difficulty in b makes it probable that that
   clause was not invented. To take tini en te kome Hebraistically for
   tini ton en te kome like the tis en humin ig.av of St. James v. 19
   [622] , need not trouble scholars, I think. Otherwise they can follow
   Meyer, according to Winer's Grammar (II. 511), and translate the second
   mede nor even. At all events, this is a poor pillar to support a great
   theory.

   (3) St. Mark ix. 38. Master, we saw one casting out devils in Thy name,
   (b) who doth not follow us, and we forbad him (a) because he followeth
   not us.'

   Here the authority for a is 'BCLD, four Cursives, f, Bohairic,
   Peshitto, Ethiopic, and the Lewis MS. For b there are D, two Cursives,
   all the Old Latin but f and the Vulgate. For the Traditional Text, i.e.
   the whole passage, APhSN + eleven Uncials, all the Cursives but six,
   the Harkleian (yet obelizes a) and Gothic versions, Basil (ii. 252),
   Victor of Antioch (Cramer, Cat. i. 365), Theophylact (i. 219): and
   Augustine quotes separately both omissions (a ix. 533, and b III. ii.
   153). No other Fathers, so far as I can find, quote the passage.

   Dr. Hort appears to advance no special arguments on his side, relying
   apparently upon the obvious repetition. In the first part of the verse,
   St. John describes the case of the man: in the second he reports for
   our Lord's judgement the grounds of the prohibition which the Apostles
   gave him. Is it so certain that the original text of the passage
   contained only the description, and omitted the reason of the
   prohibition as it was given to the non-follower of our Lord? To me it
   seems that the simplicity of St. Mark's style is best preserved by the
   inclusion of both. The Apostles did not curtly forbid the man: they
   treated him with reasonableness, and in the same spirit St. John
   reported to his Master all that occurred. Besides this, the evidence on
   the Traditional side is too strong to admit of it not being the genuine
   reading.

   (4) St. Mark ix. 49. For (a) every one shall be salted with fire, (b)
   and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.' The authorities are--

   a. 'BLD, fifteen Cursives, some MSS. of the Bohairic, some of the
   Armenian, and the Lewis.

   b. D, six copies of the Old Latin, three MSS. of the Vulgate.
   Chromatius of Aquileia (Galland. viii. 338).

   Trad. Text. ACPhSN and twelve more Uncials, all Cursives except
   fifteen, two Old Latin, Vulgate, Peshitto, Harkleian, some MSS. of
   Ethiopic and Armenian, Gothic, Victor of Antioch (Cramer's Cat. i.
   368), Theophylact (i. 221).

   This evidence must surely be conclusive of the genuineness of the
   Traditional reading. But now for Dr. Hort.

   A reminiscence of Lev. vii. 13 . . . has created b out of a.' But why
   should not the reminiscence have been our Lord's? The passage appears
   like a quotation, or an adaptation, of some authoritative saying. He
   positively advances no other argument than the one just quoted, beyond
   stating two points in which the alteration might be easily effected.

   (5) St. Luke ix. 10. He took (His Apostles) and withdrew privately

   a. Into a city called Bethsaida (eis po'lin kaloume'nen B.).

   b. Into a desert place (eis topon eremon), or Into a desert place
   called Bethsaida, or of Bethsaida.'

   Trad. Text. Into a desert place belonging to a city called Bethsaida.'

   The evidence for these readings respectively is--

   a. BLXX, with one correction of ' (C^a), one Cursive, the Bohairic and
   Sahidic. D reads komen.

   b. The first and later readings (C^b) of four Cursives?, Curetonian,
   some variant Old Latin (b^2), Peshitto also variant (b^3).

   Trad. Text. A (with eremon topon) C + twelve Uncials, all Cursives
   except three or five, Harkleian, Lewis (omits eremon), Ethiopic,
   Armenian, Gothic, with Theophylact (i. 332).

   Remark the curious character of a and b. In Dr. Hort's Neutral Text,
   which he maintains to have been the original text of the Gospels, our
   Lord is represented here as having withdrawn in private (kat' idian,
   which the Revisers shirking the difficulty translate inaccurately
   apart') into the city called Bethsaida. How could there have been
   privacy of life in a city in those days? In fact, kat' idian
   necessitates the adoption of topon eremon, as to which the Peshitto
   (b^3) is in substantial agreement with the Traditional Text. Bethsaida
   is represented as the capital of a district, which included, at
   sufficient distance from the city, a desert or retired spot. The group
   arranged under b is so weakly supported, and is evidently such a group
   of fragments, that it can come into no sort of competition with the
   Traditional reading. Dr. Hort confines himself to shewing how the
   process he advocates might have arisen, not that it did actually arise.
   Indeed, this position can only be held by assuming the conclusion to be
   established that it did so arise.

   (6) St. Luke xi. 54. The Scribes and Pharisees began to urge Him
   vehemently and to provoke Him to speak of many things (enedreu'ontes
   thereusai),

   a. Laying wait for Him to catch something out of His mouth.

   b. Seeking to get some opportunity (aphormen tina) for finding out how
   to accuse Him (hina heurosin kategoresai); or, for accusing Him (hina
   kategoresosin autou).

   Trad. Text. Laying wait for Him, and seeking to catch something
   (zetountes thereusai ti) out of His mouth, that they might accuse Him.'

   The evidence is--

   a. 'BL, Bohairic, Ethiopic, Cyril Alex. (Mai, Nov. Pp. Bibliotheca, ii.
   87, iii. 249, not accurately).

   b. D, Old Latin except f, Curetonian.

   Trad. Text. AC + twelve Uncials, all Cursives (except five which omit
   zetountes), Peshitto, Lewis (with omission), Vulgate, Harkleian,
   Theophylact (i. 363).

   As to genuineness, the evidence is decisive. The reading a is
   Alexandrian, adopted by B-', and is bad Greek into the bargain,
   enedreu'ontes thereusai being very rough, and being probably due to
   incompetent acquaintance with the Greek language. If a was the
   original, it is hard to see how b could have come from it. That the
   figurative language of a was replaced in b by a simply descriptive
   paraphrase, as Dr. Hort suggests, seems scarcely probable. On the other
   hand, the derivation of either a or b from the Traditional Text is much
   easier. A scribe would without difficulty pass over one of the
   participles lying contiguously with no connecting conjunction, and
   having a kind of Homoeoteleuton. And as to b, the distinguishing
   aphormen tina would be a very natural gloss, requiring for completeness
   of the phrase the accompanying labein. This is surely a more probable
   solution of the question of the mutual relationship of the readings
   than the laboured account of Dr. Hort, which is too long to be produced
   here.

   (7) St. Luke xii. 18. I will pull down my barns, and build greater, and
   there will I bestow all

   a. My corn and my goods.

   b. My crops (ta genemata mou). My fruits (tous karpous mou).

   Trad. Text. My crops (ta genemata mou) and my goods.'

   This is a faulty instance, because it is simply a substitution, as Dr.
   Hort admitted, in a of the more comprehensive word genemata for siton,
   and a simple omission of kai ta agatha mou in b. And the admission of
   it into the selected eight shews the difficulty that Dr. Hort must have
   experienced in choosing his examples. The evidence is--

   a. BTLX and a correction of '(a^c), eight Cursives, Peshitto, Bohairic,
   Sahidic, Armenian, Ethiopic.

   b. '*D, three Cursives, b ff i q, Curetonian and Lewis, St. Ambrose (i.
   573).

   Trad. Text. AQ + thirteen Uncials. All Cursives except twelve, f,
   Vulgate, Harkleian, Cyril Alex. (Mai, ii. 294-5) bis, Theophylact (i.
   370), Peter Chrysologus (Migne 52, 490-1) bis.

   No more need be said: substitutions and omissions are too common to
   require justification.

   (8) St. Luke xxiv. 53. They were continually in the temple

   a. Blessing God (eulogountes).

   b. Praising God (ainountes).

   Trad. Text. Praising and blessing God.'

   The evidence is--

   a. 'BC*L, Bohairic, Palestinian, Lewis.

   b. D, seven Old Latin.

   Trad. Text. AC^2 + twelve Uncials, all Cursives, c f q, Vulgate,
   Peshitto, Harkleian, Armenian, Ethiopic, Theophylact (i. 497).

   Dr. Hort adds no remarks. He seems to have thought, that because he had
   got an instance which outwardly met all the requirements laid down,
   therefore it would prove the conclusion it was intended to prove. Now
   it is evidently an instance of the omission of either of two words from
   the complete account by different witnesses. The Evangelist employed
   both words in order to emphasize the gratitude of the Apostles. The
   words are not tautological. Ainos is the set praise of God, drawn out
   in more or less length, properly as offered in addresses to Him [623] .
   Eulogia includes all speaking well of ,Him, especially when uttered
   before other men. Thus the two expressions describe in combination the
   life of gratitude exhibited unceasingly by the expectant and the infant
   Church. Continually in the temple they praised Him in devotion, and
   told the people of His glorious works.

   4. Such are the eight weak pillars upon which Dr. Hort built his theory
   which was to account for the existence of his Neutral Text, and the
   relation of it towards other Texts or classes of readings. If his eight
   picked examples can be thus demolished, then surely the theory of
   Conflation must be utterly unsound. Or if in the opinion of some of my
   readers my contention goes too far, then at any rate they must admit
   that it is far from being firm; if it does not actually reel and
   totter. The opposite theory of omission appears to be much more easy
   and natural.

   But the curious phenomenon that Dr. Hort has rested his case upon so
   small an induction as is supplied by only eight examples--if they are
   not in fact only seven--has not yet received due explanation. Why, he
   ought to have referred to twenty-five or thirty at least. If Conflation
   is so common, he might have produced a large number of references
   without working out more than was enough for illustration as patterns.
   This question must be investigated further. And I do not know how to
   carry out such an investigation better, than to examine some instances
   which come naturally to hand from the earlier parts of each Gospel.

   It must be borne in mind, that for Conflation two differently-attested
   phrases or words must be produced which are found in combination in
   some passage of the Traditional Text. If there is only one which is
   omitted, it is clear that there can be no Conflation because there must
   be at least two elements to conflate: accordingly our instances must be
   cases, not of single omission, but of double or alternative omission.
   If again there is no Western reading, it is not a Conflation in Dr.
   Hort's sense. And finally, if the remaining reading is not a Neutral'
   one, it is not to Dr. Hort's liking. I do not say that my instances
   will conform with these conditions. Indeed, after making a list of all
   the omissions in the Gospels, except those which are of too petty a
   character such as leaving out a pronoun, and having searched the list
   with all the care that I can command, I do not think that such
   instances can be found. Nevertheless, I shall take eight, starting from
   the beginning of St. Matthew, and choosing the most salient examples,
   being such also that, if Dr. Hort's theory be sound, they ought to
   conform to his requirements. Similarly, there will come then four from
   either of St. Mark and St. Luke, and eight from St. John. This course
   of proceeding will extend operations from the eight which form Dr.
   Hort's total to thirty-two.

   A. In St. Matthew we have (1) i. 25, autes ton prototokon and ton
   Huion; (2) v. 22, eike and to adelpho autou; (3) ix. 13, eis metanoian;
   (4) x. 3, Lebbaios and Thaddaios; (5) xii. 22, tuphlo`n kai` and
   kopho'n; (6) xv. 5, to`n pate'ra autou and (e) ten metera autou; (7)
   xviii. 35, apo` ton kardion umon and ta paraptomata auton ; and (8)
   xxvi. 3, oi presbu'teroi (kai) hoi Grammateis. I have had some
   difficulty in making up the number. Of those selected as well as I
   could, seven are cases of single omission or of one pure omission
   apiece, though their structure presents a possibility of two members
   for Conflation; whilst the Western clement comes in sparsely or appears
   in favour of both the omission and the retention; and, thirdly, in some
   cases, as in (2) and (3), the support is not only Western, but
   universal. Consequently, all but (4) are excluded. Of (4) Dr. Hort
   remarks, (Notes on Select Readings, p. 11) that it is a case of
   Conflation of the true and the chief Western Texts,' and accordingly it
   does not come within the charmed circle.

   B. From St. Mark we get, (1) i. 1, Uiou tou Theou, and Iesou Christou;
   (2) i. 2, e'mprosthe'n sou and pro` proso'pou sou (cp. ix. 38); (3)
   iii. 15, therapeu'ein ta`s no'sois (kai) and ekba'llein ta` daimo'nia;
   (4) xiii. 33, agrupneite and (kai`) proseu'chesthe. All these instances
   turn out to be cases of the omission of only one of the parallel
   expressions. The omission in the first is due mainly to Origen (see
   Traditional Text, Appendix IV): in the three last there is Western
   evidence on both sides.

   C. St. Luke yields us, (1) ii. 5, gunaiki' and memnesteume'ne; (2) iv.
   4, epi` panti` re'mati Theou or ep' a'rto mo'no; (3) viii. 54, ekbalo`n
   e'xo pa'ntas (kai`), or krate'sas tes cheiro`s autes; xi. 4, (alla`)
   rusai emas apo` tou ponerou, or me` eisene'nkes emas eis peirasmo'n. In
   all these cases, examination discloses that they are examples of pure
   omission of only one of the alternatives. The only evidence against
   this is the solitary rejection of memnesteume'ne by the Lewis Codex.

   D. We now come to St. John. See (1) iii. 15, me` apo'letai, or e'che
   zoe`n aio'nion; (2) iv. 14, ou me` dipse'se eis to`n aiona or to` u'dor
   o` do'so auto gene'setai en auto? pege` u'datos, k.t.l.; (3) iv. 42, o
   Christo's, or o sote`r tou ko'smou; (4) iv. 51, kai` ape'ngeilan and
   le'gontes; (5) v. 16, kai` eze'toun auto`n apoktei?nai and edi'okon
   auton; (6) vi. 51, e`n ego` do'so, or o`n ego` do'so; (7) ix. 1, 25,
   kai` eipen or apekri'the; (8) xiii. 31, 32, ei o Theo`s edoxa'sthe en
   auto, and kai` o Theo`s edoxa'sthe en auto. All these instances turn
   out to be single omissions:--a fact which is the more remarkable,
   because St. John's style so readily lends itself to parallel or
   antithetical expressions involving the same result in meaning, that we
   should expect conflations to shew themselves constantly if the
   Traditional Text had so coalesced.

   How surprising a result:--almost too surprising. Does it not immensely
   strengthen my contention that Dr. Hort took wrongly Conflation for the
   reverse process? That in the earliest ages, when the Church did not
   include in her ranks so much learning as it has possessed ever since,
   the wear and tear of time, aided by unfaith and carelessness, made
   itself felt in many an instance of destructiveness which involved a
   temporary chipping of the Sacred Text all through the Holy Gospels?
   And, in fact, that Conflation at least as an extensive process, if not
   altogether, did not really exist.

  § 2.

   THE NEUTRAL TEXT.

   Here we are brought face to face with the question respecting the
   Neutral Text. What in fact is it, and does it deserve the name which
   Dr. Hort and his followers have attempted to confer permanently upon
   it? What is the relation that it bears to other so-called Texts?

   So much has been already advanced upon this subject in the companion
   volume and in the present, that great conciseness is here both possible
   and expedient. But it may be useful to bring the sum or substance of
   those discussions into one focus.

   1. The so-called Neutral Text, as any reader of Dr. Hort's Introduction
   will see, is the text of B and ' and their small following. That
   following is made up of Z in St. Matthew, D in St. Mark, the
   fragmentary X in St. Luke, with frequent agreement with them of D, and
   of the eighth century L; with occasional support from some of the group
   of Cursives, consisting of 1, 33, 118, 131, 157, 205, 209, and from the
   Ferrar group, or now and then from some others, as well as from the
   Latin k, and the Egyptian or other versions. This perhaps appears to be
   a larger number than our readers may have supposed, but rarely are more
   than ten MSS. found together, and generally speaking less, and often
   much less than that. To all general intents and purposes, the Neutral
   Text is the text of B-'.

   2. Following facts and avoiding speculation, the Neutral Text appears
   hardly in history except at the Semiarian period. It was almost
   disowned ever after: and there is no certainty--nothing more than
   inference which we hold, and claim to have proved, to be imaginary and
   delusive,--that, except as represented in the corruption which it
   gathered out of the chaos of the earliest times, it made any
   appearance.

   3. Thus, as a matter of history acknowledged by Dr. Hort, it was mainly
   superseded before the end of the century of its emergence by the
   Traditional Text, which, except in the tenets of a school of critics in
   the nineteenth century, has reigned supreme ever since.

   4. That it was not the original text of the Gospels, as maintained by
   Dr. Hort, I claim to have established from an examination of the
   quotations from the Gospels made by the Fathers. It has been proved
   that not only in number, but still more conclusively in quality, the
   Traditional Text enjoyed a great superiority of attestation over all
   the kinds of corruption advocated by some critics which I have just now
   mentioned [624] . This conclusion is strengthened by the verdict of the
   early versions.

   5. The inferiority of the Neutral Text' is demonstrated by the
   overwhelming weight of evidence which is marshalled against it on
   passages under dispute. This glaring contrast is increased by the
   disagreement among themselves of the supporters of that Text, or class
   of readings. As to antiquity, number, variety, weight, and continuity,
   that Text falls hopelessly behind: and by internal evidence also the
   texts of B and ', and still more the eccentric text of the Western D,
   are proved to be manifestly inferior.

   6. It has been shewn also by evidence, direct as well as inferential,
   that B and ' issued nearly together from the library or school of
   Caesarea. The fact of their being the oldest MSS. of the New Testament
   in existence, which has naturally misled people and caused them to be
   credited with extraordinary value, has been referred, as being mainly
   due, to their having been written on vellum according to the fashion
   introduced in that school, instead of the ordinary papyrus. The fact of
   such preservation is really to their discredit, instead of resounding
   to their honour, because if they had enjoyed general approval, they
   would probably have perished creditably many centuries ago in the
   constant use for which they were intended.

   Such are the main points in the indictment and in the history of the
   Neutral Text, or rather--to speak with more appropriate accuracy,
   avoiding the danger of drawing with too definite a form and too deep a
   shade--of the class of readings represented by B and '. It is
   interesting to trace further, though very summarily, the connexion
   between this class of readings and the corruptions of the Original Text
   which existed previously to the early middle of the fourth century.
   Such brief tracing will lead us to a view of some causes of the
   development of Dr. Hort's theory.

   The analysis of Corruption supplied as to the various kinds of it by
   Dean Burgon has taught us how they severally arose. This is fresh in
   the mind of readers, and I will not spoil it by repetition. But the
   studies of textual critics have led them to combine all kinds of
   corruption chiefly under the two heads of the Western or
   Syrio-Low-Latin class, and in a less prominent province of the
   Alexandrian. Dr. Hort's Neutral is really a combination of those two,
   with all the accuracy that these phenomena admit. But of course, if the
   Neutral were indeed the original Text, it would not do for it to be too
   closely connected with one of such bad reputation as the Western, which
   must be kept in the distance at all hazards. Therefore he represented
   it--all unconsciously no doubt and with the best intention--as one of
   the sources of the Traditional, or as he called it the Syrian' Text.
   Hence this imputed connexion between the Western and the Traditional
   Text became the essential part of his framework of Conflation, which
   could not exist without it. For any permanent purpose, all this
   handiwork was in vain. To say no more, D, which is the chief
   representative of the Western Text, is too constant a supporter of the
   peculiar readings of B and ' not to prove its near relationship to
   them. The Neutral' Text derives the chief part of its support from
   Western sources. It is useless for Dr. Hort to disown his leading
   constituents. And on the other hand, the Syrio-Low-Latin Text is too
   alien to the Traditional to be the chief element in any process,
   Conflate or other, out of which it could have been constructed. The
   occasional support of some of the Old Latin MSS. is nothing to the
   point in such a. proof. They are so fitful and uncertain, that some of
   them may witness to almost anything. If Dr. Hort's theory of Conflation
   had been sounder, there would have been no lack of examples.

   Naturam expellas furca: tamen usque recurret.'

   He was tempted to the impossible task of driving water uphill.
   Therefore I claim, not only to have refuted Dr. Hort, whose theory is
   proved to be even more baseless than I ever imagined, but by excavating
   more deeply than he did, to have discovered the cause of his error.

   No: the true theory is, that the Traditional Text--not in superhuman
   perfection, though under some superhuman Guidance--is the embodiment of
   the original Text of the New Testament. In the earliest times, just as
   false doctrines were widely spread, so corrupt readings prevailed in
   many places. Later on, when Christianity was better understood, and the
   Church reckoned amongst the learned and holy of her members the finest
   natures and intellects of the world, and many clever men of inferior
   character endeavoured to vitiate Doctrine and lower Christian life,
   evil rose to the surface, and was in due time after a severe struggle
   removed by the sound and faithful of the day. So heresy was rampant for
   a while, and was then replaced by true and well-grounded belief. With
   great ability and with wise discretion, the Deposit whether of Faith or
   Word was verified and established. General Councils decided in those
   days upon the Faith, and the Creed when accepted and approved by the
   universal voice was enacted for good and bequeathed to future ages. So
   it was both as to the Canon and the Words of Holy Scripture, only that
   all was done quietly. As to the latter, hardly a footfall was heard.
   But none the less, corruption after short-lived prominence sank into
   deep and still deeper obscurity, whilst the teaching of fifteen
   centuries placed the true Text upon a firm and lasting basis.

   And so I venture to hold, now that the question has been raised, both
   the learned and the well-informed will come gradually to see, that no
   other course respecting the Words of the New Testament is so strongly
   justified by the evidence, none so sound and large-minded, none so
   reasonable in every way, none so consonant with intelligent faith, none
   so productive of guidance and comfort and hope, as to maintain against
   all the assaults of corruption

       peccandi impunitatem dari mulieribus suis), illud quod de adulterae
       indulgentia Dominus fecit, auferrent de codicibus suis: quasi
       permissionem peccandi tribuerit qui dixit, Iam deinceps noli
       peccare;' aut ideo non debuerit mulier a medico Deo illius peccati

       quod est secundum Matthaeum: [2426]1
     * Tenet ecclesia nostra, tenuitque semper firmam illam et immotam
       Tertulliani regulam "Id verius quod prius, id prius quod ab
