                       A Tempted Savior--Our Best Succor

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JANUARY 4, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For in that He Himself has suffered being tempted, He is able to
   succor them that are tempted." Hebrews 2:18.

   My text, furnishing the motto for the congregation for the New Year is,
   as you know, always supplied to me by a most venerable clergyman of the
   Church of England who has ever showed to me the most constant and
   affectionate regard. I have no doubt that the present text has been
   suggested to this aged servant of the Lord by his deep experience at
   once of affliction and deliverance--for there he has learned his need
   of solid, substantial food--fat things full of marrow, fit for the
   veteran warriors of the Cross. Having been tempted these many years in
   the wilderness, my esteemed friend finds that as his natural strength
   decays, he needs more and more to cast himself upon the tenderness of
   the Redeemer's love. And he is led more fully to look to Him who is his
   only help and succor in every day of trouble, finding consolation alone
   in the Person of Christ Jesus the Lord.

   My text seems to me to be a staff fitted for hoary age to lean upon in
   the rough places of the way--a sword with which the strong man may
   fight in all hours of conflict. A shield with which youth may cover
   itself in the time of peril and a royal chariot in which babes in grace
   may ride in safety. There is something here forever one of us. As
   Solomon puts it, a portion for seven and also for eight. If we consider
   the Great Prophet and High Priest of our profession--Jesus Christ--as
   being tempted in all points, we shall not grow weary or faint in our
   minds, but shall gird up our loins for our future journey and like
   Elijah go in the strength of this meat for many days to come.

   You that are tempted--and I suppose the major part of this present
   congregation is included in the list--you that are tempted--and indeed
   if you know yourselves you are all in your measure thus exercised--you
   that are tempted listen to me this morning while I endeavor to speak of
   your temptations and in parallel lines of the temptations of Him who,
   having known your trials is able to succor you at all times.

   I. Our first point this morning is this--MANY SOULS ARE TEMPTED--CHRIST
   WAS TEMPTED. All the heirs of Heaven pass under the yoke. All true gold
   must feel the fire. All wheat must be threshed. All diamonds must be
   cut. All saints must endure temptation.

   1. They are tempted from all quarters. It is as Christ's parable puts
   it concerning the house whose foundation was on the rock--"The rain
   descended, the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house
   but it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock." The descending rain
   may represent temptations from above. The floods pouring their
   devastating torrents upon the land may well denote the trials which
   spring from the world while the howling winds may typify those
   mysterious influences of evil which issue from the Prince of the power
   of the air.

   Now whether we shudder at the descending rain or fear before the
   uprising flood. Whether we are amazed at the mysterious energy of the
   winds, it is well to recollect our blessed Lord was tempted in all
   points like as we are. This is to be our consolation--that nothing
   strange to the Head has happened to the members.

   Beloved Friends, it is possible that we may be tempted by God. I know
   it is written that "God is not tempted, neither tempts He any man." Yet
   I read in Scripture, "It came to pass that God did tempt Abraham." And
   I know it is a part of the prayer which we are taught to offer before
   God--"Lead us not into temptation"--by which it is clearly implied that
   God does lead into temptation or why else should we be taught to
   entreat Him not to do so? In one sense of the term "tempt," a pure and
   holy God can have no share. But in another sense He does tempt His
   people. The temptation which comes from God is altogether that of
   trial.

   A trial, not with an evil design as are the temptations of Satan, but a
   trial meant to prove and strengthen our graces. And so at once to
   illustrate the power of divine grace, to test the genuineness of our
   virtues and to add to their energy.

   You remember that Abraham was tried and tested of God when he was bid
   to go to a mountain that God would show him, there to offer up his son
   Isaac. You and I may have a like experience. God may call us in the
   path of obedience to a great and singular sacrifice. The desire of our
   eyes may be demanded of us in an hour--or He may summon us to a
   tremendous duty far surpassing all our strength.

   We may be tempted by the weight of the responsibility, like Jonah, to
   flee from the presence of the Lord. We can only know when placed in the
   position what temptations the Lord's message may involve. But, Beloved,
   whatever these may be our Great High Priest has felt them all. His
   Father called Him to a work of the most terrific character. He laid
   upon Him the iniquity of us all. He ordained Him, the second Adam, the
   bearer of the curse, the destroyer of death, the conqueror of Hell, the
   seed of the woman to be wounded in the heel and elected to bruise the
   serpent's head. Our Lord was appointed to toil at the loom and there,
   with ever-flying shuttle, to weave a perfect garment of righteousness
   for all His people.

   Now, beloved, this was a strong and mighty testing of the character of
   Him who was found in fashion as a man and it is not possible that we
   can ever be thrust into such a refiner's fire as that which tried this
   most pure gold. No other can be in the crucible so long or subjected to
   such a tremendous heat as that which was endured by Christ Jesus. If
   then, the trial is sent directly from our heavenly Father, we may
   solace ourselves with this reflection--that He Himself has suffered and
   being tried of God--He is able also to succor them that are likewise
   tried.

   But, dear Friends, our God not only tries us directly but indirectly.
   All is under the Lord's control of Providence. Everything that happens
   to us is meted out by the decree and settled by His purpose. We know
   that nothing can occur to us save as it is written in the secret roll
   of providential predestination. Consequently all the trials resulting
   from circumstances are traceable at once to the great First Cause. Out
   of the golden gate of God's ordinance the armies of trial march forth
   in array. No shower falls without permission from the threatening
   cloud. Every drop has its order before it hastens to the earth.

   Consider poverty for instance. How many are made to feel its pinching
   necessities? They shiver in the cold for want of raiment. They are
   hungry and thirsty. They are houseless, friendless, despised. This is a
   temptation from God, but all this Christ knew--"Foxes have holes and
   the birds of the air have nests, but I, the Son of Man, have not where
   to lay My head." When He had fasted forty days and forty nights He was
   hungry and then it was that He was tempted of the devil.

   Nor does the scant table and the ragged garment alone invite
   temptation, for all Providences are doors to trial. Even our mercies,
   like roses, have their thorns. Men may be drowned in seas of prosperity
   as well as in rivers of affliction. Our mountains are not too high and
   our valleys are not too low for temptation to travel. Where shall we
   flee from their presence? What wings of wind can carry us? What beams
   of light can bear us? Everywhere, above and beneath, we are beset and
   surrounded with dangers.

   Now, since all these are under the superintendence and direction of the
   great Lord of Providence, we may look upon them all as temptations
   which come from Him. But in every one of these Christ had His part. Let
   us choose the special one of sickness--sickness is a strong temptation
   to impatience, rebellion and murmuring. But He Himself took our
   infirmities and bore our sicknesses. That visage had not been marred
   more than that of any man had not the soul been sore vexed and the body
   consequently much tormented.

   Bereavement, too--what a trial is this to the tender heart! You arrows
   of death, you kill but you wound with wounds worse than death. "Jesus
   wept," because His friend Lazarus slept in the tomb. In that great loss
   He was schooled to sympathize with the widow in her needs, with the
   orphan in his fatherless estate and with the friend whose acquaintance
   has been thrust into darkness. Nothing can come from God to the sons of
   men the like of which did not also happen unto the Lord Jesus Christ.
   Herein let us wrap ourselves about with the warm mantle of consolation,
   since Christ was tempted in this point like as we are.

   2. But still more do temptations arise from men. God does try us now
   and then, but our fellow men every day. Our foes are found in our own
   household among our friends. Out of a mistaken kindness it often
   happens that they would lead us to prefer our own ease rather than the
   service of God. Links of love have made iron chains for saints. It is
   hard to ride to Heaven over our own flesh and blood. Kinsfolk and
   acquaintances may much hinder young disciples. This, however, is no
   novelty to our Lord.

   You know how he had to say to Peter, well-beloved disciple though he
   was, "Get you behind Me, Satan. You savor not the things that are of
   God." Poor ignorant human friendship would have kept Him back from the
   Cross, would have made Him miss His great object in being fashioned as
   a man and so have robbed Him of all the honor which only shame and
   death could win Him. Not only true, but false friends attempt our ruin.
   Treason creeps like a snake in the grass and falsehood, like an adder,
   bites the horse's heels.

   Does treachery assault us, let us remember how the Son of David was
   betrayed. "He that eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against
   Me." "Yes, my own familiar friend in whom I trusted, which did eat of
   my bread has lifted up his heel against me." What shall be done unto
   you, you false tongue? Eternal silence rest on you! And yet you have
   spent your venom on my Lord--why should I marvel if you try your worst
   on me?

   As by friends you and I are tempted, so often are we assailed by
   enemies. Enemies will waylay us with subtle questions, seeking to
   entrap us in our speech. O cunning devices of a generation of vipers!
   They did the same with Christ. The Herodian, the Sadducee, the
   Pharisee, the lawyer--each one has his riddle and each one is
   answered--answered gloriously by the Great Teacher who is not to be
   entrapped. You and I are sometimes asked odd questions. Doctrines are
   set in controversy with doctrines. Texts of Scripture are made to clash
   with other portions of God's Word and we hardly know how to reply. Let
   us retire into the secret chamber of this great fact--in this point,
   too, Christ was tempted.

   And then, when His foes could not prevail against Him, they slandered
   His character. "A drunken man and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans
   and sinners," said they and He became the song of the drunkard till
   their reproach had broken His heart. This may happen to us. We may be
   subjected to slander just in that very point where we are most clear.
   Our good may be evil spoken of. Our motives misinterpreted. Our words
   misquoted. Our actions misconstrued--but here also, we may shelter
   ourselves beneath the eagle wings of this great truth--our glorious
   Head has suffered and being tempted He can give us aid.

   But His foes did even more than this--when they found Him in an agony
   of pain they taunted Him to His face. Pointing their finger they mocked
   His nakedness. Thrusting out their tongue they jeered at His claims and
   hissed out that more than diabolical temptation, "If You are the Son of
   God, come down from the Cross and we will believe in You." How often do
   the sons of men, when they have gone to the full length of their
   tether, charge us in like manner? They have caught us in some unhappy
   moment--surprised us when our spirits were broken, when our
   circumstances were unhappy and then they say, "Now--now where is your
   God? If you are what you profess to be, now prove it."

   They ask us to prove our faith by a sinful action which they know would
   destroy our characters--some rash deed which would be contrary to the
   profession we have espoused. Here, too, we may remember that, having
   been tempted, our High Priest is able to succor those that are tempted.
   Moreover, remember that there are temptations which come from persons
   who are neither friends nor foes--from those with whom we are compelled
   to mix in ordinary society. Jesus went to the Pharisee's table. The
   example of the Pharisee reeked with infectious pride--he sat with the
   publicans, whose characters were contagious with impurity.

   But, whether it was in one leper house or another, the Great Physician
   walked through the midst of moral plagues and leprosies unharmed. He
   associated with sinners, but was not a sinner. He touched disease but
   was not diseased Himself. He could enter into the chambers of evil but
   evil could not find a chamber in Him. You and I are thrown by our daily
   avocations into constant contact with evil. It were impossible, I
   suppose, to walk among men without being tempted by them.
   Inadvertently, men who have no studied design to betray us, by the mere
   force of their ordinary behavior entice us to evil and corrupt our good
   manners.

   Here, too, if we have to cry, "Woe is me, for I dwell in Meshech and
   sojourn in the tents of Kedar," we may remember that our great Leader
   sojourned here, too, and being here He was tempted even as we are.

   Dear Friends, we shall not complete the list of temptations if we
   forget that a vast host and those of a most violent character can only
   be ascribed to Satanic influence. These are usually threefold--for
   Christ's temptation in the wilderness, if I read it right, was a true
   picture of all the temptations which Satan uses against God's people.
   The first grand temptation of Satan is usually made against our faith.
   Being hungry, Satan came to our Lord and said, "If you are the Son of
   God, command that these stones be made bread." Here was that devilish
   "if," that cunning suggestion of a doubt concerning his Sonship coupled
   with the enticement to commit a selfish act, to prove whether he were
   the Son or not.

   Ah, how often does Satan tempt us to unbelief. "God has forsaken you,"
   he says. "God has no love for you. Your experience has been a delusion.
   Your profession is a falsehood. All your hopes will fail you--you are
   but a poor miserable dupe. There is no truth in religion--if there is,
   how is it that you are in this trouble? Why not do as you like, live as
   you like and enjoy yourself?" Ah, foul Fiend, how craftily do you
   spread your net. But it is all in vain, for Jesus has passed through
   and broken the snare. My Hearers, beware of intermeddling with Divine
   Providence! Satan tempts many believers to run before the cloud, to
   carve their own fortunes, build their own house, to steer their own
   vessels. Mischief will surely befall all who yield to this temptation.

   Beware of becoming the keepers of your own souls, for evil will soon
   overtake you. Ah, when you are thus tempted by Satan and your adoption
   seems in jeopardy and your experience appears to melt, fly at once to
   the Good Shepherd remembering this, "In that He Himself has suffered
   being tempted, He is able to succor them that are tempted."

   The next foul temptation of Satan with Christ was not to unbelief but
   to the very reverse--presumption. "Cast Yourself down," said he as he
   poised the Savior on the pinnacle of the temple. Even so he whispers to
   some of us, "You are a child of God. You know that and therefore you
   are safe--live as you like--cast yourself down, for it is written, 'He
   shall give His angels charge over you to keep you.' " Oh, that foul
   temptation! Many an Antinomian is led by the nose of this--driven like
   a fatted bullock to the slaughter and like a fool to the correction of
   the stocks--for many an Antinomian will say, "I am safe, therefore I
   may indulge my lusts with impunity."

   But you who know better! When you are thus molested. When the devil
   brings the doctrine of election or the great truth of the final
   perseverance of the saints and seeks to soil your purity and stain your
   innocence by temptations drawn from the mercy and love of God--then
   console yourselves by this fact--that Christ was tempted in this point,
   too, and is able to succor you even here.

   The last temptation of Christ in the wilderness was to idolatry.
   Ambition was the temptation, but idolatry was the end at which the
   tempter aimed. "All these things will I give you if you will fall down
   and worship me." The old serpent will suggest, "I will make you rich if
   you will only venture upon that one swindling transaction. You shall be
   famous, only palm off that one falsehood. You shall be perfectly at
   ease, only wink at one small evil. All these things will I give you if
   you will make me Lord of your heart." Ah, then it will be a noble thing
   if you can look up to Him who endured this temptation before you, and
   bid the fiend depart with, "It is written, you shall worship the Lord
   with all your heart and Him only shall you serve."

   Thus shall Satan leave you and angels minister unto you as they did to
   the Tempted One of old. Still further, to enlarge on this point let me
   observe that we are tempted not only from all quarters, but in all
   positions. No man is too lowly for the shafts of Hell--no person too
   elevated for the arrows of evil. Poverty has its dangers--"Lest I be
   poor and steal"--Christ knew these. Contempt has its aggravated
   temptations--to be despised often makes men bitter of spirit,
   exasperates them into savage selfishness and wolfish cruelty of
   revenge. Our great Prophet knew experimentally the temptations of
   contempt.

   It is no small trial to be filled with pain--when all the strings of
   our manhood are strained and twisted it is little wonder if they make a
   discord. Christ endured the greatest amount of physical pain,
   especially upon the Cross. And on the Cross, where all the rivers of
   human agony met in one deep lake within His heart, He bore all that it
   was possible for the human frame to bear. Here, then, without limit He
   learned the pain of pain. Turn the picture--Christ knew the temptations
   of riches. You will say, "How?" He had the opportunities to be rich.
   Mary and Martha and Lazarus would have been too glad to give Him their
   substance.

   The honorable women who ministered to Him would have begrudged Him
   nothing. There were many opportunities when He might have made Himself
   a king. He might have become famous and great like other teachers and
   so have earned honors and wealth. But as He knew, so also He overcame
   the temptations of wealth. The temptations of ease-- and these are not
   small--Christ readily escaped. There would always have been a
   comfortable home for Him at Bethany. There were many disciples who
   would have thought themselves but too honored to have found for Him the
   softest couch on which head ever rested--but He who came not to enjoy
   but to endure.

   He spurned all--but not without knowing the temptation. He learned,
   too, the trials of honor, of popularity and of applause. "Hosanna,
   hosanna, hosanna," said the multitudes in the streets of Jerusalem,
   when palm branches were strewed in the way and He rode in triumph over
   the garments of His disciples! Knowing all this, He was still meek and
   lowly and in Him was no sin. We cannot either be cast down or lifted
   up. We cannot be put into the most strange and singular positions
   without still being able to remember that Christ has made a pilgrimage
   over the least trod of our paths and is therefore able to succor them
   that are tempted.

   3. Further, let me remark that every age has its temptations. The young
   while yet children, if believers, will discover that there are peculiar
   snares for the little ones. Christ knew these. It was no small
   temptation to a youth, a lad of some twelve years of age, to be found
   sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them and answering their
   questions. It would have turned the heads of most boys and yet Jesus
   went down to Nazareth and was subject to His parents. It is small peril
   to grow in knowledge and in favor with God and man, if it were not for
   the word "God" put in it. To grow in favor constantly with men would be
   too much of a temptation for most youths.

   It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth, for youth,
   when honored and esteemed is too apt to lift its head and grow
   conceited, vain and obstinate. When a young man knows that by-and-by he
   shall become something great it is not easy to keep him balanced.
   Suppose that he is born to an estate and knows that when he comes of
   full age he will be lord and master and will be courted by
   everybody--why he is apt to be very wayward and self-willed.

   Now there were prophecies that went before concerning Mary's son--which
   marked him out as King of the Jews and a Mighty One in Israel. But I
   find not that the holy child Jesus was ever decoyed by His coming
   greatness into any actions inconsistent with the duty of a child. So
   young believers, you who are like Samuel and Timothy--you can look to
   Christ and know that he can aid you. In His full manhood it is
   unnecessary for me to repeat the various afflictions which beat upon
   our Lord. You who today bear the burden and heat of the day will find
   an example here.

   Nor need old age look elsewhere for we may view our Redeemer with
   admiration as He goes up to Jerusalem to die. His last moments are
   manifestly near at hand. He knows the temptations of an expected
   dissolution--He sees death more clearly than any of you--even though
   your temples are covered with gray. And yet, whether in life or in
   death, on Tabor's summit or on the banks of the river of death, He is
   still the same--always tempted--but never sinning. Always tried, but
   never found wanting.

   O Lord! You are able thus to succor them that are tempted. Help us! I
   need not say more. If I have not mentioned the particular trial of
   everyone here today, I think it may be included in some one of the
   general descriptions. Whatever it may happen to be it cannot be so out
   of the catalogue as not to come in somewhere or other in the
   temptations of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I, therefore, now turn
   to the second part of the discourse upon which I shall speak with
   brevity.

   II. Our second point is THAT AS THE TEMPTED OFTEN SUFFERED Christ ALSO
   SUFFERED.

   Notice, the text does not say--"In that He Himself also has been
   tempted, He is able to succor them that are tempted." It is better than
   that--"In that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to
   succor them that are tempted." Temptation, even when overcome, brings
   with it to the true child of God a great degree of suffering. The
   suffering consists in two or three things. It lies, mainly, in the
   shock which sin gives to the sensitive, regenerate nature.

   A man who is clothed in armor may walk in a wilderness through the
   midst of tearing thorns and brambles without being hurt. But let the
   man be stripped of his garments and then let him attempt the same
   journey and how sadly will he be cut and torn. Sin, to the man who is
   used to it, is not suffering. If he is tempted it is no pain to him. In
   fact, frequently temptation yields pleasure to the sinner. To look at
   the bait is sweet to the fish which means to swallow it by-and-by. But
   to the child of God who is new-made and quickened, the very thought of
   sin makes him Shudder. He cannot look at it without abhorrence and
   detestation and without being alarmed to think that he is likely ever
   to fall into so abominable a crime.

   Now, dear Friends, in this case, Christ indeed has fellowship and far
   outruns us. His detestation of sin must have been much more deep than
   ours. A word of blasphemy, a thought of sin must have cut Him to the
   very quick. We cannot get a complete idea of the degree of wretchedness
   which Jesus must have endured in merely being upon earth among the
   ungodly. For infinite Purity to dwell among sinners must be something
   as terrible as if you could suppose the best educated, the most pure,
   the most amiable person condemned to live in a den of burglars,
   blasphemers, and filthy wretches. Such a man's life must be miserable.
   No whip, no chain would be needed--merely associating with such people
   would be pain and torment enough.

   So the Lord Jesus, in merely bearing the neighborhood of sin without
   any other troubles, would have had to suffer a vast, incalculable
   amount of woe. Suffering, too, arises to the people of God from a dread
   of the temptation when its shadow falls upon us before it comes. At
   times there is more dread in the prospect of a trial than there is in
   the trial itself. We feel a thousand temptations in fearing one. Christ
   knew this. What an awful dread was that which came over Him in the
   black night of Gethsemane! It was not the cup--it was the fear of
   drinking it. "Let this cup pass from Me," just seemed to indicate what
   the sorrow was.

   He knew how black, how foul, how fiery were its deeps and it was the
   dread of drinking it that bowed Him to the ground till He sweat, as it
   were, great drops of blood. When you have the same overwhelming
   pressure upon your spirit in the prospect of a trial yet to come, fly
   to the loving heart of your sympathizing Lord--for He has suffered all
   this-- having been Himself tempted.

   The suffering of temptation also lies often in the source of it. Have
   you not often felt that you would not mind the temptation if it had not
   come from where it did? "Oh," you say, "to think that my own friend, my
   dearly beloved friend, should test me!" You are a child and you have
   said, "I think I could bear anything but my father's frown, or my
   mother's sneer." You are a husband and you say, "My thorn in the flesh
   is too sharp, for it is an ungodly wife." Or you are a wife which is
   more frequently the case and you think there is no temptation like
   yours, because it is your husband who assaults your religion and who
   speaks evil of your good. It makes all the difference where the
   temptation comes from.

   If some scoundrel mocks us we think it honor--but when it is an honored
   companion we feel his taunt. A friend can cut under our armor and stab
   us the more dangerously. Ah, but the Man of Sorrows knew all this since
   it was one of the chosen twelve who betrayed Him. And besides, "it
   pleased the Father to bruise Him, He has put Him to grief." To find God
   to be in arms against us is a huge affliction. "Eloi, Eloi, lama
   Sabacthani! My God, my God, why have You forsaken Me?" is the very
   emphasis of woe. Jesus surely has suffered your griefs, from wherever
   they may come.

   I have no doubt, too, that a portion of the sorrow and suffering of
   temptation may also lie in the fact that God's name and honor are often
   involved in our temptation. It happens to some of us who are more
   publicly placed than others to be reviled and when the reviling is
   merely against our own personal character, against our modes of speech
   or habit. We not only receive it gratefully but thankfully--blessing
   God that He has counted us worthy to suffer for His Name's sake. But
   sometimes the attack is very plainly not against us but against God and
   there will be things said of which we should say with the Psalmist
   David--"Horror has taken hold upon me, because of the wicked that keep
   not Your law!"

   When direct blasphemies are uttered against the Person of Christ, or
   against the doctrine of His holy Gospel, we have been "very heavy." We
   have thought--"If I have opened this dog's mouth against myself it
   matters not, but if I have made him roar against God--then how should I
   answer and what should I speak?" This has often been the bitterness of
   it--"If I fall, God's cause is stained. If I slip through the vehemence
   of this assault, then one of the gates of the Church will be carried by
   storm. Mischief comes not to me alone, but to many of the Israel of
   God."

   David says, of grieving the saints--"When I thought to know this it was
   too painful for me." David's Lord had to suffer this, for He says, "The
   reproaches of them that reproached You fell on Me." He was made the
   target for those errors which were really shot at God and so He had to
   feel first this bitterness of sympathy with His ill-used God.

   I cannot, of course, particularize this morning so as to hit upon the
   precise sorrow which you, beloved Brother in Christ, are enduring as
   the result of temptation. But whatever phase your sorrow may have
   assumed this should always be your comfort--that He has suffered in
   temptation--that He has not merely known the temptation as you
   sometimes have known it--when it rattled on your harness and fell
   harmless to the ground. But it has rankled in His flesh. It has not
   made Him sin, but it has made Him smart. It has not made Him err, but
   it has caused Him to mourn. Oh, child of God, I know not a deeper well
   of purer consolation than this--"He Himself has suffered being
   tempted."

   III. Now for the third and last point. THEY THAT ARE TEMPTED HAVE GREAT
   NEED OF SUCCOR, AND

   CHRIST IS ABLE, HAVING HIMSELF BEEN TEMPTED TO SUCCOR THEM THAT ARE
   TEMPTED.

   Of course this is true of Christ as God. Apart from any temptation He
   has ever endured, He would be able to succor the tempted. But we are
   now speaking in our text of Christ as a High Priest in which we are to
   regard Him in His complex character as God-man. Christ is not only God
   but Man and not only man but God. The Christos--the Anointed One, the
   High Priest of our profession--is in His complex character able to
   succor them that are tempted. How? Why, first, the very fact that He
   was tempted has some succor in it to us.

   If we had to walk through the darkness alone we should know the very
   extremity of misery. But having a companion we have comfort--having
   such a companion as Jesus Christ--we have joy. It is all black about me
   and the path is miry and I sink in it and can find no standing. But I
   plunge onwards, desperately set on reaching my journey's end. It frets
   me that I am alone, but I hear a voice (I can see nothing)--but I hear
   a voice which says, "Yes, though I pass through the valley of the
   shadow of death I will fear no evil."

   I cry out, "Who goes there?" and an answer comes back to me--"I, the
   faithful and true witness, the Alpha and the Omega, the Sufferer who
   was despised and rejected of men, I lead the way." And at once I feel
   that it is light about me and there is a rock beneath my feet. For if
   Christ, my Lord, has been here then the way must be safe. The very fact
   that He has suffered, then, consoles His people.

   But further, the fact that He has suffered without being destroyed is
   inestimably comforting to us. If you could see a block of ore just
   ready to be put into the furnace, if that block of ore could look into
   the flames and could mark the blast as it blows the coals to a vehement
   heat--if it could speak, it would say, "Ah, woe is me that ever I
   should be put into such a blazing furnace as that! I shall be burnt up.
   I shall be melted with the slag. I shall be utterly consumed!" But
   suppose another lump, all bright and glistening could lie by its side
   and say, "No, no, you are just like I was, but I went through the fire
   and I lost nothing! See how bright I am and how I have survived all the
   flames."

   Why then that piece of ore would rather anticipate than dread the
   season when it, too, should be exposed to the purifying heat and come
   out all bright and lustrous like its companion. I see You, I see You,
   Son of Mary--bone of our bone, flesh of our Flesh--You have felt the
   flames but You are not destroyed. The smell of fire has not passed upon
   You. Your heel has been bruised, but You have broken the serpent's
   head. There is no scar, nor spot, nor injury on You. You have survived
   the conflict and I, bearing Your name, purchased with Your blood and
   dear to God as You are dear to Him--I shall survive it too. Therefore
   will I tread the coals with confidence and bear the heat with patience.

   Christ's conquest gives me comfort, for I shall conquer, too. And
   please remember, too, that Christ, in going through the suffering of
   temptation was not simply not a loser but He was a great gainer, for it
   is written it pleased God "to make the Captain of their salvation
   perfect through sufferings." It was through His suffering that He
   obtained the mediatorial glory which now crowns His head. Had He never
   carried the Cross He had never worn that crown--that transcendently
   bright and glorious crown which now He wears as King in Zion and as
   leader of His people whom He has redeemed by blood.

   God over all, blessed forever He would have been, but as God-man
   Mediator He could never have been extolled unless He had been obedient
   even unto death. So He was a gainer by His suffering. And glory be to
   His name we get comfort from this, too, for we also shall be gainers by
   our temptations. We shall come up out of Egypt enriched! As it is
   written, "He brought them forth also with silver and gold," so shall we
   come forth out of trial with better than these treasures.

   "Blessed is the man that endures temptation, for when he is tried he
   shall obtain a crown of life which fades not away." The deeper their
   sorrows the louder their song. The more terrible their toil the sweeter
   their rest. The more bitter the wormwood the more delightful the wine
   of consolation. They shall have glory for their share. They shall have
   honor for their contempt. They shall have songs for their sufferings
   and thrones for their tribulations.

   But more--in that Christ has suffered being tempted, He is able to
   succor us who are tempted by sending His grace to help us. He was
   always able to send grace, but now as God and Man He is able to send
   just the right grace at the right time and in the right place. You know
   a doctor may have all the drugs that can be gathered, but an abundance
   of medicine does not make him a qualified practitioner. If however he
   has been himself and seen the case, then he knows just at what crisis
   of the disease such-and-such a medicine is wanted. The stores are good,
   but the wisdom to use the stores--this is even more precious.

   Now it pleased the Father that in Christ should all fullness dwell--but
   where should the Son of Man earn His diploma and gain the skill with
   which to use the fullness correctly? Beloved, He won it by experience.
   He knows what sore temptations mean for He has felt the same. You know
   if we had comforting grace given to us at one part of our temptation it
   would tempt us more than before--even as certain medicines given to the
   patient at one period of the disease would aggravate the malady, though
   the same medicine would cure it if administered a little later.

   Now Christ knows how to send His comfort at the very nick of time, to
   afford His help exactly when it will not be a superfluity--to send His
   joy when we shall not spend it upon our own lusts. And how knows He
   this? Why, He recollects His own experience--He has passed through it
   all. There appeared an angel unto Him strengthening Him--that angel
   came just when he was wanted. Jesus knows just when to send His angelic
   messenger to strengthen you, when to lay on the rod more heavily and
   when to stay His hand and say, "I have forgiven you. Go in peace."

   Once more, dear Friends, lest I keep you too long. Having suffered
   Himself, being tempted, Christ knows how to succor us by His prayers
   for us. There are some people whose prayers are of no use to us because
   they do not know what to ask for us. Christ is the intercessor for His
   people--He has prevalence in His intercession--but how shall He learn
   what to ask for? How can He know this better than by His own trials? He
   has suffered being tempted. You hear some Brethren pray with such
   power, such unction, such fervor. Why? Part of the reason is that
   theirs are experimental prayers--they pray out their own life.

   They just pray the great deep waters over which they themselves sail.
   Now the prayer of our great High Priest in Heaven is wonderfully
   comprehensive--it is drawn from His own life and it takes in every
   sorrow and every pain that ever rent a human heart, because He Himself
   has suffered being tempted. I know you feel safe in trusting your case
   in the hand of such an Intercessor, for He knows which is the precise
   mercy to ask for and when He asks for it, He knows how to put the words
   and frame the petition so that the mercy shall surely come to you at
   the right time.

   Ah, dear Friends, it is not in my power to bring out the depth which
   lies under my text--but I am certain of this-- when through the deep
   waters He shall cause you to go, or you are made to pass through
   furnace after furnace, you cannot want a better rod and staff nor a
   better table prepared for you in the wilderness than this my text, "In
   that He Himself has suffered being tempted, He is able to succor them
   that are tempted." Hang this text up in your houses. Read it every
   day--take it before God in prayer every time you bend the knee and you
   shall find it to be like the widow's cruse, which failed not and like
   her handful of meal which wasted not. It shall be unto you till the
   last of December what now it is when we begin to feed upon it in
   January.

   Will not my text suit the awakened sinner as well as the saint? There
   are timid souls here. They cannot say they are saved--yet here is a
   loophole of comfort for you, you poor troubled ones that are not yet
   able to get a hold of Jesus. "He is able to succor them that are
   tempted." Go and tell Him you are tempted--tempted, perhaps, to
   despair. Tempted to self-destruction. Tempted to go back to your old
   sins--tempted to think that Christ cannot save you. Go and tell Him
   that He Himself has suffered being tempted and that He is able to
   succor you.

   Believe that He will and He will. You can never believe anything too
   much of the love and goodness of my Lord. He will be better than your
   faith to you. If you can trust Him with all your heart to save you, He
   will do it. If you believe He is able to put away your sin, He will do
   it. If you can but honor Him by giving Him a good character for grace,
   you cannot give Him too good a name--

   "Trust Him, He will not deceive you, Though you hardly on Him lean; He
   will never, never leave you, Nor will let you quite leave Him."
   Receive, then, the blessing--May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and
   the love of God our Father and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be
   with you forever. Amen and Amen.

                             The Voice From Heaven

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 23, 1862, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And they heard a great voice from Hea ven, saying unto them, Come up
   here."

   Revelation 11:12.

   WHAT may be the particular meaning of the prophecy concerning the
   witnesses clothed in sackcloth, their death, their resurrection, and
   their subsequent entrance into Heaven, I am unable to guess. Nor am I
   clear that anybody else has hit upon it. Although I do not despise
   prophesying, I entertain a very intense disgust of those who know
   nothing about them, and yet pretend to be their interpreters. I am free
   to confess that I have not the key to the Book of Revelation and dare
   not set up to be its expositor.

   This, however is no great matter--for without my venturing upon that
   line of things--there are quite enough who are always studying the
   apocalyptic mysteries, and a sufficient number who believe that they
   can comprehend them. No branch of literature has more devoted students,
   and in none are men more successful in refuting one another, or more
   sure that they have established their own theories by demolishing those
   of others. It may be that there are some whose office it is to open
   sealed books--I know that it is mine to enforce the teachings of the
   unsealed volume.

   They may have a call to expound Daniel and Ezekiel--mine is of a much
   humbler, but, I think I may add, of a much more useful character--not
   so much to foretell the fall of dynasties and the deaths of monarchs as
   to deal with matters of vital godliness--and with eternal realities.
   With things that are plainly revealed, which certainly belong unto us,
   and unto our children, I had rather be a sweet savor unto God in souls
   converted, than explain all the last vials. And I would prefer rather
   to comprehend the heights and depths of my Great Master's love, than to
   count the number of the beast, or calculate the duration of the little
   horn.

   I. Waiving, then, all attempts at explaining the text from its
   connection, I intend to use it as the voice of God to His people. We
   shall regard it, first of all as A SUMMONS SENT AT THE APPOINTED HOUR
   TO EVERY SAINT. When the time shall come, fixed by irreversible decree,
   there shall be heard "a great voice from Heaven" to every Believer in
   Christ, saying, "Come up here."

   This should be to us--each one of us if we are in Christ--the subject
   of very joyful anticipation. Instead of decoding the time when we shall
   leave this world to go to the Father, we should be thirsting and
   panting for the hour that shall set our soul at liberty, and give our
   spirit, once and for all, its full discharge from an imprisonment of
   clay and from the bondage of "the body of this death." To some
   Christians it will not only be joyful in anticipation, but it will be
   intensely delightful when it arrives. It is not true, as some suppose,
   that death when it really appears, is necessarily a dreadful and
   hideous apparition--

   "Death no terrific foe appears. An angel's lovely form he wears, A
   friendly messenger he proves To every soul whom Jesus loves." I doubt
   not that many Believers welcome the kind approach of death as the
   arrival of their best friend, and salute their last hour with intense
   delight. Witness the saint who has been for years bedridden. She is
   tossed to and fro as on a sea of pain, never resting at the anchorage
   of ease. She cries at night, "Would God it were morning," and when the
   light of day affects her eyes, she longs for the returning darkness
   that she may slumber for a little season and forget her pains. Her
   bones have worn through her skin by long lying upon a bed made as soft
   as kindness can render it, but, alas, still too hard for so weak and
   tormented a body.

   Pangs have shot through her frame as arrows piercing the foe. Every
   vein has been a river flushed with agony, and every nerve a telegraph
   conveying messages of pain to the spirit. Oh, how welcome shall it be
   when the Voice shall cry from Heaven, "Come up here!" No more weakness
   now! The joyful spirit shall leave all bodily pain behind. The last
   tear shall be wiped away by the Divine Father's hand. And she that was
   a mass of disease and decay, shall now become an embodiment of intense
   delight, full to the brim with satisfaction, and infinite pleasure in
   that land where Jehovah-Rophi reigns. The inhabitant shall no more say,
   "I am sick."

   With what joy will the Voice from Heaven sound in the ear of the man
   wearied with labor! The world shall know of some of us, when we die,
   that we have not been idle--that we have served our God beyond our
   strength. He who finds the ministry an easy profession shall find the
   flames of Hell no pleasant resting place. Oh, there may be some of you
   in whose name I can speak now who have served God with throbbing brow,
   with palpitating heart--weary in your Master's service, but never weary
   of it--springing to the collar when the load was far too heavy for your
   single strength. Ready to labor, or ready to fight, never putting off
   your armor--you stand harnessed both by night and day, crying in your
   Master's name--

   "Is there a foe before whose face I fear His cause to plead? Is there a
   lamb among His flock I would refuse to feed?"

   The time must come when age shall take away the juvenile vigor which
   for a while carried off weariness, and you shall be constrained to
   lament, saying, "When shall the shadows be drawn out? When shall I
   fulfill, as a hireling, my day?" Happy for the minister if in his
   pulpit he shall hear the voice, "Come up here," and shall--

   "His body and his charge lay down, And cease at once to work and live."
   Happy for you, fellow laborers in the kingdom of Christ and in the
   tribulation of our common Savior! When you think you can do no more,
   your doing shall be ended and your reward shall come and your Savior
   shall say, "Come up here"-- and you shall see the glory which you have
   believed in, upon the earth.

   Beloved, with what intense delight will death be hailed by the sons of
   abject poverty, I mean, "such as are of the household of faith." From
   shivering in the winter's cold to the brightness of Heaven. From the
   solitude and desolation of friendless penury to the communion and
   fellowship of saints made perfect. From the table scantily furnished
   with hard-earned bread--from famishing and want. From the poor
   emaciated bones. From the form ready to be bowed down with hunger--from
   the tongue that cleaves to the mouth with thirst. From crying children
   and a wailing wife--wailing for bread, crying that they may be fed! Oh,
   to be snatched away to Heaven!

   Happy man, to have known so much of ill that he may know better the
   sweetness of perfect bliss! Mansions of the blessed, how bright you are
   in contrast with the cotter's hut! Streets of gold, how you shall make
   the beggar forget the cold doorstep and dry arch! Paupers become
   princes--pensioners are peers. And peasants are kings and priests. O
   land of Goshen, how long before the sons of Israel receive you for an
   heritage?

   And, dear Friends, I think I ought to add this--with what seraphic joy
   must this voice have been heard in the martyrs' ears in caves and dens
   of the earth where the holy wander in their sheepskins and
   goatskins--what holy triumph must this message create! Blandina, tossed
   in the Roman amphitheatre on the horns of bulls--then seated in her
   red-hot iron chair, and mocked while she is there consumed before the
   leering multitude--oh, that voice, "Come up here!" How it must have
   cheered her in those horrid agonies which she bore with more than
   masculine heroism.

   The many who have perished on the rack--surely they have seen visions
   like those of Stephen, who, when the stones were rattling about his
   ears saw Heaven open and heard the Heaven-sent voice, "Come up here."
   The multitude of our ancestors--our venerated predecessors who carried
   the banner of the Cross before our day, who stood on flaming wood and
   bore the flames with patience. Their bodies were consumed by fire till
   their lower limbs were burnt away and life just remained within a mass
   of ashes--oh the joy with which they would leap into their fiery
   chariots drawn by horses of fire straight to Heaven--at this omnipotent
   bidding of the Master--"Come up here!"

   Though yours and mine may never be the lot of protracted sickness, or
   abject penury, or excessive labor, or the death of martyrdom--let us
   still believe that if we are true followers of Christ, whenever death
   shall come, or rather whenever life and immortality shall come--it
   shall be a joyous and blessed time for us! Seek not of the Most High to
   delay the time when He shall summon you to the upper chamber, but
   listen every morning, listen with your heart desiring to hear it--
   listen for the royal message which says, "Come up here." An ancient
   singer sweetly words it--

   "I said sometimes with tears, Ah me!I'm afraid to die! Lord silence You
   these fears; My life's with You on high. Sweet truth to me! I shall
   arise, And with these eyes My Savior see!

   What means my trembling heart, To be thus shy of death? My life and I
   shall not part, Though I resign my breath. Sweet truth to me!
   Ishallarise, And with these eyes My Savior see!

   Then welcome harmless grave! By you to Heaven I'll go-- My Lord, Your
   death shall save Me from the flames below. Sweet truth to me!
   Ishallarise, And with these eyes My Savior see!"

   To change the note a moment--while this should be the subject of joyous
   anticipation, it should also be the object of patient waiting. God
   knows best when it is time for us to be bid to, "Come up here." We must
   not wish to antedate the period of our departure. I know that strong
   love will make us cry--

   "O Lord of Hosts the waves divide, And land us all in Heaven," but
   patience must have her perfect work. I would not wish to die while
   there is more work to do or more souls to win, more jewels to place in
   the Redeemer's crown, more glory to be given to His name, and more
   service to be rendered to His Church.

   When George Whitfield lay sick and wanted to die, his Negro nurse had
   prayed for him and at last said, "No Massa Whitfield there is no dying
   for you! There's many a poor Negro yet to be brought to Christ and you
   must live." And live he did. You know when Melancthon lay very sick,
   Martin Luther said he should not die. And when his prayers began to
   work a cure, Melancthon said, "Let me die Luther, let me die, leave off
   your prayers." Luther replied, "No, man, I want you. God's cause wants
   you, and you shall not die yet." And when Melancthon refused to eat or
   to take the necessary medicine because he hoped to be soon with Christ,
   Luther threatened him with excommunication if he did not then and there
   do as he was bid.

   It is not for us by neglect of means, or wanton waste of strength, or
   profligate zeal, to cut short a life which may be useful. "Do yourself
   no harm"--the advice of Paul to the jailor--is not at all amiss here.
   God knows the pace at which time should travel, and how long the road
   of life should be. Why, if it were possible for there to be regrets in
   Heaven, it might be that we did not live longer here to do more good.
   More sheaves! More jewels! But how, unless there is more work? True,
   there is the other side of it--that living so briefly we sin the less,
   and our temptations are the fewer--but oh, when we are fully serving
   God, and He is using us to scatter precious seed and reap a
   hundred-fold, we would say it is well for us to abide where we are.

   An aged Christian, asked whether she would rather die or live, said she
   would rather it should be as God willed it. "But if you might have your
   choice, which would you have?" "If I might have my choice," said she,
   "I would ask God to choose for me, for I should be afraid to choose for
   myself." So be you ready to stay on this side of Jordan, or to cross
   the flood--just as your Master wills it.

   And then another thought. As this, "Come up here," should excite joyous
   anticipation, tempered by patient waiting, so, Beloved, it should
   always be to us a matter of absolute certainty as to its ultimate
   reception. I would not give sleep to my eyes, nor slumber to my eyelids
   if this were a subject of doubt, personally, as to whether at the last
   I should stand among the justified. I can understand a man being in
   doubt about his interest in Christ, but I cannot understand, and I hope
   I never may, a man's resting content if there are doubts. This is a
   matter about which we want absolute certainty. Young man yonder! Are
   you sure that the King will say to you, "Come up here"?

   If you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ with all your heart, that call
   from the Divine Throne is as certain to meet your ear as that other
   cry, "Dust you are, and unto dust you shall return." He that believes
   on the Son of God has everlasting life. No "ifs" or "buts" ought to be
   tolerated in our hearts. I know they will come up like ill weeds, but
   it is ours to pull them up, heap them together, and set them on fire,
   as farmers do with the twitch in their furrows. The devil loves us to
   cast lots at the foot of the Cross--but Christ would have us look unto
   Him and find a sure salvation.

   No, no, we are not to be put off with guesswork here. My Friend, can
   you be easy without infallible certainty? What? You may die tonight and
   be lost forever, and can you be happy? No, Man, I charge you by the
   living God, shut not those eyes until you are sure that you shall open
   them either in earth or Heaven! But if there is this fear that you may
   lift up those eyes in Hell, how dare you sleep? How dare you sleep,
   lest your bed become your tomb, and your chamber become the door of
   Tophet to you? Oh, Brothers and Sisters, let us seek to have the seal
   of God upon us--the infallible witness of the Holy Spirit bearing
   witness with our spirits--that we are born of God. Then, and only then,
   we may joyfully hope and quietly wait to see the salvation of God when
   the Master says, "Come up here."

   I will add this fourth thought and then proceed. I think very often,
   besides joyfully anticipating, patiently waiting, and being confidently
   assured of it, the Christian should delightfully contemplate it. Ah,
   let every Christian now say, "I shall soon be dying--time swiftly
   speeds away. There is my chamber. I can paint the picture now. They
   have told me that I am very sick, but they have kept back from me, till
   I asked them plainly, the news that I must very speedily die. But now I
   know it and feel the sentence of death in myself.

   Now for the joyous secret--in a few minutes I shall know more of Heaven
   than an assembly of Divines could teach me. But how solemn is the scene
   around me--they are moving quietly about the room--very silently they
   are catching each word that is uttered--treasuring it up. Now Saint,
   you must play the man! Say a good word for your Master! Stir the deeps
   of Jordan with your bold march of victory, O soldier of Jesus! Make its
   shelving shores resound with your melodies! Show them how a Christian
   can die--now let your full heart overflow with flood tides of Heaven.
   Drink up the bitter cup and say, "Death is swallowed up in victory."

   But, how is this that my mind seems fluttering as though about to take
   wing?--

   "What is this absorbs me quite-- Steals my senses--shuts my sight--
   Drowns my spirit--draws my breath? Tell me, my Soul, can this be
   death?" I cannot see. The film is forming on my eyes--it is the death
   glaze. A clammy sweat is on my brow--it is the dew from the damps of
   death. The kind hand of affection has just wiped my forehead, and I
   wish to speak, but there is a throttle in my throat which keeps down
   the word this is the monitor to me of the silence of the tomb. I will
   strive against it--

   "Joyful, with all the strength I have, My quivering lips shall sing,
   Where is your victory, boasting grave? And where's the monster's
   sting?"

   The effort has exhausted the dying one. He must fall back again. They
   stay him up with pillows. Ah, you may prop him up with pillows, but he
   has a better arm beneath him than that of the fondest friend!

   Now does his Beloved say, "Stay him with apples, and comfort him with
   flagons," for while sick to death, he is also "sick of love." His
   Master makes his bed in his sickness. His left hand is under his head,
   and His right hand does embrace him. The Husband of that chosen soul is
   now answering the prayer for His Presence which it delighted to offer,
   saying, "Abide with Me." Now is the poet's prayer granted to the
   letter--

   "Hold then, Your Cross before my closing eyes! Shine through the gloom
   and point me to the skies!
   Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee-- In life and
   death, O Lord, abide with me!" We cannot paint the last moment. The
   rapture, the dawning Glory, the first young flash of the beatific
   Glory--we must leave all that. On earth, the scene is far more somber
   and yet not sad--see yonder friends? They gather round. They say, "Yes,
   he is gone--how placidly he slept! I could not tell the moment when he
   passed from sleep to death. He is gone." They weep, but not with
   hopeless sorrow, for they mourn the body, not the soul. The setting is
   broken, but the gem is safe. The fold is removed, but the sheep is
   feeding on the hilltops of Glory. Worms devour the clay, but angels
   welcome the soul. There is general mourning wherever the good man was
   known--but mark you, it is only in the dark that this sorrow reigns.
   Up there in the light, what are they doing? That spirit, as it left the
   body, found itself not alone. Angels had come to meet it. Angelic
   spirits clasped the disembodied spirit in their arms and bore it upward
   beyond the stars--beyond where the angel in the sun keeps his
   everlasting watch--beyond, beyond this lower sky immeasurable leagues.
   Lo! The pearly gates appear, and the azure light of the city of
   bejeweled walls! The spirit asks, "Is yonder city the fair Jerusalem
   where they need no candle, neither light of the sun?" He shall see for
   himself before long, for they are nearing the Holy City, and it is time
   for the cherub-bearers to begin their choral.
   The music breaks from the lips of those that convey the saint to
   Heaven--"Lift up your heads, O you gates, and be you lifted up you
   everlasting doors, that the blood-bought of the King of Glory may come
   in!" The gates of pearl give way! The joyous crowds of Heaven welcome
   their Brother to the seats of immortality. But what next, I cannot
   tell. In vain the fancy strives to paint it. Jesus is there, and the
   spirit is in His arms in Heaven, where should it be but in the arms of
   Jesus? O joy! Joy! Joy! Boundless oceans of joy! I shall see Him! I
   shall see Him! These eyes shall see Him and not another--
   "Shall see Him wear that very flesh On which my guilt was laid. His
   love intense, His merit fresh, As though but newly slain. These eyes
   shall see Him in that day The Man that died for me! And all my rising
   bones shall say, Lord, who is like to You."

   I could lose myself while talking upon this subject, for my heart is
   all on fire! I wander, but I cannot help it. My heart is far away upon
   the hills with my Beloved Lord. What will the bliss of Glory be? A
   surprise, I think, even to those who shall obtain it. We shall scarcely
   know ourselves when we get to Heaven! We shall be so surprised at the
   difference. That poor man yonder is to be robed in all the splendors of
   a king! Come with me and see those bright ones--that son of toil, who
   rests forever--that child of sin, washed by Jesus, and now a companion
   of the God of Heaven!

   And /, the chief of sinners singing out His praise! Saul of Tarsus,
   hymning the music of Calvary! The penitent thief, with his deep bass
   note, exalting dying love. And Magdalene, mounting to the alto notes,
   for there must be some voices even in Heaven which must sing alone, and
   mount to higher notes where the rest of us cannot reach--the whole
   together singing, "Unto Him that loved us, and has washed us from our
   sins in His blood, unto Him be glory forever and ever." Oh that we were
   there! Oh that we were there! But we must patiently wait the Master's
   will. It shall not be long before He shall say, "Come up here."

   II. And now we shall turn to a second part of the subject. We will take
   the text, this time, not as a summons to depart, but as a WHISPER FROM
   THE SKIES TO THE BELIEVER'S HEART. There is a Voice that sounds from

   Heaven tonight, not as a peremptory summons, but as a gently-whispered
   invitation--"Come up here."

   The Father seems to say this to every adopted child tonight. We say,
   "Our Father which are in Heaven." The Father's heart desires to have
   His children round His knees, and His love each day beckons us with a
   tender, "Come up here." Nor will your Father, and my Father ever be
   content till everyone of His children shall be in the many mansions
   above. And Jesus whispers this in your ear tonight, too. Listen! Do you
   not hear Him say, "I will that they also whom You have given Me be with
   Me where I am, that they may behold My glory--the glory which You have
   given Me--the glory which I had with You before the world was." Jesus
   beckons you to the skies, Believer.

   Lay not hold upon the things of earth. He who is but a lodger in an inn
   must not live as though he were at home. Keep your tent ready for
   striking. Be always prepared to draw up your anchor, and to sail across
   the sea and find the better port--for while Jesus beckons, here we have
   no continuing city. No true wife has rest save in the house of her
   husband. Where her consort is, there is her home--a home which draws
   her soul towards it every day. Jesus, I say, invites us to the skies.
   He cannot be completely content until He brings His body, the Church,
   into the Glory of its Head, and conducts His elect spouse to the
   marriage feast of her Lord.

   Besides the desires of the Father and the Son, all those who have gone
   before seem to be leaning over the battlements of Heaven tonight, and
   calling, "Courage, Brothers! Courage, Brothers and Sisters! Eternal
   Glory awaits you. Fight your way, stem the current, breast the wave,
   and come up here. We, without you, cannot be made perfect--there is no
   perfect Church in Heaven till all the chosen saints are there.
   Therefore come up here."

   They stretch out their hands of fellowship. They look with glistening
   eyes of strong affection upon us, and again, they say, "Come up here."
   Warriors who wear your laurels, you call us to the brow of the hill
   where the like triumphs await us. The angels do the same tonight. How
   they must wonder to see us so careless, so worldly, so hardened! They
   also beckon us away, and cry from their starry seats, "Beloved, you
   over whom we rejoiced when you were brought as prodigals to your
   Father's house, 'Come up here,' for we long to see you. Your story of
   Divine Grace will be a strange and wondrous one--one which angels love
   to hear--

   "Stretch your wings, you saints and fly, Straight to yonder worlds of
   joy."

   I have kept my pledge to be short on that point. You can walk in this
   meditation as in a garden when you are quiet and alone. All nature
   rings the bell which calls you to the temple above. You may see the
   stars at night, looking down like the eyes of God upon you, and saying,
   "Come up here." The whispers of the wind, as they come in the stillness
   of the night talk to you, and say, "There is another and a better land.
   Come away with us--'Come up here.' " Yes, every cloud that sails across
   the sky may say to you, "Mount up beyond me, into the clear ether which
   no cloud can dim. Behold the sun which I can never hide--the noon which
   I can never mar. "Come up here."

   III. I shall want your attention to my third point for a few minutes,
   for I think these words may be used as A LOVING INVITATION TO
   UNCONVERTED PERSONS. There are many spirit voices which cry to them,
   "Come up here.

   Come up to Heaven."

   I like to see so many crowding here on these dark, cold, wintry days.
   This huge place is just as crowded as though it were some little
   vestry. You press upon one another as did the throngs in the days of
   the Master. God gives a spirit of hearing nowadays in a most wonderful
   manner. And oh, I would that while you are hearing, some living spark
   of Divine fire may fall into your hearts and become the parent of a
   glowing fire! If we ask any man whether he desires to go to Heaven, he
   will say, "Yes," but alas, his desires for Heaven are not strong enough
   to be of practical use! They are such sorry winds, that there is no
   sailing to Heaven with them.

   Perhaps if we can quicken those desires tonight, God the Spirit may
   bless our words to the bringing of men into the way of life. Sinner,
   Wanderer, far from God, many voices salute you tonight. Albeit you have
   chosen the paths of the Destroyer, there are many who would turn you to
   the way of peace. First, God our Father calls you. You say, "How?"
   Sinner, you have had many troubles of late. Business goes amiss. You
   have been out of work, unfortunate, troubled, disappointed. You have
   tried to get on, but you cannot do it in your house. Everything is out
   of order--somehow or other, whatever you put your hand to--nothing
   prospers.

   You are always floundering from one slough into another. And you are
   growing weary of your life. Do you not know, Sinner, this is your
   Father saying, "Come up here"? Your portion is not here. Seek another
   and a better land. You have built your nest on a tree that is marked
   for the axe, and He is pulling your nest down for you, that you may
   build on the Rock. I tell you, these troubles are but love strokes to
   deliver you from yourself. If you had been left untouched, I had had
   little hope for you. Surely then, God would have said, "Let him alone.
   He will have no portion in the next life, let him have his portion
   here."

   We have heard of a wife, a godly woman, who for twenty years had been
   persecuted by a brutal husband--a husband so excessively bad that her
   faith at last failed her, and she ceased to be able to believe that he
   would ever be converted. But all this while she was more kind to him
   than ever. One night, at twelve o'clock, in a drunken state, he told
   his friends he had such a wife as no other man had. And if they would
   go home with him, he would get her up, to try her temper, and she
   should get a supper for them all.

   They came and the supper was very soon ready, consisting of such things
   as she had prepared, as well and as rapidly as the occasion would
   allow. And she waited at the table with as much cheerfulness as if the
   feast had been held at the proper time. She did not utter a word of
   complaint. At last, one of the company, more sober than the rest, asked
   how it was she could always be so kind to such a husband. Seeing that
   her conduct had made some little impression, she ventured to say to
   him, "I have done all I can to bring my husband to God, and I fear he
   will never be saved. Since, therefore, his portion must be in Hell
   forever, I will make him as happy as I can while he is here, for he has
   nothing to expect hereafter."

   Now, such is your case tonight. You may get some pleasure here, but you
   have nothing to expect hereafter. God has been pleased, I said just
   now, to take your pleasures away. Here, then, I have good hopes that,
   since He shakes you from the present, you may be driven to the future.
   God your Father is thus making you uncomfortable in order that you may
   seek Him. It is the beckoning of the finger of His love, "Come up
   here." And you know, those deaths you have had lately, all say, "Come
   up here."

   You remember when your mother died--that was a Saint, indeed! Do you
   remember, John, what she said to you? She said, "I could die happy, if
   it were not for you, and your brother. But O that I might have a hope
   that you may yet come to God." Do you remember, Man, how that little
   daughter of yours, that had been to the Sunday School and died so
   young, kissed you and said to you, "Father, dear Father, do give up the
   drunkard's cup and follow me to Heaven. Do not be angry, Father, I am
   dying. Do not be angry because I said that, Father. Follow me to
   Heaven." You have not yielded to that loving entreaty. You are
   descending into Hell.

   Yet remember, all this was God beckoning to you and saying, "Come up
   here." He has called, and you have refused. Take care, lest when you
   call, He should refuse you. Besides, you have had a sickness yourself.
   If I am not mistaken, I am speaking to the right man now. It is not so
   long ago since you had a fever, or what was it? It was an accident, and
   everybody said you had a near escape for life. You had time for
   reflection when you lay in that hospital, or in your own little room.
   Do you remember what conscience said to you? How it rent away the
   curtain and made you look at your destiny, until you read in fiery
   letters these words, "You shall make your bed in Hell"?

   Oh, how you trembled then! You had no objection to see the minister.
   You could not laugh, then, at the Gospel of Christ! You made a great
   many vows and resolutions, and you have broken them all. You have lied
   unto the Most High. You have perjured yourself to the God of Israel,
   and mocked at the God of mercy, and of justice. Beware, lest He take
   you away with a stroke, for then a great ransom shall not deliver you.
   These things, then, have been beckonings of your Father's hand to you,
   saying, "Come up here."

   But more, the Lord Jesus Christ has also beckoned to you to come. You
   have heard that He made a way to Heaven. What does a way mean? Is not a
   road an invitation to a traveler to walk therein? I have crossed the
   Alps, and have seen the mighty roads which Napoleon made that he might
   take his cannon into Austria. But how shall we compare the works which
   men have made through the solid granite and over pathless
   mountains--mountains that before were pathless-- how shall we compare
   these with the road which Christ has made to Heaven through the rocks
   of Justice, over the gulfs of Sin, throwing Himself into the gaps,
   leaping into the chasm to complete the way?

   Now, the way itself speaks to you. The blood of Christ, which made the
   way, speaks better things than that of Abel. And it says, "Sinner,
   believe on Christ and you are saved." By every drop of blood which
   streamed in sweat from Him in the garden. By every drop which poured
   from His hands and feet. By all the agony which He endured, I do
   beseech you-- hear the Voice which cries, "Go and sin no more." Trust
   your soul with Him and you are saved.

   But, my dear Hearer, have patience with me--give me your ear. The
   Spirit of God strives with you, and cries, "Come up here." The Spirit
   of God wrote this Book. And why was this Book written? Hear the words
   of Scripture, "These are written that you might believe that Jesus is
   the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing, you might have life
   through His name." Here is the Book full of promises, perfumed with
   affection, brimming with love. Oh, why, why will you spurn it, and put
   the voice of mercy from you? Every time you see the Bible, imagine you
   see written on its cover, "Go up to Heaven, seek eternal life."

   Then there is the ministry through which the Spirit of God speaks. I
   have often prayed my Master to give me a Baxter's heart to weep for
   sinners, and a Whitfield's tongue to plead. I have neither. But if I
   had them, oh, how would I plead with you! But such as I have, I give
   you. As God's ambassador, I do beseech you, Sinner, turn from the error
   of your ways. "As I live, says the Lord, I have no pleasure in the
   death of him that dies, but would rather that he turn unto Me and
   live." "Why will you die?" Is Hell so pleasant? Is an angry God a
   trifle? Is sin a thing to be laughed at? Is the right hand of God, when
   bared in thunder, a thing to be despised? Oh, turn! Flee to the Refuge!
   The Spirit bids you fly!

   Moreover, does not your conscience say the same? Is not there something
   in your heart tonight which says--"Begin to think about your soul.
   Trust your soul with Christ"? May Divine Grace constrain you to listen
   to the still small voice, that you may be saved!

   And, last of all, the spirits of your departed friends cry from Heaven
   to you tonight--that voice which I would you could hear, "Come up
   here." Mother--unconverted woman--you have a babe in Heaven. Perhaps
   not one or two, but a family of babes in Heaven. You are a mother of
   angels, and those young cherubs cry to you, "Mother, come up here!" But
   this can never be unless you repent and believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ! I know there are some of you who have carried to the tomb the
   most sainted of relatives. Your hoary-headed father at last went the
   way of all flesh, and from his celestial seat before the eternal throne
   he cries, "Come up here."

   A sister, sickened by consumption, who has long since left your house
   for you to mourn her absence, cries "Come up here." I entreat you, you
   sons of saints in glory! I entreat you, daughter of immortal
   mothers--despise not now the voice of those who speak from Heaven to
   you! Oh, were they here--could it be possible for them to come here to
   speak to you tonight, I know the notes of fond affection which would
   spring from your lips--"There's my mother." "There's my father."

   They cannot come--but I am the spokesman for them. If I cannot speak as
   they might, yet remember, if you are not converted when you hear the
   Gospel preached, "neither would you be converted if one rose from the
   dead." They could but tell you the Gospel. I do no less. That Gospel
   is, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved." "He that
   believes and is baptized shall be saved," says the Evangelist. To
   believe is to trust Christ. To be baptized is not baby sprinkling--for
   that there is no warrant but in the inventions of man. To be baptized
   is to be buried with Christ in Baptism after faith--for that which is
   done without faith, and not done of faith, is contrary to the Lord's
   command.

   Baptism is for Believers, not for sinners--like the Lord's Supper, it
   is in the Church, not out of it. Believing, you are saved. Baptism does
   not save you. You are baptized because you are saved. Baptism is the
   outward recognition of the great inward change which the Spirit of God
   has worked. Believe, then, in Jesus. Flat on your face before His
   Cross, cast yourself. Then rise and say, "Now will I confess His name,"
   and be united with His Church, and believe that at last, having
   confessed Him before men, He may confess you before His Father which is
   in Heaven.

   And now you are going home tonight--I am clear of your blood, remember.
   I know not how many may be here, but I suppose there are seven thousand
   people here tonight who will be without excuse in the Day of Judgment.
   I have warned you as best I can. I have pleaded with you. Sinner!
   Sinner! Your blood is on your own head if you refuse this great
   Salvation! O God the Holy Spirit, make them willing in the day of Your
   Power, and save them this night and forever, for Your name's sake.
   Amen.

                            Broad Rivers And Streams

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JANUARY 18, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: your eyes shall see
   Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken
   down. Not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither
   shall any of the cords thereof be broken. But there the glorious Lord
   will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go
   no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby. For the
   Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King. He
   will save us. Your tacklings are loosed, they could not well strengthen
   their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great
   spoil divided, the lame take the prey." Isaiah 33:20-23.

   THIS prophecy was uttered when the city of Jerusalem was reduced to the
   direst extremity. The Assyrian hosts threatened the city with utter
   destruction. Rabshakeh, a fitting herald for his tyrannical master, had
   advanced to inspect the walls while Sennacherib tarried at Lachish.
   False to all treaties, the heavy sum paid down by Hezekiah could not
   ensure the promised mercy from the ferocious despot. The treasuries of
   the city were exhausted, and therefore no further attempt in that
   direction could be made. No help could be looked for from any other
   nation. Even Egypt was in deadly fear of the great power of Nineveh.

   The Assyrians were strong as lions, and cruel as evening wolves. No
   nation had ever equaled them in remorseless and wanton cruelty.
   Punishments the most horrible were constantly executed upon those whom
   they vanquished. Impalement, flaying alive, and piercing out the eyes
   were their ordinary amusements after the close of battle. Look at the
   stones disinterred from Nineveh, and you will see engraved there by
   themselves memorials of the horrible barbarities which they constantly
   perpetrated. Sennacherib's army was exceedingly great. It had already
   stormed many cities.

   Arphad and Sepharvaim, Hamath and Samaria had fallen an easy
   spoil--cities that were surrounded by rivers had been defeated by
   diverting the current and so drying up the streams. Or else by using
   galleys with oars, the Assyrian monarch had reached the walls and
   applied the scaling ladders. The army was so well equipped, so
   numerous, and so thoroughly well supplied with all munitions of war,
   that there was not the slightest hope of the escape of Jerusalem except
   by Divine power. Yet the Assyrians did not shoot an arrow there, nor
   did they cast up a mound against it, for at nightfall the angel of the
   Lord went forth and slew a hundred and forty thousand men, and
   Sennacherib hastened back to his own land.

   Brethren, you know the analogy here, how the Church of Christ is every
   day surrounded by the most ferocious adversaries. She is like
   Jerusalem. All round about her the dogs of Hell are yelping for her as
   their prey. Satan has multitudes of faithful servants too glad to
   engage in battle against the Lord's Anointed, and against the Church
   which He has redeemed by His own blood. They are well armed with an
   infernal protection. They are very skillful, determined and resolute.
   Not a stone will be left unturned to blot out the remembrance of
   Christ's kingdom from under Heaven.

   But rejoice! Even if the dark day should come, be not dismayed! God is
   our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. The Church is
   not in danger. She is impregnably garrisoned. The gates of Hell shall
   not prevail against her, and she shall abide in her place until He
   shall come who has made her beautiful for the situation, the joy of the
   whole earth. He shall come to translate her to the skies, to be the New
   Jerusalem--the Bride, the Lamb's wife--to glitter forever in the
   brightness which far outshines the light of the sun.

   Let us now with profound attention meditate upon our text, and notice
   that, as the existence of Jerusalem was imperiled, the first promise of
   Isaiah was that Jerusalem should still exist--"Your eyes shall see
   Jerusalem a quiet habitation," and so on. But, further, inasmuch as
   during the siege many unbelieving persons had found fault with the
   position of Jerusalem, because it was not surrounded by a river, the
   promise is given that she shall have a glorious position--"There the
   glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams."

   No, more than this, as a climax of blessing, she is promised perpetual
   triumph over all her enemies, since in her streams, "shall go no galley
   with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby." Or, if they come,
   they shall prove a wreck--"Your tacklings are loosed. They could not
   well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail."

   I. The first promise made to the Church of God in our text is one
   SECURING TO HER AN EVERLASTING EXISTENCE. The Church is not a temporary
   institution--it shall never be removed, but abide forever.

   1. From the words of the text I gather that the Jerusalem of God shall
   exist as she is. What was she in those days? She was the city of
   solemnities. She was the place where prayer and praise were custom to
   be made. So is she to continue throughout all generations. The Church
   of God is in this world the city of all true solemnities. Any prayer
   and praise that are not offered by the chosen of the Lord, who
   constitute the true and invisible Church of God, are but vain
   oblations.

   Zion--the chosen Church, redeemed by blood, called by the Spirit, and
   preserved by Divine Grace--Zion is the one consecrated enclosure in
   which sacrifices of righteousness can be acceptably offered. This
   hallowed temple shall stand forever as the Lord's chosen dwelling
   place. Beloved, the day shall never come when the Church shall cease to
   be the temple of prayer. The fire upon this altar shall never be
   quenched day nor night--

   "To Him shall constant prayer be made, And princes throng to crown His
   head. His name like sweet perfume shall rise With every morning's
   sacrifice."

   There shall never lack a man in our Israel to hold up holy hands, like
   Moses, upon the mountain, that the hosts of God may prevail in the
   plain below. Elijahs may be taken away, but Elishas shall follow.
   Apostles may cease their perpetual supplications, but a train of
   intercessors shall follow in their footsteps. While earth brings forth
   her harvests, the Church shall yield her sheaves of prayer. Nor shall
   praise ever cease. The hallowed hymn, the psalm of victory, the
   hallelujah of triumphant joy--these shall never be suspended in the
   worst days of the Church. Even when she assembled in the catacombs and
   gathered her sons for worship in the caves of the earth--even then she
   had her hymns of praise--even then they sang of Christ ascended and
   about to come.

   The roaring of the sea may cease, the thunders may be hushed, and the
   spheres may end their songs, but the redeemed of the Lord must praise
   the name of Jehovah world without end. Neither shall the Church ever
   cease to be the fountain of ministry. The ministration of the Word is a
   part of our solemnities. There shall never come a time when the
   Prophet's voice shall be stilled. Our Lord will still raise pastors
   after His own heart, and teachers anointed for His work. The living
   waters shall ever gush from the foot of Mount Zion, and the stream
   which welled up when Jesus sent forth His twelve disciples shall flow
   on, ever widening, ever deepening, "Till, like a sea of glory, it
   spreads from pole to pole."

   City of our solemnities! We delight to behold the feet of the
   ambassadors of the Lord. They are beautiful upon the mountains, for
   they proclaim to us glad tidings. How greatly do we rejoice that we
   shall never lack the messenger sent from Heaven, nor shall the
   candlestick be removed out of its place. Moreover, Beloved, the
   ordinances of God's house, such as Baptism and the Sacred Supper, these
   shall never cease. There was a day when Baptism was hardly known in the
   Christian Church, save only among a persecuted few who were called
   heretics.

   Nevertheless, the hallowed stream has always been stirred by some who,
   "faithful to their Master found," were buried with Him in Baptism unto
   death, and gave in Baptism the answer of a good conscience towards God.
   And the Lord's Supper, too, had almost ceased from the Christian
   Church. The "mass," of course, continued, but what of that? Is that the
   Lord's Supper? No, verily, but a profane prostitution of the simplicity
   of God, a silly mystery more fitted to be styled the incantation of a
   haggard witch, than to be called the Supper of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   But still, there were a faithful few, called heretics, who met together
   and broke bread in remembrance of their Lord and Master. And so,
   Brothers and Sisters, while seedtime and harvest, summer and winter
   shall continue, until He comes, we will show forth His death, we will
   set forth His burial, celebrating, according to His own will, the
   commands and ordinances which He Himself has given us. City of our
   solemnities, methinks I see you now in vision! You are the place where
   God dwells between the curtains, hidden from the gaze of unhallowed
   eyes, seen only by those whom Christ has made kings and priests unto
   God!

   Never, never, never from you, O Church of God, shall the presence of
   the Holy One depart! No rushing of wings shall be heard, as in the
   siege of Jerusalem. No mysterious voice shall thunder, "Arise, let us
   go from here." "Lo I am with you always, even unto the end of the
   world," secures to you, O Zion, the Presence of your Lord and Master
   forever. Methinks I see your altar--on it smokes the Lamb that has just
   been slain--still acceptable before the Lord, and ever to remain the
   finished sacrifice--

   "Dear dying Lamb, Your precious blood Shall never lose its Power, Till
   all the ransomed Church of God Be sa ved to sin no more."

   Hallowed courts, you shall never be desecrated! Sacred rites, you shall
   never cease! The Lord has said it, and it must be! His Church
   abides--though the mountains depart, and the hills be removed, yet
   shall not His Covenant of love depart from her--nor shall her safety
   ever be imperiled, even unto the world's end.

   2. Further, my Brothers and Sisters, it appears to me that the city is
   to exist, not only as the city of our solemnities, which it is, but as
   a quiet habitation which we would desire it to be. The Church of God is
   always a quiet habitation, even when her enemies surround her. Some of
   you may have seen, some months ago in the Exhibition, a Belgian picture
   representing the reading of the statute of the Duke of Alva in the
   Flemish Towns, establishing the Inquisition. Godly merchants are
   listening in deep solemnity of sorrow. The young maiden weeps upon her
   sister's bosom, the aged woman turns her streaming eyes to Heaven.

   All this the painter could depict, but he could not paint the deep
   Heaven-born peace which still possessed the souls of the threatened
   ones--who for the Master's sake could suffer all worldly loss. That
   peace of God which passes all understanding, lives even in the day of
   trial. You know what Martin Luther said, whenever any trouble came,
   "Come, let us go in and sing the forty-sixth Psalm, and defy the
   devil." And oh, how grandly that old Psalm would swell from the deep
   bass voices of the Reformer and his companions--"God is our refuge and
   strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear,
   though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into
   the midst of the sea."

   With all her foes about her, I say, the Church of God is evermore a
   quiet habitation. But how quiet is she, Beloved, when her enemies are
   not allowed to prey upon her! "Then had the Churches rest," says the
   Holy Spirit in the Acts of the Apostles, and verily, the text applies
   to us now. We sit, every man, under his own vine, and under his own fig
   tree, none making us afraid. And besides the quiet we enjoy
   politically, I thank God that in this Church, at least, we know what
   quiet means in our communion with one another. Where ever the Holy
   Spirit dwells, there will be quietness. The Holy Spirit, you know, is
   represented to us as a dove--doves love not the storm, and the Spirit
   of God abides not where there is noise, strife, controversy and
   division. No. There must be peace and quietness.

   And you, my beloved Friends, who are really in the Church of
   Christ--mark, you may be in our Church, and not in the Church of
   Christ--you may make a profession of being in the Church and not be in
   the invisible, mysterious, secret body of the faithful. But if you
   really are among that chosen number, you will enjoy great quietness,
   you will be able to say with the Apostle, "Therefore being justified by
   faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." You will
   get a hold of the Psalmist's meaning when he said, "So He gives His
   beloved sleep." You will rest in God's love even as God rests in it.

   Happy day! Happy day! For those who, by the eye of faith, can look into
   the future after Christ shall come, who can behold the glad millennial
   age--they shall understand yet more fully the meaning of this prophecy,
   "Your eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation." When everywhere
   Christ shall be known. When in every land the fifth and last empire
   shall rule. Then, as in the days of Solomon, there shall be no war, but
   peace, peace forever. Till then the God of all peace is with us and we
   may be sure that all is well.

   Our quietness must continue, for the Church nestles under the wings of
   God. How can she be disquieted? The mountains of His power are round
   about her. How can she be carried by storm? Her Lord is a wall of fire
   encircling her. Who can touch her? He is the glory in the midst of her.
   How can she fear? He is All in All to her. He wears her on His breast,
   He has written her name on His hands. She is the jewel of His crown and
   the bracelet of His arm. Oh, how blessed must she be!

   3. But, further, our text seems to indicate that there were some
   persons who doubted all this and said, "Well, but you speak of this
   city as though it could stand an attack. It cannot--it is such a feeble
   place, it is like a tent, it can soon be stormed--a gust of wind can
   blow it over." The Lord anticipates this difficulty and shows that the
   feebleness of Jerusalem should be no reason why she should not still
   continue to exist. She is a tabernacle--a mere tent--but she is a
   tabernacle that shall not be taken down.

   It is true that to human eyes she seems to have no huge stones, no
   gates of brass, no bulwarks of solid masonry. But though she has
   nothing but cords and stakes, yet her stakes shall not be loosed, nor
   shall her cords be snapped. Oh, Beloved, one delights to think of the
   feebleness of the Church, as magnifying the power of Him who keeps her!
   What can be more feeble than the Church of God? She has no carnal
   weapons. "My kingdom is not of this world, else would My servants
   fight." The true Church has no great riches. The most of her followers
   are poor. She has no wisdom. They who use logic and cunning can soon
   overthrow her disciples and ridicule her advocates.

   She understands not the wisdom of human speech, or, rather, she
   renounces it and speaks with simplicity, as she ought to speak.
   Philosophers laugh at her. Kings hardly take her into account. They
   think the Church so insignificant that they can put out her candle when
   they will. But, ah, not so. The Church is still secure, despite her
   feebleness. It is wonderful, how during these last nineteen centuries,
   God has been pleased to keep that spark alive. All the devils in Hell
   have been spitting at this candle, but it burns still--they have sought
   to throw the whole of the floods of evil upon the Heaven-kindled spark,
   but the spark still lives.

   They have tried to stamp it out, but it has blazed the more. The
   Church's feebleness, because it drives her to God, is the Church's
   strength. I pray God that our Church may never confide in wisdom, or
   wit, or eloquence, or riches, or rank, or fame. No, Lord, You are the
   reinforced pillar of Your Church's sure support, and if we rest on You,
   we are secure. But if once we depend elsewhere, we fall to our
   confusion.

   4. Further, complete this part of the promise, the city,
   notwithstanding all her feebleness, is to be forever complete. If I
   understand the last two sentences--"Not one of the stakes thereof shall
   ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken," we
   learn here that all the true members of the Church are safe. Some of
   them may be driven into the earth as the stakes are driven, with a
   heavy mallet--but the strokes of tribulation shall only give them a
   better hold and minister stability to the whole structure.

   Satan may seek to pull them up, and the winds may blow on the tent
   enough to tear up the stakes that hold it, but no hurricane or raging
   typhoon shall cast down the Divine habitation. Cords are apt to be
   snapped, and if they are long used, the strands at last may rot and new
   cords and new stakes may be required--but not so with the Church of
   God. If you are one of the cords or the stakes of the Church, you shall
   never be cast away, the Lord will take care, not only to preserve the
   Church as a whole, but each individual part of it.

   I need not enlarge here, for you are all sound in your belief of final
   perseverance. What should we do without that precious doctrine! Oh,
   Brothers and Sisters, if one cord could be snapped, surely it were
   myself! If one stake could be removed, I think I hear you say, "It must
   be I. I must be moved, I must be cast away." But not one shall be. Just
   as the stones were taken out of the quarry and all shaped, to be put in
   their own position in Solomon's temple, and no one stone could take
   another stone's niche, so you have your place appointed you. And you
   are being quarried today to be made into the right shape for it, and
   you, and no one but you, can occupy that place in the temple of God in
   Heaven. And you shall shine there as a polished stone forever.

   But I think, dear Friends, that this also relates to the doctrines of
   the Gospel. Every day produces some improved divinity. Every now and
   then, to suit the times, a new edition of the Gospel is issued. Young
   gentlemen at college are taught not to preach the common ordinary
   doctrines, such as John Calvin, St. Augustine, and the Apostle Paul
   preached. They must go to Germany and muddle their own heads, and then
   come forth to muddle other people's. They must have some philosophical
   divinity, some novelty, something more refined than that which would
   attract the mob and gather together the common people.

   Thinking people must be cared for. Sermons must be full of intellectual
   matter. The old Apostles were but fishermen, and of course they could
   not preach more than fishermen's education would enable them to
   comprehend. But these gentlemen have taken their degrees, and can climb
   to far greater heights, and descend into far more profound depths than
   plain Peter or illiterate John. Well, dear Friends, we are content with
   the old wine since it is the best. Christ's Gospel is no new Gospel.

   And moreover, we are old-fashioned enough to believe that not one
   doctrine is to be altered, nor half a doctrine, nor the thousandth part
   of a doctrine! No, nor yet the form of a doctrine. We would "hold fast
   the form of sound words"-- not only the principle, mark--but the words.
   And not only the words, but the very form in which the words were
   molded. "Words, words, words," says somebody, "what is the use of
   words, and forms, and creeds? Why, these are old musty, crusty
   documents, only sectarians care about them."

   Yes, then let us be sectarians. Let us hold with force and strength of
   mind the very form of sound words which have been delivered unto us.
   Not one of the stakes shall be removed, nor one of the cords be
   loosened. So with the ordinances. We do not believe, for instance, that
   we have any power to change the immersion, which was practiced by the
   Apostles, into sprinkling--nor take infants instead of Believers. We
   think that not one of the cords can be removed, nor one of the stakes
   be taken out of its place. We do not think we have any right to change
   the breaking of bread and the drinking of wine into a "mass," and thus
   make a new ceremony, instead of perpetuating that which was delivered
   unto us.

   No, let the old Gospel be the old Gospel. "To the Law and to the
   Testimony, if they speak not according to this Word, it is because
   there is no light in them." We must keep to the same practices and
   believe the same Truths of God even unto the end. Alas for you, you
   cities of earth, you have tottered to your fall! A heap of sand, a
   mountain of ruin is to be found where once Babylon lifted her proud
   head, and where Nineveh exalted her brazen brow! Even old Rome has
   crumbled, and her pillars lie prostrate! Her theatres are but a place
   of emptiness, and her temples but deserted fanes.

   But you, O Church of God, you still exist! Not one of your pillars has
   been shaken! Not a column has left its base or lost its capital.
   Riveted and held fast by more than iron bands, the whole of your fabric
   is as unmoved as the pillars of the universe. Every stone is as new and
   strong as when first Jehovah dug your deep foundations, and laid your
   stones in the fair red cement of Jesus' precious blood!

   Still do your pinnacles glisten in the sun, O you bejeweled city! No
   change has tarnished you. Time has no tooth to devour the glories, no
   foot to trample on your joys. You are the Eternal City and all things
   else are but shadow, mist and dream. Like the God that made you, you
   are immortal, invisible, the only true Church, as He is the only true
   God. Unto Him that built you, and that dwells in you, be glory both now
   and forever. Amen.

   II. The second part of our subject is THE PREEMINENT POSITION. It was a
   cause of lamenting to many of the sinners in Zion that Jerusalem was
   not better defended. The most approved method of ancient defense was to
   surround the city by a broad moat. Joab thought it no mean achievement
   when he took the "city of waters." Hence, God here meets all the wishes
   of His people by telling them that He will be to them all that broad
   rivers and streams could possibly be.

   Jerusalem had nothing but its little brook Kedron, which was not worth
   the mentioning, for it could be no means of defense at all in a day of
   siege. But He, even Jehovah, will be to them all that broad rivers and
   streams would by comparison suggest. At the meaning of this promise I
   must now very hastily glance. First I think it means fertility.
   Understand that especially in the East broad rivers and streams are
   very necessary to fertilize the earth. Egypt owed all her harvests to
   the Nile.

   And the great plain of Mesopotamia, in which Nineveh and Babylon were
   situated, was watered by two great riv-ers--the Tigris and the
   Euphrates--and by innumerable streams which intersected the intervening
   country. The whole land was irrigated by canals and little brooks. It
   is now a desert because there is no irrigation, but then it was the
   most fertile part of the world. We are told in the first chapters of
   Genesis concerning Eden, that there went a river through it. It had not
   been Eden without its Hiddekel.

   Well, now, Jerusalem had none of these broad rivers or streams, but her
   God is to be all that to her. O, Beloved, how fertile God makes His
   Church! Let but the Lord Jehovah come among His people, and there are
   many conversions. Her sons and daughters are as many as the sand of the
   sea, and her offspring like the gravel thereof. Only let the Lord be
   with the minister, and with the Church, and we shall have to say--"Who
   are these that fly as a cloud and like doves to their windows?"

   Moreover, in your heart and mine, if we have Jehovah there, He will be
   to us a place of broad rivers and streams, and we shall be fertile in
   all Divine Graces. Perhaps this morning you feel like a desert,
   bringing forth no fruit. Ah, but think of your glorious Lord! Think of
   the glory of all His attributes--especially think of the glory of His
   Grace, the glory of His finished work for you, the glory of His Cross,
   and of His Throne. You will find that He will give you fertility--your
   faith shall grow and all your graces shall flourish! The glorious Lord
   can make us like a tree planted by the rivers of water so that we shall
   bring forth our fruit in our season.

   And as for good works, which are the true fruit of such as the Lord
   loves, let but Jehovah dwell in us, let His Spirit abide in us, let
   Christ be in constant fellowship with our souls, and we shall abound in
   every good work to the glory of God. We want no Tigris. We need no
   Euphrates. We seek no Nile--Jehovah is to us a place of broad rivers
   and streams. Our fruit surely blossoms and ripens in its time when God,
   the glorious Lord, is with us.

   Broad rivers signify not only fertile soil, but abundance to the
   inhabitants. Places near broad rivers produce a great variety of
   plants. We know that the children of Israel regretted that they had
   left the leeks, garlic, onions, cucumbers and melons of Egypt--plants
   that grew by the rivers. Besides, where there are rivers there is an
   abundance of fish of all kinds, and in the fat pastures, such as
   Goshen, which was well watered by the Nile, abundance of cattle are
   reared. And the abundant harvests which are produced there through the
   admirable irrigation, make that land blessed which has broad rivers and
   streams.

   Well now, our God is all this to His Church. Having God, she has
   abundance. What can she ask for that He will not give her? What want
   can she have which He will not supply? Oh, you citizens of Zion, what
   are your wants this morning? My Master sends me out like a herald from
   a king, and He bids me cry in the streets of this Zion, "Ho, you that
   have any need, come to your king and He will supply you." Want you the
   Bread of Life? It drops like manna from the sky. Want you refreshing
   streams? The Rock follows you, and that Rock is Christ.

   "In this mountain shall the Lord of Hosts make unto all people a feast
   of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of
   marrow, of wines on the lees well refined." If you have any want, it is
   your own fault! If you are straitened, you are not straitened in Him,
   but in your own heart.

   Broad rivers and streams in like manner point to commerce. We know that
   in Holland, especially the broad rivers and streams make that nation
   what it is. The harbors are so safe, the rivers so broad, and the
   canals so innumerable, that commerce is easy in every place, and the
   ends of the earth are linked to the nation by its broad rivers and
   streams. In that country we find curious importations hardly known to
   any other people, because they have gathered up the treasures of the
   far-off lands. There was a time when their broad rivers and streams
   enabled them to engross the mercantile power of the whole universe.

   Well, Beloved, our glorious Lord--keep the adjective as well as the
   noun--our glorious Lord is to be to us a place of commerce. Through God
   we have commerce with the past. The riches of Calvary, the riches of
   the Covenant, the riches of the old age of election, the riches of
   eternity--all come to us down the broad stream of our gracious Lord. We
   have commerce, too, with the future. What galleys, laden to the water's
   edge, come to us from the millennium! What visions we have of the days
   of Heaven upon earth.

   Through our glorious Lord we have commerce with angels, commerce with
   the bright spirits washed in blood that sing before the Truth of
   God--no, better still, we have commerce with the Infinite One, with
   eternity, with self-existence, with Immutability, with Omnipotence,
   with Omniscience--for our glorious Lord is to us a place of broad
   rivers and streams. I wonder how Unitarians find comfort, since they
   have no glorious Lord--they have an inglorious Lord. And I think I may
   say of Unitarianism as our Prophet here says concerning Assyria, that,
   having no glorious Lord, "their tacklings are loosed, they cannot well
   strengthen their mast, they cannot spread the sail. There is the prey
   of a great spoil taken from them, the lame take the prey." But we who
   have a glorious Lord, an Incarnate God, God in Christ Jesus, we, I say,
   have commerce with Heaven.

   Finally, broad rivers and streams are specially intended to set forth
   security. We have already alluded to our own happy island. Dr. Watts
   has said of it--

   "Oh, Britain, praise your mighty God, And make His honors known abroad.
   He bade the ocean round you flow, Not bars of brass could guard you
   so."

   In the memorable '88, when the Spanish Armada, as the old Divines of
   that age said, "turreted the seas" till the high prows of the vessels
   hid the waves of the ocean, God blew with His winds and all Spain's
   mighty hosts were broken, and God's favored isle was free.

   We were doubtless spared the horrors of war under the first Napoleon
   through our narrow sea. It was especially so in the old times of
   ancient warfare. Then a narrow trench was almost as useful as a broad
   channel would be now, for they had no ready means of crossing so well.
   Although on old Assyrian sculptures we see galleys with oars crossing
   over rivers and we have one or two sculptures, I believe, in the
   British Museum, of the Assyrian king turning the river into another
   channel so that he might the more easily take the city.

   But still, rivers were for a defense. Oh, Beloved, what a defense is
   God to His Church! Ah, the devil cannot cross this broad river of God.
   Between me and you, O fiend of Hell, is my God. Do remember this,
   Christian, between you and your archenemy is your God. Satan has to
   stand on the other side and oh, how he wishes he could dry up that
   stream, but God is Omnipotent. How Satan wishes he could change the
   current, but fear not, for God abides Immutably the same.

   How Satan wishes he could get at you and me--but only once let us get
   safely in Zion--we may look over its walls, across the broad rivers and
   streams, and remember that we are out of gunshot of the enemy so far as
   our spiritual existence is concerned. He cannot destroy us! Worry us,
   he may--for we are such timid souls--but kill he cannot, for God, even
   our mighty God, keeps us safe beyond all possibility of destruction.

   III. We come now to offer one or two words on the last point, upon
   which we have already entrenched. The last point is ETERNAL SAFETY. I
   have already said that these broad rivers did not always answer the
   purpose of defending the city, because the Assyrian king carried
   galleys with him overland, and thus took the city. But concerning this
   broad river it is written, "There shall go no galley with oars, neither
   shall gallant ship pass thereby," to come up to the walls to attack the
   bulwarks.

   Our text teaches us that to the eye of faith the Church has no enemies
   at all. "Wherein shall go no galley with oars." "No enemies at all."
   "But," says one, "there are enemies to the Truth of God everywhere! We
   see the enemies of God creeping in everywhere. The whole world is in
   arms against us." But faith so clearly perceives the feebleness and the
   frailty of man that, like her Lord, she takes up all the nations as a
   very little thing and counts all her adversaries to be but as a drop in
   the bucket. You ramble in your garden, perhaps, in the summer time, and
   a spider has spun its stoutest web across your path. You walk along and
   you never think that there is anything to hinder you, and yet there are
   those spiders' strong webs, which would have caught a thousand flies,
   but they do not impede you.

   So is it with God's glorious Church--there are barriers across her
   path, but they are only spider's webs. On she walks--she has no
   adversaries, for she counts her adversaries to be nothing. "No weapon
   that is formed against you shall prosper, and every tongue that rises
   against you in judgment you shall condemn." This is the heritage of the
   people of the Lord. "They that war against us shall be as nothing and
   as a thing of nothing." Thus says the Lord.

   Further, mark, dear Friends, that when we are compelled to see that the
   Church has adversaries, yet, according to the promise, those
   adversaries shall be put to confusion. They have launched the ship. The
   galley with oars is on the sea. The text does not say that no galley
   with oars shall ever be there, but "no galley with oars shall go
   there." Now, in order to make it "go" they must fix the mast. They must
   gird the tacklings, or how shall they spread the sail, and how shall
   they proceed on their way? Ah, but they cannot, they cannot strengthen
   their mast. Their tacklings are loosed.

   They are like mariners reeling to and fro. They stagger like drunken
   men. They are at their wit's end. They know not how to make the mast
   stand in its socket. It was shaped and fashioned at Nineveh. It has
   been used in other sieges and it answered well. But this time it will
   not fit into its socket. The wind blows furiously. They cannot fasten
   the tacklings in their proper places. They know not where to find the
   ropes and spars. They cannot strengthen the mast nor spread the sail!
   Oh, how glorious it is to see the confusion of God's enemies!

   Some say the devil is wise, but he is a fool, and has been a fool from
   the very beginning. All he has ever done has been to throw stones in
   the sky which have fallen down upon his own head. He always shoots his
   arrows the wrong end foremost, and then they come back again with their
   points toward him. Somehow or other the crafty old fox, when
   undermining the Church's fall, manages to cover himself with filth.
   When the whole of this world's drama shall come to an end, there will
   be one tremendous laugh from earth and Heaven against the devil, for
   they will say, "Aha! Aha! Aha! He has been God's slave all the while.

   "He has been but God's dupe, working out God's Glory. He thought he was
   having his own way and doing his own will, but he has been but a
   pitiful slave to carry the materials out of which God shall bring forth
   triumphs that shall shine throughout eternity." O Beloved, we need not
   be afraid! Our enemies are in confusion. They do not know how to attack
   us.

   And then, faith not only sees the confusion of her adversaries, but she
   also believes they are so utterly destroyed that she may go out and
   spoil them. They could not spread the sails. They could not fix the
   mast. Look! The wind has driven them on yonder rock! How the ship
   breaks. How she splits. There, now, she divides in pieces, and her
   cargo is drifted on the shore-- and the men and the women and lame men
   are leaning on their staves. And little children all run down to the
   beach and gather the spoil from the wrecked ship. So it always has been
   in every attack that has been made on the Church--we have always seen
   the wreck of our adversaries and gathered spoils from them.

   I see the ship launched once again. She has had her name altered. She
   has sailed from a distant port--not quite from the land from where
   Solomon derived his apes and peacocks, but almost as far. She has a
   proud helmsman, who wears a miter on his head. This time there are
   terrible expectations that Zion's city will be taken and destroyed.
   What will be the result, do you suppose, of the recent attack upon
   Christianity? Why, the result of it will be that we shall have the
   richest spoil we have had for years!

   The Pentateuch, the blessed old Pentateuch, which was the only Bible,
   you remember, David ever had to read--the Book which David used to
   spell over and say blessed was the man who searched it day and
   night--that old-fashioned Pentateuch-- why, we had almost forgotten it!
   People said, "Ah, yes, all very well to preach on the Gospels and
   sometimes on the Epistles, but the Pentateuch is an old-fashioned book
   of little importance." Consequently there are very few comments upon
   the Pentateuch, which is, perhaps, the most neglected part of all
   Inspired Writ.

   And what will be the effect of this new galley with oars? Why, we shall
   all read the Pentateuch more. I believe that the Pentateuch is the text
   of all the Bible, that the Pentateuch is the Law, the statute, the
   Book. And if any part of Scripture has the preeminence, it is the five
   books of Moses. We shall look over those five books again. "In His Law
   we will begin to meditate both day and night." And then there will be
   comments written, there will be sermons preached, and even those who
   are the feeblest in our Zion, even the little children, will get some
   of the spoil. We shall gather some of the rich and rare treasures that
   have been hidden in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy and
   Numbers.

   We shall have to say, "Thank God that ever the galley with oars came
   here, for the spoil is very great, and we are all made rich thereby." I
   wish they would attack some other part of Scripture. Let some other
   portion of Scripture be attacked, and as silver tried in a furnace of
   earth, purified seven times, so shall the Word of God be. Wherever I
   see the devil's black finger I am obliged to him, for I feel inclined
   to think there must be something there that is good, or else he would
   not have pointed it out as an object of attack to his followers. Let us
   rest assured, dearly Beloved, that the spoil shall surely come in, and
   that we shall not be destroyed.

   And what is to be the end of it all? Our text ascribes glory to a
   Triune God. The Church is, after all her attacks, and all her
   salvations, to ascribe glory to the Three-in-One Jehovah. Read the
   verse, dear Friends, "For the Lord is our Judge. The Lord is our
   Lawgiver. The Lord is our King"--Three, yet One. O Lord, be You
   exalted! Our Father which are in Heaven, You sit on the Throne and You
   are Judge! Jesus, son of Mary, and Son of God, You, by Your holy life,
   have set us such an example that You are our Lawgiver! And you,
   indwelling Spirit, You are with us, and therefore the shout of a King
   is in the midst of our camps.

   Instead of doubting, fearing, and trembling, let us betake ourselves to
   song. The hope of the Church does not rest in her ministers, but in her
   God. Not in her wisdom, but in Him. Not in her eloquence, but in His
   promise. Not in her might or in her numbers, but in His great strength,
   and in the multitude of His loving kindnesses. Dear Friends, let us
   roll all our cares on God this morning. Look up to God alone. Remember,
   you are saved. Do not believe Satan's lies. Hold fast to God's Truth.
   He is on your side. You have trusted yourselves in your Redeemer's
   hand. You are a Believer in Christ. You are, therefore, saved.

   Being saved, expect to see every temptation minister to your growth.
   Expect that every trial shall make you richer in Divine Grace. And go
   home and keep your heart in tune, singing unto God, praising and
   blessing and magnifying His name. Oh, I wish we were all citizens of
   Zion! I wish we were all members and had rights of citizenship in this
   blessed city! The gates are open and aliens who enter become citizens
   at once.

   To become a citizen all that is needed is to be nothing, and to let
   Christ be everything. Trust Christ and you are enrolled a free man--and
   then from that day all the glorious things that are spoken of Zion are
   spoken of you! You shall share her blessedness on earth and her triumph
   above. The Lord now seal these words with His own Spirit for His own
   sake. Amen.

                                Gracious Renewal

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JANUARY 25, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Renew a right spirit within me." Psalm 51:10.

   WE had a joyful meeting last Wednesday evening. As a Church we all met
   together as a loving family, and it was a sight of the most encouraging
   kind to see a great host, like the host of God, of Brothers and
   Sisters, all dwelling together in unity. That solemnly joyful sight
   suggested to my heart the propriety of addressing you today upon the
   subject of the renewal of your consecration to Christ. I thought that
   the season, the annual season when we all meet together, would be but a
   fit and proper opportunity for our giving ourselves over again to Him
   whose we are, and whom we serve.
   In an honored sanctuary in the neighborhood, it is the custom at the
   early part of the year to have a solemn form of covenant read at
   communion, when the Church members all give their verbal assent with a
   solemn "Amen." There must be something very solemn, and at the same
   time something very delightful, in the uttered consent of a multitude
   of persons to the will and law of Christ. Days of annual celebration
   should be days of solemn dedication.
   Dear Friends, there are other occasions when you might very rightly, I
   think, renew your Covenant with God. After recovery from sickness,
   when, like Hezekiah, you have had a new term of years added to your
   life, and have risen from the bed of languishing to tread the
   greensward, and breathe the fresh air. Then should you sing--
   "My life which You have made Your care, Lord, I devote to You."

   After any extraordinary deliverance, when your troubles have a pause,
   when your joys bud forth anew, when after a season of deep depression
   of spirit you can once again lift up your brow, and bathe it in the
   light of God--then, again, should you visit the foot of the Cross of
   Christ--and by the blood that is sprinkled there renew your
   consecration to your Lord.

   Especially will it be incumbent upon you to do this after any sin,
   after any such sin, I mean, as may have grieved the Holy Spirit, or
   brought dishonor upon the cause of God. Then, like David, repair to
   your chamber, and, with bitter tears of penitence, look to the hyssop,
   and the blood which can make you whiter than snow--and again offer
   yourself unto the Lord Most High as a teacher of sinners--or a singer
   of His praise. I think, Brothers and Sisters, we should not only let
   our troubles confirm our dedication to God, but our prosperity should
   do the same.

   If we should ever meet with occasions which deserve to be called, in
   Oliver Cromwell's words, "crowning mercies," then, surely, if He has
   crowned us, we ought also to crown our God. If He has been pleased to
   give you a wreath of loving kindnesses and of tender mercies, then
   bring forth anew all the jewels of the Divine regalia that have been
   stored in the jewel closet of your heart. And let your God sit upon the
   throne of your love, arrayed in royal apparel. If we would get good out
   of our prosperity, we should not need so much adversity.

   If we would gather from a kiss all the good it might confer upon us, we
   should not so often smart under the rod. If we will not gather wisdom
   from vines and fig trees, we must be taught it with briars and thorns.
   Our folly makes rods for its own back. Do any of you come here today
   with hearts leaping for joy? Have you received a valued favor which you
   little expected? Has the Lord put your feet in a large room? Oh, can
   you sing of mercies multiplied? Then this is the day to put your hand
   upon the horns of the altar and say, "Bind me here, my God. Bind me
   here with cords, even forever."

   I may also suggest that there are certain seasons in life when this
   fresh espousal is very comely--in arriving at manhood, at the birth of
   children, at the death of friends, in passing the anniversaries of our
   birth, in advancing from strength to gray hairs--we may read anew the
   memorials of our love. Inasmuch as we need the fulfillment of new
   promises from God, let us give fresh promises to God, or, rather, let
   us offer renewed prayers that the old ones may not be dishonored.

   I have known persons who have religiously set apart a certain day in
   the month, or year, when they would look anew over their obligations,
   survey their state before God, and determine to be the Lord's forever.
   Let us commend their zeal, if we do not imitate their precision. Well,
   Beloved, I suggest--and I am sure such a joyous act as this will never
   be out of season--I suggest that this morning, if God shall enable us,
   we renew our vows unto Him.

   These were the thoughts which possessed my heart. But there was another
   which overrode them all, and prevented my following out my desire. You
   see, my text deals not with renewing our vows before God, nor with our
   proclaiming anew in the courts of the Lord's house our surrender to
   Him--no, it goes deeper than all this--"Renew a right spirit within
   me." Surely, if the Lord will do this, then our consecration will be
   renewed. If the fountain is filled, then the streams must flow. If the
   sun is made to shine, then the plants must bud. If the sap within the
   tree flows vigorously, then the fruit without will be plentiful.

   Perhaps we have done well to lay the axe at the root of the tree by
   going to the very soul and core of this matter. We have our hand upon
   the lever now--it is a dead weight when a man tries to renew his own
   vows--but now we have the lever under it. If we cry to God in prayer,
   "Renew a right spirit within me," we shall accomplish our end none the
   less certainly, even though we do not so much preach upon the subject
   of consecration, as upon the power of God the Holy Spirit to renew our
   spirit and bring us afresh to Himself.

   Come then, Beloved. I want, not so much to preach, as to lead you now
   to the footstool of Divine mercy in humble, earnest entreaty--that the
   Lord may renew within you a constant spirit and invigorate the life of
   your piety. For this there are several reasons, which we will give at
   once.

   I. And, first, a cogent motive of desiring the renewal of our graces is
   to be found in THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR IT, IF WE WOULD PERSEVERE.
   That we need renewal is very clearly seen when we reflect that all
   created things need it. Nothing that God has made is self-existent.
   Self-existence belongs exclusively to the, "I AM THAT I AM." Even the
   tall archangel, who stands nearest the eternal Throne, can only claim a
   borrowed existence which is immortal only in the immortality of God.

   The very mountains crumble, rocks dissolve, and marble wears away.
   Those old rivers that have even been adored by idolaters for their
   antiquity, still need to be refreshed with the melted snows from the
   mountain's brow. It is rumored of our mother earth herself, that her
   soil is losing its former fruitfulness. Certain it is that the most
   fertile fields yield no perpetual harvests unless the labor of man
   fertilizes the soil. All things on earth need, perpetually, to be
   renewed.

   "You renew the face of the year," said the Psalmist, for in winter
   earth sleeps like a wearied giant, as if gray with the decay of age,
   the snow covers its slumbering head. In winter the world shows none of
   her youthful verdure. All her beauty lies buried beneath the sod. Are
   not all things hushed and quiet in winter's bedchamber of life? But
   spring comes leaping on. The song of birds arouses the slumbering earth
   and she awakes refreshed.

   But were it not for the renewing of delicious spring, would not earth
   become everywhere as intolerable as at her frozen poles? Nor here,
   alone, is refreshing needed, for doubtless the upper spheres require
   fresh fuel for their ardent flames. The orb of day shines in radiance
   lent him by the great Father of Lights, albeit that he is, in Milton's
   noble phrase, "of this great world both eye and soul." That eye must
   soon grow dim with age, and that soul must lose its overflowing life,
   if the all-filling God refuses His ever-flowing aid.

   No created thing stands by itself. It is only an infernal conceit that
   anything can be without the great Creator's perpetual Presence. And
   will you lend your soul to this blasphemy of Hell? If your piety can
   live without God, it is not of Divine creating. It lives not but in
   your imagination. It is but a dream--for if God has begotten it, it
   would wait upon Him as the flowers wait for the dew.

   Moreover, this Truth of God is especially applicable to those creatures
   of God which are endowed with life. Those without life need
   preserving--but the truth is not so clearly seen in their case as in
   living objects. But life, if God would sustain it, must often, no,
   constantly, receive renewal. What animal can live without the
   refreshment of sleep and food? Job's war horse, whose neck is clothed
   with thunder, must humble himself to his stall and to his provender.

   The wild asses of the wilderness, whose bands the Lord has loosed, have
   the range of the mountains for their pasture. The unicorn abides not by
   the crib, neither will he harrow the valleys for the farmer--yet he
   grows weary and lies down to rest. Behemoth, whose bones are as bars of
   iron, eats grass as an ox, and leviathan, which makes the deep to boil
   like a pot, whose eyes are like the eyelids of the morning, receives
   the breath in his nostrils each hour from his Maker.

   Even the trees, those motionless things, which wear not themselves with
   care, nor shorten their fires with labor-- these must drink of the rain
   of Heaven, and suck from the hidden treasures of the soil. The cedars
   of Lebanon, which God has planted, only live because day by day they
   are full of sap fresh drawn from the earth. You and I, having life,
   cannot expect that it should be sustained without renewal from God. Our
   natural life needs constantly its bread and water. The strongest man
   that ever lived must soon yield to the weakness of death, unless he
   were reinvigorated by nourishment.

   Sampson himself must have a cleft opened in the rock that he may drink,
   for though he has slain the Philistines, yet will he perish unless his
   thirst is quenched. Assuredly it must be so in spiritual life, or else
   all the analogies of nature must be reversed. You must drink again of
   the Living Water. You must feed anew upon the Living Bread. What mean
   those texts in Scripture that speak of waiting upon the Lord, and
   renewing our strength? What can be the meaning of, "renewing our
   strength like the eagle's"? And what could be David's meaning when, in
   his matchless pastoral, he sings, "You restore my soul," if we do not
   need full often the times of refreshing from the Presence of the Lord?

   But I need not travel so far to fetch my arguments in your own inner
   consciousness. My Brothers and Sisters, you are aware that your piety
   requires constant renovation. What downward tendencies the thoughtful
   must perceive in themselves. We could travel downhill to Hell how
   easily, but upwards to Heaven with what difficulty! Downward, without a
   hand to help. But upward, no hand less than the Omnipotent must speed
   our course. Do you not find, Christians, that as we men must eat, so we
   must pray? Is there not a vacuum in your heart and a pang within it, if
   you have neglected supplication?

   Do you not discover that as men must breathe, so you must exercise
   faith in Christ, for if your faith is suspended for a moment, there is
   a suffocation of all your hope, your joy, your love? No--of your very
   life! Have you not found that, as it is necessary to repair the waste
   of the body by the frequent meal, so you must repair the waste of the
   soul by feeding upon the Book of God, or by listening to the preached
   Word, or by the soul-fattening table of the ordinances? I will not give
   a farthing for your experience--it cannot be the experience of a child
   of God--unless you discover a hungering and a thirsting in your inner
   man.

   And what are these but proofs that renewal is wanted--signs by which
   your new nature sets forth to you a secret necessity which moves it to
   these outward longings? Oh, how dull our love becomes if we go for a
   little time without a sight of Christ! How our faith flickers if we are
   for a little season absent from the Cross! How depressed are our graces
   when means are neglected! What poor starvelings some saints are who
   live without the diligent use of the Word of God and secret prayer! You
   know you want renewal! You feel you do. Need I say more?

   Moreover, if you do not perceive this very apparent Truth of God, let
   me remind you that you may be made to see it, and that terribly, by
   some surprising sin. Just as this prayer was forced out of David by his
   adultery with Bathsheba, and his bloody murder of Uriah, so you--yes,
   you, my Brothers and Sisters, saints before the Lord--yes, you,
   Preacher-- you may be made to know it, by being suddenly overtaken in a
   fault, to your own shame forever. "Let him that thinks he stands take
   heed lest he fall."

   There are north winds in the hand of the Almighty which He has not yet
   permitted to come forth upon men. But when the whirlwind shall be
   loosed, woe, woe to the tree that has not sucked up fresh sap and
   grasped the rock with many intertwisted roots. There are tempests yet
   to come forth from the secret treasuries of God. If they come, woe, woe
   to the mariners that have not yet strengthened their mast, nor cast
   their anchor, nor sought the haven.

   Without perpetual restoration, I say, we are not ready for the
   perpetual assaults of Hell, or the stern afflictions of Heaven, nor
   even for the strife within us. If you suffer the good to grow weaker,
   the evil will surely gather strength and struggle desperately for the
   mastery over you. And so may you have a sad downfall, a painful
   desolation--and a lamentable disgrace may follow from your neglect of
   the renewing of your spirit before God.

   Once more, here, and though this reason may not seem so forcible as the
   last, the wise man will understand it, and see that there is yet mighty
   power therein, "That unconscious backsliding from God, which is,
   perhaps, even more dangerous, though not so disgraceful as open sin.
   That unconscious apostasy from God, I say, will certainly be upon you,
   unless you have seasons of renewal. Does not Hosea speak of Ephraim as
   having gray hairs here and there upon him, but he knew it not?

   Oh, Beloved, I do proclaim--I speak not in any severity against God's
   saints--but I do believe that this is the sin in the Church of God at
   the present moment--that the most of us have gray hairs here and there
   and know it not. We walk so carelessly before God. we do not make such
   heart-work of religion as we should. Indifference, I find, to be my own
   temptation. I do not know that I am assaulted with certain other sins
   which prevail over other men, but this indifference I find to be harder
   to meet than even a temptation to lust or covetousness.

   I do believe that the Church, to a great extent, is just now where
   Bunyan's Pilgrim was when he went through the Enchanted Ground and the
   air was heavy, and the Pilgrim had much ado to keep himself from
   sleeping. The Church has rest nowadays. These are times of quietness.
   And therefore we are in danger of being given to slumber. Perhaps it is
   a "ruthless legend that the holidays of Capua ruined the veterans of
   Hannibal," but if it is a legend in his case, it is a fact in ours.

   The peace and quietness of the Church in these calm times bring on an
   idleness, a dullness, an indifference, a lethargy as deadly and as
   damnable as outrageous sin itself. And unless the Holy Spirit arouses
   us and constrains us to come back again to the simple earnestness of
   our first love, we shall slip and slide and discover not how low we
   have fallen till out of the depths we have to cry in agony, "Renew a
   right spirit within me."

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, for these reasons, I do persuade you, and
   therein I do persuade myself--let us take with us words. Let us turn
   unto the Lord. Let us beg Him to heal our backslidings, and to receive
   us graciously. Let us entreat Him to be as the dew unto our souls that
   we may grow as the lily and cast out our roots as Lebanon. In the words
   of Jeremy in the Lamentations let us pray, "Turn You us unto You, O
   Lord, and we shall be turned. Renew our days as of old."

   If the crown is fallen from our head because we have sinned, let us
   seek the Lord with deep humiliation of soul. If the joy of our heart
   has ceased, if our dance is turned into mourning, let us return unto
   Him from whom we have erred, and renew our marriage covenant. "Thus
   says the Lord, I remember you, the kindness of your youth, and the love
   of your espousals." My Brothers and Sisters, if thus He remembers us,
   let us remember Him, and offer this supplication, "Renew a right spirit
   within me." This brings me now to a second method of reasoning with
   you.

   II. Secondly, let us pray the brief but very forcible prayer of the
   text because of our OWN POWERLESSNESS TO RENEW OUR OWN SPIRITS. It is a
   doctrine acknowledged by all orthodox Christians, and confessed in some
   form or other by all Believers, that without the Spirit of God we are
   unable to do anything aright. Nevertheless, I question if any of us
   have given our full consent to the doctrine of human inability in its
   fullest bearings. "Without Me you can do nothing," is a text upon which
   our life is the sermon--but until its very close it is probable we
   shall not fully fathom the depth of our own weakness.

   Brethren, when a ship is in sailing order and in good condition, she
   still cannot speed on her journey of herself! Even though the sails are
   spread, there is no hope of her making port unless the wind shall blow.
   If that is so, how much more is it true that if that ship leaks, if the
   worm has begun to eat her timbers, or if by grazing upon a rock she has
   done serious damage to her bottom, it is impossible that she should
   repair her own damage! If her sails are tattered, how shall she mend
   them? If her masts are strained, if any injury whatever is done to her
   tackling, how shall she be able to recover herself?

   Brethren, you can see the analogy. If the child of God, even when in a
   healthy state, needs to cry for the Divine Spirit, how much more when
   he has fallen under spiritual decays, or has grievously backslidden,
   does he need the Divine hand of the Mighty Carpenter to set him right!
   As for ungodly men, the analogy might be pushed still farther if that
   were in the subject of this morning. If the ship built and manned
   cannot sail without the wind, how much less could the trees of the
   forest hew themselves, convey themselves to the shipwright's yard,
   fashion themselves into timbers, keel, beam, and mast--and then arrange
   themselves into a ship and launch themselves upon the sea!

   Yet even this were less a miracle than for an unconverted man to
   regenerate himself. But we must return to our point, that the
   Christian, when his heart is out of order, has no power to put himself
   right again without the blessed Spirit. The disease of the living must
   be cured by the same Voice which removes the sleep of the dead. He who
   said, "Lazarus come forth!" is needed to say, "Take up your bed and
   walk!" Indeed, if you will think for a moment, you will find the work
   of renewal to be a stern work. It is called in Scripture--conversion.

   Now, in conversion the same power is exercised that was put forth in
   raising Jesus Christ from the dead. What power, then, must be required
   in the renewal of a soul! Besides, to renew a soul is to go directly
   opposite to nature. What power is necessary to make water leap uphill,
   to suspend the waterfall in midair, to compel a flame to blaze in the
   midst of the depths of the sea? Yet such a power as this is absolutely
   needed to reverse the efforts of the flesh, and to make our old carnal
   corruptions, which had begun to get the mastery, resign it once more.

   The strong man armed keeps the house till a stronger than he binds him.
   And sin, when it once prevails in a Believer, would continue to prevail
   unless the Mighty One who first broke our chains shall come to set us
   free. Do you not know, Beloved, that in the renewal of our spirits
   every Divine Grace is needed that was nestled for our first conversion?
   We needed repentance in order to our first salvation--we certainly need
   it now, that we may be renewed. We wanted faith that we might come to
   Christ at first--only the like Grace can bring us to Jesus now.

   We wanted a word from the Most High, a word from the lips of the Loving
   One, to end our fears then--we shall soon discover, when under a sense
   of present sin, that we need it now. No man can be renewed, I say,
   without as real and true an exercise of the Holy Spirit's energy as he
   felt at first, because the work is as great. The same Graces are
   needed, and flesh and blood are as much in the way now as ever they
   were. Let your powerlessness, O Christian, be an argument to make you
   pray earnestly to your God.

   Remember, David, when he felt himself powerless, did not fold his arms
   or close his lips, but he hastened to the Mercy Seat with, "Renew a
   right spirit within me." Let not the doctrine that you, unaided can do
   nothing, make you sleep. Rather let it be a goad in your side to drive
   you with an awful earnestness to the great Fountain from which all
   streams must flow to satisfy your wants and plead it, plead it as
   though you pleaded for your very life--as though you pleaded for your
   only son--"Lord, renew a right spirit within me."

   Nor pray this falsely. Prove that you mean it by going forth to use the
   means. Continue much in prayer. Live much upon the Word of God. Attend
   constantly a soul-satisfying Ministry. Kill the lusts that have driven
   your Lord from you. Be careful to watch over the future uprisings of
   sin--otherwise your prayers cannot be sincere. The man who prays to God
   to do a thing must use the means through which God works. He is a
   hypocrite who asks the Lord to visit him, and then nails up his door,
   or asks for life, and then refuses to eat.

   The Lord has his own appointed ways, and sitting by the wayside you
   will be ready when He passes by. Oh, continue, then, in all those
   blessed ordinances which will foster and nourish your dying Graces. And
   strengthen the things which remain which are ready to die. Knowing that
   all the power must be from Him, cease not to cry, "Renew a right spirit
   within me."

   III. But we change our note and come to a third point. I would the Holy
   Spirit might honor the word this morning, and I should look upon it as
   no mean privilege if I might stir up any of you, my beloved Brothers
   and Sisters in Christ, truly today to come afresh to the Fountain
   filled with Blood, and to renew again your entire surrender and
   resignation of yourselves to your Lord. The argument I use shall be
   found in THE BLESSED RESULTS WHICH ARE SURE TO FOLLOW, if the Lord
   shall renew your spirit.

   Think what joy you will experience! There are some things, Beloved,
   that perhaps may need to be renewed, but they would bring no joy. The
   physician may require you to receive a new bottle of medicine. It may
   be possible that an operation once performed may have lost its potency.
   Painful though it is, it may be required to be performed again. But
   that of which I speak has no pain to the child of God. It is in itself
   so sweet that it ought to tempt you to perform it.

   What is it, my Brothers and Sisters? Is it not the renewal of a
   brotherly covenant, just as when Jonathan and David went into the woods
   and renewed their covenant? I do not believe it was a sorrowful hour to
   Jonathan. I can imagine that David shed tears when he parted from his
   beloved friend, tears of deep affection, perhaps, but oh, with what joy
   did they clasp each other in the woods! With what true love did they
   make a covenant when Jonathan loved David as his own soul.

   The prince stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it
   to David. And he even gave his garments, even to his sword, and to his
   bow, and to his girdle. And surely you will not object to renew your
   embrace of your David today! Can it be a hard matter to you, once more,
   to go without the camp bearing His reproach, to clasp the Man, once
   again who is better to you than all the treasures of Egypt? Besides,
   there is a sweeter figure. The Covenant we have with Christ is a
   marriage Covenant.

   I believe in Sweden it is common when a happy pair have been wedded for
   five-and-twenty years to have what they call, "A silver wedding." And
   if they should be spared to old age, until their children's children
   are round about them, on the fiftieth year, they have, "A golden
   wedding." Who would not wish to have a repetition of the happy day! Let
   us celebrate today, dear Friends, a silver wedding with the Christ whom
   we married years ago. And oh, we will wait awhile longer and anticipate
   our golden wedding, in the year of jubilee, when we shall see Him as He
   is and be like He is.

   What? Will you not give Him the kiss that is the token of continued
   affection? Do you refuse to give Him fresh pledges of your love, which
   is the fruit of His everlasting love to you? Why, the thing is so
   joyous that I cannot refrain from crying, "Let the marriage bells be
   rung again! Bring forth the wedding dainties once more, and let us sit
   at the table of the marriage festival!" Jesus, we do embrace You! We
   are Yours, it is happiness, it is Heaven, it is bliss superlative to
   renew our vows to You and to receive fresh tokens of Your regard to us.

   Do you remember, Beloved, that in our early days, besides having an
   abundance of joy, how full of heavenly light our Graces were, and how
   real everything appeared to our faith at the first? Now if we can have
   our spirit renewed, and made it as it was at first, why, then we shall
   have back the same satisfactory reality in our emotions. I speak for
   one. I know that when my eyes first looked to Christ, He was a very
   real Christ to me. And when my burden of sin rolled from off my back,
   it was a real pardon, and a real release from sin to me. And when that
   day I said for the first time, "Jesus Christ is mine," it was a real
   possession of Christ to me.

   When I went up to the sanctuary then in that early dawn of youthful
   piety, every song was really a Psalm, and when there was a prayer, oh,
   how I followed every word! It was prayer, indeed! And so was it, too,
   in silent quietude, when I drew near to God. Oh it was no mockery, no
   routine, no matter of mere duty. It was a real talking with my Father
   who is in Heaven. And oh, how I loved my Savior Christ then! I can talk
   about loving Him now, and methinks if He said to me as He did to Simon
   Peter--"Do you love me?" I would dare to answer, "You know all things,
   You know that I love

   You."

   But still, my consciousness of loving Christ is not always as vivid,
   now, as it once was. Why, then I was quite sure I loved Him, I know I
   could have burned for Him, or suffered anything for His dear sake. Was
   it not so with you? Well, Beloved, if we will come now, and put our
   hand within His hands afresh, which will be the effect of His renewing
   our spirit, then we shall have back again all the fullness and reality
   that distinguished our early, new-born piety. Oh, how blessed this will
   be!

   Moreover, at that time how active all our Graces were! Do you not
   remember? Why, you had no doubts then, your faith was so strong. You
   had no lukewarmness then, your zeal was so burning. You remember, some
   of you, when first the Lord met with you? Perhaps it was in this house,
   or in the Surrey Music Hall. You would stand in the crowd till you were
   almost ready to drop, but there were no sleepy eyes, no dull, lethargic
   spirits. Oh, how you used to drink in the Word of God! It was marrow
   and fatness to you when you fed upon it.

   If anybody would have bribed you to stay away from a Prayer Meeting or
   from a weeknight lecture, they might have offered the world, but it
   would have been a bribe too low. But now, too often, if there is a
   little discomfort in getting in the gate, if you happen not to get the
   very seat you want, or if you happen to be seated uncomfortably, or in
   a cramped position--you cannot worship as once you did. I know it may
   be the fault of the minister--perhaps he does not preach as he did in
   your younger days--when you were first converted. That is possible, I
   suppose. Still, I think it is more likely that you have lost the ears
   you once had, or that your ears are become dull of hearing.

   I think it is more likely that your eyes have lost their quickness of
   sight, or that your hearts may be less tender and sensitive. Certainly
   your Graces are not in such active exercise as they were. Well now, if
   we come back to our Master, we shall have our youthful force and vigor
   renewed. To my mind it is always a pleasant sight to see lambs skipping
   in the meadows, because it shows they have more strength than they well
   know what to do with--and so they do a great many things that are
   improper for sheep to do. What odd, fantastic gestures they have!

   It is even so with young Christians. They will often do many rash
   things just because they have an excess of liveliness. They have such a
   full tide of love and zeal that they do not know how to put it into
   action. Young life demands exercise. O that some of you who are old in
   years, and others of you upon whose Graces there are signs of decay,
   could but recover some of this juvenile effervescence! Ah, and you can
   have it. In the answer to this prayer you will find it, "Renew a right
   spirit within me."

   A subject like this grows upon me while speaking of it. I cannot doubt
   that you will find it equally enlarge upon you in thinking it over. But
   on no account let us forget the practical ends that ought to be kept in
   view. Dear Friends, your usefulness to others will be increased if the
   Lord should graciously visit you with times of refreshing. You want the
   re- newal of your own spirit in your Sunday school class, in the
   district where you distribute tracts, in the little room where you
   preach--or in your family, with your own children. You want to have
   more Divine Grace in your own hearts that you may have power with them.
   Well, you must get this by coming anew to your Lord.

   Ah, and some of you came up here this morning complaining of the world
   and its trials. The world is very hard with you, and troubles are
   multiplied. How little weight the sorrows of this life will have in the
   scale, if balanced against the joy of your heart when the Lord renews
   your spirit. What did you care when you were first converted, whether
   you were rich or poor? It seemed no matter to you. Like Peter, you left
   the net, and the fishes, that you might get at your Lord. Like the
   woman at the well, you left the water pot that you might go and tell
   others that you had seen a Man who told you all things that ever you
   did.

   Well, now, if your former piety comes back, if the zeal of your young
   days shall be restored to you, the world will be just as much a trifle
   to you, and you will tread it beneath your feet with just as much
   heroic contempt as you did when first you received the Gospel, not in
   word only, but in power. Since all these blessed results will follow,
   let me therefore beseech you--by your love to your own souls, by your
   care to grow in Divine Grace, by your anxiety to prosper in the Lord's
   way, and by your interest in the welfare of others--pray with me this
   prayer, "Renew a right spirit within me."

   And You, O Lord, hear it in Heaven, Your dwelling place. Let Your eyes
   be open unto the supplication of Your servants, to hearken unto us in
   all that we call for unto You.

   IV. One other argument only, where many might be given. Do not GOSPEL
   OBLIGATIONS irresistibly constrain us by the means of this, our prayer,
   to renew our Covenant with God?

   Legal motives I would disdain to urge you with. But Gospel motives I
   may, and must. Did you do right in giving your soul to Christ at first?
   Was it a mistake? Was it the effect of a juvenile excitement, misled by
   some fanatical speech? No, you cannot say that. You believe it was the
   best thing you ever did in your life. You have often regretted you
   never did it before. There are a thousand things you repent of, but
   this one thing, that you gave yourself to God, is a subject of
   perpetual congratulations with you.

   Very well, then, if it was well to do it then, do it now. If you would
   not make out yourself to have been a fool, and your faith to have been
   a lie. If you would not before the eyes of men and of angels declare
   that the whole thing is a farce--this day, even this day--let us go
   into Gilgal, and there let us renew the kingdom before the Lord. Oh,
   once again do what you did at the first--if it were a wise, if it were
   a good thing.

   Moreover, Brothers and Sisters, remember how often Jesus renewed His
   Covenant with His people. It was not enough to have spoken it in the
   ear of Adam, and whispered it to the heart of Eve. Enoch must testify
   of it. Abraham must understand it on the plains of Mamre, as Noah
   adores the time, when floating securely in the ark. There must be a
   renewed revelation to Isaac, and to Jacob, and to Moses, and to Joshua.
   Symbols of the renewed Covenant must be seen in the tabernacle, and in
   the temple. Each day, each week, each month, each year, each jubilee
   must give some fresh form of Christ setting His seal anew to the love
   which He bore to His people and His purpose to redeem His Church by
   blood.

   Does Christ do this, and will you blush to do it? Oh, do as Jesus did
   to you--as you would that "the Man" should do to you, do you also unto
   Him. And moreover, He has renewed His Covenant with you. Come, I want
   you to look back at your old diaries. You have not burned your
   pocketbooks, in which you set down in some mysterious marks that others
   could not read, some mementoes of your Tabors, your Mizars and the
   hills of the Hermonites. I want you to look back. Has not Christ
   renewed His Covenant with some of us many times?

   My soul looks back and sees some joyous seasons, some days marked with
   the red Dominical letter among the days of my history, when He said to
   me afresh, "You are Mine. I have redeemed you by blood." It may be it
   was on a bed of sickness. Perhaps it was when you were walking in the
   streets. It may be it was in a season of holy retirement, or it may be
   in a moment when you were brought down to the earth. Oh, He has renewed
   His Covenant with us many and many a time with such sweet reassuring
   words that our soul, which was tired of this world, has been willing to
   stay her three-score years and ten, because her Husband had visited
   her.

   You have stayed me with flagons. You have comforted me with apples. You
   have made me sick with love. Your left hand has been under my head, and
   Your right hand did embrace me. Therefore will I renew my vows unto You
   even as You did unto me!

   Yet farther, dear Friends, and I shall not stay longer than this,
   though it is a very wide field. Let us be moved today to renew our
   Covenant with Christ, or rather to ask Him to renew our spirit, because
   every Covenant transaction binds us to it. You believe in the doctrine
   of election. We do not blush to preach it, and you love to hear it.
   What does election mean? It means that God has chosen you. Very well,
   if it is so, then you will acknowledge it anew today, by choosing His
   way and Word. You believe in a special and efficacious redemption, that
   you were redeemed from among men. Very well, then, you are not your
   own, you are bought with a price.

   You believe in effectual calling. You know that you were called out. If
   it is so, recognize your distinction and sepa-rateness as a sacred
   people set apart by God. You believe that this distinction in you is
   perpetual, for you will persevere to the end--if you are to be God's
   forever, be His today. And are you not looking for a Heaven from which
   selfishness shall be banished? Are you not expecting a Heaven where
   Glory shall consist in being wholly absorbed in Christ? Well then, this
   day, by all that is coming, as well by all that is cast, let your soul
   be bound as with cords that cannot be snapped to the altar of your God.

   Backsliders, you that have gone astray, pray this prayer today. He bids
   you pray it, and He will, therefore, answer it. The text in the margin
   reads "renew a constant spirit within me." You have been obstinate,
   wayward, unstable, fickle. Poor Backslider, He has put this prayer here
   for you--"Renew a constant spirit within me." My Brothers and Sisters,
   the Church has had to cast you out, but if still there is a desire in
   your soul toward God, return! Return! Return! Your Father waits to meet
   you. The Church, your mother, longs for you. Your Brothers and Sisters
   desire to see your face again.

   Say it, and we will say it with you, "Renew a right spirit within me,"
   and it shall be done. And you, Christians, that have not backslidden,
   you, my Brothers and Sisters, whose heads are covered with the gray
   honors of long service, offer today this prayer, for you need to pray
   it as well as the youngest of us, "Renew a right spirit within me." Ask
   the Master who has kept you in your youth to preserve you till, in
   life's latest hour, YOU bow, "and bless in death a bond so dear."

   You strong men and fathers, who are struggling with the world, battling
   day by day with business and its cares, forget not your God through
   being mindful of many things. Today, in this little pause in the noise
   and turmoil and strife of the world's bustle, come now and renew your
   vows. You young men and maidens, you little ones in God's Israel, whose
   portion it is to be the lambs carried in His bosom, you, also, say,
   "Renew You, O God, a right spirit within me."

   Come, renew the dedication so lately made. You that are brought, like
   Samuels, to God's house, that you may wear the vestments of prophets
   before you wear the garments of manhood--give yourselves anew to the
   Lord. Let your youthful voices, so full of sweet music, unbroken as yet
   to the deeper bass which the world's care is sure to give them
   by-and-by, sing unto the Lord, and let this be your cry--"Lord, I am
   Your servant, and the son of Your handmaiden, You have loosed my
   bonds!"

   May the Lord, the Holy Spirit, so dwell in us that each of us may renew
   our vows, through His renewing a right spirit within us. Amen.

                                 Our Stronghold

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY EVENING, OCTOBER 26, 1862, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous run into it, and
   are safe."

   Proverbs 18:10.

   STRONG towers were a greater security in a bygone age than they are
   now. Then when troops of marauders invaded the land, strong castles
   were set upon the various hilltops, and the inhabitants gathered up
   their little wealth and fled there at once. Castles were looked upon as
   being very difficult places to attack. And ancient troops would rather
   fight a hundred battles than endure a single siege. Towns which would
   be taken by modern artillery in twelve hours held out for twelve years
   against the most potent forces of the ancient times.

   He that possessed a castle was lord of all the region round about, and
   made their inhabitants either his clients who sought his protection, or
   his dependents whom he ruled at will. He who owned a strong tower felt,
   however potent might be his adversary, his walls and bulwarks would be
   his sure salvation. Generous rulers provided strongholds for their
   people--mountain fastnesses where the peasantry might be sheltered from
   marauders.

   Transfer your thoughts to a thousand years ago, and picture a people,
   who after plowing and sowing, have gathered in their harvest. But when
   they are about to make merry with the harvest festival, a startling
   signal banishes their joy. A trumpet is blown from yonder mountain, the
   bell answers it from the village tower. Hordes of ferocious robbers are
   approaching, their corn will be devoured by strangers! Burying their
   corn and furniture, and gathering up the little portable wealth they
   have, they hasten with all their might to their tower of defense which
   stands on yonder ridge.

   The gates are shut. The drawbridge is pulled up. The iron grating is
   let down. The warders are on the battlements, and the inhabitants
   within feel that they are safe. The enemy will rifle their deserted
   farms, and search for hidden treasure, and finding that the inhabitants
   are quite beyond their reach, they will betake themselves to some other
   place. Such is the figure which is in the text. "The name of the Lord
   is a strong tower: the righteous run into it and are safe."

   I. Of course we all know that by the name of God is meant the Character
   of the Most High, so that our first lesson is that THE CHARACTER OF GOD
   FURNISHES THE RIGHTEOUS WITH ABUNDANT SECURITY.

   The Character of God is the refuge of the Christian, in opposition to
   other refuges which godless men have chosen. Solomon suggestively puts
   the following words in the next verse--"The rich man's wealth is his
   strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit." The rich man
   feels that his wealth may afford him comfort. Should he be attacked in
   law, his wealth can procure him an advocate. Should he be insulted in
   the streets, the dignity of a full purse will avenge him. Should he be
   sick, he can hire the best physicians. Should he need ministers to his
   pleasures, or helpers of his infirmities, they will be at his call.

   Should famine stalk through the land, it will avoid his door. Should
   war itself break forth, he can purchase an escape from the sword, for
   his wealth is his strong tower in contradistinction to this, the
   righteous man finds in his God all that the wealthy man finds in his
   substance and a vast deal more. "The Lord is my portion, says my soul,
   therefore will I trust in Him." God is our treasure. He is to us better
   than the heaviest purse, or the most magnificent income. Broad acres
   yield not such peace as a well attested interest in the love and
   faithfulness of our heavenly Father. Provinces under our sway could not
   bring to us greater revenues than we possess in Him who makes us heirs
   of all things by Christ Jesus.

   Other men who trust not in their wealth, nevertheless make their own
   names a strong tower. To say the truth, a man's good name is no mean
   defense against the attacks of his fellow men. To wrap one's self about
   in the garment of integrity is to defy the chill blast of calumny and
   to be mailed against the arrows of slander. If we can appeal to God and
   say, "Lord, You know that in this thing I am not wicked"--then let the
   mouth of the liar pour forth his slanders, let him scatter his venom
   where he may--we bear an antidote within before which his poison yields
   its power.

   But this is only true in a very limited sense. Death soon proves to men
   that their own good name can afford them no consolation, and under
   conviction of sin a good repute is no shelter. When conscience is
   awake, when the judgment is unbiased, when we come to know something of
   the law of God and of the justice of His Character, we soon discover
   that self-righteousness is no hiding place for us. It is nothing but a
   crumbling battlement which will fall on the neck of him that hides
   behind it--a pasteboard fortification yielding to the first shock of
   the law--a refuge of lies to be beaten down with the great hailstones
   of eternal vengeance--such is the righteousness of man.

   The righteous trusts not in this--not his own name--but the name of his
   God. Not his own character, but the Character of the Most High is his
   strong tower. Numberless are those castles in the air to which men
   hasten in the hour of peril--ceremonies lift their towers into the
   clouds--professions pile their walls high as mountains, and works of
   the flesh paint their delusions till they seem substantial bulwarks.
   But all, all, shall melt like snow, and vanish like a mist. Happy is he
   who leaves the sand for the Rock, the phantom for the Substance.

   The name of the Lord is a strong tower to the Christian, not only in
   opposition to other men's refuges but as a matter of fact and reality.
   Even when he is not able to perceive it by experience, yet God's
   Character is the refuge of the saint. If we come to the bottom of
   things, we shall find that the basis of the security of the Believer
   lies in the Character of God. I know you will tell me it is the
   Covenant--but what is the Covenant worth, if God were changeable,
   unjust, untrue? I know you will tell me that the confidence of the
   Believer is in the blood of Christ--but what were the blood of Christ
   if God were false?

   If after Christ had paid the ransom the Lord should deny Him the
   ransomed. If after Christ had been the Substitute, the Judge of men
   should yet visit upon our heads, for whom He suffered, our own guilt.
   If Jehovah could be unrighteous, if He could violate His promise and
   become faithless as we are--then, I say, that even the blood of Christ
   would afford us no security. You tell me that there is His promise, but
   again I remind you that the value of a man's promise must depend on his
   character.

   If God were not such that He cannot lie, if He were not so faithful
   that He cannot change His mind, if he were not so mighty that He cannot
   be frustrated when He intends to perform--then His promises were but
   waste paper! His Words like our words, would be but wind, and afford no
   satisfactory shelter for a soul distressed and anxious. But you will
   tell me He has sworn with an oath. Brethren, I know He has. He has
   given us two immutable things in which it is impossible for Him to lie,
   that we may have strong consolation.

   But still what is a man's oath worth irrespective of his character? Is
   it not, after all, what a man is that makes his assertions to be
   eminently mistrusted or profoundly believed? And it is because our God
   cannot by any means foreswear Himself but must be true, that His oath
   becomes of value to you and to me. Brethren, after all, let us remember
   that the purpose of God in our salvation is the glorifying of His own
   Character, and this it is that makes our salvation positively sure. If
   everyone that trusts in Christ is not saved, then is God dishonored,
   the Lord of Hosts has hung up His escutcheon.

   And if in the face of the whole earth He accomplishes not that which He
   declares He will perform in this Book, then is His reputation stained.
   I say it, He has flung down the gauntlet to sin, death, and Hell--and
   if He is not the conqueror over all these in the heart of every soul
   that trusts in Him, then He is no more the God of Victories, nor can we
   shout His everlasting praise as the Lord mighty in battle. His
   Character, then, you see, when we come to the basis of all, is the
   granite formation upon which must rest all the pillars of the Covenant
   of Grace, and the sure mercies thereof.

   His wisdom, truth, mercy, justice, power, eternity and immutability are
   the seven pillars of the house of sure salvation. If we would have
   comfort, we can surely find it in the Character of God. This is our
   strong tower, we run into it and we are safe.

   Mark, Beloved, not only is this true as a matter of fact, but it is
   true as a matter of experience. I hope I shall now speak the feelings
   of your hearts, while I say we have found the Character of God to be an
   abundant safeguard to us. We have known full well the trials of life!
   Thank God we have, for what would any of us be worth if we had no
   troubles? Troubles, like files, take away our rust--like furnaces, they
   consume our dross--like winnowing fans they drive away the chaff. And
   we should have had but little value, we should have had but little
   usefulness--if we had not been made to pass through the furnace.

   But in all our troubles we have found the Character of God a comfort.
   You have been poor--very poor--I know some of you here have been out of
   work a long time. You have wondered where your bread would come from,
   even for the next meal. Now what has been your comfort? Have you not
   said, "God is too good to let me starve. He is too bountiful to let me
   want." And so, you see, you have found His Character to be your strong
   tower. Or else you have had personal sickness--you have long lain on
   the bed of weariness, tossing to and fro, and then the temptation has
   come into your heart to be impatient--"God has dealt harshly with you,"
   so the Evil One whispers. But how do you escape?

   Why you say, "No, He is no tyrant, I know Him to be a sympathizing
   God." "In all their afflictions He was afflicted, the angel of His
   Presence saved them." Or else you have had losses--many losses, and you
   have been apt to ask, "How can these things be? How is it I have to
   work so long, and plod so hard, and have to look about me with all my
   wits to earn but little, and yet when I have made money it melts? I see
   my wealth, like a flock of birds upon the fields--here one moment, and
   gone the next--for a passerby claps his hands, and everything takes to
   itself wings and flies away."

   Then we are apt to think that God is unwise to let us toil for nothing,
   but lo, we run into our strong tower and we feel it cannot be. No. The
   God who sent this affliction could not have acted in a thoughtless,
   reckless, unwise manner. There must be something here that shall work
   for my good. You know, Brothers and Sisters, it is useless for me to
   attempt to describe the various ways in which your trials come. I am
   sure they that know Jehovah's name will put their trust in Him.

   Perhaps your trial has been want, and then you have said, "His name is
   Jehovah-Jireh, the Lord will provide." Or else you have been banished
   from friends, perhaps from country, but you have said, "Ah, His name is
   Jehovah-Shammah, the Lord is there." Or else you have had a disturbance
   in your family. There has been war within, and war without, but you
   have run into your strong tower, for you have said, "His name is
   Jehovah-Shalom, the Lord sends peace." Or else the world has slandered
   you, and you, yourself have been conscious of sin, but you have said,
   "His name is Jehovah-Tsidkenu, the Lord our righteousness."

   And so you have gone there and been safe. Or else many have been your
   enemies, then His name has been "Jehovah-Xissi, the Lord my banner."
   And so He has been a strong tower to you. Defy, then, Brothers and
   Sisters--defy, in God's strength, tribulations of every sort and size.
   Say, with the poet--

   "There is a safe and secret place
   Beneath the wings Divine,
   Reserved for al the heirs of Grace,
   That refuge no w is mine.
   The least and feeblest here may hide
   Uninjured and unawed;
   While thousands fall on every side, I rest secure in God." But,
   Beloved, besides the trials of this life, we have the sins of the
   flesh, and what a tribulation these are! But the name of our God is our
   strong tower then. At certain seasons we are more than ordinarily
   conscious of our guilt. And I would give little for your piety, if you
   do not sometimes creep into a corner with the poor publican and say,
   "God be merciful to me a sinner." Broken hearts and humble walkers,
   these are dear in Jesus' eyes. There will be times with all of us when
   our saintship is not very clear, but our sinnership is very apparent.
   Well, then, the name of our God must be our defense--"He is very
   merciful." "For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their
   sins and their iniquities will I remember no more."

   Yes, in the Person of Christ we even dare to look at His justice with
   confidence, since, "He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and
   to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." Possibly it is not so much the
   guilt of sin that troubles you, as the power of sin. You feel as if you
   must one day fall by the hand of this enemy within. You have been
   striving and struggling, but the old Adam is too much for you.

   It is a stern conflict and you fear that the sons of Anak will never be
   driven out. You feel you carry a bombshell within your heart. Your
   passions are like a powder magazine--you are walking where the flakes
   of fire are flying, and you are afraid a spark may fall, and then there
   will be a terrible destruction of everything. Ah, then there is the
   power of God, there is the Truth of God, there is the faithfulness of
   God, and, despite all the desperate power of sin, we find a shelter
   here in the Character of the Most High.

   Sin sometimes comes with all the terrors of the law. Then if you know
   not how to hide yourself behind your God, you will be in an evil
   plight. It will come at times with all the fire of the flesh, and if
   you cannot perceive that your flesh was crucified in Christ, and that
   your life is a life in Him, and not in yourself, then you will soon be
   put to the rout. But he who lives in his God and not in himself. He who
   wraps Christ's righteousness about him, and is righteous in Christ--
   such a man may defy all the attacks of the flesh, and all the
   temptations of the world. He shall overcome through the blood of the
   Lamb. "This is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith."

   Then, Beloved, there are the temptations of the devil, and these are
   very dreadful. But how sweet it is, still, to feel that the Character
   of God is our strong tower. Without walls of Divine Grace and bulwarks
   of mercy, how can a tempted soul escape the clutches of the Destroyer?
   But where the soul lies in the entrenchments of Divine promise, all the
   devils in Hell cannot carry it by storm. I saw this week, one whom many
   of you greatly respect, the former pastor of this Church, Mr. James
   Smith, of Cheltenham--[since departed, to be with Christ, which is far
   better]--a name well-known by his innumerable little works which are
   scattered everywhere and cannot fail to do good.

   You will remember that about a year ago he was struck with paralysis
   and one half of his body was dead. But yet, when I saw him on the bed,
   I had not seen a more cheerful man in the full heyday of strength. I
   had been told that he was the subject of very fearful conflicts at
   times. So after I had shook hands with him, I said, "Friend Smith, I
   hear you have many doubts and fears!" "Who told you that?" said he,
   "for I have none." "Never have any? Why I understood you had many
   conflicts." "Yes," he said, "I have many conflicts, but I have no
   doubts. I have many wars within, but I have no fears.

   "Who could have told you that? I hope I have not led anyone to think
   that. It is a hard battle, but I know the victory is sure. After I have
   had an ill night's rest--of course, through physical debility--my mind
   is troubled, and then that old coward, Satan, who would be afraid to
   meddle with me, perhaps, if I were strong, attacks me when I am weak.
   But I am not afraid of him--don't you go away with that opinion. He
   does throw many fiery darts at me, but I have no doubt as to my final
   victory."

   Then he said, in his own way, "I am just like a packet that is all
   ready to go by train, packed, corded, labeled, paid for, and on the
   platform, waiting for the express to come by and take me to Glory. I
   wish I could hear the whistle now," said he. "I had hoped I should have
   been carried to Heaven long ago, but still I am fine." "And then," he
   said, "I have been telling your George Moore, over there, that I am not
   only on the Rock, but that I am cemented to the Rock, and that the
   cement is as hard as the Rock, so there is no fear of my perishing.
   Unless the Rock falls, I cannot. Unless the Gospel perishes, I cannot
   perish."

   Now, here was a man attacked by Satan--he did not tell me of the bitter
   conflicts he had within, I know they were severe enough. He was anxious
   to bear a good testimony to the faithfulness of his gracious Lord--but
   you see, it was his God that was his stronghold. He ran to this--the
   immutability, the faithfulness, the truthfulness, the mightiness of
   that God upon whose arm he leaned. If you and I will do the same, we
   can always find an attribute of God to oppose to each suggestion of the
   Evil One. "God will leave you," says the Evil One. "You old liar, He
   cannot, for He is a faithful God." "But you will perish after all." "O
   you vile deceiver! That can never be, for He is a mighty God and strong
   to deliver."

   "But one of these times He will abhor you." "No, you false accuser, and
   father of lies, that cannot be, for He is a God of love." "The time
   shall happen when He shall forget you." "No, traitor! That cannot be,
   for He is a God Omniscient, and knows and sees all things." I say, thus
   we may rebut every mischievous slander of Satan, running still into the
   Character of God as our strong tower.

   Brethren, even when the Lord Himself chastens us, it is most blessed to
   appeal against God to God. Do you understand what I mean? He smites us
   with His rod, but then to look up and say, "Father, if I could believe
   what Your rod seems to say, I should say You love me not. But I know
   You are a God of love, and my faith tells me that You love me none the
   less because of that hard blow." See here, Brothers and Sisters, I will
   put myself in the case a moment--Lo, He spurns me as though He hated
   me. He drives me from His Presence, gives me no caresses, denies me
   sweet promises.

   He shuts me up in prison, and gives me the water of affliction, and the
   bread of distress. But my faith declares, "He is such a God that I
   cannot think harshly of Him. He has been so good to me that I know He
   is good now, and in the teeth of all His Providences, even when He puts
   a black mask over His face, I still believe that--

   "Behind a frowning Providence,
   He hides a smiling face."

   But, Friends, I hope you know, I hope each of us may know by
   experience, the blessed are running into the bosom of God and hiding
   there.

   This word to the sinner who has not yet found peace. Do not you see,
   Sinner, the Christian is not saved by what he is, but by what his God
   is? And this is the groundwork of our comfort--that God is perfect--not
   that we are perfect. When I preached last Thursday night about the
   snuffers of the temple, and the golden snuffer trays, and the necessity
   there was for the lamps in the sanctuary to be trimmed, one foolish
   woman said, "Ah, you see, according to the minister's own confession,
   these Christians are as bad as the rest of us, they have many faults.
   Oh," she said, "I dare say I shall be as well off at the last as they
   will."

   Poor soul! She did not see that the Christian's hope does not lie in
   what he is, but in what Christ is. Our trust is not in what we suffer,
   but in what Jesus suffered. Not in what we do, but in what He has done.
   It is not our name--I say again--that is a strong tower to us. It is
   not even our prayers, it is not our good works. It is the name, the
   promise, the truth, the work, the finished righteousness of our God in
   Christ Jesus. Here the Believer finds his defense and nowhere besides.
   Run Sinner, run, for the castle gate is free to all who seek a shelter,
   be they who they may.

   II. By your leave I shall turn to the second point. How THE RIGHTEOUS
   AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THIS

   STRONG TOWER. They run into it. Now, running seems to me to imply that
   they do not stop to make any preparation. You will remember our Lord
   Jesus Christ said to His disciples that when the Romans surrounded
   Jerusalem, he that was on the housetop was not to come down into his
   house, but to run down the outer staircase, and escape. So the
   Christian, when he is attacked by his enemies, should not stop for
   anything, but just run into his God and be safe.

   There is no need for you to tarry until you have prepared your mind,
   until you have performed sundry ablutions, but run, Man, straight away,
   at once. When the pigeons are attacked by the hawk, their better plan
   is not to parley, nor to stay, but swiftly as they can, cut the air and
   fly to the dovecote. So should it be with you. Leave fools, who will,
   to parley with the fiend of Hell--but as for you, fly to your God and
   enter into His secret places till the tempest is over, past. A gracious
   hint, this, to you anxious souls who are seeking to fit yourselves for
   Jesus--away with such legal rubbish, run at once!

   You are safe in following the good example of the righteous. This
   running appears to me to imply that they have nothing to carry. A man
   who has a load, the heavier the load may be, the more will he be
   impeded in his flight. But the righteous run, like racers in the games,
   who have thrown off everything. Their sins they leave to mercy, and
   their righteousness to the moles and bats. If I had any righteousness I
   would not carry it, but run to the righteousness of Christ without
   it--for my own righteousness must be a drag upon me which I could not
   bear.

   Sinners, I know, when they come to Christ, want to bring tons of good
   works, wagon loads of good feelings, and fitness, and repenting and
   such like--but the righteous do no such thing. They just foreswear
   everything they have of their own, and count it but dross and dung,
   that they may run to Christ, and be found in him. Gospel righteousness
   lies all in Jesus, not in the Believer.

   It seems to me, too, that this expression not only implies a want of
   preparation, and having nothing to carry, but it implies that fear
   quickens them. Men do not run to a castle unless they are afraid. But
   when the avenger of death is close behind, then swiftly they fly. It is
   marvelous how godly fear helps faith. There is a man sinking there in
   the river. He cannot swim, he must be drowned! Look! He is going down!
   We push him a plank--with what a clutch he grasps it! And the more he
   is convicted that he has no power to float, the more firmly does he
   grip at this one hope. Fear may even drive a man, I say, to faith, and
   lend him wings to fly, where otherwise he might have crept with laggard
   feet. The fight is the flight of fear, but the refuge is the refuge of
   faith. O, Sinner, if the righteous fly, what ought your pace to be?

   Again, it seems to me that there is great eagerness here, as if the
   Christian did not feel safe till he had entered into his God. As the
   stag pursued by the hounds quickens its flight by reason of the baying
   of the dogs, as the clamor grows louder and louder, see how the stag
   leaps from crag to crag! He dashes through the stream, flies over
   yonder hill, is lost in yonder brake and soon springs through the
   valley! So the Christian flies to his dear God for safety, when the
   hounds of Hell and the dogs of temptation are let loose against him.
   Eagerness! Where indeed shall the like be found?

   "As the hart pants after the water brooks, so pants my soul after you,
   O God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God: when shall I come
   and appear before God?" O convicted Sinner, what should your eagerness
   be if thus the righteous pant for God? Brethren, I may add here, that
   there is an absence of all hesitation. He runs. You know, if we want
   somebody to help us, we put our hand to our brow and consider, "Let us
   see, where shall we go? I am in great straits, to whom shall I fly? Who
   will be the best friend to me?" The righteous never ask that question,
   at least when they are in a right mind they never do.

   The moment their trouble comes they run at once to their God, for they
   feel that they have full permission to repair to Him. And again they
   feel they have nowhere else to fly. "To whom, or where should I go, if
   I could turn from You," is a question which is its own answer. Then
   understand, in our text there is eagerness, the absence of all
   hesitation. There is fear, and yet there is courage. There is no
   preparation, there is the flinging aside of every burden. "The
   righteous run into His high tower and are safe."

   Beloved, I will leave that point, when I have said please remember that
   when a man gets into a castle, he is safe because of the impregnability
   of the castle. He is not safe because of the way in which he entered
   into the castle. You hear some man inside saying, "I shall never be
   hurt, because I came into the castle the right way." You will tell him,
   "No, no, no, it is not the way you came into the castle, but the castle
   itself is our defense." So some of you may be thinking, "I do come to
   Christ, but I am afraid that I do not come aright." But it is not your
   coming, it is Christ that saves you!

   If you are in Christ, I do not care a pin how you got in, for I am sure
   you could not get in except by the door! If you are once in, He will
   never throw you out. He will never drive away a soul that comes unto
   Him, for any reason whatever. Your safety does not lie in how you came,
   for in very truth, your safety is in Him. If a man should run into a
   castle and carry all the jewels of a kingdom with him, he would not be
   safer because of the jewels. And if another man should run in with
   hardly a fresh suit of clothes with him, he would not be any the more
   in danger because of his raggedness.

   It is the castle, it is the castle, not the man. The solid walls, the
   strong bastions, the frowning ramparts, the mighty munitions--these
   make up the defense--not the man! Nor the man's wealth, nor the way the
   man came. Beloved, it is most true that salvation is of the Lord, and
   whoever shall look out of self tonight, whoever shall look to Christ
   only, shall find Him to be a strong tower. You may run into your Lord
   and be safe.

   III. And now for our third and closing remark. You that have Bibles
   with margins, just look at them. You will find that the second part of
   the text is put in the margin thus--"The righteous run into it and are
   set aloft." Our first rendering is, "The righteous run into it and are
   safe"--there is the matter offact. The other rendering is, "He is set
   aloft"-- there is the matter of joyous experience.

   1. Now, first, let us see to the matter of fact. The man that is
   sheltered in his God--a man that dwells in the secret places of the
   tabernacle of the Host on High, who is hidden in His pavilion, and is
   set upon a rock, he is safe, for, first, who can hurt him? The Devil?
   Christ has broken his head. Life? Christ has taken his life up to
   Heaven, for we are dead, and, "our life is hid with Christ in God."
   Death? No. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. "O death,
   where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory?"

   The law? That is satisfied and it is dead to the Believer, and he is
   not under its curse. Sin? No--that cannot hurt the Believer, for Christ
   has slain it. Christ took the Believer's sins upon Himself, and
   therefore they are not on the Believer any more. Christ took the
   Believer's sins and threw them into the Red Sea of His atoning blood.
   The depths have covered them, not one of them is left. All the sin the
   Believer has ever committed is now blotted out, and a debt that is
   cancelled can never put a man in prison. A debt that is paid, let it be
   ever so heavy, can never make a man an insolvent--it is discharged, it
   has ceased to be.

   "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that
   justifies. Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died, yes,
   rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who
   also makes intercession for us." Who can harm us? Let him have
   permission to do what he will, what is there that he can do? Who,
   again, has the power to reach us? We are in the hands of Christ. What
   arrow shall penetrate His hands to reach our souls? We are under the
   skirts of Deity. What strength shall tear away the mantle of God to
   reach His children? Our names are written on the hands of Jesus--who
   can erase those everlasting lines?

   We are jewels in Immanuel's crown. What thievish fingers shall steal
   away those jewels? We are in Christ. Who shall be able to rend us from
   His innermost heart? We are members of His body. Who shall mutilate the
   Savior? "I bore you," says God, "as on eagles' wings." Who shall smite
   through the breast of the Eternal One, Heaven's great eagle? He must
   first do it before he can reach the eaglets, the young sons of God,
   begotten unto a lively hope. Who can reach us? God interposes--Christ
   stands in the way. And the Holy Spirit guards us as a garrison.

   Who shall stand against the Omnipotent? Tens of thousands of created
   powers must fall before him, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting
   strength. What weapon is there that can be used against us? Shall they
   kill us? Then we begin to live. Shall they banish us? Then we are but
   nearer to our Home. Shall they strip us? How can they rend away the
   garment of imputed righteousness? Shall they seize our property? How
   can they touch our treasure since it is all in Heaven? Shall they
   scourge us? Sweet shall be the smart when Christ is present with us!
   Shall they cast us into a dungeon? Where shall the free spirit find a
   prison? What fetters can bind the man who is free in Christ?

   Shall the tongue attack us? Every tongue that rises against us in
   judgment, we shall condemn. I know not what new weapon can be formed,
   for certain it is that the anvil of the Church has broken all the
   hammers that were ever used to smite it, and remains uninjured, still.
   The Believer is--he must be safe. I said this morning that if the
   Believer in Christ is not saved forever, then, Beloved, there is no
   meaning whatever in God's Word. And I say it once again, and I say it
   without any word of apology for so doing--I could never receive that
   Book as the Book of God at all, if it could be proved to me that it did
   not teach the doctrine of the safety of those that trust in Christ.

   I could never believe that God would speak in such a manner as to make
   tens of thousands of us, yes, millions of us, believe that He would
   keep us, and yet after all, He should cast us away. Nor do I believe
   that He would use words which, to say the very least, seem to teach
   final perseverance if He had not intended to teach us the doctrine. All
   the Arminian Divines that ever lived cannot prove the total apostasy of
   Believers. They can attack some other points of the Calvinistic
   doctrine. There are some points of our form of doctrine which
   apparently are far more vulnerable.

   God forbid we should be so foolish as to deny that there are
   difficulties about every system of theology! But about the perseverance
   of the saint there is no difficulty. It is as easy to overthrow an
   opponent, here, as it would be to thrust through, with a spear, a
   shield of pasteboard. Be confident, Believer, that this is God's Truth,
   that they who trust in God shall be as Mount Zion which shall never be
   removed, but abide forever.

   2. But now we conclude by noticing that our text not only teaches us
   our safety, but our experience of it. "He shall set him up aloft." The
   Believer in his high days, and they ought to be every day, is like an
   eagle perched aloft on a towering crag. Yonder is a hunter, down below,
   who would desire to strike the royal bird. He has his rifle with
   him--but his rifle would not reach one third of the way--so the royal
   bird looks down upon him. He sees him load and prime, and aim. He looks
   in quiet contempt on him, not intending even to take the trouble to
   stretch one of his wings.

   He sees him load again, hears the bullet down below, but he is quite
   safe, for he is up aloft. Such is the faithful Christian's state before
   God. He can look down upon every trial and temptation, upon every
   adversary and every malicious attack--for God is his strong tower, and,
   "he is set up aloft." When some people go to the newspaper and write a
   very sharp, bitter, and cutting letter against the minister, "Oh," they
   think, "How he will feel that! How that will cut him to the quick!"

   And yet, if they had seen the man read it through, double it up, and
   throw it into the fire, saying, "What a mercy it is to have somebody
   taking notice of me." If they could see the man go to bed and sleep all
   the better because he thinks he has had a high honor conferred on him
   for being allowed to be abused for Christ, surely they would see that
   their efforts are only, "hate's labor lost." I do not think our enemies
   would take so much trouble to make us happy, if they knew how blessed
   we are under their malice.

   "You have prepared a table before me in the presence of my enemies,"
   said David. Some soldiers never eat so well as when their enemies are
   looking on--for there is a sort of gusto about every mouthful which
   they eat, as they seem to say--"snatched from the jaw of the lion, and
   from the paw of the bear, and in defiance of you all, in the name of
   the Most High God I feast to the full, and then set up my banner." The
   Lord sets His people up aloft.

   But there are many who do not appear to be much up aloft. You meet them
   in the corn market and they say, "Wheat does not pay as they used to.
   Farming is no good to anybody." Hear others, after those gales, those
   violent gales, when so many ships have gone down, say, "Ah, you may
   well pity us poor fellows that have to do with shipping, dreadful times
   these, we are all sure to be ruined." See many of our tradesmen--"This
   Exhibition has given us a little spurt, but as soon as this is over,
   there will be nothing doing. Trade never was so dull." Trade has been
   dull ever since I have been in London, and that is nine years!

   I do not know how it is, but our friends are always losing money, yet
   they get on pretty comfortably, too. Some I know, began with nothing.
   And they are getting pretty rich now, but, it is all by losing money,
   if I am to believe what they tell me! Surely this is not sitting up
   aloft. Surely this is not living up on high. This is a low kind of life
   for a child of God. We should not have liked to see the Prince of Wales
   in his boyhood playing with the children in the street, and I do not
   suppose you would like to see him now among coal heavers at a wrestling
   match.

   Nor should the child of God be seen pushing and grasping as if this
   world were all, always using that muckrake to scrape together the
   things of this world. Instead he should be in full satisfaction, being
   content with such things as he has, for God has said, "I will never
   leave you nor forsake you." I am not a little ashamed of myself that I
   do not live more on high, for I know when we get depressed in spirits,
   and downcast, and doubting, we say many unbelieving and God-dishonoring
   words. It is all wrong. We ought not to stay here in these marshes of
   fleshly doubts. We ought never to doubt our God. Let the heathen doubt
   his god, for well he may, but our God made the heavens.

   What a happy people we ought to be! When we are not, we are not true to
   our principles. There are ten thousand arguments in Scripture for
   happiness in the Christian. But I do not know that there is one logical
   argument for misery. Those people who draw their faces down, and like
   the hypocrites, pretend to be of a sad countenance, these, I say, cry,
   "Lord, what a wretched land is this, that yields us no supplies." I
   should think they do not belong to the children of Israel! The children
   of Israel find in the wilderness a Rock following them with its streams
   of water, and manna dropping every day. And when they want them, there
   are the quails, and so the wretched land is filled with good supplies.

   Let us rather rejoice in our God. I should not like to have a serving
   man who always went about with a dreary countenance, because do you
   know people would say, "What a bad master that man has." And when we
   see Christians looking so sad, we are apt to think they cannot have a
   good God to trust to. Come, Beloved, let us change our notes, for we
   have a strong tower, and are safe.

   Let us take a walk upon the ramparts. I do not see any reason for
   always being down in the dungeon. Let us go up to the very top of the
   ramparts, where the banner waves in the fresh air, and let us sound the
   clarion of defiance to our foes! And let it ring across the plain,
   where yonder pale white-horsed rider comes, bearing the lance of death.
   Let us defy even him. Ring out the note again! Salute the evening, and
   make the outgoings of the morning to rejoice.

   Wander upon the castle top, shout to your companion, yonder, and let
   every tower and every turret of the grand old battlements be vocal with
   the praise of Him who has said--

   "Munitions of stupendous rock,
   Your dwelling place shall be.
   There shall your soul without a shock
   The wreck of nature see."

   Sinner, again I say the door is open! Run to the mercy of God in
   Christ, and by His Grace, be safe!

                       Nominal Christians--Real Infidels

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 1, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "If I say the truth, why do you not believe Me?" John 8:46.

   As we meet this evening to commune at the Table of the Lord, it will
   then be necessary for me to seek the edification of God's people. I
   therefore think it best to occupy our time this morning with an
   exhortation to those that are out of the way. May the Holy Spirit make
   our words like arrows from the bow of a mighty man. May He graciously
   direct them to the chosen hearts which He has ordained to bless, and
   may this hallowed hour be a time of salvation to many among you.
   Whatever may be lacking in the human instrument, I trust there will be
   no absence of true affection and solemn earnestness. And O, may the
   Holy Spirit use those infirmities under which I labor this morning to
   magnify His own strength!
   You know, dear Friends, there has been a great deal of talk lately
   about the Infidelity, which like a whirlwind, shakes the Establishment.
   We felt a very stiff breeze caused by certain, "Essays and Reviews,"
   and before that could blow over, a perfect hurricane from the African
   shore astonished many, and alarmed a few. Everybody agrees to censure
   the inconsistency of a man who wears a miter and quarrels with Moses,
   professes to be a minister of the Church and undermines her
   foundations. Too much importance has been attached to the poor attempts
   of the Arithmetical Unbeliever and what was in reality nothing more
   than a storm in a teacup has been exaggerated until all the sea of
   Christendom is tossed with tempest.
   To my mind, there is a terrible enemy abroad far more worthy of our
   steel than the recreant prelate and his Zulu teachers. Spare your
   voices, O Watchmen of Zion, for a mightier enemy--and reserve your
   swords for a sterner adversary of our Israel. Secret unbelief, as the
   mother and foster parent of all open infidelity, requires to be watched
   and wept over. Let us mourn over the professed unbelief of the age. But
   there is an unbelief more gross than this, more dishonest, more
   inconsistent, more widely spread, and more deceptive in its character!
   It is an infidelity so impalpable that we cannot readily arrest it, and
   drag it into the court of conscience!
   It is so unreasonable that argument is out of place in contending with
   it. This "pestilence which walks in darkness," broods frightfully over
   our congregations, and smothers beneath its death-bearing wings not a
   few of you, whose souls I would win for Christ. Into the battle with
   this destroyer of souls I enter this day. Oh, may my Lord and Master
   give me power to strike home. Solemnly I protest against that
   dishonest, inconsistent infidelity of which some of you are the
   victims. You tell me that you believe the Bible to be inspired of God.
   No suspicions as to its Divine authority linger in your mind. You have
   faith in the Gospel which we preach, that it is genuine, true, and
   sound.
   But here lies your inconsistency or dishonesty--you say it is true--but
   you do not believe it! You admit that it came from God, but practically
   you reject it! You will not deny that it is worthy of all
   acceptation--it must be so if it came from God. You admit it deals with
   all-important matters--and yet you practically say it is not worthy of
   your attention, since many of you are still in disobedience to the
   voice of love, neglecting the great salvation.
   Before charging home upon your consciences, my Hearers, I feel impelled
   to remark that many professors of religion deserve the rebuke of the
   text, for they say they believe the Bible, but they do not act in
   accordance with it. We have been boasting, in the language of
   Chillingworth, that the Bible, and the Bible alone, is the religion of
   Protestants--but the boast requires a little examination. Do we not
   tolerate many things among Protestants which can never be vindicated
   from Scripture?
   You tell me that the Bible is your religion, and yet bring your infants
   for Baptism! You sprinkle their brows, or sign their foreheads with a
   cross. And where do you find your warrant for thus profaning an
   ordinance which sets forth the burial of Believers with their Lord?
   Tradition may lend a forced and lame support to baby sprinkling, but to
   the Bible it is a novelty unknown. Moreover I ask you where comes
   confirmation? Will anyone be bold enough to assert that there is
   anything in God's Word like it?
   Yes, and more--where do you find a State Establishment? Verily, not in
   the New Testament, since our Lord has said, "My kingdom is not of this
   world," and this unworldly Gospel is a standing protest against the
   spiritual fornication which State religion involves. Everywhere, in all
   sects, I see inventions of men arrogating the place of the Commandments
   of God. Let us sweep our temples, and return unto the Word of the Lord.
   Say not that you believe the Book, when you act as though it were not
   true--when you advocate practices, and set up rites and ceremonies
   unknown to Apostolic times, and Scriptural records.
   Brethren, again I say it, our Churches require to be brought face to
   face with the infallible Word. By this test try them all--they say the
   thing is true--will they believe it? Will they practice it? Will they
   abide by the standard? High professors, the love of this world is
   enmity against God! You profess to love God, but you are as worldly, as
   fond of fashion and its frivolities, as pleased with pomp and its
   fooleries, as hungry for honor and its pretensions, as you can be. And
   yet you say this Book is true!
   Verily, by your acts you prove that you believe it not. I might draw up
   today a dreadful bill of indictment against the visible Church of this
   age. I might prove to a demonstration that it is not delivered from
   this present evil world, according to the will of God, even the Father.
   And that it teaches for doctrines the commandments of men--so that it
   deserves to be met with the unanswerable question and faithful rebuke
   of our Lord Jesus--"If I say the truth, why do you not believe Me?"

   Although fidelity to my Lord required these few remarks, which are not
   meant as an angry discovery of a Brother's faults, but as the faithful
   wounds of a friend, I turn to the matter which has most to do with you,
   the people of my charge. Having shown you the many giants' heads which
   might be smitten by this smooth stone, taken out of the brook, I shall
   now take aim at your hearts, O you who believe not on my Lord!

   I. Unbelievers in Christ, MY TEXT SETS FORTH VERY PITHILY AND
   PERTINENTLY YOUR INCONSISTENCY.

   "If I say the truth, why do you not believe Me?" If you boldly meet me
   by saying, "I am not converted, for I do not believe in the mission of
   Christ," your position is a consistent, though a terrible one. If you
   tell me you have suspicions about the inspiration of Scripture, and
   therefore you do not believe in Christ, your position is certainly
   dangerous, if it is not despicable. But when you tell me that you
   believe Jesus Christ was sent from Heaven, and that His Gospel is the
   revelation of God to man--and you are still at this day
   unconverted--your position, besides its tremendous responsibility and
   danger, is extraordinarily inconsistent, so inconsistent that an honest
   man should blush to remain in it for an hour.

   Were you rightly to weigh the matter you would say, "I will not, I will
   not be thus a liar unto my soul any longer. I will not contradict
   myself, but I will be consistent, and since the thing is true, I will
   believe it."

   Remember, first of all, that Jesus Christ has revealed to you your
   need. He has told you in express words that you need regeneration.
   "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
   Enlarging upon the doctrine, He adds--"Except a man be born of water
   and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of Heaven." He has
   laid the new birth before you as an imperative necessity. You admit
   that this is true. Your admission that this Book came from God is
   clearly an assent to this teaching. Why, then, is it that you who have
   never passed from death unto life?

   Why do you remain contented without that Divine change, and are
   satisfied with moral reformation or outward respectability, while the
   Book assures you that these will never do? The Great Master assures you
   that you must be converted. Hear His express words--"Except you are
   converted and become as little children, you shall in no wise enter
   into the kingdom of Heaven." This you allow to be correct, for it is in
   the Book which you agree to reverence. Oh, Sinner, how then, can you be
   at ease in an unconverted state? How is it that you can remain so
   careless, when Heaven is barred against you because you are not
   converted?

   You cannot delude yourself with the thought that perhaps all will be
   well with you, when Christ assures you it cannot be well with you
   except you experience His converting Grace. Has He not told you, too,
   in many a passage of prophetic and Apostolic Scripture, that you must
   return unto the God from whom you have wandered, and leave your sins,
   and give your heart to Him? What meant that gracious parable concerning
   the prodigal? Did it not set you forth, you who have spent your living
   with harlots, and are brought to the degradations of sin? Did He not
   teach you that your only hope lies in quick return to your offended,
   but loving Father in Heaven? "I will arise and go to my Father"--is not
   this fit language for you?

   The citizens of this country--what can they do for you? They send you
   into their fields to feed swine, but you cannot fill your belly with
   the husks which the swine eat. Does not Jesus, in that loving parable,
   say affectionately to you, "Return unto your God"? Oh, if this is true,
   and you say it is, then believe it--and sure I am your heart will yearn
   towards your Father's house, and you will run towards your home at
   once. Is it not true that we must abhor that which is evil and turn
   with full purpose of heart unto the Lord? "True," you answer,
   "certainly it is." Why then, I reply, do you not believe it, and act
   upon the belief?

   Dear Friends, if any physician, well-known and honored, should meet you
   today on your way home, and if he should most affectionately and
   solemnly inform you that you bear about in your person a dreadful
   disease. Methinks if you should profess to believe his warning, and yet
   you should seek no remedy for it, but remain totally unaffected by the
   dreadful assurance, it might well be asked of you, "How can you say it
   is true, for you evidently do not believe it?"

   O my Hearers, as though Christ spoke to you by me, so I ask you this
   question--How can you, as candid persons, how can you as honest men,
   admit this Book to be true, when it tells you that your whole head is
   sick, and your whole heart faint? When it warns you that, dying as you
   now are, without a work of Divine Grace in you, you are lost to all
   eternity--how can you, I say, admit these things to be true, and yet
   prove by your apathy and carelessness that you do not believe them? May
   God press that enquiry home upon you!

   Our Lord Jesus Christ came not only to reveal your need, but also to
   set forth His claims. The claims of Jesus of Nazareth are briefly
   stated by Peter, "Repent and be converted, everyone of you, that your
   sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from
   the presence of the Lord." He demands repentance--that is, a change of
   mind--the changing of your mind with reference to sin, caring no more
   for its pleasures, despising it and turning away from it. A change of
   mind with regard to holiness--seeking your happiness in it. A change of
   mind with regard to Christ Himself, so that you shall no longer look
   upon Him as without form or comeliness, but as a most precious Savior,
   such as you need.

   Sinner, Christ demands of you that you should take your ornaments of
   self-righteousness from you, and wrap yourself in the sackcloth of
   humiliation, and cast the ashes of penitence upon your head, and cry,
   "Unclean! Unclean! Unclean!" Moreover, He requires faith of you.
   "Repent and believe the Gospel." "This is the commandment, that you
   believe on Jesus Christ whom God has sent." The Jews said, "What shall
   we do that we may do the work of God?" Christ said, "This is the work
   of God, that you believe on Jesus Christ whom He has sent." He demands
   that faith which will accept Him to be the sole cleanser from sin, and
   to be the sole possessor, as He is the sole redeemer, of the heart.

   Friend, you believe that no less a Person than the Son of God thus bids
   you look unto Him and be saved. You believe that the Son of God was
   nailed to the Cross, and that out of love to you He demands that you
   forsake the sin which will destroy you. And He demands you believe in
   His blood which will cleanse you. Does Jesus thus speak? Are these
   demands the hard inventions of a tyrannical priesthood, or the mild and
   tender claims of love? Is it a mere man who bids you believe and live,
   or is it the Redeemer, "in whom dwells all the fullness of the Godhead
   bodily," who commands you to believe and be baptized?

   If the claim to faith is true and just, why do you not accede to it?
   Why harden your hearts? Why stand out against incarnate love, pleading
   and persuading you? Oh, strange inconsistency, to know the Savior's
   Truth, but not to believe Him! Oh, shameful dishonesty, to grant the
   validity of His claim, but to be careless concerning the discharge of
   it! To grant the justness of the requirement, and refuse to accede to
   it with your hearts is to write yourselves down as deceitful and
   unrighteous. "If I say the truth, why do you not believe Me?"

   Further, Christ came to provide the remedy for your soul. Christ did
   not preach an impossible Gospel--one out of the reach of sinners. He
   provided a real, ready, and available salvation. No, Beloved, He came
   to preach glad tidings of great joy to men, a Gospel worthy of all
   acceptation, in which even the vilest have a share. And this is
   it--that God wills not the death of the sinner, but had rather that he
   should turn unto Him and live. That, in order that mercy and justice
   might both meet, Christ, God's own dear Son, was sacrificed on Calvary
   for the ungodly. The Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to
   God. And that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have
   everlasting life.

   This is the Gospel--a Gospel to be preached to every creature, from the
   cold snows of Lapland to the balmy plains of the torrid zone--a Gospel
   to be published among, every people wherever sinners are found--that
   Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, even the very chief,
   and that an act of faith in Him saves the soul. A simple trusting in
   Him and the soul is delivered from all sin. My Friends, you profess
   that this is true. O my Hearers, very few among you doubt that this
   Gospel is Divine.

   The most of you who sit in these seats Sunday after Sunday, never raise
   any difficulties of that sort. You say, "Our minister has preached the
   Gospel to us." But oh, if this is true, why do you not believe it? If
   there is a remedy, a sure one, a God-appointed one, why do you not
   receive it? O Sirs, this damnable inconsistency of yours will ruin your
   souls, unless you repent of it. Deny it altogether, and I can
   understand your position, though I weep over it. But say that it is
   true, and yet reject it, and your folly is so glaring that it shall be
   a theme for laughter in Hell, when fiends shall be your companions and
   the eternal burnings your perpetual abode.

   How can it be? You are hanging over the jaws of Hell, the flames flash
   into your face! A strong hand that can save you is stretched out. You
   refuse its grasp and will refuse it, still, unless it lays hold on you
   by force. Perishing! The very medicine offered you which will cure you,
   and you will not receive it although you know its healing virtue! You
   do not believe it. There is infidelity in your heart, and before you
   condemn open unbelievers, search your own hearts, for how are you
   better than they? May not your sins be less excusable and your state
   less hopeful than theirs?

   Dear Friends. Our blessed Lord came also to reveal the freeness of His
   Grace. Oh, what freeness was there in the Gospel when Christ preached
   it! No cold theology His lips. Words did not hang like icicles there,
   but out of His mouth there flowed rivers of living water. What can be
   freer than this--"Come unto Me all you that labor and are heavy-laden
   and I will give you rest"? Or what more wide than this--"If any man
   thirst let him come unto Me and drink"? Or what more gracious than
   this, by the lips of His servant John--"Whosoever will, let him come
   and take of the water of life freely"? Oh, I need not repeat these
   invitations! I shall rather remind you that you admit them to be true,
   hearty, Divine invitations.

   Why then, oh, why do you not believe them? You say, "Yes, it is freely
   presented. I have not a doubt about that." Then why do you stand
   shivering and refusing to lay hold on eternal life? Soul, if this
   Gospel were hedged with thorns or guarded with bayonets I would
   recommend you to fling yourself upon their very points to reach it. But
   when the door is opened, and when Christ Himself, dressed in bleeding
   love, woos you to come--how shall I make an excuse for you when you can
   say it is true and yet you do not believe it? May God give you wisdom
   and teach you reason--right reason.

   Furthermore, Jesus Christ in His preaching gave a very clear
   description of the danger of unregenerate souls. Hear how He puts
   it--"Where their worm dies not and their fire is not quenched." Mark
   how He speaks of the unprofitable servant--"Cast him into outer
   darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Observe how He
   describes the goats on the left hand, these are the thundering accents
   of the Judge of All--"Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting
   fire, prepared for the devil and his angels."

   No preacher was ever so awfully explicit upon future punishment as
   Jesus of Nazareth. No human ministry ever gave such graphic and
   harrowing descriptions of Hell as Christ has given. You say you believe
   the words of Jesus--you do not suspect a loving Savior of exaggeration,
   do you? Oh, my Hearers, I ask you now, in the name of God--if it is
   true, why do you not believe it? You do not believe it--that is clear
   enough. Would you sit quietly in your seat this morning, young man, if
   you really believed that within one instant you may be in Hell?

   Old Man! Old in years, and old in sin--would you be as quiet in your
   soul today as you are if you knew and believed that there is but a step
   between you and the flames? Oh, all of you who can make merry while yet
   you have no hope in Jesus, could it be so with you if you really
   believed in the wrath of God which abides on you? So near the lake of
   fire and yet so full of levity! Death and damnation at your doors, and
   yet jesting and unconcerned! My soul is full of horror at your madness!
   My heart is ready to burst with anguish at the ruin which will so soon
   overtake you! What shall I say unto you? How shall I reason with
   you?--Surely if the thunders of an angry God do not arouse you, you
   will sleep yourselves into the lowest Hell.

   Brethren, let me add, Christ has brought to light the hope of
   immortality, eternal life and Heaven. What glowing pictures does the
   Word of God give of the state of the blessed in the land of the
   hereafter! What music streams from angels' harps! What joy irradiates
   every celestial brow! What hallowed blessedness floats along the river
   of the Water of Life in the midst of every street of the new Jerusalem!
   You admire the poetry of the Book of God and marvel at its matchless
   painting of scenes beyond the flood. You believe that Jesus has
   revealed that which eye had not seen and ear had not heard. Then why do
   you not believe it?

   If you believed it you would seek after it, you would strive to enter
   in at the strait gate. You would labor for the meat which perishes not.
   The Spirit of God would lead you to prize the world to come. You would
   tread this present fleeting world beneath your feet, and be looking
   for, and hasting unto the glories which are yet to be revealed in those
   who love the Lord. The sum of all this is the weighty enquiry of our
   Lord Jesus. "If I say the truth why do you not believe Me?" If Christ
   is no liar, if His Word is no fiction, how can you remain as you now
   are--ungodly, unthinking, unconverted men and women? May the Holy
   Spirit constrain you to give heed to this searching question.

   II. YOU OFFER SOME DEFENSE OF YOUR INCONSISTENCY, BUT I ANSWER THAT
   YOUR APOLOGIES

   DO NOT MEET THE CASE.

   I hear one say, "Sir, I do not feel myself entitled to come to Christ.
   The Revelation of God is true, but I do not believe in Christ because I
   do not feel any need that I should." I answer that this is no
   excuse--this is rather a proof of guilt. You do not believe that which
   Christ has told you concerning yourself. The Word of God informs you in
   many places that your case is an awful and a lamentable one. If you
   believed this, you would never have to complain that you did not feel
   it. In matters relating to the body, we feel first, and then believe.

   My hand smarts, and therefore I believe that it has been wounded. But
   in things relating to the soul, you believe first, and feel afterwards.
   A woman cannot feel grief on account of the loss of her child till she
   believes she has lost it. A young man cannot feel joy at the
   inheritance of a large estate till he believes he has inherited it. But
   it is impossible for a loving mother to believe that her child is lost,
   and not to weep, or for an ambitious young man to believe himself
   suddenly made rich and not to rejoice. Now, if you really believed your
   heart to be as deceitful as the Bible says it is. If you really
   believed sin to be as dreadful a thing as God regards it to be, you
   would necessarily feel repentance and conviction.

   Alas, it is only when the Spirit of God gives you a real belief in
   these things that you repent in earnest. The real root of your hardness
   of heart lies in your not believing what you admit to be true. You say
   the Bible is true, but you say what you do not mean. Oh, I would that
   this inconsistency would strike you! You say it is true, but you cannot
   believe it, or you would be at once aroused to anxious conviction.

   But you make a second apology. "But, Sir, I do not see how faith can
   save me." Here, again, there is no excuse, because the basis of your
   doubt, after all, is this--you do not believe what Scripture reveals.
   If you speak honestly, you really mean to say, "The testimony of the
   Bible concerning salvation through faith is not true." Let me
   affectionately remove this stumbling block, if it is ignorance and not
   willful unbelief. You say you cannot see how faith can save you. Do you
   not know that faith, in itself, does not save?

   Faith saves by reason of that which it lays hold of. Christ stood in
   the place of every man living that ever did or will believe on Him. He
   took the sins of those persons and was punished for them. And those who
   trust Him receive the effect of what He suffered. To say that faith
   could save would be an unreasonable thing--but that the Object of
   faith, the Divine suffering Savior can save--is no unreasonable
   doctrine. Now, if you do really believe what Scripture tells you
   concerning this, you cannot again raise this objection, that you do not
   see how faith can save.

   But you say you prefer works. But Scripture tells you, times without
   number, that by the works of the law there shall no flesh be justified.
   And it adds that all your righteousnesses are but as filthy rags. So
   all hope in that quarter is destroyed. You admit that Scripture is
   true, and yet you want to be saved by your works! This is to say that
   black is white! This is to make God a liar, and yet, to make you bow,
   and compliment Him as the God of Truth at the same time. Sinner, if you
   believe the Bible, it is as clear as noonday that he that believes on
   Him is not condemned, and that he that believes not is condemned
   already, because he has not believed on the Son of God.

   Perhaps you meet me by saying, that you have long thought that the good
   things promised in the Gospel, simply and only to faith, are too good
   to be true. That, conscious of being a lost sinner, and a very wretched
   offender, you have not the presumption to believe that if you were to
   trust Christ this very morning, all your sins would be forgiven. Well
   Friend, come now, you talk like a humble man, but it is very likely you
   are very proud. Let me get ahold of you by the button. What does all
   this mean, my dear Friend, but just this--that you think very meanly of
   God? I do not believe you think so meanly of yourself as you think you
   do.

   You think meanly of God! You think that He has but little mercy, at
   least not so much mercy as you need, and so you limit the Holy One of
   Israel. But I shall meet you on the ground of my text. You allow that
   this Book is true--very well--has not the Lord declared, both by
   instances, and by express words of promise, that though your sins are
   as scarlet they shall be as wool? And though they are red like crimson
   they shall be whiter than snow? However aggravated guilt may be, it can
   damn no man that believes in Christ. I pray you read the Gospel aright.
   You cannot then make the greatness of its Grace a ground of doubt. The
   thing is great, but it is not too great for God. As high as the heavens
   are above the earth so high are His ways above your ways, and His
   thoughts above your thoughts.

   But do I hear you answer that you are not quite sure that the promise
   is made to you. Sinner, I must not lose patience with you, but I would
   you would lose patience with yourself, for this is trifling. You say
   the Bible is true. Sir, if you say it is true, you know that the very
   object for which it was sent to you was that it might save you. What is
   said in the twentieth chapter of the Gospel by John?--"These are
   written that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, and that
   believing you might have life through His name."

   God did not send this Book to you, I am sure, to play with you. He sent
   it that you might be saved. But how can you say the invitations do not
   include you? "Whosoever will." Does that shut you out? The Gospel not
   sent to you? Why, does it not say, "Go you into all the world and
   preach the Gospel to every creature?" Are you not a creature? Can you
   escape there? Soul, you know that, inasmuch as the Gospel is to be
   preached to every creature, and inasmuch as you are condemned already
   for not believing on the Son of God, therefore the Gospel must have
   been sent to you.

   You say you do not feel your need and you are not prepared. No
   preparation was ever asked. "This He gives you--it is His Spirit's
   rising beam." You say you do not feel this, and you do not feel that.
   He never asked you to feel anything as a preparation for Him. All this
   is the gift of His Divine Grace. You know we preach here every Sunday
   to you a Gospel which meets you as you are, not as quickened sinners,
   but as sinners! Not as convicted sinners, but as sinners--naked, poor
   and helpless. You know we speak the Truth of God. Why do you not
   believe us when we tell you that to you, even to you, is the Word of
   this Gospel sent--for him that comes to Christ He will in no wise cast
   out?

   Ah, you will think about this, but the time has not yet come. I answer,
   again, that you do not believe the Bible to be true. If you believed,
   as the Bible describes, that life is short, and death is certain, and
   eternity is near, and there is a dreadful Hell into which you will be
   plunged, and a bright and glorious Heaven which you will lose, you
   would cry out, "Lord, save me, or I perish!" As when the hand of the
   angel hastened Lot from the burning city, so would a full conviction of
   these things hasten you to the Cross for shelter.

   Ah, I repeat what I commenced with, I would care but little for open
   infidelity if this secret unbelief could be killed. You know why men
   are infidels openly? It is because they want to find an excuse for
   their inward infidelity. When men with some few grains of honesty, and
   a little pride mingled with it, begin to reason with themselves, they
   argue thus-- "Now I love my sins too well to give them up. The Bible is
   true, but it demands of me repentance, faith, and other things not at
   all palatable. If I say the old Book is true and do not heed it, I
   shall be inconsistent.

   "I will at least show I have one virtue--I will be consistent. I will
   deny the authority of the Scriptures, and then, though conscience may
   prick me, yet before men I shall earn a reputation for daring
   consistency, my actions and my words agreeing." Well, Sir, I like you
   not for this, but I must say this, that we have seen some of the
   greatest unbelievers converted to God in this House of Prayer, while
   others remain unblest. We have seen many baptized into Christ who once
   did not believe His Deity and who doubted the inspiration of Scripture!

   But all the while there are some of you who say the Word is true, but
   do not believe it, and I am almost ready to give you up. You are like
   some persons we visit on their sick beds. They say, "Yes, Sir," "Yes,
   Sir," to all we say, and they die and are damned with, "Yes, Sir," on
   their tongue, but with "No, Sir" in their heart! This is what you are
   doing. You say, "Yes, Sir," "Yes, Sir," "Yes, Sir," but you do not
   repent, you do not believe. You live, and I fear some of you will die,
   without God.

   III. Again, I would aim at your consciences from another quarter.
   Friend, Friend, be not offended with me while I tell you now a piece of
   solemn Truth. In the forty-fifth verse Jesus gives the reason why some
   did not believe on Him. It is a most unreasonable reason. It is
   this--"Because I tell you the truth you believe Me not." Why, that
   should be the very reason why they should believe Him!

   Now, I fear some of you do not believe the Truth of God, simply because
   it is the Truth of God. Some of you, my Hearers, hate the Truth of God.
   You say, "That is too severe. It is not true." I would not be untrue
   even with a good design, for I do not think we should tell a lie even
   to save a soul. But it is true, solemnly true. Now I will tell one part
   of the Truth as it is taught in Scripture--"Whatsoever a man sows, that
   shall he also reap." Well now, that teaches that if you continue to sow
   sin you will have to reap the result of it, and unless, through Divine
   Grace you are led to give up your right-eye sins and to cut oft your
   right-arm lusts, you will perish.

   Now this is a Truth of God which you hate. That man who comes here on
   Sundays and often has pangs of conscience, but is a drunkard still, a
   secret drunkard still--he hates this Truth. Where shall I find that
   other man who listens to the Word, yes, and often with tears, but he
   has his midnight crime when he thinks no man sees him, and even now,
   when I press harshly upon his vice, he likes it not. You that are here
   this morning listening to me, and this afternoon will be busy with your
   shops on God's own day, beware!

   And you, too, that so trade in business that you no more dare to show
   your books than you dare to look at the flames of Hell--you hate the
   Truth of God. I am sure you do. You abhor the doctrine that all this
   must be given up! You prove you do not like it, because you do not
   practice it. Some of you will even say--"Ah, the preacher is
   Puritanical-- he is too severe--he cuts too close." No! Here it is, you
   believe it not because it is the Truth of God.

   The Pharisees, my Friends, hated God's truth deliberately. I think I
   hear one of you say, "I do not do that. I may hate the Truth in the
   sense you have explained, in rejecting it, and going on in my sins, but
   I do not do it deliberately." Ah, but how long does it take to make an
   action deliberate? I have preached to some of you nine years now--nine
   years! And you are still what you were! Is not that deliberate? Some of
   you have heard the Gospel forty years, and you are unregen-erate
   still--and hate the Truth of God--and prove you do by living in sin! Is
   not that deliberate?

   And you, young Man, the other Sunday you were so impressed that you
   felt as if you must yield to God that very day. You stood on those
   steps under those pillars, and you said to your soul--"To be or not to
   be, that is the question. A companion met you and asked you--asked you
   before the impression had died away, to go with him to the haunt of
   sin. And you stood and poised it in the balance thus--which shall it
   be?

   And you did deliberately choose your own damnation when you chose sin.
   Take care, lest God shall say, "You have chosen your own delusions, and
   I will give you up unto them and that forever." I lay this charge with
   all the boldness of a Nathan at the door of some of you, that you have
   chosen deliberately to despise the Truth of God.

   But the Pharisees, you will tell me, scoffed at it. Yes, and I lay
   that, too, at the door of some of you. There may be here the regular
   scoffer, who mocks at everything sacred. With him I have little to do
   this morning. He shall measure out his iniquities and receive vengeance
   for them. But you who sit here Sunday after Sunday and hear appeals
   which you reject--have Christ preached to you and will not look at
   Him--have His sufferings set forth as we try to paint Him, dipping the
   pencil in His own blood and yet He is nothing to you--do you not
   despise Him?

   I do not know any contempt that is more sorrowful to the man that is
   smitten by it than the contempt of utter silence. Do we not say, "We
   pass you by in silent contempt?" Thus you treat my Lord! We have
   another expression--we say of some people that they are beneath our
   contempt, and some of you have not enough esteem for my Master to treat
   Him with open contempt. You think religion such a trifle, that it is
   not worth your sneering at it. You so despise it, that you think it is
   not worth your despising. Oh, is it so? Is it so? Then are you of your
   father, the devil, and you do his works! May God bring you out of that
   black family and translate you into the kingdom of His own dear Son.

   IV. Having spoken feebly, but yet desiring the Master to make what I
   have said mighty, I close by asking these questions:

   If these things are true, why do you not believe them? Is there
   anything to hinder you? Is the doctrine unreasonable? You say the Bible
   is true. Now the Bible contains many things which are harder to believe
   than that Jesus Christ died for the ungodly. If you can believe that
   Jonah was in the whale's belly. If you can believe all the marvelous
   miracles of Scripture, you cannot say that the doctrine of the Cross is
   unreasonable. To believe that Christ stood as a Substitute, and that
   through His substitution God can pardon sin, is no tax upon faith.

   Nor can you tell me that the precept is intolerable. "His yoke is easy
   and His burden is light." It is your sin that is intolerable, not the
   precept. He only bids you give up that which will ruin you. He only
   asks you to do that which will make you happy. But there is one answer
   you will give. You will tell me you cannot believe. How do you know you
   cannot?

   "Well," says one, "I cannot believe without the Spirit of God." That is
   true, but are you sure the Spirit of God is not with you? Let me ask
   you whether you can now trust Jesus Christ. This is what I am about to
   experiment upon.

   Jesus Christ, who took the sin of men, declares that whoever will trust
   Him to save them shall be saved. Now Christ is God, He is a mighty
   Savior. He has suffered as Man, therefore He has all that is necessary
   for the office. Do you think you can now trust Christ to save you? I
   think I hear one say, "Yes, I could trust such a Savior as that." Then
   you can do it, you see, and inasmuch as you can do it, the Spirit of
   God is with you. Do not expect to see the Spirit of God! He is a great
   mystery. You cannot know His operations except by their effects.

   Faith is the effect of His secret operation. If you can now believe in
   Christ, then doubtless the Spirit of God is with you, and I doubt not
   the Spirit of God is often with you when you know it not. If you can
   now believe, He is with you. Do I hear one say, "Well, I have often
   thought I could trust Christ, but I thought if I could do it then it
   was not the work of the Spirit of God, but the work of the creature."
   No, verily, Beloved, there is no such thing as a simple trust in Christ
   that comes of the creature. It is always the work of the Spirit of
   God--and if you can trust in Christ you need not question about the
   Spirit. The Spirit of God must be in you, or else your trust in Christ
   would never have been there.

   Only if now the thing seems right and reasonable to you, cast yourself
   on Jesus, and you are saved! I might multiply words, but I might not,
   perhaps, increase the force of the text, and therefore let me entreat
   you who stand to the Scriptures as being true, and yet deny their
   veracity by remaining unregenerate--let me entreat you to decide one
   way or the other. Do be consistent. "How long halt you between two
   opinions?" Say the Book is false, and then we shall know what you are,
   and where you stand, and you yourselves will, probably, begin to be
   alarmed at your position. Say the Book is false, and then you will be
   openly numbered with the disciples and slaves of Hell. And it may be
   your conscience will then begin to work.

   But, oh, if you are not prepared to take that side, if Baal is not God,
   and you will not serve him, then if God is God--and that is the only
   other conclusion--serve Him. I bring you to that awful place where the
   two roads meet--the right, the left--to Heaven, to Hell--to
   righteousness, to sin--to God, to fiends! There you stand. I am glad to
   have made you stand there. If it is a thing that needs consideration,
   consider. Put your hand to your brow, now, and turn this matter over.
   And I do trust that through the word which we have spoken to you, the
   Spirit of God will work on your conscience and on your heart and you
   will say, "For God! For Christ! For holiness! For everlasting life!"

   But mark you, I had sooner you would say, "For the devil. For sin. For
   Hell," than say nothing. For if you say nothing, you will go on and be
   as careless and as indifferent as ever. But if you make this last
   choice deliberately, it may be that then God will alarm your conscience
   and stir your soul, so that you may see your danger and may fly to
   Jesus.

   May He bless you, now, and guide your heart into the way of Truth. And
   to His name be glory forever. Amen.

                                   Gethsemane

   A Sermon

   (No. 493)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, February 8th, 1863, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as
   it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground."--Luke 22:44.

   FEW HAD FELLOWSHIP with the sorrows of Gethsemane. The majority of the
   disciples were not there. They were not sufficiently advanced in grace
   to be admitted to behold the mysteries of "the agony." Occupied with
   the Passover feast at their own houses, they represent the many who
   live upon the letter, but are mere babes and sucklings as to the spirit
   of the gospel. The walls of Gethsemane fitly typify that weakness in
   grace which effectually shuts in the deeper marvels of communion from
   the gaze of ordinary believers. To twelve, nay, to eleven only was the
   privilege given to enter Gethsemane and see this great sight. Out of
   the eleven, eight were left at some distance; they had fellowship, but
   not of that intimate sort to which the men greatly beloved are
   admitted. Only three highly favored ones, who had been with him on the
   mount of transfiguration, and had witnessed the life-giving miracle in
   the house of Jairus--only these three could approach the veil of his
   mysterious sorrow: within that veil even these must not intrude; a
   stone's-cast distance must be left between. He must tread the
   wine-press alone, and of the people there must be none with him. Peter
   and the two sons of Zebedee, represent the few eminent, experienced,
   grace-taught saints, who may be written down as "Fathers;" these having
   done business on great waters, can in some degree, measure the huge
   Atlantic waves of their Redeemer's passion; having been much alone with
   him, they can read his heart far better than those who merely see him
   amid the crowd. To some selected spirits it is given, for the good of
   others, and to strengthen them for some future, special, and tremendous
   conflict, to enter the inner circle and hear the pleadings of the
   suffering High priest; they have fellowship with him in his sufferings,
   and are made conformable unto his death. Yet I say, even these, the
   elect out of the elect, these choice and peculiar favourites among the
   kings courtiers, even these cannot penetrate the secret places of the
   Savior's woe, so as to comprehend all his agonies. "Thine unknown
   sufferings" is the remarkable expression of the Greek liturgy; for
   there is an inner chamber in his grief, shut out from human knowledge
   and fellowship. Was it not here that Christ was more than ever an
   "Unspeakable gift" to us? Is not Watts right when he sings--

   "And all the unknown joys he gives,

   Were bought with agonies unknown."

   Since it would not be possible for any believer, however experienced,
   to know for himself all that our Lord endured in the place of the
   olivepress, when he was crushed beneath the upper and the nether
   mill-stone of mental suffering and hellish malice, it is clearly far
   beyond the preacher's capacity to set it forth to you. Jesus himself
   must give you access to the wonders of Gethsemane: as for me, I can but
   invite you to enter the garden, bidding you put your shoes from off
   your feet, for the place whereon we stand is holy ground. I am neither
   Peter, nor James, nor John, but one who would fain like them drink of
   the Master's cup, and be baptized with his baptism. I have hitherto
   advanced only so far as yonder band of eight, but there I have listened
   to the deep groanings of the man of sorrows. Some of you, my venerable
   friends, may have learned far more than I; but you will not refuse to
   hear again the roarings of the many waters which strove to quench the
   love of the Great Husband of our souls.

   Several matters will require our brief consideration. Come Holy Spirit,
   breathe light into our thoughts, life into our words.

   I. Come hither and behold the SAVIOR'S UNUTTERABLE WOE.

   The emotions of that dolorous night are expressed by several words in
   Scripture. John describes him as saying four days before his passion,
   "Now is my soul troubled," as he marked the gathering clouds he hardly
   knew where to turn himself, and cried out "What shall I say?" Matthew
   writes of him, "he began to be sorrowful and very heavy." Upon the word
   ademonein translated "very heavy," Goodwin remarks that there was a
   distraction in the Savior's agony since the root of the word signifies
   "separated from the people--men in distraction, being separated from
   mankind." What a thought, my brethren, that our blessed Lord should be
   driven to the very verge of distraction by the intensity of his
   anguish. Matthew represents the Savior himself as saying "My soul is
   exceeding sorrowful, even unto death." Here the word Perilupos means
   encompassed, encircled, overwhelmed with grief. "He was plunged head
   and ears in sorrow and had no breathing-hole," is the strong expression
   of Goodwin. Sin leaves no cranny for comfort to enter, and therefore
   the sin-bearer must be entirely immersed in woe. Clark records that he
   began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy. In this case
   thambeisthai, with the prefix ek, shows extremity of amazement like
   that of Moses when he did exceedingly fear and quake. O blessed Savior,
   how can we bear to think of thee as a man astonished and alarmed! Yet
   was it even so when the terrors of God set themselves in array against
   thee. Luke uses the strong language of my text--"being in an agony."
   These expressions, each of them worthy to be the theme of a discourse,
   are quite sufficient to show that the grief of the Savior was of the
   most extraordinary character; well justifying the prophetic exclamation
   "Behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow which was
   done unto me." He stands before us peerless in misery. None are
   molested by the powers of evil as he was; as if the powers of hell had
   given commandment to their legions, "Fight neither with small nor
   great, save only with the king himself."

   Should we profess to understand all the sources of our Lord's agony,
   wisdom would rebuke us with the question "Hast thou entered into the
   springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in search of the depths?" We
   cannot do more than look at the revealed causes of grief. It partly
   arose from the horror of his soul when fully comprehending the meaning
   of sin. Brethren, when you were first convinced of sin and saw it as a
   thing exceeding sinful, though your perception of its sinfulness was
   but faint compared with its real heinousness, yet horror took hold upon
   you. Do you remember those sleepless nights? Like the Psalmist, you
   said "My bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long, for day
   and night thy hand was heavy upon me; my moisture is turned into the
   drought of summer." Some of us can remember when our souls chose
   strangling rather than life; when if the shadows of death could have
   covered us from the wrath of God we would have been too glad to sleep
   in the grave that we might not make our bed in hell. Our blessed Lord
   saw sin in its natural blackness. He had a most distinct perception of
   its treasonable assault upon his God, its murderous hatred to himself,
   and its destructive influence upon mankind. Well might horror take hold
   upon him, for a sight of sin must be far more hideous than a sight of
   hell, which is but its offspring.

   Another deep fountain of grief was found in the fact that Christ now
   assumed more fully his official position with regard to sin. He was now
   made sin. Hear the word! he, who knew no sin, was made sin for us, that
   we might be made the righteousness of God in him. In that night the
   words of Isaiah were fulfilled--"The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity
   of us all." Now he stood as the sin-bearer, the substitute accepted by
   Divine justice to bear that we might never bear the whole of wrath
   divine. At that hour heaven looked on him as standing in the sinner's
   stead, and treated as sinful man had richly deserved to be treated. Oh!
   dear friends, when the immaculate Lamb of God found himself in the
   place of the guilty, when he could not repudiate that place because he
   had voluntarily accepted it in order to save his chosen, what must his
   soul have felt, how must his perfect nature have been shocked at such
   close association with iniquity?

   We believe that at this time, our Lord had a very clear view of all the
   shame and suffering of his crucifixion. The agony was but one of the
   first drops of the tremendous shower which discharged itself upon his
   head. He foresaw the speedy coming of the traitor-disciple, the seizure
   by the officers, the mock-trials before the Sanhedrim, and Pilate, and
   Herod, the scourging and buffeting, the crown of thorns, the shame, the
   spitting. All these rose up before his mind, and, as it is a general
   law of our nature that the foresight of trial is more grievous than
   trial itself, we can conceive how it was that he who answered not a
   word when in the midst of the conflict, could not restrain himself from
   strong crying and tears in the prospect of it. Beloved friends, if you
   can revive before your mind's eye the terrible incidents of his death
   the hounding through the streets of Jerusalem, the nailing to the
   cross, the fever, the thirst, and, above all, forsaking of his God, you
   cannot marvel that he began to be very heavy, and was sore amazed.

   But possibly a yet more fruitful tree of bitterness was this--that now
   his Father began to withdraw his presence from him. The shadow of that
   great eclipse began to fall upon his spirit when he knelt in that cold
   midnight amidst the olives of Gethsemane. The sensible comforts which
   had cheered his spirit were taken away; that blessed application of
   promises which Christ Jesus needed as a man, was removed, all that we
   understand by the term "consolations of God" were hidden from his eyes.
   He was left single-handed in his weakness to contend for the
   deliverance of man. The Lord stood by as if he were an indifferent
   spectator, or rather, as if he were an adversary, he wounded him "with
   the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one."

   But in our judgment the fiercest heat of the Savior's suffering in the
   garden lay in the temptations of Satan. That hour above any time in his
   life, even beyond the forty days' conflict in the wilderness, was the
   time of his temptation. "This is your hour and the power of darkness."
   Now could he emphatically say, "The prince of this world cometh." This
   was his last hand-to-hand fight with all the hosts of hell, and here
   must he sweat great drops of blood before the victory can be achieved.

   We have glanced at the fountains of the great deep which were broken up
   when the floods of grief deluged the Redeemer's soul. Brethren, this
   one lesson ere we pass from the contemplation. "We have not an high
   priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but
   was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us
   therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain
   mercy, and find grace to help in time of need." Let us reflect that no
   suffering can be unknown to him. We do but run with footmen--he had to
   contend with horsemen; we do but wade up to our ankles in shallow
   streams of sorrow--he had to buffet with the swellings of Jordan. He
   will never fail to succor his people when tempted; even as it was said
   of old, "In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his
   presence saved them."

   II. Turn we next to contemplate THE TEMPTATION OF OUR LORD.

   At the outset of his career, the serpent began to nibble at the heel of
   the promised deliverer; and now as the time approached when the seed of
   the woman should bruise the serpent's head, that old dragon made a
   desperate attempt upon his great destroyer. It is not possible for us
   to lift the veil where revelation has permitted it to fall, but we can
   form some faint idea of the suggestions with which Satan tempted our
   Lord. Let us, however, remark by way of caution, before we attempt to
   paint this picture, that whatever Satan may have suggested to our Lord,
   his perfect nature did not in any degree whatever submit to it so as to
   sin. The temptations were, doubtless, of the very foulest character,
   but they left no speck or flaw upon him, who remained still the fairest
   among ten thousand. The prince of this world came, but he had nothing
   in Christ. He struck the sparks, but they did not fall, as in our case,
   upon dry tinder; they fell as into the sea, and were quenched at once.
   He hurled the fiery arrows, but they could not even scar the flesh of
   Christ; they smote upon the buckler of his perfectly righteous nature,
   and they fell off with their points broken, to the discomfiture of the
   adversary.

   But what, think you, were these temptations? It strikes me, from some
   hints given, that they were somewhat as follows--there was, first, a
   temptation to leave the work unfinished; we may gather this from the
   prayer--"If it be possible, let this cup pass from me." "Son of God,"
   the tempter said, "is it so? Art thou really called to bear the sin of
   man? Hath God said, I have laid help upon one that is mighty,' and art
   thou he, the chosen of God, to bear all this load? Look at thy
   weakness! Thou sweatest, even now, great drops of blood; surely thou
   art not he whom the Father hath ordained to be mighty to save; or if
   thou be, what wilt thou win by it? What will it avail thee? Thou hast
   glory enough already. See what miscreants they are for whom thou art to
   offer up thyself a sacrifice. Thy best friends are asleep about thee
   when most thou needest their comfort; thy treasurer, Judas, is
   hastening to betray thee for the price of a common slave. The world for
   which thou sacrificest thyself will cast out thy name as evil, and thy
   Church, for which thou dost pay the ransom-price, what is it worth? A
   company of mortals! Thy divinity could create the like any moment it
   pleaseth thee; why needest thou, then, pour out thy soul unto death?"
   Such arguments would Satan use; the hellish craft of one who had then
   been thousands of years tempting men, would know how to invent all
   manner of mischief. He would pour the hottest coals of hell upon the
   Savior. It was in struggling with this temptation, among others, that,
   being in an agony, our Savior prayed more earnestly.

   Scripture implies that our Lord was assailed by the fear that his
   strength would not be sufficient. He was heard in that he feared. How,
   then, was he heard? An angel was sent unto him strengthening him. His
   fear, then, was probably produced by a sense of weakness. I imagine
   that the foul fiend would whisper in his ear--"Thou! thou endure to be
   smitten of God and abhorred of men! Reproach hath broken thy heart
   already; how wilt thou bear to be publicly put to shame and driven
   without the city as an unclean thing? How wilt thou bear to see thy
   weeping kinsfolk and thy broken-hearted mother standing at the foot of
   thy cross? Thy tender and sensitive spirit will quail under it. As for
   thy body, it is already emaciated; thy long fastings have brought thee
   very low; thou wilt become a prey to death long ere thy work is done.
   Thou wilt surely fail. God hath forsaken thee. Now will they persecute
   and take thee; they will give up thy soul to the lion, and thy darling
   to the power of the dog." Then would he picture all the sufferings of
   crucifixion, and say, "Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be
   strong in the day when the Lord shall deal with thee?" The temptation
   of Satan was not directed against the Godhead, but the manhood of
   Christ, and therefore the fiend would probably dwell upon the
   feebleness of man. "Didst thou not say thyself, I am a worm and no man,
   the reproach of men and the despised of the people?' How wilt thou bear
   it when the wrath-clouds of God gather about thee? The tempest will
   surely shipwreck all thy hopes. It cannot be; thou canstnot drink of
   this cup, nor be baptized wiit this baptism." In this manner, we think,
   was our Master tried. But see he yields not to it. Being in an agony,
   which word means in a wrest ring, he struggles with the tempter like
   Jacob with the angel. "Nay," saith he, "I will not be subdued by taunts
   of my weakness; I am strong in the strength of my Godhead, I will
   overcome thee yet." Yet was the temptation so awful, that, in order to
   master it, his mental depression caused him to "sweat as it were great
   drops of blood falling down to the ground."

   Possibly, also, the temptation may have arisen from a suggestion that
   he was utterly forsaken. I do not know--there may be sterner trials
   than this, but surely this is one of the worst, to be utterly forsaken.
   "See," said Satan, as he hissed it out between his teeth--"see, thou
   hast a friend nowhere! Look up to heaven, thy Father hath shut up the
   bowels of his compassion against thee. Not an angel in thy Father's
   courts will stretch out his hand to help thee. Look thou yonder, not
   one of those spirits who honored thy birth will interfere to protect
   thy life. All heaven is false to thee; thou art left alone. And as for
   earth, do not all men thirst for thy blood? Will not the Jew be
   gratified to see thy flesh torn with nails, and will not the Roman
   gloat himself when thou, the King of the Jews, art fastened to the
   cross? Thou hast no friend among the nations; the high and mighty scoff
   at thee, and the poor thrust out their tongues in derision. Thou hadst
   not where to lay thy head when thou wast in thy best estate; thou hast
   no place now where shelter will be given thee. See the companions with
   whom thou hast taken sweet counsel, what are they worth? Son of Mary,
   see there thy brother James, see there thy loved disciple John, and thy
   bold Apostle Peter--they sleep, they sleep; and yonder eight, how the
   cowards sleep when thou art in thy sufferings! And where are the four
   hundred others? They have forgotten thee; they will be at their farms
   and their merchandize by morning. Lo! thou hast no friend left in
   heaven or earth. All hell is against thee. I have stirred up mine
   infernal den. I have sent my missives throughout all regions summoning
   every prince of darkness to set upon thee this night, and we will spare
   no arrows, we will use all our infernal might to overwhelm thee; and
   what wilt thou do, thou solitary one?" It may be, this was the
   temptation; I think it was, because the appearance of an angel unto him
   strengthening him removed that fear. He was heard in that he feared; he
   was no more alone, but heaven was with him. It may be that this is the
   reason of his coming three times to his disciples--as Hart puts it--

   "Backwards and forwards thrice he ran

   As if he sought some help from man."

   He would see for himself whether it was really true that all men had
   forsaken him; he found them all asleep; but perhaps he gained some
   faint comfort from the thought that they were sleeping, not from
   treachery, but from sorrow, the spirit indeed was willing, but the
   flesh was weak.

   We think Satan also assaulted our Lord with a bitter taunt indeed. You
   know in what guise the tempter can dress it, and how bitterly sarcastic
   he can make the insinuation--"Ah! thou wilt not be able to achieve the
   redemption of thy people. Thy grand benevolence will prove a mockery,
   and thy beloved ones will perish. Thou shalt not prevail to save them
   from my grasp. Thy scattered sheep shall surely be my prey. Son of
   David, I am a match for thee; thou canst not deliver out of my hand.
   Many of thy chosen have entered heaven on the strength of thine
   atonement, but I will drag them thence, and quench the stars of glory;
   I will thin the courts of heaven of the choristers of God, for thou
   wilt not fulfill thy suretyship; thou canst not do it. Thou art not
   able to bring up all this great people; they will perish yet. See, are
   not the sheep scattered now that the Shepherd is smitten? They will all
   forget thee. Thou wilt never see of the travail of thy soul. Thy
   desired end will never be reached. Thou wilt be for ever the man that
   began to build but was not able to finish." Perhaps this is more truly
   the reason why Christ went three times to look at his disciples. You
   have seen a mother; she is very faint, weary with a heavy sickness, but
   she labors under a sore dread that her child will die. She has started
   from her couch, upon which disease had thrown her, to snatch a moment's
   rest. She gazes anxiously upon her child. She marks the faintest sign
   of recovery. But she is sore sick herself, and cannot remain more than
   an instant from her own bed. She cannot sleep, she tosses painfully,
   for her thoughts wander; she rises to gaze again--"How art thou, my
   child, how art thou? Are those palpitations of thy heart less violent?
   Is thy pulse more gentle? "But, alas! she is faint, and she must go to
   her bed again, yet she can get no rest. She will return again and again
   to watch the loved one. So, methinks, Christ looked upon Peter, and
   James, and John, as much as to say, "No, they are not all lost yet;
   there are three left," and, looking upon them as the type of all the
   Church, he seemed to say--"No, no; I will overcome; I will get the
   mastery; I will struggle even unto blood; I will pay the ransom-price,
   and deliver my darlings from their foe."

   Now these, methinks, were his temptations. If you can form a fuller
   idea of what they were than this, then right happy shall I be. With
   this one lesson I leave the point--"Pray that ye enter not into
   temptation." This is Christ's own expression; his own deduction from
   his trial. You have all read, dear friends, John Bunyan's picture of
   Christian fighting, with Apollyon. That master-painter has sketched it
   to the very life. He says, though "this sore combat lasted for above
   half a day, even till Christian was almost quite spent, I never saw him
   all the while give so much as one pleasant look, till he perceived he
   had wounded Apollyon with his two-edged sword; then indeed, he did
   smile and look upward! But it was the dreadfullest sight I ever saw."
   That is the meaning of that prayer, "Lead us not into temptation." Oh
   you that go recklessly where you are tempted, you that pray for
   afflictions--and I have known some silly enough to do that--you that
   put yourselves where you tempt the devil to tempt you, take heed from
   the Master's own example. He sweats great drops of blood when he is
   tempted. Oh! pray God to spare you such trial. Pray this morning and
   every day, "Lead me not into temptation."

   III. Behold, dear brethren, THE BLOODY SWEAT.

   We read, that "he sweat as it were great drops of blood." Hence a few
   writers have supposed that the sweat was not actually blood, but had
   the appearance of it. That interpretation, however, has been rejected
   by most commentators, from Augustine downward, and it is generally held
   that the words "as it were" do not only set forth likeness to blood,
   but signify that it was actually and literally blood. We find the same
   idiom used in the text--"We beheld his glory, the glory as of the
   only-begotten of the Father." Now, clearly, this does not mean that
   Christ was like the only-begotten of the Father, since he is really so.
   So that generally this expression of Holy Scripture sets forth, not a
   mere likeness to a thing, but the very thing itself. We believe, then,
   that Christ did really sweat blood. This phenomenon, though somewhat
   unusual, has been witnessed in other persons. There are several cases
   on record, some in the old medicine books of Galen, and others of more
   recent date, of persons who after long weakness, under fear of death
   have sweat blood. But this case is altogether one by itself for several
   reasons. If you will notice, he not only sweat blood, but it was in
   great drops; the blood coagulated, and formed large masses. I cannot
   better express what is meant than by the word "gouts"--big, heavy
   drops. This has not been seen in any case. Some slight effusions of
   blood have been known in cases of persons who were previously
   enfeebled, but great drops never. When it is said "falling to the
   ground"--it shows their copiousness, so that they not only stood upon
   the surface and were sucked up by his garments till he became like the
   red heifer which was slaughtered on that very spot, but the drops fell
   to the ground. Here he stands unrivalled. He was a man in good health,
   only about thirty years of age, and was laboring under no fear of
   death; but the mental pressure arising from his struggle with
   temptation, and the straining of all his strength, in order to baffle
   the temptation of Satan, so forced his frame to an unnatural
   excitement, that his pores sent forth great drops of blood which fell
   down to the ground. This proves how tremendous must have been the
   weight of sin when it was able so to crush the Savior that he distilled
   drops of blood! This proves too, my brethren, the mighty power of his
   love. It is a very pretty observation of old Isaac Ambrose that the gum
   which exudes from the tree without cutting is always the best. This
   precious camphire-tree yielded most sweet spices when it was wounded
   under the knotty whips, and when it was pierced by the nails on the
   cross; but see, it giveth forth its best spice when there is no whip,
   no nail, no wound. This sets forth the voluntariness of Christ's
   sufferings, since without a lance the blood flowed freely. No need to
   put on the leech, or apply the knife; it flows spontaneously. No need
   for the rulers to cry "Spring up, O well;" of itself it flows in
   crimson torrents. Dearly beloved friends, if men suffer some frightful
   pain of mind--I am not acquainted with the medical matter--apparently
   the blood rushes to the heart. The cheeks are pale; a fainting fit
   comes on; the blood has gone inward, as if to nourish the inner man
   while passing through its trial. But see our Savior in his agony; he is
   so utterly oblivious of self, that instead of his agony driving his
   blood to the heart to nourish himself, it drives it outward to bedew
   the earth. The agony of Christ, inasmuch as it pours him out upon the
   ground, pictures the fullness of the offering which he made for men.

   Do you not perceive, my brethren, how intense must have been the
   wrestling through which he passed, and will you not hear its voice to
   you?--"Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin." It
   has been the lot of some of us to have sore temptations--else we did
   not know how to teach others--so sore that in wrestling against them
   the cold, clammy sweat has stood upon our brow. The place will never be
   forgotten by me--a lonely spot; where, musing upon my God, an awful
   rush of blasphemy went over my soul, till I would have preferred death
   to the trial; and I fell on my knees there and then, for the agony was
   awful, while my hand was at my mouth to keep the blasphemies from being
   spoken. Once let Satan be permitted really to try you with a temptation
   to blasphemy, and you will never forget it, though you live till your
   hairs are blanched; or let him attack you with some lust, and though
   you hate and loathe the very thought of it, and would lose your right
   arm sooner than indulge in it, yet it will come, and hunt, and
   persecute, and torment you. Wrestle against it even unto sweat, my
   brethren, yea, even unto blood. None of you should say, "I could not
   help it; I was tempted." Resist till you sweat blood rather than sin.
   Do not say, "I was so pressed with it; and it so suited my natural
   temperament, that I could not help falling into it." Look at the great
   Apostle and High Priest of your profession, and sweat even to blood
   rather than yield to the great tempter of your souls. Pray that ye
   enter not into temptation, so that when ye enter into it ye may with
   confidence say, "Lord, I did not seek this, therefore help me through
   with it, for thy name's sake."

   IV. I want you, in the fourth place, to notice THE SAVIOR'S PRAYER.

   Dear friends, when we are tempted and desire to overcome, the best
   weapon is prayer. When you cannot use the sword and the shield, take to
   yourself the famous weapon of All-prayer. So your Savior did. Let us
   notice his prayer. It was lonely prayer. He withdrew even from his
   three best friends about a stone's cast. Believer, especially in
   temptation, be much in solitary prayer. As private prayer is the key to
   open heaven, so is it the key to shut the gates of hell. As it is a
   shield to prevent, so is it the sword with which to fight against
   temptation. Family-prayer, social prayer, prayer in the Church, will
   not suffice, these are very precious, but the best beaten spice will
   smoke in your censer in your private devotions, where no ear hears but
   God. Betake yourselves to solitude if you would overcome.

   Mark, too, it was humble prayer. Luke says he knelt, but another
   evangelist says he fell on his face. What! does the King fall on his
   face? Where, then, must be thy place, thou humble servant of the great
   Master? Doth the Prince fall flat to the ground? Where, then, wilt thou
   lie? What dust and ashes shall cover thy head? What sackcloth shall
   gird thy loins? Humility gives us good foot-hold in prayer. There is no
   hope of any real prevalence with God, who casteth down the proud,
   unless we abase ourselves that he may exalt us in due time.

   Further, it was filial prayer. Matthew describes him as saying "O my
   Father," and Mark puts it, "Abba, Father." You will find this always a
   stronghold in the day of trial to plead your adoption. Hence that
   prayer, in which it is written, "Lead us not into temptation, but
   deliver us from evil," begins with "Our Father which art in heaven."
   Plead as a child. You have no rights as a subject; you have forfeited
   them by your treason, but nothing can forfeit a child's right to a
   father's protection. Be not then ashamed to say, "My Father, hear my
   cry."

   Again, observe that it was persevering prayer. He prayed three times,
   using the same words. Be not content until you prevail. Be as the
   importunate widow, whose continual coming earned what her first
   supplication could not win. Continue in prayer, and watch in the same
   with thanksgiving.

   Further, see how it glowed to a red-hot heat--it was earnest prayer.
   "He prayed more earnestly." What groans were those which were uttered
   by Christ! What tears, which welled up from the deep fountains of his
   nature! Make earnest supplication if you would prevail against the
   adversary.

   And last, it was the prayer of resignation. "Nevertheless, not as I
   will, but as thou wilt." Yield, and God yields. Let it be as God wills,
   and God will will it that it shall be for the best. Be thou perfectly
   content to leave the result of thy prayer in his hands, who knows when
   to give, and how to give, and what to give, and what to withhold. So
   pleading, earnestly, importunately, yet mingling with it humility and
   resignation, thou shalt yet prevail.

   Dear friends, we must conclude, turn to the last point with this as a
   practical lesson--"Rise and pray." When the disciples were lying down
   they slept; sitting was the posture that was congenial to sleep. Rise;
   shake yourselves; stand up in the name of God; rise and pray. And if
   you are in temptation, be you more than ever you were in your life
   before, instant, passionate, importunate with God that he would deliver
   you in the day of your conflict.

   V. As time has failed us we close with the last point, which is, THE
   SAVIOR'S PREVALENCE.

   The cloud has passed away. Christ has knelt, and the prayer is over.
   "But," says one, "did Christ prevail in prayer?" Beloved, could we have
   any hope that he would prevail in heaven if he had not prevailed on
   earth? Should we not have had a suspicion that if his strong crying and
   tears had not been heard then, he would fail now? His prayers did
   speed, and therefore he is a good intercessor for us. "How was he
   heard?" The answer shall be given very briefly indeed. He was heard, I
   think, in three respects. The first gracious answer that was given him
   was, that his mind was suddenly rendered calm. What a difference there
   is between "My soul is exceeding sorrowful,"--his hurrying too and fro,
   his repetition of the prayer three times, the singular agitation that
   was upon him--what a contrast between all these and his going forth to
   meet the traitor with "Betrayest thou the Son of Man with a kiss?" Like
   a troubled sea before, and now as calm as when he himself said, "Peace
   be still," and the waves were quiet. You cannot know a profounder peace
   than that which reigned in the Savior when before Pilate he answered
   him not a word. He is calm to the last, as calm as though it were his
   day of triumph rather than his day of trouble. Now I think this was
   vouchsafed to him in answer to his prayer. He had sufferings perhaps
   more intense, but his mind was now quieted so as to meet them with
   greater deliberation. Like some men, who when they first hear the
   firing of the shots in a battle are all trepidation, but as the fight
   grows hotter and they are in greater danger, they are cool and
   collected; they are wounded, they are bleeding, they are dying; yet are
   they quiet as a summer's eve; the first young flush of trouble is gone,
   and they can meet the foe with peace--so the Father heard the Savior's
   cry, and breathed such a profound peace into his soul, that it was like
   a river, and his righteousness like the waves of the sea.

   Next, we believe that he was answered by God strengthening him through
   an angel. How that was done we do not know. Probably it was by what the
   angel said, and equally likely is it that it was by what he did. The
   angel may have whispered the promises; pictured before his mind's eye
   the glory of his success; sketched his resurrection; pourtrayed the
   scene when his angels would bring his chariots from on high to bear him
   to his throne; revived before him the recollection of the time of his
   advent, the prospect when he should reign from sea to sea, and from the
   river even to the ends of the earth; and so have made him strong. Or,
   perhaps, by some unknown method God sent such power to our Christ, who
   had been like Samson with his locks shorn, that he suddenly received
   all the might and majestic energy that were needed for the terrific
   struggle. Then he walked out of the garden no more a worm and no man,
   but made strong with an invisible might that made him a match for all
   the armies that were round about him. A troop had overcome him, like
   Gad of old, but he overcame at last. Now he can dash through a troop;
   now he can leap over a wall. God has sent by his angel force from on
   high, and made the man Christ strong for battle and for victory.

   And I think we may conclude with saying, that God heard him in granting
   him now, not simply strength, but a real victory over Satan. I do not
   know whether what Adam Clarke supposes is correct, that in the garden
   Christ did pay more of the price than he did even on the cross; but I
   am quite convinced that they are very foolish who get to such
   refinement that they think the atonement was made on the cross, and
   nowhere else at all. We believe that it was made in the garden as well
   as on the cross; and it strikes me that in the garden one part of
   Christ's work was finished, wholly finished, and that was his conflict
   with Satan. I conceive that Christ had now rather to bear the absence
   of his Father's presence and the revilings of the people and the sons
   of men, than the temptations of the devil. I do think that these were
   over when he rose from his knees in prayer, when he lifted himself from
   the ground where he marked his visage in the clay in drops of blood.
   The temptation of Satan was then over, and he might have said
   concerning that part of the work--"It is finished; broken is the
   dragon's head; I have overcome him." Perhaps in those few hours that
   Christ spent in the garden the whole energy of the agents of iniquity
   was concentrated and dissipated. Perhaps in that one conflict all that
   craft could invent, all that malice could devise, all that infernal
   practice could suggest, was tried on Christ, the devil having his chain
   loosened for that purpose, having Christ given up to him, as Job was,
   that he might touch him in his bones and in his flesh, yea, touch him
   in his heart and his soul, and vex him in his spirit. It may be that
   every devil in hell and every fiend of the pit was summoned, each to
   vent his own spite and to pour their united energy and malice upon the
   head of Christ. And there he stood, and he could have said as he stood
   up to meet the next adversary--a devil in the form of man--Judas--"I
   come this day from Bozrah, with garments dyed red from Edom; I have
   trampled on my enemies, and overcome them once for all; now go I to
   bear man's sin and my Father's wrath, and to finish the work which he
   has given me to do." If this be so, Christ was then heard in that he
   feared; he feared the temptation of Satan, and he was delivered from
   it; he feared his own weakness, and he was strengthened; he feared his
   own trepidation of mind, and he was made calm.

   What shall we say, then, in conclusion, but this lesson. Does it not
   say "Whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall have." Then
   if your temptations reach the most tremendous height and force, still
   lay hold of God in prayer and you shall prevail. Convinced sinner! that
   is a comfort for you. Troubled saint! that is a joy for you. To one and
   all of us is this lesson of this morning--"Pray that ye enter not into
   temptation." If in temptation let us ask that Christ may pray for us
   that our faith fail not, and when we have passed through the trouble
   let us try to strengthen our brethren, even as Christ has strengthened
   us this day."

                                  The Betrayal

   A Sermon

   (No. 494)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, February 15th, 1863, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called
   Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to
   kiss him. But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man
   with a kiss?"--Luke 22:47, 48.

   WHEN SATAN HAD BEEN ENTIRELY worsted in his conflict with Christ in the
   garden, the man-devil Judas came upon the scene. As the Parthian in his
   flight turns round to shoot the fatal arrow, so the arch-enemy aimed
   another shaft at the Redeemer, by employing the traitor into whom he
   had entered. Judas became the devil's deputy, and a most trusty and
   serviceable tool he was. The Evil One had taken entire possession of
   the apostate's heart, and, like the swine possessed of devils, he ran
   violently downwards towards destruction. Well had infernal malice
   selected the Savior's trusted friend to be his treacherous betrayer,
   for thus he stabbed at the very center of his broken and bleeding
   heart. But, beloved, as in all things God is wiser than Satan, and the
   Lord of goodness outwitteth the Prince of Evil, so, in this dastardly
   betrayal of Christ, prophecy was fulfilled, and Christ was the more
   surely declared to be the promised Messiah. Was not Joseph a type? and,
   lo! like that envied youth, Jesus was sold by his own brethren. Was he
   not to be another Samson, by whose strength the gates of hell should be
   torn from their posts? lo! like Samson, he is bound by his countrymen,
   and delivered to the adversary. Know ye not that he was the anti-type
   of David? and was not David deserted by Ahithophel, his own familiar
   friend and counsellor? Nay, brethren, do not the words of the Psalmist
   receive a literal fulfillment in our Master's betrayal? What prophecy
   can be more exactly true than the language of the forty-first and
   fifty-fifth Psalms? In the first we read, "Yea, mine own familiar
   friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up
   his heel against me;" and in the fifty-fifth the Psalmist is yet more
   clear; "For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have
   borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself
   against me; then I would have hid myself from him: but it was thou, a
   man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance. We took sweet counsel
   together, and walked unto the house of God in company. He hath put
   forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken
   his covenant. The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war
   was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn
   swords." Even an obscure passage in one of the lesser prophets, must
   have a literal fulfillment, and for thirty pieces of silver, the price
   of a base slave, must the Savior be betrayed by his choice friend. Ah!
   thou foul fiend, thou shalt find at the last that thy wisdom is but
   intensified folly; as for the deep plots and plans of thy craft, the
   Lord shall laugh them to scorn; after all, thou art but the unconscious
   drudge of him whom thou abhorrest; in all the black work thou doest so
   greedily, thou art no better than a mean scullion in the royal kitchen
   of the King of kings.

   Without further preface, let us advance to the subject of our Lord's
   betrayal. First, concentrate your thoughts upon Jesus, the betrayed
   one; and when ye have lingered awhile there, solemnly gaze into the
   villanous countenance of Judas, the betrayer--he may prove a beacon to
   warn us against the sin which gendereth apostacy.

   I. LET US TARRY AWHILE, AND SEE OUR LORD UNGRATEFULLY AND DASTARDLY
   BETRAYED.

   It is appointed that he must die, but how shall he fall into the hands
   of his adversaries? Shall they capture him in conflict? It must not be,
   lest he appear an unwilling victim. Shall he flee before his foes until
   he can hide no longer? It is not meet that a sacrifice should be hunted
   to death. Shall he offer himself to the foe? That were to excuse his
   murderers, or be a party to their crime. Shall he be taken accidentally
   or unawares? That would withdraw from his cup the necessary bitterness
   which made it wormwood mingled with gall. No; he must be betrayed by
   his friend, that he may bear the utmost depths of suffering, and that
   in every separate circumstance there may be a well of grief. One reason
   for the appointment of the betrayal, lay in the fact that it was
   ordained that man's sin should reach its culminating point in his
   death. God, the great owner of the vineyard, had sent many servants,
   and the husbandmen had stoned one and cast out another; last of all, he
   said, "I will send my Son; surely they will reverence my Son." When
   they slew the heir to win the inheritance, their rebellion had reached
   its height. The murder of our blessed Lord was the extreme of human
   guilt; it developed the deadly hatred against God which lurks in the
   heart of man. When man became a deicide, sin had reached its fullness;
   and in the black deed of the man by whom the Lord was betrayed, that
   fullness was all displayed. If it had not been for a Judas, we had not
   known how black, how foul, human nature may become. I scorn the men who
   try to apologize for the treachery of this devil in human form, this
   son of perdition, this foul apostate. I should think myself a villain
   if I tried to screen him, and I shudder for the men who dare extenuate
   his crimes. My brethren, we should feel a deep detestation of this
   master of infamy; he has gone to his own place, and the anathema of
   David, part of which was quoted by Peter, has come upon him, "When he
   shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.
   Let his days be few; and let another take his office." Surely, as the
   devil was allowed unusually to torment the bodies of men, even so was
   he let loose to get possession of Judas as he has seldom gained
   possession of any other man, that we might see how foul, how
   desperately evil is the human heart. Beyond a doubt, however, the main
   reason for this was that Christ might offer a perfect atonement for
   sin. We may usually read the sin in the punishment. Man betrayed his
   God. Man had the custody of the royal garden, and should have kept its
   green avenues sacred for communion with his God; but he betrayed the
   trust; the sentinel was false; he admitted evil into his own heart, and
   so into the paradise of God. He was false to the good name of the
   Creator, tolerating the insinuation which he should have repelled with
   scorn. Therefore must Jesus find man a traitor to him. There must be
   the counterpart of the sin in the suffering which he endured. You and I
   have often betrayed Christ. We have, when tempted, chosen the evil and
   forsaken the good; we have taken the bribes of hell, and have not
   followed closely with Jesus. It seemed most fitting, then, that he who
   bore the chastisement of sin should be reminded of its ingratitude and
   treachery by the things which he suffered. Besides, brethren, that cup
   must be bitter to the last degree which is to be the equivalent for the
   wrath of God. There must be nothing consolatory in it; pains must be
   taken to pour into it all that even Divine wisdom can invent of awful
   and unheard of woe, and this one point--"He that eateth bread with me
   hath lifted up his heel against me," was absolutely necessary to
   intensify the bitterness. Moreover, we feel persuaded that by thus
   suffering at the hand of a traitor the Lord became a faithful High
   Priest, able to sympathize with us when we fall under the like
   affliction. Since slander and ingratitude are common calamities, we can
   come to Jesus with lull assurance of faith; he knows these sore
   temptations, for he has felt them in their very worst degree. We may
   cast every care, and every sorrow upon him, for he careth for us,
   having suffered with us. Thus, then, in our Lord's betrayal, Scripture
   was fulfilled, sin was developed, atonement was completed, and the
   great all-suffering High Priest became able to sympathize with us in
   every point.

   Now let us look at the treason itself. You perceive how black it was.
   Judas was Christ's servant, what if I call him his confidential
   servant. He was a partaker in apostolic ministry and the honor of
   miraculous gifts. He had been most kindly and indulgently treated. He
   was a sharer in all the goods of his Master, in fact he fared far
   better than his Lord, for the Man of Sorrows always took the lion's
   share of all the pains of poverty and the reproach of slander. He had
   food and raiment given him out of the common stock, and the Master
   seems to have indulged him very greatly. The old tradition is, that
   next to the apostle Peter he was the one with whom the Savior most
   commonly associated. We think there must be a mistake there, for surely
   John was the Savior's greatest friend; but Judas, as a servant had been
   treated with the utmost confidence. Ye know, brethren, how sore is that
   blow which comes from a servant in whom we have put unlimited trust.
   But Judas was more than this: he was a friend, a trusted friend. That
   little bag into which generous women cast their small contributions had
   been put into his hands, and very wisely too, for he had the financial
   vein. His main virtue was economy, a very needful quality in a
   treasurer. As exercising a prudent foresight for the little company,
   and watching the expenses carefully, he was, as far as men could judge,
   the right man in the right place. He had been thoroughly trusted. I
   read not that there was any annual audit of his accounts; I do not
   discover that the Master took him to task as to the expenditure of his
   privy purse. Everything was given to him, and he gave, at the Master's
   direction, to the poor, but no account was asked. This is vile indeed,
   to be chosen to such a position, to be installed purse-bearer to the
   Ring of kings, Chancellor of God's exchequer, and then to turn aside
   and sell the Savior; this is treason in its uttermost degree. Remember
   that the world looked upon Judas as colleague and partner with our
   Lord. To a great extent the name of Judas was associated with that of
   Christ. When Peter, James, or John had done anything amiss, reproachful
   tongues threw it all on their Master. The twelve were part and parcel
   of Jesus of Nazareth. One old commentator says of Judas--"He was
   Christ's alter ego"--to the people at large there was an
   indentification of each apostle with the leader of the band. And oh!
   when such associations have been established, and then there is
   treachery, it is as though our arm should commit treason against our
   head, or as if our foot should desert the body. This was a stab indeed!
   Perhaps, dear brethren, our Lord saw in the person of Judas a
   representative man, the portraiture of the many thousands who in after
   ages imitated his crime. Did Jesus see in Iscariot all the Judases who
   betray truth, virtue, and the cross? Did he perceive the multitudes of
   whom we may say, that they were, spiritually, in the loins of Judas?
   Hymeneus, Alexander, Hermogenes, Philetus, Demas, and others of that
   tribe, were all before him as he saw the man, his equal, his
   acquaintance, bartering him away for thirty pieces of silver.

   Dear friends, the position of Judas must have tended greatly to
   aggravate his treason. Even the heathens have taught us that
   ingratitude is the worst of vices. When Caesar was stabbed by his
   friend Brutus, the world's poet writes--

   "This was the most unkindest cut of all;

   For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,

   Ingratitude, more strong than traitor's arms,

   Quite vanquish'd him; then burst his mighty heart;

   And, in his mantle muffling up his face,

   Even at the base of Pompey's statua,

   _________________________great Caesar fell."

   Many ancient stories, both Greek and Roman, we might quote to show the
   abhorrence which the heathens entertain towards ingratitude and
   treachery. Certain, also, of their own poets, such, for instance, as
   Sophocles, have poured out burning words upon deceitful friends; but we
   have no time to prove what you will all admit, that nothing can be more
   cruel, nothing more full of anguish, than to be sold to destruction by
   one's bosom friend. The closer the foeman comes the deeper will be the
   stab he gives; if we admit him to our heart, and give him our closest
   intimacy, then can he wound us in the most vital part.

   Let us notice, dear friends, while we look at the breaking heart of our
   agonizing Savior, the manner in which he met this affliction. He had
   been much in prayer; prayer had overcome his dreadful agitation; he was
   very calm; and we need to be very calm when we are forsaken by a
   friend. Observe his gentleness. The first word he spake to Judas, when
   the traitor had polluted his cheek with a kiss, was this--"FRIEND!"
   FRIEND!! Note that! Not "Thou hateful miscreant," but "Friend,
   wherefore art thou come?" not "Wretch, wherefore dost thou dare to
   stain my cheek with thy foul and lying lips?" no, "Friend, wherefore
   art thou come?" Ah! if there had been anything good left in Judas, this
   would have brought it out. If he had not been an unmitigated,
   incorrigible, thrice-dyed traitor, his avarice must have lost its power
   at that instant, and he would have cried--"My master! I came to betray
   thee, but that generous word has won my soul; here, if thou must be
   bound, I will be bound with thee; I make a full confession of my
   infamy!" Our Lord added these words--there is reproof in them, but
   notice how kind they are still, how much too good for such a
   caitiff--"Judas, betrayest thou the Son of Man with a kiss?" I can
   conceive that the tears gushed from his eyes, and that his voice
   faltered, when he thus addressed his own familiar friend and
   acquaintance--"Betrayest thou," my Judas, my treasurer, "betrayest thou
   the Son of Man," thy suffering, sorrowing friend, whom thou hast seen
   naked and poor, and without a place whereon to lay his head. Betrayest
   thou the Son of Man--and dost thou prostitute the fondest of all
   endearing signs--a kiss--that which should be a symbol of loyalty to
   the King, shall it be the badge of thy treachery--that which was
   reserved for affection as her best symbol--dost thou make it the
   instrument of my destruction? Betrayest thou the Son of Man with a
   kiss?" Oh! if he had not been given up to hardness of heart, if the
   Holy Ghost had not utterly left him, surely this son of perdition would
   have fallen prostrate yet again, and weeping out his very soul, would
   have cried--"No, I cannot betray thee, thou suffering Son of man;
   forgive, forgive; spare thyself; escape from this bloodthirsty crew,
   and pardon thy treacherous disciple!" But no, no word of compunction,
   while the silver is at stake! Afterwards came the sorrow that worketh
   death, which drove him, like Ahithophel, his prototype, to court the
   gallows to escape remorse. This, also, must have aggravated the woe of
   our beloved Lord, when he saw the final impenitence of the traitor, and
   read the tearful doom of that man of whom he had once said, it would be
   better for him that he had never been born.

   Beloved, I would have you fix your eyes on your Lord in your quiet
   meditations as being thus despised and rejected of men, a man of
   sorrows and acquainted with grief; and gird up the loins of your minds,
   counting it no strange thing if this fiery trial should come upon you,
   but being determined that though your Lord should be betrayed by his
   most eminent disciples, yet, through his grace you will cling to him in
   shame and in suffering, and will follow him, if needs be, even unto
   death. God give us grace to see the vision of his nailed hands and
   feet, and remembering that all this came from the treachery of a
   friend, let us be very jealous of ourselves, lest we crucify the Lord
   afresh and put him to an open shame by betraying him in our conduct, or
   in our words, or in our thoughts.

   II. Grant me your attention while we make an estimate of the man by
   whom the Son of man was betrayed--JUDAS THE BETRAYER.

   I would call your attention, dear friends, to his position and public
   character. Judas was a preacher; nay, he was a foremost preacher, "he
   obtained part of this ministry," said the Apostle Peter. He was not
   simply one of the seventy; he had been selected by the Lord himself as
   one of the twelve, an honorable member of the college of the apostles.
   Doubtless he had preached the gospel so that many had been gladdened by
   his voice, and miraculous powers had been vouchsafed to him, so that at
   his word the sick had been healed, deaf ears had been opened; and the
   blind had been made to see; nay, there is no doubt that he who could
   not keep the devil out of himself, had cast devils out of others. Yet
   how art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! He that
   was as a prophet in the midst of the people, and spake with the tongue
   of the learned, whose word and wonders proved that he had been with
   Jesus and had learned of him--he betrays his Master. Understand, my
   brethren, that no gifts can ensure grace, and that no position of honor
   or usefulness in the Church will necessarily prove our being true to
   our Lord and Master. Doubtless there are bishops in hell, and crowds of
   those who once occupied the pulpit are now condemed for ever to bewail
   their hyprocrisy. You that are Church-officers, do not conclude that
   because you enjoy the confidence of the Church, that therefore of an
   absolute certainty the grace of God is in you. Perhaps it is the most
   dangerous of all positions for a man to become well known and much
   respected by the religious world, and yet to be rotten at the core. To
   be where others can observe our faults is a healthy thing though
   painful; but to live with beloved friends who would not believe it
   possible for us to do wrong, and who if they saw us err would make
   excuses for us--this is to be where it is next to impossible for us
   ever to be aroused if our hearts be not right with God. To have a fair
   reputation and a false heart is to stand upon the brink of hell.

   Judas took a very high degree officially. He had the distinguished
   honor of being entrusted with the Master's financial concerns, and
   this, after all, was no small degree to which to attain. The Lord, who
   knows how to use all sorts of gifts, perceived what gift the man had.
   He knew that Peter's unthinking impetuosity would soon empty the bag
   and leave the company in great straits, and if he had entrusted it to
   John, his loving spirit might have been cajoled into unwise benevolence
   towards beggars of unctious tongue; he might even have spent the little
   moneys in buying alabaster boxes whose precious ointments should anoint
   the Master's head. He gave the bag to Judas, and it was discreetly,
   prudently, and properly used; there is no doubt he was the most
   judicious person, and fitted to occupy the post. But oh! dear friends,
   if the Master shall choose any of us who are ministers or
   Church-officers, and give us a very distinguished position; if our
   place in the ranks shall be that of commanding officers, so that even
   our brother ministers look up with esteem, and our fellow-elders or
   deacons regard us as being fathers in Israel--oh! if we turn, if we
   prove false, how damnable shall be our end at the last! What a blow
   shall we give to the heart of the Church, and what derision will be
   made in hell!

   You will observe that the character of Judas was openly an admirable
   one. I find not that he committed himself in any way. Not the slightest
   speck defiled his moral character so far as others could perceive. He
   was no boaster, like Peter; he was free enough from the rashness which
   cries, "Though all men should forsake thee yet will not I." He asks no
   place on the right hand of the throne, his ambition is of another sort.
   He does not ask idle questions. The Judas who asks questions is "not
   Iscariot." Thomas and Philip are often prying into deep matters, but
   not Judas. He receives truth as it is taught him, and when others are
   offended and walk no more with Jesus, he faithfully adheres to him,
   having golden reasons for so doing. He does not indulge in the lusts of
   the flesh or in the pride of life. None of the disciples suspected him
   of hypocrisy; they said at the table, "Lord, is it I?" They never said,
   "Lord, is it Judas?" It was true he had been filching for months, but
   then he did it by littles, and covered his defalcations so well by
   financial manipulations that he ran no risk of detection from the
   honest unsuspecting fishermen with whom he associated. Like some
   merchants and traders we have heard of--invaluable gentlemen as
   chairmen of speculating companies and general managers of swindling
   banks--he could abstract a decent per-centage and yet make the accounts
   exactly tally. The gentlemen who have learned of Judas, manage to cook
   the accounts most admirably for the shareholders, so as to get a rich
   joint for their own table; over which they, no doubt, entreat the
   divine blessing. Judas was, in his known life, a most admirable person.
   He would have been an alderman ere long there is no doubt, and being
   very pious and richly-gifted, his advent at churches or chapels would
   have created intense satisfaction. "What a discreet and influential
   person;" say the deacons. "Yes," replies the minister; "what an
   acquisition to our councils; if we could elect him to office he would
   be of eminent service to the Church." I believe that the Easter chose
   him as apostle on purpose that we might not be at all surprised if we
   find such a man a minister in the pulpit, or a colleague of the
   minister, working as an officer in Christ's Church. These are solemn
   things, my brethren; let us take them to heart, and if any of us wear a
   good character among men and stand high in office, let this question
   come home close to us--"Lord, is it I? Lord, is it I?" Perhaps he who
   shall last ask the question is just the man who ought to have asked it
   first.

   But, secondly, I call your attention to his real nature and sin. Judas
   was a man with a conscience. He could not afford to do without it. He
   was no Sadducee who could fling religion overboard; he had strong
   religious tendencies. He was no debauched person; he never spent a
   two-pence in vice on his life, not that he loved vice less, but that he
   loved the two-pence more. Occasionally he was generous, but then it was
   with other people's money. Well did he watch his lovely charge, the
   bag. He had a conscience, I say, and a ferocious conscience it was when
   it once broke the chain, for it was his conscience which made him hang
   himself. But then it was a conscience that did not sit regularly on the
   throne; it reigned by fits and starts. Conscience was not the leading
   element. Avarice predominated over conscience. He would get money, if
   honestly, he liked that best, but if he could not get it
   conscientiously, then anyhow in the world. He was but a small trader;
   his gains were no great things, or else he would not have sold Christ
   for so small a sum as that--ten pounds at the outside, of our money at
   its present value--some three or four pounds, as it was in those days.
   It was a poor price to take for the Master; but then a little money was
   a great thing to him. He had been poor; he had joined Christ with the
   idea that he would soon be proclaimed King of the Jews, and that then
   he should become a nobleman, and be rich. Finding Christ a long while
   in coming to his kingdom, he had taken little by little, enough to lay
   by in store; and now, fearing that he was to be disappointed in all his
   dreams, and never having had any care for Christ, but only for himself,
   he gets out of what he thinks to have been a gross mistake in the best
   way he can, and makes money by his treason against his Lord. Brethren,
   I do solemnly believe, that of all hypocrites, those are the persons of
   whom there is the least hope whose God is their money. You may reclaim
   a drunkard; thank God, we have seen many instances of that; and even a
   fallen Christian, who has given way to vice, may loathe his lust, and
   return from it; but I fear me that the cases in which a man who is
   cankered with covetousness has ever been saved, are so few, that they
   might be written on your finger-nail. This is a sin which the world
   does not rebuke; the most faithful minister can scarce smit its
   forehead. God knoweth what thunders I have launched out against men who
   are all for this world, and yet pretend to be Christ's followers; but
   yet they always say, "I is not for me." What I should call stark naked
   covetousness, they call prudence, discretion, economy, and so on; and
   actions which I would scorn to spit upon, they will do, and think their
   hands quite clean after they have done them, and still sit as God's
   people sit, and hear as God's people hear, and think that after they
   have sold Christ for paltry gain, they will go to heaven. O souls,
   souls, souls, beware, beware, beware, most of all of greed! It is not
   money, nor the lack of money, but the love of money which is the root
   of all evil. It is not getting it; it is not even keeping it; it is
   loving it; it is making it your god; it is looking at that as the main
   chance, and not considering the cause of Christ, nor the truth of
   Christ, nor the holy life of Christ, but being ready to sacrifice
   everything for gains' sake. Oh! such men make giants in sin; they shall
   be set up for ever as butts for infernal laughter; their damnation
   shall be sure and just.

   The third point is, the warning which Judas received, and the way in
   which he persevered. Just think--the night before he sold his Master
   what do you think the Master did? Why, he washed his feet! And yet he
   sold him! Such condescension! Such love! Such familiarity! He took a
   towel, and girded himself, and washed Judas's feet! And yet those very
   feet brought Judas as a guide to them that took Jesus! And you remember
   what he said when he had washed his feet--"Now ye are clean, but not
   all;" and he turned a tearful eye on Judas. What a warning for him!
   What could be more explicit? Then when the Supper came, and they began
   to eat and drink together, the Lord said--"One of you shall betray me."
   That was plain enough; and a little farther on he said explicitly--"He
   that dippeth with me in the dish the same is he." What opportunities
   for repentance! He cannot say he had not a faithful preacher. What
   could have been more personal? If he does not repent now, what is to be
   done? Moreover, Judas saw that which was enough to make a heart of
   adamant bleed; he saw Christ with agony on his face, for it was just
   after Christ had said "Now is my soul troubled," that Judas left the
   feast and went out to sell his Master. That face, so full of grief,
   ought to have turned him, must have turned him, if he had not been,
   given up and left alone, to deliver over his soul unto his own devices.
   What language could have been more thundering than the words of Jesus
   Christ, when he said, "Woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is
   betrayed; it had been good for that man if he had not been born." He
   had said, "Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil."
   Now, if while these thunders rolled over his head, and the
   lightningflashes pointed at his person, if, then, this man was not
   aroused, what a hell of infernal pertinacity and guilt must have been
   within his soul! Oh! but if any of you, if any of you shall sell Christ
   for the sake of keeping the shop open on Sunday, if you shall sell
   Christ for the extra wages you may earn for falsehood--oh! if you shall
   sell Christ for the sake of the hundred pounds that you may lay hold of
   by a villanous contract--if you do that, you do not perish unwarned. I
   come into this pulpit to please no man among you. God knoweth if I knew
   more of your follies you should have them pointed out yet more plainly;
   if I knew more of the tricks of business, I would not flinch to speak
   of them! But, O sirs, I do conjure you by the blood of Judas, who
   hanged himself at last, turn you--if such there be--turn you from this
   evil, if haply your sin may be blotted out!

   Let us for one minute notice the act itself. He sought out his own
   temptation. He did not wait for the devil to come to him; he went after
   the devil. He went to the chief priests and said, "What will ye give
   me?" One of the old Puritan divines says, "This is not the way people
   generally trade; they tell their own price." Judas says "What will ye
   give me? Anything you like. The Lord of life and glory sold at the
   buyer's own price. What will ye give me?" And another very prettily
   puts it, "What could they give him? What did the man want? He did not
   want food and raiment; he fared as well as his Master and the other
   disciples; he had enough; he had all that his needs could crave, and
   yet he said, What will ye give me? What will ye give me? What will ye
   give ne?" Alas! some people's religion is grounded on that one
   question--"What will you give me?" Yes, they would go to church if
   there are any charities given away there, but if there were more to be
   got by not going they would do that. "What will you give me?" Some of
   these people are not even so wise as Judas. Ah! there is a man over
   yonder who would sell the Lord for a crown, much more for ten pounds,
   as Judas did! Why, there are some who will sell Christ for the smallest
   piece of silver in our currency. They are tempted to deny their Lord,
   tempted to act in an unhallowed way, though the gains are so paltry
   that a year's worth of them would not come to much. No subject could be
   more dreadful than this, if we really would but look at it carefully.
   This temptation happeneth to each of us. Do not deny it. We all like to
   gain; it is but natural that we should; the propensity to acquire is in
   every mind, and under lawful restrictions it is not an improper
   propensity; but when it comes into conflict with our allegiance to our
   Master, and in a world like this it often will, we must overcome it or
   perish. There will arise occasions with some of you many times in a
   week in which it is "God--or gain;" "Christ, or the thirty pieces of
   silver;" and therefore I am the more urgent in pressing this on you. Do
   not, though the world should bid its highest, though it should heap its
   comforts upon one another, and add fame, and hononr, and respect, do
   not, I pray you, forsake your Master. There have been such cases; cases
   of persons who used to come here, but they found they did not get on,
   because Sunday was the best day's trade in the week; they had some good
   feelings, some good impressions once, but they have lost them now. We
   have known others who have said, "Well, you see, I did once think I
   loved the Lord, but my business went so badly when I came up to the
   house of God, that I left it; I renounced my profession." Ah, Judas!
   ah, Judas! ah, Judas! let me call thee by thy name, for such thou art!
   This is the sin of the apostate over again; God help thee to repent of
   it, and go, not to any priest, but to Christ and make confession, if
   haply thou mayest be saved. You perceive that in the act of selling
   Christ, Judas was faithful to his master. "Faithful to his master?" you
   say. Yes, his master was the devil, and having made an agreement with
   him he carried it out honestly. Some people are always very honest with
   the devil. If they say they will do a wrong thing they say they ought
   to do it because they said they would; as if any oath could be binding
   on a man if it be an oath to do wrong? "I will never go into that house
   again," some have said, and they have said afterwards, "Well, I wish I
   had not said it." Was it a wrong thing? What is your oath then? It was
   an oath given to the devil. What was that foolish promise but a promise
   to Satan, and will you be faithful to him? Ah! would God that you were
   faithful to Christ! Would that any of us were as true to Christ as
   Satan's servants are to their master!

   Judas betrayed his Master with a kiss. That is how most apostates do
   it; it is always with a kiss. Did you ever read an infidel book in your
   life which did not begin with profound respect for truth? I never have.
   Even modern ones, when bishops write them, always begin like that. They
   betray the Son of man with a kiss. Did you ever read a bank of bitter
   controversy which did not begin with such a sickly lot of humility,
   such sugar, such butter, such treacle, such everything sweet and soft,
   that you said, "Ah! there is sure to be something bad here, for when
   people begin so softly and sweetly, so humbly and so smoothly, depend
   upon it they have rank hatred in their hearts." The most devout looking
   people are often the most hypocritical in the world.

   We conclude with the repentance of Judas. He did repent; he did repent,
   but it was the repentance that worketh death. He did make a confession,
   but there was no respect to the deed itself, but only to its
   consequences. He was very sorry that Christ was condemned. Some latent
   love that he had once had to a kind Master, came up when he saw that he
   was condemned. He did not think, perhaps, it would come to that; he may
   have had a hope that he would escape out of their hands, and then he
   would keep his thirty pieces of silver and perhaps sell him over again.
   Perhaps he thought that he would rid himself from their hands by some
   miraculous display of power, or would proclaim the kingdom, and so he
   himself would only be hastening on that very blessed consummation.
   Friends, the man who repents of consequences does not repent. The
   ruffian repents of the gallows but not of the murder, and that is no
   repentance at all. Human law of course must measure sin by
   consequences, but God's law does not. There is a pointsman on a railway
   who neglects his duty; there is a collision on the line, and people are
   killed; well, it is manslaughter to this man through his carelessness.
   But that pointsman, perhaps, many times before had neglected his duty,
   but no accident came of it, and then he walked home and said, "Well, I
   have done no wrong." Now the wrong, mark you, is never to be measured
   by the accident, but by the thing itself, and if you have committed an
   offense and you have escaped undetected it is just as vile in God's
   eye; if you have done wrong and Providence has prevented the natural
   result of the wrong, the honor of that is with God, but you are as
   guilty as if your sin had been carried out to its fullest consequences,
   and the whole world set ablaze. Never measure sin by consequences, but
   repent of them as they are in themselves.

   Though being sorry for consequences, since these are unalterable, this
   man was led to remorse. He sought a tree, adjusted the rope, and hanged
   himself, but in his haste he hanged himself so badly that the rope
   broke, he fell over a precipice, and there we read his bowels gushed
   out; he lay a mangled mass at the bottom of the cliff, the horror of
   every one who passed. Now you that make a gain of godliness--if there
   be such here--you may not come to a suicide's end, but take the lesson
   home. Mr. Keach, my venerable predecessor, gives at the end of one of
   his volumes of sermons, the death of a Mr. John Child. John Child had
   been a Dissenting minister, and for the sake of gain, to get a living,
   he joined the Episcopalians against his conscience; he sprinkled
   infants; and practiced all the other paraphernalia of the Church
   against his conscience. At last, at last, he was arrested with such
   terrors for having done what he had, that he renounced his living, took
   to a sick bed, and his dying oaths, and blasphemies, and curses, were
   something so dreadful, that his case was the wonder of that age. Mr.
   Keach wrote a full account of it, and many went to try what they could
   do to comfort the man, but he would say, "Get ye hence; get ye hence;
   it is of no use; I have sold Christ." You know, also, the wonderful
   death of Francis Spira. In all literature, there is nothing so awful as
   the death of Spira. The man had known the truth; he stood well among
   reformers; he was an hononred, and to a certain extent apparently a
   faithful man; but he went back to the Church of Rome; he apostatized;
   and then when conscience was aroused he did not fly to Christ, but he
   looked at the consequences instead of at the sin, and so, feeling that
   the consequences could not be altered, he forget that the sin might be
   pardoned, and perished in agonies extreme. May it never be the unhappy
   lot of any of us to stand by such a death-bed; but the Lord have mercy
   upon us now, and make us search our hearts. Those of you who say, "We
   do not want that sermon," are probably the persons who need it most. He
   who shall say, "Well, we have no Judas amongst us," is probably a Judas
   himself. Oh! search yourselves; turn out every cranny; look in every
   corner of your soul, to see whether your religion be for Christ's sake,
   and for truth's sake, and for God's sake, or whether it be a profession
   which you take up because it is a respectable thing, a profession which
   you keep up because it keeps you up. The Lord search us and try us, and
   bring us to know our ways.

   And now, in conclusion--there is a Savior, and that Savior is willing
   to receive us now. If I am not a saint, yet I am a sinner. Would it not
   be best for all of us to go again to the fountain, and wash and be
   clean. Let each of us go anew, and say, "Master, thou knowest what I
   am; I know not myself; but, if I be wrong, make me right; if I be
   right, keep me so. My trust is in thee. Keep me now, for thine own
   sake, Jesus." Amen.

                          The Greatest Trial on Record

   A Sermon

   (No. 495)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, February 22nd, 1863, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel
   together, against the Lord, and against his anointed."--Psalm 2:2.

   AFTER OUR LORD HAD been betrayed by the false-hearted Judas, he was
   bound by the officers who had come to take him; no doubt the cords were
   drawn as tight, and twisted as mercilessly as possible. If we believe
   the traditions of the fathers, these cords cut through the flesh even
   to the very bones, so that all the way from the garden to the house of
   Annas, his blood left a crimson trail. Our Redeemer was hurried along
   the road which crosses the brook Kedron. A second time he was made like
   unto David, who passed over that brook, weeping as he went; and perhaps
   it was on this occasion that he drank of that foul brook by the way.
   The brook Redron, you know, was that into which all the filth of the
   sacrifices of the temple was cast, and Christ, as though he were a foul
   and filthy thing, must be led to the black stream. He was led into
   Jerusalem by the sheep-gate, the gate through which the lambs of the
   Passover and the sheep for sacrifice were always driven. Little did
   they understand, that in so doing they were again following out to the
   very letter the significant types which God had ordained in the law of
   Moses. They led, I say, this Lamb of God through the sheep-gate, and
   they hastened him on to the house of Annas, the ex-high priest, who,
   either from his relationship to Caiaphas, from his natural ability, or
   his prominence in opposing the Savior, stood high in the opinion of the
   rulers. Here they made a temporary call, to gratify the bloodthirsty
   Annas with the sight of his victim; and then, hastening on, they
   brought him to the house of Caiaphas, some little distance off; where,
   though it was but a little past the dead of night, many members of the
   Sanhedrim were assembled. In a very short time, no doubt informed by
   some speedy messenger, all the rest of the elders came together, and
   sat down with great delight to the malicious work. Let us follow our
   Lord Jesus Christ, not, like Peter, afar off, but, like John, let us go
   in with Jesus into the high priest's house, and when we have tarried
   awhile there, and have seen our Savior despitefully used, let us
   traverse the streets with him, till we come to the hall of Pilate, and
   then to the palace of Herod, and then afterwards to the place called
   "the pavement," where Christ is subjected to an ignominious competition
   with Barabbas, the murderer, and where we hear the howling of the
   people, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"

   Brethren, as the Lord gave commandment concerning even the ashes and
   offal of the sacrifices, we ought to think no matter trivial which
   stands in connection with our great burnt offering. My admonition is,
   "Gather up the fragments which remain, that nothing be lost." As
   goldsmiths sweep their shops, to save even the filings of the gold, so
   every word of Jesus should be treasured up as very precious. But,
   indeed, the narrative to which I invite you is not unimportant. Things
   which were purposed of old, prophesied by seers, witnessed by apostles,
   written by evangelists, and published by the ambassadors of God, are
   not matters of secondary interest, but deserve our solemn and devout
   attention. Let all our hearts be awed as we follow the King of kings in
   his pathway of shame and suffering.

   I. Come we, then, to the hall of Caiaphas. After the mob had dragged
   our Lord from the house of Annas, they reached the palace of Caiaphas,
   and there a brief interval occurred before the High Priest came forth
   to question the prisoner. How were those sad minutes spent? Was the
   poor victim allowed a little pause to collect his thoughts, that he
   might face his accusers calmly? Far from it; Luke shall tell the
   pitiful story: "And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.
   And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and
   asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? And many other
   things blasphemously spake they against him." The officers were pausing
   until the chairman of the court should please to have an interview with
   the prisoner, and instead of suffering the accused to take a little
   rest before a trial so important, upon which his life and character
   depended, they spend all the time in venting their bitter malice upon
   him. Observe how they insult his claim to the Messiahship! In effect,
   they mock him thus: "Thou claimest to be a prophet like unto Moses;
   thou knowest things to come; if thou be sent of God, prove it by
   discovering thy foes; we will put thee on thy trial, and test thee, O
   thou man of Nazareth." They bind his eyes, and then, smiting him one
   after another, they bid him exercise his prophetic gift, for their
   amusement, and prophesy who it was that smote him. Oh, shameful
   question! How gracious was the silence, for an answer might have
   withered them for ever. The day shall come when all that smite Christ,
   shall find that he has seen them, though they thought his eyes were
   blinded. The day shall come, blasphemer, worldling, careless man, when
   everything that you have done against Christ's cause and Christ's
   people, shall be published before the eyes of men and angels, and
   Christ shall answer your question, and shall tell you who it is that
   smote him. I speak to some this morning who have forgotten that Christ
   sees them; and they have ill-treated his people; they have spoken ill
   of his holy cause, saying, "How doth God know? and is there knowledge
   in the Most High?" I tell you, the Judge of men shall ere long, point
   you out, and make you, to your shame and confusion of face, confess
   that you smote the Savior when you smote his Church.

   This preliminary mockery being over, Caiaphas, the high priest came in;
   he began at once to interrogate the Lord before the public trial
   doubtless with the view of catching him in his speech. The high priest
   asked him first of his disciples. We do not know what questions he
   asked; perhaps they were something like these: "What meanest thou, to
   allow a rabble to follow thee wherever thou goest? Who art thou, that
   thou shouldst have twelve persons always attending thee and calling
   thee Master? Dost thou intend to make these the leaders of a band of
   men? Are these to be thy lieutenants, to raise a host on thy behalf? Or
   dost thou pretend to be a prophet, and are these the sons of the
   prophets who follow thee, as Elisha did Elias Moreover, where are they?
   Where are thy gallant followers? If thou art a good man, why are they
   not here to bear witness to thee? Where are they gone? Are they not
   ashamed of their folly, now that thy promises of honor all end in
   shame?" The high priest "asked him of his disciples." Our Lord Jesus on
   this point said not a syllable. Why this silence? Because it is not for
   our Advocate to accuse his disciples. He might have answered, "Well
   dost thou ask, Where are they?' the cowards forsook me; when one proved
   a traitor, the rest took to their heels. Thou sayest, Where are my
   disciples?' there is one yonder, sitting by the fire, warming his
   hands, the same who just now denied me with an oath." But no, he would
   not utter a word of accusation; he whose lips are mighty to intercede
   for his people, will never speak against them. Let Satan slander, but
   Christ pleads. The accuser of the brethren is the prince of this world:
   the Prince of peace is ever our Advocate before the eternal throne.

   The high priest next shifted his ground, and asked him concerning his
   doctrine--what it was that he taught--whether what he taught was not in
   contradiction to the original teachings of their great law-giver
   Moses--and whether he had not railed at the Pharisees, reviled the
   Scribes, and exposed the rulers. The Master gave a noble answer. Truth
   is never shamefaced; he boldly points to his public life as his best
   answer. "I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue,
   and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I
   said nothing. Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have
   said unto them: behold they know what I said." No sophistries--no
   attempt at evasion--the best armor for truth is her own naked breast.
   He had preached in the market-places, on the mountain's brow, and in
   the temple courts; nothing had been done in a corner. Happy is the man
   who can make so noble a defense. Where is the joint in such harness?
   Where can the arrow pierce the man arrayed in so complete a panoply?
   Little did that arch-knave Caiaphas gain by his crafty questioning. For
   the rest of the questioning, our Lord Jesus said not a word in
   self-defense; he knew that it availed not for a lamb to plead with
   wolves; he was well aware that whatever he said would be misconstrued
   and made a fresh source of accusation, and he willed, moreover, to
   fulfill the prophecy, "He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as
   a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth." But
   what power he exerted in thus remaining silent! Perhaps nothing
   displays more fully the omnipotence of Christ, than this power of
   self-control. Control the Deity? What power less than divine can
   attempt the task? Behold, my brethren, the Son of God does more than
   rule the winds and commend the waves, he restrains himself. And when a
   word, a whisper, would have refuted his foes, and swept them to their
   eternal destruction, he "openeth not his mouth." He who opened his
   mouth for his enemies, will not utter a word for himself. If ever
   silence were more than golden, it is this deep silence under infinite
   provocation.

   During this preliminary examination, our Lord suffered an outrage which
   needs a passing notice. When he had said, "Ask them that hear me," some
   over-officious person in the crowd struck him in the face. The margin
   in John 18:22, very properly corrects our version, and renders the
   passage, "with a rod." Now, considering that our blessed Lord suffered
   so much, this one little particular might seem unimportant, only it
   happens to be the subject of prophecy in the book of Micah 5:1, "They
   shall smite the Judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek." This
   smiting while under trial is peculiarly atrocious. To strike a man
   while he is pleading in his own defense, would surely be a violation of
   the laws even of barbarians. It brought Paul's blood into his face, and
   made him lose his balance when the high priest ordered them to smite
   him on the mouth. I think I hear his words of burning indignation: "God
   shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after
   the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?" How soon
   the servant loses his temper: how far more glorious the meekness of the
   Master. What a contrast do these gentle words afford us--"If I have
   spoken evil bear witness to the evil; but if well, why smitest thou
   me?" This was such a concentrated infamy, to strike a man while
   pleading for his life, that it well deserved the notice both of
   evangelist and prophet.

   But now the Court are all sitting; the members of the great Sanhedrim
   are all in their various places, and Christ is brought forth for the
   public trial before the highest ecclesiastical court; though it is,
   mark you, a foregone conclusion, that by hook or by crook they will
   find him guilty. They scour the neighborhood for witnesses. There were
   fellows to be found in Jerusalem, like those who in the olden times
   frequented the Old Bailey, "straw witnesses," who were ready to be
   bought on either side; and, provided they were well paid, would swear
   to anything. But for all this, though the witnesses were ready to
   perjure themselves, they could not agree one with another; being heard
   separately, their tales did not tally. At last two came, with some
   degree of similarity in their witness; they were both liars, but for
   once the two liars had struck the same note. They declared that he said
   "I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three
   days I will build another made without hands," Mark 14:58. Now here
   was, first, misquotation. He never said, "I will destroy the temple,"
   his words were, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it
   up." See how they add to his words and twist them to their own ends.
   Then again, they not only misquoted the words, but they misrepresented
   the sense, wilfully, because he spake concerning the temple of his
   body, and not the literal temple in which they worshipped; and this
   they must have known. He said, "Destroy this temple"--and the
   accompanying action might have showed them that he meant his own body,
   which was raised by his glorious resurrection after destruction upon
   the cross. Let us add, that even when thus misrepresented, the witness
   was not sufficient as the foundation of a capital charge. Surely there
   could be nothing worthy of death in a man's saying, "Destroy this
   temple, and I will build it in three days." A person might make use of
   those words a thousand times over--he might be very foolish, but he
   would not be guilty of death for such an offense. But where men have
   made up their minds to hate Christ, they will hate him without a cause.
   Oh! ye that are adversaries of Christ--and there are some such here
   to-day--I know ye try to invent some excuse for your opposition to his
   holy religion; ye forge a hundred falsehoods; but ye know that your
   witness is not true, and your trial in conscience through which you
   pass the Savior, is but a mock one. Oh that ye were wise, and would
   understand him to be what he is, and submit yourselves to him now.

   Finding that their witness, even when tortured to the highest degree,
   was not strong enough, the high priest, to get matter of accusation,
   adjured him by the Most High God to answer whether he was the Christ,
   "the Son of the Blessed." Being thus adjured, our Master would not set
   us an example of cowardice; he spake to purpose; he said, "I am," Mark
   14:62, and then, to show how fully he knew this to be true, he added,
   "ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and
   coming in the clouds of heaven." I cannot understand what Unitarians do
   with this incident. Christ was put to death on a charge of blasphemy,
   for having declared himself to be the Son of God. Was not that the time
   when any sensible person would have denied the accusation? If he had
   not really claimed to be the Son of God, would he not now have spoken?
   Would he not now, once for all, have delivered our minds from the
   mistake under which we are laboring, if, indeed, it be a mistake, that
   he is the Son of God? But no, he seals it with his blood; he bears open
   testimony before the herd of his accusers. "I am." I am the Son of God,
   and I am the sent-one of the Most High. Now, now the thing is done.
   They want no further evidence. The judge, forgetting the impartiality
   which becomes his station, pretends to be wonderfully struck with
   horror, rends his garments, turns round to ask his co-assessors whether
   they need any further witness, and they, all too ready, hold up their
   hands in token of unanimity, and he is at once condemned to die. Ah!
   brethren, and no sooner condemned, than the high priest, stepping down
   from his divan, spits in his face, and then the Sanhedrim follow, and
   smite him on his cheek; and then they turn him down to the rabble that
   had gathered in the court, and they buffet him from one to the other,
   and spit upon his blessed cheeks, and smite him, and then they play the
   old game again, which they had learned so well before the trial came
   on; they blindfold him for a second time, place him in the chair, and
   as they smite him with their fists they cry. "Prophet! Prophet!
   Prophet! who is it that smote thee? Prophecy unto us!" And thus the
   Savior passed a second time through that most brutal and ignominious
   treatment. If we had tears, if we had sympathies, if we had hearts, we
   should prepare to shed those tears, to awake those sympathies, and
   break those hearts, now. O thou Lord of life and glory! how shamefully
   wast thou illtreated by those who pretended to be the curators of holy
   truth, the conservators of integrity, and the teachers of the law!

   Having thus sketched the trial as briefly as I could, let me just say,
   that, throughout the whole of this trial before the ecclesiastical
   tribunal, it is manifest that they did all they could to pour contempt
   upon his two claims--to Deity and to Messiahship. Now, friends, this
   morning--this morning, as truly as on that eventful occasion--you and I
   must range ourselves on one of two sides. Either this day we must
   cheerfully acknowledge his Godhead, and accept him also as the Messias,
   the Savior promised of old to us; or else we must take our post with
   those who are the adversaries of God and of his Christ. Will you ask
   yourself the question, on which side will you now stand? I pray you, do
   not think that Christ's Deity needs any further proof than that which
   this one court gives. My dear friends, there is no religion under
   heaven, no false religion, which would have dared to hazard such a
   statement, as that yonder man who was spit upon and buffeted was none
   other than incarnate God. No false religion would venture to draw upon
   the credulity of its followers to that extent. What! that man there who
   speaks not a word, who is mocked, despised, rejected, made nothing
   of--what! he "very God of very God?" You do not find Mohammed, nor any
   false prophet, asking any person to believe a doctrine so
   extraordinary. They know too well that there is a limit even to human
   faith; and they have not ventured upon such a marvellous assertion as
   this, that yonder despised man is none other than the upholder of all
   things. No false religion would have taught a truth so humbling to him
   who is its founder and Lord. Besides, it is not in the power of any
   man-made religion to have conceived such a thought. That Deity should
   willingly submit to be spit upon to redeem those whose mouths vented
   the spittle! In what book do you read such a wonder as this? We have
   pictures drawn from imagination; we have been enchanted along romantic
   pages, and we have marvelled at the creative flights of human genius;
   but where did you ever read such a thought as this? "God was made flesh
   and dwelt among us"--he was despised, scourged, mocked, treated as
   though he were the offscouring of all things, brutally treated, worse
   than a dog, and all out of pure love to his enemies. Why, the thought
   is such a great one, so God-like, the compassion in it is so divine,
   that it must be true. None but God could have thought of such a thing
   as this stoop from the highest throne in glory to the cross of deepest
   shame and woe. And do you think that if the doctrine of the cross were
   not true, such effects would follow from it? Would those South Sea
   Islands, once red with the blood of cannibalism, be now the abode of
   sacred song and peace? Would this island, once itself the place of
   naked savages, be what it is, through the influence of the benign
   gospel of God, if that gospel were a lie? Ah! hallowed mistake, indeed,
   to produce such peaceful, such blessed, such lasting, such divine
   results! Ah! he is God. The thing is not false. And that he is Messiah,
   who shall doubt? If God should send a prophet, what better prophet
   could you desire? What character would you seek to have exhibited more
   completely human and divine? What sort of a Savior would you wish for?
   What could better satisfy the cravings of conscience? Who could commend
   himself more fully to the affections of the heart? He must be, we feel
   at once, as we see him, one alone by himself, with no competitor; he
   must be the Messiah of God.

   Come, now, sirs, on which side will you range yourselves? Will you
   smite him? I put the question--"Who is it that will smite him this day?
   Who is it that will spit upon him this day?" "I will not," says one,
   "but I do not accept nor believe in him." In that you smite him. "I do
   not hate him," says another, "but I am not saved by him." In refusing
   his love you smite him. Whoever among you will not trust him with your
   soul--in that you smite him, smite him in the tenderest part: since you
   impugn his love and power to save. Oh! "Kiss the Son, lest he be angry,
   and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little."
   That suffering man stands in the room, and place, and stead of every
   one that will believe on him. Trust him! trust him!--you have then
   accepted him as your God, as your Messiah. Refuse to trust him!--you
   have smitten him; and you may think it little to do this to-day; but
   when he rides upon the clouds of heaven you will see your sin in its
   true light, and you will shudder to think that ever you could have
   refused him who now reigns "King of kings and Lord of lords." God help
   you to accept him, as your God and Christ, to-day!

   II. But our time flies too rapidly, and we must hasten with it, and
   accompany our Savior to another place.

   The Romans had taken away from the Jews the power to put a person to
   death, they sometimes did it still, but they did it, as in the case of
   Stephen, by popular tumult. Now, in our Savior's case they could not do
   this, because there was still a strong feeling in favor of Christ among
   the people, a feeling so strong, that had they not been bribed by the
   rulers, they would never have said, "Crucify him! crucify him!" You
   will remember that the priests and rulers did not arrest him on the
   feast day, "lest" said they "there be a tumult among the people."
   Besides, the Jewish way of putting a person to death, was by stoning:
   hence, unless there was a sufficient number of persons who hated him, a
   person would never get put to death at all. That is why the method of
   putting to death by stoning was chosen, because if a person was
   generally thought to be innocent, very few persons would stone him; and
   although he would be somewhat maimed, his life might possibly be
   spared. They thought, therefore, the Savior might escape as he did at
   other times, when they took up stones to stone him. Moreover they
   desired to put him to the death of the accursed; they would confound
   him with slaves and criminals, and hang him like the Canaanitish kings
   of old; therefore they hound him away to Pilate. The distance was about
   a mile. He was bound in the same cruel manner, and was doubtless cut by
   the cords. He had already suffered most dreadfully; please to remember
   the bloody sweat of last Sabbath week; then remember that he has
   already twice been beaten; and he is now hurried along, without any
   rest or refreshment, just as the morning is breaking, along the streets
   to the place where Pilate lived, perhaps the tower of Antonia, close to
   the temple itself; we are not quite sure. He is bound and they hurry
   him along the road; and here the Romish writers supply a great number
   of particulars of anguish out of their very fertile imaginations. After
   they had brought him there a difficulty occurred. These holy people,
   these very righteous elders, could not come into the company of Pilate,
   because Pilate, being a Gentile, would defile them; and there was a
   broad space outside the palace, like a raised platform, this was called
   "the pavement," where Pilate was wont to sit on those high days, that
   he might not touch these blessed Jews. So he came out on the pavement,
   and they themselves went not into the hall, but remained before "the
   pavement." Always notice, that sinners who can swallow camels will
   strain at gnats, crowds of men who will do great sins are very much
   afraid of committing some little things which they they think will
   affect their religion. Notice, that many a man who is a big thief
   during the week, will ease his conscience by rigid Sabbatarianism when
   the day comes round. In fact, most hypocrites run for shelter to some
   close observance of days, ceremonies, and observations, when they have
   slighted the weightier matters of the law.

   Well, Pilate receives him bound. The charge brought against him was
   not, of course, blasphemy; Pilate would have laughed at that, and
   declined all interference. They accused him of stirring up sedition,
   pretending to be a king, and teaching that it was not right to pay
   tribute to Caesar. This last charge was a clear and manifest lie. He
   refuse to pay tribute? Did not he send to the fish's mouth to get the
   money? He say that Caesar must not have his due? Did he not tell the
   Herodians--"Render unto Caesar the things that are Cresar's?" He stir
   up a sedition?--the man that had "not where to lay his head?" He
   pretend to snatch the diadem from Caesar?--he, the man who hid himself,
   when the people would have taken him by force and made him a king?
   Nothing can be more atrociously false. Pilate examines him, and
   discovers at once, both from his silence and from his answer, that he
   is a most extraordinary person; he perceives that the kingdom which he
   claims is something supernatural; he cannot understand it. He asks him
   what he came into the world for, the reply puzzles and amazes him, "To
   bear witness to the truth," says he. Now, that was a thing no Roman
   understood; for a hundred years before Pilate came, Jugurtha said of
   the city of Rome, "a city for sale;" bribery, corruption, falsehood,
   treachery, villany, these were the gods of Rome, and truth had fled the
   seven hills, the very meaning of the word was scarcely known. So Pilate
   turned on his heel, and said, "What is truth?" As much as to say, "I am
   the procurator of this part of the country; all I care for is money."
   "What's truth?" I do not think he asked the question, "What is truth?"
   as some preach from it, as if he seriously desired to know what it
   really was, for surely he would have paused for the divine reply and
   not have gone away from Christ the moment afterwards. He said, "Pshaw;
   What's truth?" Yet there was something so awful about the prisoner,
   that his wife's dream, and her message--"See that thou have nothing to
   do with this just person," all worked upon the superstitious fears of
   this very weak-minded ruler; so he went back and told the Jews a second
   time, "I find no fault in him;" and when they said, "He stirreth up the
   people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning at Galilee to this
   place," he caught at that word "Galilee." "Now," he thought, "I will be
   rid of this man; the people shall have their way, and yet I will not be
   guilty." "Galilee?" said he; "why, Herod is ruler there; you had better
   take him to Herod at once." He thus gained two or three points; he made
   Herod his friend; he hoped to exonerate himself of his crime, and yet
   please the mob. Away they go to Herod. Oh! I think I see that blessed
   Lamb of God again hounded through the streets. Did you ever read such a
   tale? No martyr, even in bloody Mary's time, was ever harried thus as
   the Savior was. We must not think that his agonies were all confined to
   the cross; they were endured in those streets--in those innumerable
   blows, and kicks, and strikings with the fist, that he had to bear.
   They took him before Herod, and Herod having heard of his miracles,
   thought to see some wonderful thing, some piece of jugglery, done in
   his presence; and when Christ refused to speak, and would not plead
   before "that fox" at all, then Herod treated him with a sneer. "They
   made nothing of him." Can you picture the scene? Herod, his captains,
   his lieutenants, all, down to the meanest soldiers, treat the Savior
   with a broad grin! "A pretty king," they seem to say; "a miserable
   beggar better! Look at his cheeks, all bruised where they have been
   smiting him: is that the color of royalty's complexion?" "Look," say
   they, "he is emaciated, he is covered with blood, as though he had been
   sweating drops of blood all night. Is that the imperial purple?" And so
   they "made nothing of him," and despised his kingship. And Herod said,
   "Bring out that costly white robe, you know, if he be a king, let us
   dress him so," and so the white robe is put on him--not a purple
   one--that Pilate put on afterwards. He has two robes put on him--the
   one put on by the Jews, the other by the Gentiles; seeming to be a fit
   comment on that passage in Solomon's song, where the spouse says, "My
   beloved is white and ruddy"--white with the gorgeous robe which marked
   him King of the Jews, and then red with the purple robe which Pilate
   afterwards cast upon his shoulders, which proved him King of nations
   too. And so Herod and his men of war, after treating him as shamefully
   as they could, looking at him as some madman mare fit for Bedlam than
   elsewhere, sent him back again to Pilate. Oh! can you not follow him?
   You want no great imagination--as you see them dragging him back again!
   It is another journey along those streets; another scene of shameful
   tumult, bitter scorn, and cruel smitings. Why, he dies a hundred
   deaths, my brethren, it is not one--it is death on death the Savior
   bears, as he is dragged from tribunal to tribunal.

   See, they bring him to Pilate a second time. Pilate again is anxious to
   save him. He says, "I have found no fault in this man touching those
   things whereof ye accuse him: no, nor yet Herod; I will therefore
   release him!" "No, no," they say; and they clamor greatly. He proposes
   a cruel alternative, which yet he meant for tender mercy "I will
   therefore chastise him, and let him go." He gave him over to his
   lictors to be scourged. The Roman scourge was, as I have explained
   before, a most dreadful instrument. It was made of the sinews of oxen,
   and little sharp pieces of bone, which, you know, cause the most
   frightful lacerations, if by accident you even run them into your hand;
   little sharp pieces, splinters of bone, were intertwisted every here
   and there among the sinews; so that every time the lash came down some
   of these pieces of bone went right into the flesh, and tore off heavy
   thonglulls, and not only the blood but the very flesh would be rent
   away. The Savior was tied to the column, and thus beaten. He had been
   beaten before; but this of the Roman lictor was probably the most
   severe of his flagellations. After Pilate had beaten him, he gave him
   up to the soldiers for a short time, that they might complete the
   mockery, and so be able to witness that Pilate had no idea of the
   royalty of Jesus, and no complicity in any supposed treason. The
   soldiers put a crown of thorns on his head, and bowed before him, and
   spat on him, and put a reed in his hands; they smote the crown of
   thorns into his temple, they covered him with a purple robe; and then
   Pilate brought him out, saying, "Behold the man!" I believe he did it
   out of pity. He thought, "Now I have wounded him and cut him to pieces
   thus, I will not kill him; that sight will move their hearts." Oh! that
   Ecce Homo ought to have melted their hearts, if Satan had not made them
   harder than flints and sterner than steel. But no, they cry, "Crucify
   him! crucify him!" So Pilate listens to them again, and they change
   their note, "He hath spoken blasphemy." This was a wrong charge to
   bring; for Pilate, having his superstition again aroused, is the more
   afraid to put him to death; and he comes out again, and says, "I find
   no fault in him." What a strong contest between good and evil in that
   man's heart! But they cried out again, "If thou let this man go thou
   art not Caesar's friend." They hit the mark this time, and he yields to
   their clamor. He brings forth a basin of water, and he washes his hands
   before them all, and he says, "I am innocent of the blood of this just
   person: see ye to it." A poor way of escaping! That water could not
   wash the blood from his hands, though their cry did bring the blood on
   their heads--"His blood be on us and on our children." When that is
   done, Pilate takes the last desperate step of sitting down on the
   pavement in royal state; he condemns Jesus, and bids them take him
   away. But ere he is taken to execution, the dogs of war shall snap at
   him again. The Jews no doubt having bribed the soldiers to excessive
   zeal of scorn, they a second time--(oh! mark this; perhaps ye thought
   this happened only once. This is the fifth time he has thus been
   treated)--the soldiers took him back again, and once more they mocked
   him, once more they spat upon him, and treated him shamefully. So, you
   see, there was once when he first went to the house of Caiaphas; then
   after he was condemned there; then Herod and his men of war; then
   Pilate after the scourging; and then the soldiers, after the ultimate
   condemnation. See ye not how manifestly "he was despised and rejected
   of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; we hid as it were
   our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not." I do not
   know when I ever more heartily wished to be eloquent than I do now. I
   am talking to my own lips, and saying, "Oh! that these lips had
   language worthy of the occasion!" I do but faintly sketch the scene. I
   cannot lay on the glowing colors. Oh, that I could set forth thy grief,
   thou Man of Sorrows! God the Holy Ghost impress it on your memories and
   on your souls, and help you pitifully to consider the griefs of your
   blessed Lord.

   I will now leave this point, when I have made this practical
   application of it. Remember, dear friends, that this day, as truly as
   on that early morning, a division must be made among us. Either you
   must this day accept Christ as your King, or else his blood will be on
   you. I bring my Master out before your eyes, and say to you, "Behold
   your King." Are you willing to yield obedience to him? He claims first
   your implicit faith in his merit: will you yield to that? He claims,
   next, that you will take him to be Lord of your heart, and that, as he
   shall be Lord within, so he shall be Lord without. Which shall it be?
   Will you choose him now? Does the Holy Spirit in your soul--for without
   that you never will--does the Holy Spirit say, "Bow the knee, and take
   him as your king?" Thank God, then. But if not, his blood is on you, to
   condemn you. You crucified him. Pilate, Caiaphas, Herod, the Jews and
   Romans, all meet in you. You scourged him; you said, "Let him be
   crucified." Do not say it was not so. In effect you join their clamours
   when you refuse him; when you go your way to your farm and to your
   merchandise, and despise his love and his blood, you do spiritually
   what they did literally--you despise the King of kings. Come to the
   fountain of his blood, and wash and be clean.

   III. But we must close with a third remark. Christ really underwent yet
   a third trial. He was not only tried before the ecclesiastical and
   civil tribunals, but, he was really tried before the great democratical
   tribunal, that is, the assembly of the people in the street.

   You will say, "How?" Well, the trial was somewhat singular, but yet it
   was really a trial. Barabbas--a thief, a felon, a murderer, a traitor,
   had been captured; he was probably one of a band of murderers who were
   accustomed to come up to Jerusalem at the time of the feast, carrying
   daggers under their cloaks to stab persons in the crowd, and rob them,
   and then he would be gone again; besides that, he had tried to stir up
   sedition, setting himself up possibly as a leader of banditti. Christ
   was put into competition with this villain; the two were presented
   before the popular eye, and to the shame of manhood, to the disgrace of
   Adam's race, let it be remembered that the perfect, loving, tender,
   sympathizing, disinterested Savior was met with the word, "Crucify
   him!" and Barabbas, the thief, was preferred. "Well," says one, "that
   was atrocious." The same thing is put before you this morning--the very
   same thing; and every unregenerate man will make the same choice that
   the Jews did, and only men renewed by grace will act upon the contrary
   principle. I say, friend, this day I put before you Christ Jesus, or
   your sins. The reason why many come not to Christ is because they
   cannot give up their lusts, their pleasures, their profits. Sin is
   Barabbas; sin is a thief; it will rob your soul of its life; it will
   rob God of his glory. Sin is a murderer; it stabbed our father Adam; it
   slew our purity. Sin is a traitor; it rebels against the king of heaven
   and earth. If you prefer sin to Christ, Christ has stood at your
   tribunal, and you have given in your verdict that sin is better than
   Christ. Where is that man? He comes here every Sunday; and yet he is a
   drunkard? Where is he? You prefer that reeling demon Bacchus to Christ.
   Where is that man? He comes here. Yes; and where are his midnight
   haunts? The harlot and the prostitute can tell! You have preferred your
   own foul, filthy lust to Christ. I know some here that have their
   consciences open pricked, and yet there is no change in them. You
   prefer Sunday trading to Christ; you prefer cheating to Christ; you
   prefer the theater to Christ; you prefer the harlot to Christ; you
   prefer the devil himself to Christ, for he it is that is the father and
   author of these things. "No," says one, "I don't, I don't." Then I do
   again put this question, and I put it very pointedly to you--"If you do
   not prefer your sins to Christ, how is it that you are not a
   Christian?" I believe this is the main stumbling-stone, that "Men love
   darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil." We come not
   to Christ because of the viciousness of our nature, and depravity of
   our heart; and this is the depravity of your heart, that you prefer
   darkness to light, put bitter for sweet, and choose evil as your good.
   Well, I think I hear one saying, "Oh! I would be on Jesus Christ's
   side, but I did not look at it in that light; I thought the question
   was. "Would he be on my side? I am such a poor guilty sinner that I
   would fain stand anywhere, if Jesu's blood would wash me." Sinner!
   sinner! if thou talkest like that, then I will meet thee right
   joyously. Never was a man one with Christ till Christ was one with him.
   If you feel that you can now stand with Christ, and say, "Yes, despised
   and rejected, he is nevertheless my God, my Savior, my king. Will he
   accept me? Why, soul, he has accepted you; he has renewed you, or else
   you would not talk so. You speak like a saved man. You may not have the
   comfort of salvation, but surely there is a work of grace in your
   heart, God's divine election has fallen upon you, and Christ's precious
   redemption has been made for you, or else you would not talk so. You
   cannot be willing to come to Christ, and yet Christ reject you. God
   forbid we should suppose the possibility of any sinner crying after the
   Savior, and the Savior saying, "No, I will not have you." Blessed be
   his name, "Him that cometh to me," he says, "I will in no wise cast
   out." "Well," says one, "then I would have him to-day. How can I do
   it?" There is nothing asked of thee but this. Trust him! trust him!
   Believe that God put him in the stead of men; believe that what he
   suffered was accepted by God instead of their punishment; believe that
   this great equivalent for punishment can save you. Trust him; throw
   yourself on him; as a man commits himself to the waters, so do you;
   sink or swim! You will never sink, you will never sink; for "he that
   believeth on the Lord Jesus Christ hath everlasting life, and shall
   never come into condemnation."

   May these faint words upon so thrilling a subject bless your souls, and
   unto God be glory, for ever and ever. Amen and Amen.

                                  The New Song

   A Sermon

   (No. 496)

   Delivered on Sunday Evening, December 28th, 1862, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "O sing unto the Lord a new song; for he hath done marvellous things:
   his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory."--Psalm
   98:1.

   THERE MUST BE NEW SONGS on new occasions of triumph. It would have been
   absurd for Miriam with her timbrel to conduct the music of the
   daughters of Israel to some old sonnet that they had learned in Egypt.
   Nay, an old song could not have spoken out the feelings of that
   generation, much less could it have served to utter a voice, the
   jubilant notes of which distant posterity should echo. They must have a
   new song while they cry the one unto the other, "Sing unto the Lord,
   for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he
   thrown into the sea." The like had never been known before, but
   henceforth father to son must show forth its fame. In after times, when
   Deborah and Barak had routed the hosts of Sisera, they did not borrow
   Miriam's song; but they had a new psalm for the new event. They said,
   "Awake, awake, Deborah; awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and
   lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam." In after years, at
   the building of the temple, or on the solemn feast days, it was ever
   the wont of the inspired poets of the age to cry, "O come, let us sing
   unto the Lord a new song." Thus the grateful notes of praise have
   gathered volume and augmented their compass as the ages have rolled
   onwards; and these as it were only the rehearsals for a grand oratorio.
   What then, shall be the marvellous novelty and the matchless glory of
   that song which shall be sung at the last upon Mount Zion, when ten
   thousand times ten thousand of the warriors of God shall surround Jesus
   the conqueror, when we shall hear a voice from heaven as the voice of
   many waters, and like great thunders, when shall be heard the voice of
   harpers, harping with their harps; what shall be, I say, the strange
   novelty of that new song which they shall sing before the throne, when
   the four and twenty elders and the four living creatures shall fall
   before God upon their faces, and worship him for ever and ever? Would
   that our ears could anticipate that tremendous burst of "Hallelujah!
   hallelujah! hallelujah! the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth."

   I want to carry your minds, if I can, to-night, for a little season to
   that last and grandest, because the decisive victory, which shall tell
   out the name and fame of Jehovah in all his mighty attributes, and in
   all his majestic deeds, when the battle shall be over for ever, and the
   banner shall be furled and the sword shall be sheathed, because the
   last foe shall be destroyed, and placed beneath the feet of the
   Almighty victor; "His right hand, and his holy arm, hath him the
   victory." My text seems, however suitable it may be to other occasions,
   to be most fitting to that last and most splendid triumph.

   Three things there are in it: victory transcendent; Deity conspicuous;
   holiness glorified.

   I. First in our text we perceive very clearly VICTORY TRANSCENDENT.

   What shall we say of that victory? The shouts thereof already greet our
   ears, and the anthem that celebrates it is already prepared, when all
   the principalities and powers of this world shall be laid low, the
   pride of earth shall burst like a bubble, the great globe itself shall
   dissolve, and the things that are seen shall be folded up like a
   vesture, worn out, and crumbled with decay, that victory will be
   transcendent; there shall be none comparable to it; it shall stand
   matchless and unrivalled in all the wars of God, of angels, or men.

   Well, we must say of that victory, there shall be none to dispute the
   claim of God the Most High. The most splendid victories of one army
   have frequently been claimed by the opposite partisans. If you stand
   beneath the triumphal arch in Paris, you will see the names of some
   battles which you simple-minded Englishmen always thought had been won
   by British soldiers; but you discover that our history was all a
   mistake, and that the Frenchmen really retired victorious from the
   plain. I suppose in America it is always difficult to ascertain who has
   been the conqueror; and where there are no generals, and the whole
   affair seems to be which shall kill the most and wade through the most
   blood, there naturally must be difficulty in ascertaining who has won
   the day. But in this case there shall be no dispute whatever. The
   dragon's head shall be so completely broken, that he can do nothing but
   bite his iron bonds and growl out his confession that God is stronger
   than he. The hosts of hell shall have been so utterly routed, that the
   deep groans of dismay and shrieks of terror shall be the confession
   that Omnipotence rules their terrible doom. As for Death, when he shall
   see his captives all loosed before his eyes; as for the grave, when the
   key shall be rent from her grip, and all her treasures plucked from her
   grasp--death and the grave shall both acknowledge that their victory is
   gone for ever; Christ has been the conqueror, the Son of God who in our
   nature has already taken away the sting. There may be to-day some who
   write their names down as Atheists; there may be others who openly avow
   that they are the adversaries of God; and throughout the universe there
   are never wanting those who are hopeful that the issue will turn out as
   they wish--they are hopeful that wrong will master right; that evil
   shall drive out good, and darkness extinguish light. But there shall
   not be one such being left on that great day of victory; it shall be
   acknowledged even by the lip of despair that the Lord God, "with his
   own right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory."
   Blazoned across the sky in lightnings such as the eye of terror has
   never beheld before; thundered out with trumpet louder than even that
   which startled the sleeping dead, every tongue in earth and hell shall
   confess, because every ear hath heard, that the Lord reigneth, and is
   king for ever and ever.

   But further, as this victory will be certainly beyond all dispute, let
   me remind you it will be transcendent, because there shall be nothing
   that can occur to mar it. When the last shock of the dread artillery
   shall have been endured by the hosts of God's elect; when the last
   charge shall have driven the foes before them as thin clouds fly before
   a Biscay gale; then, as the heroes sit down to read the story of the
   war, they shall discover that there is nothing to mar the splendor of
   that glory, for it has been a victory throughout. Of all other
   victories we read, at one time the balance trembled--sometimes the host
   on this side wavered; perhaps for the first half day it seemed not only
   doubtful which would win, but it appeared as though the adversary at
   length defeated would certainly be the conqueror. But, beloved, when we
   shall read history in the light of heaven, we shall discover that God
   was never conquered--that never did the ranks reel; we shall see that
   even the most disastrous strokes of Providence, even the most dire
   calamities that ever occurred to the Church, were only the on-march,
   the tramp of victories yet to come. I am certain that those things we
   most deplore to-day will even become the subjects of the most
   marvellous gratitude to-morrow. We look to-day upon the black side of
   the question, and say, "Ah! here, indeed, goodness was foiled;" but
   when we look at the whole matter through, we shall see that every dark
   and bending line meets in the center of the divine plan, and that which
   seemed the most incongruous and out of place with its fellow, was the
   most fitting and the most necessary of the whole programme. Satan at
   the last shall not be able to put his finger upon any spot of the
   battle-field and say, "Here my hosts routed the troops of Emmanuel."
   Everywhere it shall be seen that, from the dawning day, when first he
   struck the blow at Eve and made her sin, to the very last, when Christ
   shall drag him up the everlasting hills, led captive at his chariot
   wheels, from the first to the last, the Lord's "right hand, and his
   holy arm, hath gotten him the victory."

   Remember, too, that this is a victory all along the line. The general's
   cautious eye marks that there the left wing has driven the adversary
   back, but for that right wing bring up the reserves, let not the ranks
   be broken. Stern liners, let your chivalry be seen yonder for that wing
   reels. Generally in the battle some part must fail, while in this
   portion or the other there shall be success. Ah! but at the last when
   Christ shall stand, and bare his brow in heaven's sunlight, and all his
   angels shall be with him, it shall be seen that they were everywhere
   triumphant. The blood on Madagascar's rocks shall not defeat the
   on-march of God's armies. Saints may be burned, may be sawn in sunder,
   may wander about in sheep skins and goat skins, but they shall be
   victorious everywhere. Spain may shut her gates against the gospel, and
   the inquisition may make that place its stronghold, but as sure as
   there is a God in heaven, Christ shall be conqueror there. Tyrants may
   pass edicts to exterminate Christians, conclaves may make decrees to
   drive out the religion of Jesus, but in every place, in every land,
   where ever foot of man has trodden this green earth, shall there be
   victory; from the north to the south, from the east to the west,
   everywhere shall be triumph--China and Japan, Brazil and Chili, the
   islands of the south, the frozen regions of the north, even Africa with
   her sable sons, the dwellers in the wilderness shall bow before him and
   lick the dust at his feet. There shall be victory all along the line.
   Not from one place merely, but from all, shall be heard the tune--"His
   own right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory."

   And it shall be a victory Sustained by the news of the morrow. Not so
   among the embattled hosts of men. How hard to brook the morrow! Then
   the general's brow is dark, and his eye is heavy, for the list of the
   dead and wounded is brought in for inspection. "Another victory like
   this," says one, "and I am defeated for ever. It is dearly purchased,"
   saith he, "with the blood of these mothers' sons. My comrades and
   companions in arms must bite the ground to let the country live." But
   in that last great battle of God the muster-roll shall be found without
   one missing in it; as they call their names they shall all answer,
   there shall not be one left dead upon the field. "How so? How so?"
   saith unbelief, "are they not dead and buried now? Have not their
   bodies lain to bleach upon the side of the Alps? Have they not been
   burned in the fire and scattered as ashes to the four winds? Do not the
   saints sleep to-day in our cemeteries, and in our grave-yards, and doth
   not the deep engulf full many a body that was a temple of the Holy
   Ghost?" I answer, yes, but they shall come again. Refrain thine eyes
   from weeping, O daughter of Jerusalem; refrain thine heart from sorrow,
   for they shall come again from the land of their captivity. We that are
   alive and remain shall not have the preference beyond them that sleep,
   "For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
   incorruptible, and we shall be changed; so when this corruptible shall
   have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on
   immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written,
   Death is swallowed up in victory." "His right hand, and his holy arm,
   hath gotten him the victory."

   And sometimes, on the morrow, the general feels the glory of the
   victory is marred, for there are many prisoners; they are not dead,
   their corpses lie not on the field, but they have been taken off by the
   opposite parties, and they are a prey; and who knoweth what may become
   of them; what dungeons may contain them; to what tortures they may be
   put. But in this last victory of God, there shall be no prisoners, no
   prisoners left in the hand of his enemy. I know there are some who say
   that we may be children of God, and yet fall from grace and perish. My
   brethren, it is a foul slander upon the faithfulness and power of the
   Redeemer. I know that all he undertakes to save he will save, and he
   will bring the troops off from the battle field, every brow crowned
   with laurel, not one slain, not one a prisoner; the gates of hell shall
   never enclose the ransomed of the Lord; amongst the groans of the lost
   there shall never be heard a sigh from one that was once a saint before
   God. There are no prisoners. March out your prisoners, Prince of Hell,
   bring forth, if you can, one soul that Jesus bought with blood, one
   soul that the Spirit quickened, one soul that the Eternal Father gave
   to the hands of the Great Surety to keep for ever--bring him forth. Ah!
   ye have none. "Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful
   captive delivered?" Thus saith the Lord, the God of hosts, "My ransomed
   shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon
   their heads;" then shall it be said, "His right hand, and his holy arm,
   hath gotten him the victory."

   But, beloved, after the battle is over, the conqueror wipes his brow
   and says, "Ah, but the scattered hosts may rally, and they who were
   driven to-day like chaff before the wind, may rise again, and long may
   be the campaign, and fierce the struggle, before we have stamped out
   the sparks of war. "Sleep on your arms," saith he, "you may be attacked
   to-morrow, be ready for the cry of boot and saddle,' for there may be a
   charge again ere many hours are spent." But not so in this case: the
   victory is crushing, total, final; it is once for ever with evil, with
   darkness, with hell; they shall never again be able to tempt the
   righteous, or to cast them down, or to pale their cheeks with fear;
   they shall never be able again to win the world to their dominion, they
   are routed, routed, routed for ever. Hosts of evil, it is not your heel
   that is bruised--your head is broken; the Lord hath used his people as
   his battle-axe and his weapons of war, and he hath cleft ye and left ye
   without might or strength for ever and for ever. So, dear friends, this
   is our joy and comfort, that once the battle over, the whole campaign
   is ended; there shall be no further onslaughts; we rest eternally; we
   triumph everlastingly; no more fights to risk, no more conflicts in
   which to tug and strive. This shall be the note that shall ring
   throughout the arches of eternity--"The Lord's right hand, and his holy
   arm, hath gotten him the victory for ever and for ever."

   I think these are two good reasons why I should say this victory is
   transcendent--there is none to dispute it, and there is nothing to mar
   it.

   But yet further we will venture to enlarge upon this victory by shewing
   its particulars. The ultimate triumph and victory of God in all his
   purposes will lie in several things. How glorious the fact that all
   whom he ordained to save are saved! Calling was the first work which he
   wrought in them; they were called every one of them, but like the rest
   of mankind they would not come; their wills were so desperate that they
   resisted long; the minister preached at them; their mother wept over
   them; their father entreated them; providence came and hewed them;
   afflictions broke them in pieces, and they were unsaved still; but not
   in one case where God ordains to call has the calling failed. In every
   case where his electing love hath set its purpose, the will is turned
   round, the affections yield, the judgment gives way, the man is
   subdued--he is called, he is quickened. There may be some such here
   to-night, who think, "Well, I never would be saved upon such terms as
   acknowledging the sovereign grace of God, even if he wills to do it."
   Thy will must give way before the crushing force of the will of God. He
   hath mysterious ways of finding an entrance into the most reluctant
   heart, and taking up his throne there for ever.

   How clearly is this victory seen in the subjugation of the lusts and
   passions of the called sinner! He may have been a drunkard, he thought
   he could not give it up, but the rod of iron "dashes in pieces the
   potter's vessel." He may have loved the pleasures of the flesh, they
   were dear to him as his right eye, but grace overcame the most darling
   lust, and threw to the earth the most pampered sin.

   Not less conspicuously will it appear in the perseverance of every
   saint. Not a stone will have been left unturned by the adversary to
   prevent the saints holding on; the caverns of hell will be emptied
   against God's redeemed; Satan and his myrmidons will do their utmost to
   cast them down to destruction, but they shall hold on their way, they
   shall wax stronger and stronger, and when at last the gates of heaven
   shall be fast closed, because there are no more to enter, it shall be
   proclaimed, while devils bite their iron bands in shame, that not a
   soul who was written in the Book of Life was lost, not one whom Jesus
   bought with blood has been unredeemed, not one quickened by grace
   suffered to die, not one who truly began the heavenly race turned aside
   from it, not one concerning whom it was said, "These are mine, and in
   the day when I make up my jewels they shall be mine;" not one of these
   is lost, but all saved, saved eternally. Oh! that will be a splendid
   victory! What can be greater? You that know the conflict through which
   the child of God has to pass will bear me witness that if you get to
   heaven, you will sing with all your might the conqueror's hymn. And I
   think we all should do the same. I remember saying once that if ever I
   got to heaven I would sing the loudest there, for I owed the most to
   sovereign grace. But when I came down stairs, one said to me, "You made
   a mistake, I shall sing more loudly than you, for I owe more than you
   do." And I found that was the general opinion, that each brother and
   each sister thought that he owed most to divine grace. Now, if we are
   all to sing loudest what a shout of triumph there will be! And I
   suppose the verse in our hymn is quite true to the apprehension of each
   of us--

   "Then loudest of the crowd I'll sing,

   While heaven's resounding mansions ring

   With shouts of sovereign grace."

   What a transcendent triumph!

   Not a few shall there be to share the triumph, but a multitude that no
   man can number; for the glory shall be enhanced by the salvation of so
   many. Heaven is none of your narrow places for narrow-hearted bigots.
   No, brethren, our largest imagination never yet could grasp heaven, but
   it will hold multitudes of multitudes. Nor will the praise be any the
   less, when we consider that there were so many of such varied clans and
   climes, some of all kindreds on the face of the earth, swarthy or
   white. There shall be found in heaven the vilest sinner that lived,
   there shall be brought thither the proudest rebel, and the stoutest
   hearted, and the most obstinate of sinners; there shall be such in
   heaven as would have made a wonder in hell, some, I say, who would have
   been such great sinners, had they been suffered to go to hell, that
   their dreadful fall would even hell itself appal, but they are in
   heaven, saved by sovereign grace. And, O beloved! as there are such
   persons, this will help to make the victory grand, that they were saved
   by such means, such simple means, by the simple preaching of the
   gospel; not by wisdom, not by science, not by eloquence, but by the
   simple telling out of the story of the cross. How this will tend to
   make the triumph brighter than it could have been in any other way.

   And, O beloved, this victory will excel all others in the routing of
   such foes, such cruel, such crafty, such mighty, such numerous foes.
   Sin, sin, it is a name of horror--sin o'erthrown. Death--what glooms
   are concentrated in that word!--death destroyed. Satan--what craft,
   what cruelties, what malice linger there--Satan bound hand and foot,
   and led captive. Such a victory over such foes. I find no words in any
   tongue by which I can describe its magnitude. And oh! the results of
   that victory, how bright! Souls knit to Christ by such love, tongues
   tuned to such music, hearts burning with such fire, heaven filled with
   such devout, such holy inhabitants, the ears of Deity regaled with such
   grateful music, heaven filled with such myriads of happy spirits. The
   peaceful results, setting aside the overthrow, will be enough to make
   this victory grander than all the triumphs of men or angels put
   together.

   Say now, and gather up all your enthusiasm to say it--What a victory
   shall that be, when there shall not be a single trophy in the hands of
   the adversary. The victory shall be unparalleled in this, that all the
   success which the enemy thought he had achieved shall only tend to make
   his defeat the more galling, and add lustre to the victorious King of
   kings. You see sometimes hanging up in old minsters tattered flags,
   that were taken from the adversary; sometimes when the report of battle
   comes in, we are told the battle was won, that so many cannon and so
   many flags were left with the enemy. But, O Lord God! thou hast not
   left a single trophy in the hands of thy foe. I said he had no
   prisoners, but he shall not even have a flag, not one truth rent in
   pieces, not one doctrine of revelation hung up to rot in the minsters
   of hell; not one single attribute of God that shall be trailed in the
   mire, not one single truth of Christianity to be laughed at, and
   despised by fiends, not a trophy; there shall not a hair of your head
   perish, not so much as that shall Satan gain, not a bone, not a
   fragment of the saint, either of his body or his spirit--no trophies
   left. And all this will make hell angry, to think that God gave him
   vantage-ground, let him contend with poor feeble men; but God was in
   man, and fought with Satan--man, a poor feeble worm, fought with Satan,
   and, like David, he threw the stone of faith at the giant's head, and
   destroyed him with his own weapons. God hath destroyed death by the
   death of Christ, destroyed sin by the great sin-bearer, yea he has
   destroyed the dragon by the seed of a woman, who bruised his head with
   that very seed whose heel the serpent once did bite. Glory be unto
   thee, O Lord! This is thy victory. The more we muse upon it, the higher
   doth our rapture rise, and the more prepared do our hearts grow to peal
   forth the words of the Psalmist, "His right hand, and his holy arm hath
   gotten him the victory."

   II. Secondly; observe that DEITY IS CONSPICUOUS HERE.

   Man is not made mention of. There is no name of Moses, or of the
   prophets, or of the apostles here; I read not the names of Chrysostom
   and Augustine, nor of those modern fathers of the Church, such as
   Calvin, and Zwingle--the stars are lost in the blaze of the sun. O God!
   how glorious is thy right arm, and how do thy disciples, thy children,
   hide their heads and say, "Not unto us, but unto thy name be all the
   glory!" But mark, beloved, as they are not mentioned it is not because
   the mention need to be avoided, for the more we talk of
   instrumentalities, or rather think about them--(I do not say the more
   we think of them, but the more we think about them)--the more persuaded
   we shall be that it only adds to God's glory to use men, for men are
   such poor tools to work with. You have heard of the celebrated painter
   who gained renown by painting with poor brushes, when the good ones
   were stolen; and Quintin Matsys, who made a cover for the well without
   tools, when all the proper tools were taken away; he wrought the
   ironwork with such poor implements as he could get. So was the skill of
   the painter or artisan admired in that he could produce such effects
   under such disadvantageous conditions. Ah! then what an artist must he
   be! they exclaim concerning the one. And they look upon this piece of
   ironwork, and say of the other, "What! no graving tools, no casting,
   how could he do it?" So when we shall come to look at men, when we look
   at them in the light which eternity shall reveal, we shall say of the
   best of them, "How can the Lord have won such victories with such poor
   things as these!" So that you may mention the instruments every one of
   them, from righteous Abel down to the last preacher of the Word, and
   yet it shall be true, that the victory shall speak the sole praise of
   the General. No doubt, dear friends, this will be a part of the
   splendor of the triumph to think that he did win by man. It was in man
   that Satan conquered: Adam and Eve were led astray by the crafty wiles
   of Satan. It is by man that death came, and by man comes the
   resurrection of the dead. This will be gall and wormwood in the cup of
   the lost, when they shall see the Man Christ Jesus, the seed of the
   woman, sitting at the right hand of God. This is judgment's greatest
   terror, "Hide us from the Lamb;" and this shall be hell's greatest
   horror, "Hide us from the Lamb; let us not behold his face." But glory
   be unto thee, most gracious God, for thou hast lifted man up above all
   the works of thy hands, and given him dominion above all creatures, so
   that principalities and powers are put beneath his feet in the person
   of Christ. And all this only proves that "His own right-hand, and his
   holy arm, hath gotten him the victory."

   I wish I might enlarge here and speak of the conspicuous glory of God
   in this respect, that all the persons of the Trinity will be glorified,
   the Father, the Son, the Spirit. All the attributes of God, his
   unsearchable greatness, and his unrivalled majesty, his grace, his
   power, his truth, his justice, his holiness, his immutability, these
   shall shine forth with resplendent lustre. His wondrous works and his
   terrible acts shall declare his praise; they shall be the theme of
   every tongue, and the topic of every conversation. "Men shall speak of
   the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power." All his decrees shall
   be seen in their final accomplishment, every one of them fulfilled, the
   counsel answering to the providence. Of all that the Father willed, of
   all that the Son performed, of all that the Spirit revealed, not one
   thing is frustrated. How shall I gather up these things? O for the
   voice of a mighty angel! O for a seraph's lip of fire, to speak now of
   the splendor of that last day, when not only the great but the little,
   not only the abundance of God's providence, and the great deeps of his
   counsel, but even the small deeds of his lovingkindness shall be made
   to sing forth his praise, when not only the leviathian deeds of God
   shall make the deep to praise the Lord, but even the little fish that
   move therein, shall leap up to join the chorus, and everywhere from
   everything, for everything, there shall be heard the tune--"His right
   hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory."

   III. We have in our text a third thought, which we can only hint at. In
   all this--HOLINESS WILL BE GLORIFIED.

   Note the adjective,--"His holy arm." When we contemplate any actions of
   God, you will notice that the name which cherubs utter, "Holy, holy,
   holy, Lord God of Sabaoth," is always brought out. Where Christ bears
   sin, and overcomes it, I hear the cry of "Holy, holy, holy," from the
   cross. Where Jesus breaks the tomb, and conquers death, I seem to hear
   the note of "Holy, holy, holy," for it makes the day holy on which the
   deed was done. And when he ascends to glory, and the Father says, "Well
   done," we seem to hear still the note, "Holy, holy, holy." In
   everything, from the manger to the cross, and from the cross onward to
   the crown, holiness becometh God's house, and all God's acts for ever.
   Is it not, dear friends, after all the hinge of the struggle? Is not
   this the point, just as you know in great battles, there is some one
   mountain or hill, which is the object of struggle, not for the value of
   that particular hill, but because on that the battle will depend, so
   holiness is just the point, the rallying point between God and Satan.
   Here are the two war-cries. The hosts of evil cry, "Sin, sin, sin;" but
   the cry of the armies of the Lord of hosts is this, "Holiness,
   holiness, holiness." Every time we strike a blow it is "Holiness;" and
   every time they attack us it is "Sin." Sin is the real object of their
   aim. When Satan attacks, it is to stab at holiness, and when we resist,
   it is to guard holiness, or to drive back his sin. Mark you, this, I
   say, is the point of the battle, and by that ye shall be able to judge
   on which side you are. What is your war-cry? What is your war-cry? When
   Cromwell fought with the soldiers of the covenant at Dunbar, you will
   remember they were distinguished by their cries, on the one side, "The
   Covenant, the Covenant;" and on the other side, "The Lord of hosts, the
   Lord of hosts." And so to-night there is the cry on either side, "Sin
   and the pleasures thereof." Is that your war-cry, friend? You say
   "No,"--how is it then you were at the theater the other night? You say
   "No,"--how is it then you frequent the tavern? You say "No,"--how is it
   then you have got so many misgotten gains about you now? You say,
   "No,"--how is it you make appointments for deeds of sin, and perhaps
   to-night, or to-morrow night, intend to fulfill them? I tell you, sirs,
   there are many of you whose war-cry to-night is "Sin, and the pleasures
   thereof." On the other hand, I trust there are not a few in this vast
   throng, who can say, "Oh! sir, feebly though I speak it, yet my war"
   cry is Holiness, and the cross'"--that goeth with it, "Holiness, and
   the cross." Ah! beloved you are just now on the side that is laughed
   at, the world points at you and says, "There are your saints." Yes,
   here they are, sir, what dare you say against them? Abide your time,
   man, and have your jeering out; ye shall change that laugh for
   everlasting howlings by-and-bye. "There are your Methodists; there are
   your hypocritical professors." What, sir, dare you say it? The servants
   of the living God will know how to answer you in that day, when their
   king shall be revealed in the clouds of heaven, and his glory shall be
   manifest, and they shall share his triumph, and all flesh shall see it,
   for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. The world knoweth us not,
   because it knew him not. "It doth not yet appear what we shall be, but
   when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he
   is." Come, we will pass that question again to-night, "What is your
   war-cry?" There has been a good deal of wickedness these last few days
   in London. I love to see holy mirth; I delight to see men well feasted.
   I like Christmas; I wish it came six times a-year. I like the
   generosity of those who give to the poor. Let it be extended. I would
   not stop a smile. God forbid me! But cannot men be happy without
   drunkenness? cannot they be mirthful without blasphemy? Is there no
   possibility of being happy without lasciviousness? Are there no other
   ways of finding true pleasure besides selling your soul to the devil? O
   sirs! I say there have been thousands in this huge city who have been
   going about the streets, and whose cry has been, "Sin, and the
   pleasures thereof! Where is the music-hall? Where is the Casino? Where
   is the Coal Hole? Where is the tavern? Where is the ball-room? Sin, and
   the pleasures thereof." O Satan! thou hast many soldiers, and right
   brave soldiers they are, and never are they afraid of thy cause, nor
   ashamed of thy name nor of thy unholy work. Ay, thou art well served, O
   prince of hell! and rich will be thy wages when thy drudges earn the
   fire for which they have labored. But I hope and trust there are some
   to-night who will change their watch-note. Ye have not nailed your
   colors to the mast, have you? Even if you have, by God's grace I would
   pull the nails out. Are ye determined to die? Will you serve the black
   prince for ever, and perish with him? Jesus Emmanuel, the captain of
   our salvation, bids me cry to you, "Enlist beneath my banner." Believe
   in him, trust in him, and live. Oh! trust the merit of the cross, the
   virtue of the blood, the tears, and the dying groans. This it is to be
   a Christian, and ever afterwards this shall be your
   war-note--"Holiness, and the cross thereof!" O take this, all! Fear
   not. The cross with holiness will bring the mortifying of the flesh,
   the shame of the world, and the reproach of men. Take both, for now the
   battle is raging. But, O my brethren, another crush, and another, and
   another, and another, and we shall gain the top of the hill, and the
   shout of "Holiness and the cross!" shall be answered by the echoes all
   round the world, for everywhere holiness shall be victorious, and men
   shall know the Lord. Ay, and the echoes of heaven shall answer, too,
   and the spirits of the sanctified shall cry, "Holiness, and the crown
   thereof!" Then we will change one word of our watch-note; and as our
   enemies have broken before us and are utterly destroyed; as they melt
   away like the fat of rams; as unto smoke they consume away, we will
   sing for ever, "Holiness, and the crown thereof! holiness, and the
   crown thereof!" But that shall be only one note: this shall be the
   song--"His own right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the
   victory."

   I would that some soul would believe in Jesus to-night, that it might
   share in the victory. I would that young man's heart would be given to
   Christ to-night, or yours yonder. He deserves it of you: if it were
   only his mercy in having spared you, he deserves it. And thou
   greyheaded sinner there, does he not deserve thy heart for sparing thee
   so long? Yield, I pray thee; his love meets thee. Yield; his terrors
   threaten thee. Yield; lay down thy weapons, and be for ever forgiven.
   May God help thee to do it. The Lord prove his sovereignty and his
   power to-night in the conversion of many of his chosen; and unto him
   shall be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.

                            The Procession of Sorrow

   A Sermon

   (No. 497)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, March 1st, 1863, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "And they took Jesus, and led him away."--John 19:16.

   NEXT SATURDAY ALL EYES will be fixed on a great Prince who shall ride
   through our streets with his Royal Bride. To-day I invite your
   attention to another Prince, marching in another fashion through his
   metropolis. London shall see the glory of the one: Jerusalem beheld the
   shame of the other. Come hither, ye lovers of Immanuel, and I will show
   you this great sight--the King of sorrow marching to his throne of
   grief, the cross. I claim for the procession of my Lord an interest
   superior to the pageant you are now so anxiously expecting. Will your
   Prince be sumptuously arrayed? Mine is adorned with garments crimsoned
   with his own blood. Will your Prince be decorated with honors? Behold,
   my King is not without his crown--alas, a crown of thorns set with ruby
   drops of blood! Will your thoroughfares be thronged? So were the
   streets of Jerusalem; for great multitudes followed him. Will ye raise
   a clamor of tumultuous shouting? Such a greeting had the Lord of glory,
   but alas, it was not the shout of welcome, but the yell of "Away with
   him! away with him." High in the air ye bid your banners wave about the
   heir of England's throne, but how shall ye rival the banner of the
   sacred cross, that day for the first time borne among the sons of men.
   For the thousands of eyes which shall gaze upon the youthful Prince, I
   offer the gaze of men and angels. All nations gathered about my Lord,
   both great and mean men clustered around his person. From the sky the
   angels viewed him with wonder and amazement; the spirits of the just
   looked from the windows of heaven upon the scene, yea, the great God
   and Father watched each movement of his suffering Son. But ye ask me
   where is the spouse, the king's daughter fair and beautiful? My Lord is
   not altogether without his espoused one. The Church, the bride of
   Christ, was there conformed to the image of her Lord; she was there, I
   say, in Simon, bearing the cross, and in the women weeping and
   lamenting. Say not that the comparison is strained, for in a moment I
   will withdraw it and present the contrast. Grant me only thus much of
   likeness: we have here a Prince with his bride, bearing his banner, and
   wearing his royal robes, traversing the streets of his own city,
   surrounded by a throng who shout aloud, and a multitude who gaze with
   interest profound. But how vast was the disparity! The most careless
   eye discerns it. Yonder young Prince is ruddy with the bloom of early
   youth and health; my Master's visage is more marred than that of any
   man. See, it has been blackened with bruises, and stained with the
   shameful spittle of them that derided him. Your heir of royalty is
   magnificently drawn along the streets in his stately chariot, sitting
   at his ease: my princely sufferer walks with weary feet, marking the
   road with crimson drops; not borne, but bearing; not carried, but
   carrying his cross. Your Prince is surrounded by a multitude of
   friends; hark how they joyously welcome him! And well they may; the son
   of such noble parents deserves a nation's love. But my Prince is hated
   without a cause. Hark how their loud voices demand that he should be
   hastened to execution! How harshly grate the cruel syllables, "Crucify
   him! crucify him!" Your noble Prince is preparing for his marriage:
   mine is hastening to his doom. Oh, shame that men should find so much
   applause for Princes and none for the King of kings. Yet, dear friends,
   to some eyes there will be more attraction in the procession of sorrow,
   of shame, and of blood, than in you display of grandeur and joy. Oh! I
   pray you, lend your ears to such faint words as I can utter on a
   subject all too high for me, the march of the world's Maker along the
   way of his great sorrow; your Redeemer traversing the rugged path of
   suffering, along which he went with heaving heart and heavy footsteps,
   that he might pave a royal road of mercy for his enemies.

   I. After our Lord Jesus Christ had been formally condemned by Pilate,
   our text tells us he was led away. I invite your attention to CHRIST AS
   LED FORTH.

   Pilate, as we reminded you, scourged our Savior according to the common
   custom of Roman courts. The lictors executed their cruel office upon
   his shoulders with their rods and scourges, until the stripes had
   reached the full number. Jesus is formally condemned to crucifixion,
   but before he is led away he is given over to the Praetorian guards
   that those rough legionaries may insult him. It is said that a German
   regiment was at that time stationed in Judea, and I should not wonder
   if they were the lineal ancestors of those German theologians of modern
   times who have mocked the Savior, tampered with revelation, and cast
   the vile spittle of their philosophy into the face of truth. The
   soldiery mocked and insulted him in every way that cruelty and scorn
   could devise. The platted crown of thorns, the purple robe, the reed
   with which they smote him, and the spittle with which they disfigured
   him, all these marked the contempt in which they held the King of the
   Jews. The reed was no mere rush from the brook, it was of a stouter
   kind, of which easterns often make walkingstaves, the blows were cruel
   as well as insulting; and the crown was not of straw but thorn, hence
   it produced pain as well as pictured scorn. When they had mocked him
   they pulled off the purple garment he had worn, this rough operation
   would cause much pain. His wounds unstaunched and raw, fresh bleeding
   from beneath the lash, would make this scarlet robe adhere to him, and
   when it was dragged off; his gashes would bleed anew. We do not read
   that they removed the crown of thorns, and therefore it is most
   probable, though not absolutely certain, that our Savior wore it along
   the Via Dolorosa, and also bore it upon his head when he was fastened
   to the cross. Those pictures which represent our Lord as wearing the
   crown of thorns upon the tree have therefore at least some scriptural
   warrant. They put his own clothes upon him, because they were the
   perquisites of the executioner, as modern hangmen take the garments of
   those whom they execute, so did the four soldiers claim a right to his
   raiment. They put on him his own clothes that the multitudes might
   discern him to be the same man, the very man who had professed to be
   the Messias. We all know that a different dress will often raise a
   doubt about the identity of an individual; but lo! the people saw him
   in the street, not arrayed in the purple robe, but wearing his garment
   without seam, woven from the top throughout, the common smock-frock, in
   fact, of the countrymen of Palestine, and they said at once, "Yes, tis
   he, the man who healed the sick, and raised the dead; the mighty
   teacher who was wont to sit upon the mountain-top, or stand in the
   temple courts and preach with authority, and not as the Scribes." There
   can be no shadow of doubt but that our Lord was really crucified, and
   no one substituted for him. How they led him forth we do not know.
   Romish expositors, who draw upon their prolific fancy for their facts,
   tell us that he had a rope about his neck with which they roughly
   dragged him to the tree; this is one of the most probable of their
   surmises, since it was not unusual for the Romans thus to conduct
   criminals to the gallows. We care, however, far more for the fact that
   he went forth carrying his cross upon his shoulders. This was intended
   at once to proclaim his guilt and intimate his doom. Usually the crier
   went before with an announcement such as this, "This is Jesus of
   Nazareth, King of the Jews, who for making himself a King, and stirring
   up the people, has been condemned to die." This cross was a ponderous
   machine; not so heavy, perhaps, as some pictures would represent it,
   but still no light burden to a man whose shoulders were raw with the
   lashes of the Roman scourge. He had been all night in agony, he had
   spent the early morning at the hall of Caiaphas, he had been hurried,
   as I described to you last Sunday, from Caiaphas to Pilate, from Pilate
   to Herod, and from Herod back again to Pilate; he had, therefore, but
   little strength left, and you will not wonder that by-and-bye we find
   him staggering beneath his load, and that another is called to bear it
   with him. He goes forth, then, bearing his cross.

   What learn we here as we see Christ led forth? Do we not see here the
   truth of that which was set forth in shadow by the scape-goat? Did not
   the high-priest bring the scape-goat, and put both his hands upon its
   head, confessing the sins of the people, that thus those sins might be
   laid upon the goat? Then the goat was led away by a fit man into the
   wilderness, and it carried away the sins of the people, so that if they
   were sought for, they could not be found. Now we see Jesus brought
   before the priests and rulers, who pronounce him guilty; God himself
   imputes our sins to him; he was made sin for us; and, as the substitute
   for our guilt, bearing our sin upon his shoulders--for that cross was a
   sort of representation in wood of our guilt and doom--we see the great
   Scape-goat led away by the appointed officers of justice. Bearing upon
   his back the sin of all his people, the offering goes without the camp.
   Beloved, can you say he carried your sin? As you look at the cross upon
   his shoulders does it represent your sin? Oh I raise the question, and
   be not satisfied unless you can answer it most positively in the
   affirmative. There is one way by which you can tell whether he carried
   your sin or not. Hast thou laid thy hand upon his head, confessed thy
   sin, and trusted in him? Then thy sin lies not on thee; not one single
   ounce or drachma of it lies on thee; it has all been transferred by
   blessed imputation to Christ, and he bears it on his shoulder in the
   form of yonder heavy cross. What joy, what satisfaotion this will give
   if we can sing--

   "My soul looks back to see

   The burden thou didst bear,

   When hastening to the accursed tree,

   And knows her guilt was there!"

   Do not let the picture vanish till you have satisfied yourselves once
   for all that Christ was here the substitute for you.

   Let us muse upon the fact that Jesus was conducted without the gates of
   the city. It was the common place of death. That little rising ground,
   which perhaps was called Golgotha, the place of a skull, from its
   somewhat resembling the crown of a man's skull, was the common place of
   execution. It was one of Death's castles; here he stored his gloomiest
   trophies; he was the grim lord of that stronghold. Our great hero, the
   destroyer of Death, bearded the lion in his den, slew the monster in
   his own castle, and dragged the dragon captive from his own den.
   Methinks Death thought it a splendid triumph when he saw the Master
   impaled and bleeding in the dominions of destruction; little did he
   know that the grave was to be rifled, and himself destroyed, by that
   crucified Son of man.

   Was not the Redeemer led thither to aggravate his shame? Calvary was
   like our Old Bailey; it was the usual place of execution for the
   district. Christ must die a felon's death, and it must be upon the
   felon's gallows, in the place where horrid crimes had met their due
   reward. This added to his shame; but, methinks, in this, too, he draws
   the nearer to us, "He was numbered with the transgressors, and bare the
   sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors."

   But further, my brethren; this, I think, is the great lesson from
   Christ's being slaughtered without the gate of the city--let us go
   forth, therefore, without the camp, bearing his reproach. You see there
   the multitude are leading him forth from the temple. He is not allowed
   to worship with them. The ceremonial of the Jewish religion denies him
   any participation in its pomps; the priests condemn him never again to
   tread the hallowed floors, never again to look upon the consecrated
   altars in the place of his people's worship. He is exiled from their
   friendship, too. No man dare call him friend now, or whisper a word of
   comfort to him. Nay more; he is banished from their society, as if he
   were a leper whose breath would be infectious whose presence would
   scatter plague. They force him without the walls, and are not satisfied
   till they have rid themselves of his obnoxious presence. For him they
   have no tolerance. Barrabas may go free; the thief and the murderer may
   be spared; but for Christ there is no word, but "Away with such a
   fellow from the earth! It is not fit that he should live." Jesus is
   therefore hunted out of the city, beyond the gate, with the will and
   force of his oven nation, but he journeys not against his own will;
   even as the lamb goeth as willingly to the shambles as to the meadow,
   so doth Christ cheerfully take up his cross and go without the camp.
   See, brethren, here is a picture of what we may expect from men if we
   are faithful to our Master. It is not likely that we shall be able to
   worship with their worship. They prefer a ceremonial pompous and gaudy;
   the swell of music, the glitter of costly garments, the parade of
   learning all these must minister grandeur to the world's religion, and
   thus shut out the simple followers of the Lamb. The high places of
   earth's worship and honor are not for us. If we be true to our Master
   we shall soon lose the friendship of the world. The sinful find our
   conversation distasteful; in our pursuits the carnal have no interest;
   things dear to us are dross to worldlings, while things precious to
   them are contemptible to us. There have been times, and the days may
   come again, when faithfulness to Christ has entailed exclusion from
   what is called "society." Even now to a large extent the true Christian
   is like a Pariah, lower than the lowest caste, in the judgment of some.
   The world has in former days counted it God's service to kill the
   saints. We are to reckon upon all this, and should the worst befal us,
   it is to be no strange thing to us. These are silken days, and religion
   fights not so stern a battle. I will not say it is because we are
   unfaithful to our Master that the world is more kind to us, but I half
   suspect it is, and it is very possible that if we were more thoroughly
   Christians the world would more heartily detest us, and if we would
   cleave more closely to Christ we might expect to receive more slander,
   more abuse, less tolerance, and less favor from men. You young
   believers, who have lately followed Christ, should father and mother
   forsake you, remember you were bidden to reckon upon it; should
   brothers and sisters deride, you must put this down as part of the cost
   of being a Christian. Godly working-men, should your employers or your
   fellow-workers frown upon you; wives, should your husbands threaten to
   cast you out, remember, without the camp was Jesus' place, and without
   the camp is yours. Oh! ye Christian men, who dream of trimming your
   sails to the wind, who seek to win the world's favor, I do beseech you
   cease from a course so perilous. We are in the world, but we must never
   be of it; we are not to be secluded like monks in the cloister, but we
   are to be separated like Jews among Gentiles; men, but not of men;
   helping, aiding, befriending, teaching, comforting, instructing, but
   not sinning either to escape a frown or to win a smile. The more
   manifestly there shall be a great gulf between the Church and the
   world, the better shall it be for both; the better for the world, for
   it shall be thereby warned; the better for the Church, for it shall be
   thereby preserved. Go ye, then, like the Master, expecting to be
   abused, to wear an ill-name, and to earn reproach; go ye, like him,
   without the camp.

   II. Let us now gaze for awhile upon CHRIST CARRYING HIS CROSS.

   I have shown you, believer, your position; let me now show you your
   service. Christ comes forth from Pilate's hall with the cumbrous wood
   upon his shoulder, but through weariness he travels slowly, and his
   enemies urgent for his death, and half afraid, from his emaciated
   appearance, that he may die before he reaches the place of execution,
   allow another to carry his burden. The tender mercies of the wicked are
   cruel, they cannot spare him the agonies of dying on the cross, they
   will therefore remit the labor of carrying it. They place the cross
   upon Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country. We do not know what
   may have been the color of alimony face, but it was most likely black.
   Simon was an African; he came from Cyrene. Alas poor African, thou hast
   been compelled to carry the cross even until now. Hail, ye despised
   children of the sun, ye follow first after the King in the march of
   woe. We are not sure that Simon was a disciple of Christ; he may have
   been a friendly spectator; yet one would think the Jews would naturally
   select a disciple if they could. Coming fresh from the country, not
   knowing what was going on, he joined with the mob, and they made him
   carry the cross. Whether a disciple then or not, we have every reason
   to believe that he became so afterwards; he was the father, we read, of
   Alexander and Rufus, two persons who appear to have been well known in
   the early Church; let us hope that salvation came to his house when he
   was compelled to bear the Savior's cross.

   Dear friends, we must remember that, although no one died on the cross
   with Christ, for atonement must be executed by a solitary Savior, yet
   another person did carry the cross for Christ; for this world, while
   redeemed by price by Christ, and by Christ alone, is to be redeemed by
   divine power manifested in the sufferings and labors of the saints as
   well as those of Christ. Mark you, the ransom of men was all paid by
   Christ; that was redemption by price. But power is wanted to dash down
   those idols, to overcome the hosts of error; where is it to be found?
   In the Lord of Hosts, who shows his power in the sufferings of Christ
   and of his Church. The Church must suffer, that the gospel may be
   spread by her means. This is what the Apostle meant when he said, "I
   fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh
   for his body's sake, which is the Church." There was nothing behind in
   the price, but there is something behind in the manifested power, and
   we must continue to fill up that measure of revealed power, carrying
   each one of us the cross with Christ, till the last shame shall have
   been poured upon his cause, and he shall reign for ever and ever. We
   see in Simon's carrying the cross a picture of what the Church is to do
   throughout all generations. Mark then, Christian, Jesus does not suffer
   so as to exclude your suffering. He bears a cross, not that you may
   escape it, but that you may endure it. Christ does exempt you from sin,
   but not from sorrow; he does take the curse of the cross, but he does
   not take the cross of the curse away from you. Remember that, and
   expect to suffer.

   Beloved, let us comfort ourselves with this thought, that in our case,
   as in Simon's, it is not our cross, but Christ's cross which we carry.
   When you are molested for your piety; when your religion brings the
   trial of cruel mockings upon you; then remember, it is not your cross,
   it is Christ's cross; and how delightful is it to carry the cross of
   our Lord Jesus?

   You carry the cross after him. You have blessed company; your path is
   marked with footprints of your Lord. If you will look, there is the
   mark of his blood-red shoulder upon that heavy cross. Tis his cross,
   and he goes before you as a shepherd goes before his sheep. Take up
   your cross daily and follow him.

   Do not forget, also, that you bear this cross in partnership. It is the
   opinion of some commentators that Simon only carried one end of the
   cross, and not the whole of it. That is very possible; Christ may have
   carried the heavier end, against the transverse beam, and Simon may
   have borne the lighter end. Certainly it is so with you; you do but
   carry the light end of the cross; Christ bore the heavier end.

   "His way was much rougher and darker than mine;

   Did Christ, my Lord, suffer, and shall I repine?"

   Rutherford says, "Whenever Christ gives us a cross, he cries, Halves,
   my love.'" Others think that Simon carried the whole of the cross. If
   he carried all the cross, yet he only carried the wood of it; he did
   not bear the sin which made it such a load. Christ did but transfer to
   Simon the outward frame, the mere tree; but the curse of the tree,
   which was our sin and its punishment, rested on Jesus' shoulders still.
   Dear friend, if you think that you suffer all that a Christian can
   suffer; if all God's billows roll over you, yet, remember, there is not
   one drop of wrath in all your sea of sorrow. Jesus took the wrath;
   Jesus carried the sin; and now all that you endure is but for his sake,
   that you may be conformed unto his image, and may aid in gathering his
   people into his family.

   Although Simon carried Christ's cross, he did not volunteer to do it,
   but they compelled him. I fear me, beloved, I fear me that the most of
   us if we ever do carry it, carry it by compulsion, at least when it
   first comes on to our shoulders we do not like it, and would fain run
   from it, but the world compels us to bear Christ's cross. Cheerfully
   accept this burden, ye servants of the Lord. I do not think we should
   seek after needless persecution. That man is a fool and deserves no
   pity, who purposely excites the disgust of other people. No, no; we
   must not make a cross of our own. Let there be nothing but your
   religion to object to, and then if that offends them let them be
   offended, it is a cross which you must carry joyfully.

   Though Simon had to bear the cross for a very little while, it gave him
   lasting honor. I do not know how far it was from Pilate's house to the
   Mount of Doom. Romanists pretend to know; in fact they know the very
   spot where Veronica wiped the blessed face with her handkerchief, and
   found his likeness impressed upon it; we also know very well where that
   was not done; in fact they know the very spot where Jesus fainted, and
   if you go to Jerusalem you can see all these different places if you
   only carry enough credulity with you; but the fact is the city has been
   so razed, and burned, and ploughed, that there is little chance of
   distinguishing any of these positions, with the exception, it may be,
   of Mount Calvary, which being outside the walls may possibly still
   remain. The Via Dolorosa, as the Romanists call it, is a long street at
   the present time, but it may have been but a few yards. Simon had to
   carry the cross but for a very little time, yet his name is in this
   Book for ever, and we may envy him his honor. Well, beloved, the cross
   we have to carry is only for a little while at most. A few times the
   sun will go up and down the hill; a few more moons will wax and wane,
   and then we shall receive the glory. "I reckon that these light
   afflictions, which are but for a moment, are not worthy to be compared
   with the glory which shall be revealed in us." We should love the
   cross, and count it very dear, because it works out for us a far more
   exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Christians, will you refuse to
   be cross-bearers for Christ? I am ashamed of some professed Christians,
   heartily ashamed of them! Some of them have no objection to worship
   with a poor congregation till they grow rich, and then, forsooth, they
   must go with the world's church, to mingle with fashion and gentility.
   There are some who in company hold their tongues, and never say a good
   word for Christ. They take matters very gently; they think it
   unnecessary to be soldiers of the cross. "He that taketh not up his
   cross and followeth not after me," says Christ, "is not worthy of me."
   Some of you will not be baptized because you think people will say, "He
   is a professor; how holy he ought to be." I am glad the world expects
   much from us, and watches us narrowly. All this is a blessed clog upon
   us, and a means of keeping us more near the Lord. Oh! you that are
   ashamed of Christ, how can you read that text, "He that is ashamed of
   me, and of my words, of him will I be ashamed when I come in the glory
   of my Father, and all my holy angels with me." Conceal your religion?
   Cover it with a cloak? God forbid! Our religion is our glory; the Cross
   of Christ is our honor, and, while not ostentatiously parading it, as
   the Pharisees do, we ought never to be so cowardly as to conceal it.
   "Come ye out from among them, and be ye separate, and touch not the
   unclean thing." Take up your cross, and go without the camp, following
   your Lord, even until death.

   III. I have now a third picture to present to you--CHRIST AND HIS
   MOURNERS.

   As Christ went through the streets, a great multitude looked on. In the
   multitude there was a sparse sprinkling of tender-hearted women,
   probably those who had been healed, or whose children had been blessed
   by him. Some of these were persons of considerable rank; many of them
   had ministered to him of their substance; amidst the din and howling of
   the crowd, and the noise of the soldiery, they raised an exceeding loud
   and bitter cry, like Rachel weeping for her children, who would not be
   comforted, because they were not. The voice of sympathy prevailed over
   the voice of scorn. Jesus paused, and said, "Daughters of Jerusalem,
   weep not for me; but weep for yourselves and for your children." The
   sorrow of these good women was a very proper sorrow; Jesus did not by
   any means forbid it, he only recommended another sorrow as being
   better; not finding fault with this, but still commending that. Let me
   show what I think he meant. Last Sunday the remark was made to me--"If
   the story of the sufferings of Christ had been told of any other man,
   all the congregation would have been in tears." Some of us, indeed,
   confess that, if we had read this narrative of suffering in a romance,
   we should have wept copiously, but the story of Christ's sufferings
   does not cause the excitement and emotion one would expect. Now, I am
   not sure that we ought to blame ourselves for this. If we weep for the
   sufferings of Christ in the same way as we lament the sufferings of
   another man, our emotions will be only natural, and may work no good.
   They would be very proper, very proper; God forbid that we should stay
   them, except with the gentle words of Christ, "Daughters of Jerusalem,
   weep not for me." The most Scriptural way to describe the sufferings of
   Christ is not by laboring to excite sympathy through highly-coloured
   descriptions of his blood and wounds. Romanists of all ages have
   wrought upon the feelings of the people in this manner, and to a degree
   the attempt is commendable, but if it shall all end in tears of pity,
   no good is done. I have heard sermons, and studied works by Romish
   writers upon the passion and agony, which have moved me to copious
   tears, but I am not clear that all the emotion was profitable. I show
   unto you a more excellent way.

   What, then, dear friends, should be the sorrows excited by a view of
   Christ's sufferings? They are these--Weep not because the Savior bled,
   but because your sins made him bleed.

   "Twere you my sins, my cruel sins,

   His chief tormentors were;

   Each of my grimes became a nail,

   And unbelief the spear."

   When a brother makes confession of his transgressions, when on his
   knees before God he humbles himself with many tears, I am sure the Lord
   thinks far more of the tears of repentance than he would do of the mere
   drops of human sympathy. "Weep for yourselves," says Christ, "rather
   than for me."

   The sufferings of Christ should make us weep over those who have
   brought that blood upon their heads. We ought not to forget the Jews.
   Those once highly favored people of God who cursed themselves with,
   "His blood be upon us and upon our children," ought to make us mourn
   when we think of their present degradation. There are no passages in
   all the public ministry of Jesus so tender as those which have regard
   to Jerusalem. It is not sorrow over Rome, but Jerusalem. I believe
   there was a tenderness in Christ's heart to the Jew of a special
   character. He loved the Gentile, but still Jerusalem was the city of
   the Great King. It was, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have
   gathered thy children together as a hen gathereth her chickens under
   her wings, but ye would not!" He saw its streets flowing like bloody
   rivers; he saw the temple naming up to heaven; he marked the walls
   loaded with Jewish captives crucified by command of Titus; he saw the
   city razed to the ground and sown with salt, and he said, "Weep not for
   me, but for yourselves and for your children, for the day shall come
   when ye shall say to the rocks, Hide us, and to the mountains, Fall
   upon us."

   Let me add, that when we look at the sufferings of Christ, we ought to
   sorrow deeply for the souls of all unregenerate men and women.
   Remember, dear friends, that what Christ suffered for us, these
   unregenerate ones must suffer for themselves, except they put their
   trust in Christ. The woes which broke the Savior's heart must crush
   theirs. Either Christ must die for me, or else I must die for myself
   the second death; if he did not carry the curse for me, then on me must
   it rest for ever and ever. Think, dear friends, there are some in this
   congregation who as yet have no interest in Jesu's blood, some sitting
   next to you, your nearest friends who, if they were now to close their
   eyes in death, would open them in hell! Think of that! Weep not for
   him, but for these. Perhaps they are your children, the objects of your
   fondest love, with no interest in Christ, without God and without hope
   in the world! Save your tears for them; Christ asks them not in
   sympathy for himself. Think of the millions in this dark world! It is
   calculated that one soul passes from time into eternity every time the
   clock ticks! So numerous has the family of man now become, that there
   is a death every second; and when we know how very smell a proportion
   of the human race have even nominally received the cross--and there is
   none other name given under heaven among men whereby we must be
   saved--oh! what a black thought crosses our mind! What a cataract of
   immortal souls dashes downwards to the pit every hour! Well might the
   Master say, "Weep not for me, but for yourselves." You have, then, no
   true sympathy for Christ if you have not an earnest sympathy with those
   who would win souls for Christ. You may sit under a sermon, and feel a
   great deal, but your feeling is worthless unless it leads you to weep
   for yourselves and for your children. How has it been with you? Have
   you repented of sin? Have you prayed for your fellow men? If not, may
   that picture of Christ fainting in the streets lead you to do so this
   morning.

   IV. In the fourth place, one or two words upon CHRIST'S
   FELLOW-SUFFERERS.

   There were two other cross-bearers in the throng; they were
   malefactors; their crosses were just as heavy as the Lord's, and yet,
   at least, one of them had no sympathy with him, and his bearing the
   cross only led to his death, and not to his salvation. This hint only.
   I have sometimes met with persons who have suffered much; they have
   lost money, they have worked hard all their lives, or they have laid
   for years upon a bed of sickness, and they therefore suppose that
   because they have suffered so much in this life, they shall thus escape
   the punishment of sin hereafter. I tell you, sirs, that yonder
   malefactor carried his cross and died on it; and you will carry your
   sorrows, and be damned with them, except you repent. That impenitent
   thief went from the cross of his great agony--and it was agony indeed
   to die on a cross--he went to that place, to the flames of hell; and
   you, too, may go from the bed of sickness, and from the abode of
   poverty, to perdition, quite as readily as from the home of ease and
   the house of plenty. No sufferings of ours have anything to do with the
   atonement of sin. No blood but that which He has spilt, no groans but
   those which came from His heart, no suffering but that which was
   endured by Him, can ever make a recompense for sin. Shake off the
   thought, any of you who suppose that God will have pity on you because
   you have endured affliction. You must consider Jesus, and not yourself;
   turn your eye to Christ, the great substitute for sinners, but never
   dream of trusting in yourselves. You may think that this remark is not
   needed; but I have met with one or two cases where it was required; and
   I have often said I would preach a sermon for even one person, and,
   therefore, I make this remark, even though it should rebuke but one.

   V. I close with THE SAVIOR'S WARNING QUESTION--"If they do these things
   in the green tree, what will they do in the dry?" Among other things
   methinks he meant this--"If I, the innocent substitute for sinners,
   suffer thus, what will be done when the sinner himself--the dry
   tree--whose sins are his own, and not merely imputed to him, shall fall
   into the hands of an angry God." Oh! ye unregenerate men and women, and
   there are not a few such here now, remember that when God saw Christ in
   the sinner's place he did not spare him, and when he finds you without
   Christ, he will not spare you. You have seen Jesus led away by his
   enemies; so shall you be dragged away by fiends to the place appointed
   for you. "Deliver him to the tormentors," was the word of the king in
   the parable; it shall be fulfilled to you--"Depart ye cursed into
   everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." Jesus was
   deserted of God; and if he, who was only imputedly a sinner, was
   deserted, how much more shall you be? "Eloi, Eloi, lama
   sabachthani,"--what an awful shriek! But what shall be your cry when
   you shall say, "Good God! good God! why hast thou forsaken me?" and the
   answer shall come back, "Because I have called, and ye refused; I have
   stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set at nought
   all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your
   calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh." These are awful words,
   but they are not mine; they are the very words of God in Scripture. Oh!
   sinner, if God hides his face from Christ, how much less will he spare
   you! He did not spare his Son the stripes. Did I not describe last
   Sabbath the knotted scourges which fell upon the Saviours back? What
   whips of steel for you, what knots of burning wire for you, when
   conscience shall smite you, when the law shall scourge you with its
   ten-thonged whip! Oh! who would stand in your place, ye richest, ye
   merriest, ye most self-righteous sinners--who would stand in your place
   when God shall say, "Awake O sword against the rebel, against the man
   that rejected me; smite him, and let him feel the smart for ever!"
   Christ was spit upon with shame; sinner, what shame will be yours! The
   whole universe shall hiss you; angels shall be ashamed of you; your own
   friends, yes, your sainted mother, shall say "Amen" to your
   condemnation; and those who loved you best shall sit as assessors with
   Christ to judge you and condemn you! I cannot roll up into one word all
   the mass of sorrows which met upon the head of Christ who died for us,
   therefore it is impossible for me to tell you what streams, what oceans
   of grief must roll over your spirit if you die as you now are. You may
   die so, you may die now. There are more unlikely things than that you
   will be dead before next Sunday. Some of you will! It does not often
   happen that five or six thousand people meet together twice; it never
   does, I suppose; the scythe of death must cut some of you down before
   my voice shall warn you again! Oh! souls, I do beseech you, by the
   agonies of Christ, by his wounds and by his blood, do not bring upon
   yourselves the curse; do not bear in your own persons the awful wrath
   to come! May God deliver you! Trust in the Son of God and you shall
   never die.

   The Lord bless you, for Jesu's own sake. Amen.

                       The Gladness of the Man of Sorrows

   A Sermon

   (No. 498)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, March 8th, 1863, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy
   God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. All
   thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory
   palaces, whereby they have made thee glad."--Psalm 45:7, 8.

   DURING THE LAST FEW SABBATH-DAYS we have been considering the
   sufferings of our Lord Jesus Christ. We followed him through the agony
   of the garden, the sorrows of the betrayal, the weariness and slander
   of his various trials, the shame and mockery of the soldiery, and the
   sorrows of his cross-bearing progress along the streets of the city. It
   seems fit this morning to make a pause that we may take breath awhile
   in this our pilgrimage of sorrow, and be comforted by a view of the
   glory-land to which the thorny pathway leads. A festive occasion like
   the present may have unfitted your minds for deep contemplations upon
   the Passion, and it may be more congenial with our present mood of
   gladness to meditate upon the glory which followed the shame. The same
   person will be before our eye, but we shall view him in a brighter
   light, we shall see the silver lining of the black cloud of anguish,
   the rich pearls hidden in the stormy deep of his sufferings, and the
   days of heaven which were conceived in the womb of the black night of
   his agony. The Man of Sorrows is the fountain of all joy to others, and
   is the possessor of all the joys of heaven and earth, by virtue of his
   triumphs. He has experienced joys in proportion to his sorrows; as he
   once waded through deep waters of grief he has now climbed to the
   highest mountains of happiness. For the joy that was set before him he
   endured the cross despising the shame, and now having sat down at his
   Father's right-hand he enjoys pleasures for evermore. We have seen our
   David crossing the brook Kedron weeping as he went; shall we not gaze
   upon him as he dances before the ark for joy? We saw him crowned with
   thorns, shall we not go forth to meet him and behold him with the crown
   wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in
   the day of the gladness of his heart? Oh that while we muse upon these
   things our heavenly Father may hear the prayer of our great Advocate
   who once cried on our behalf--"And now come I to thee; and these things
   I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in
   themselves."

   Our text describes the joy poured forth upon our glorious King in a
   twofold manner. Our Lord is first made joyous by his Father--"Thou
   lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God,
   hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows." But
   there is another joy, which he getteth not from one person, but from
   many. Read the next verse--"All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes,
   and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee
   glad." Here both saints and angels unite to swell the ever-deepening,
   and widening river of the Savior's gladness. When we shall have walked
   by these still waters and trodden these green pastures, perhaps we
   shall be prepared to say with the apostle, "And not only so, but we
   also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now
   received the atonement," and we shall be qualified to sing with the
   spouse, "We will rejoice and be glad in thee; Ye will remember thy love
   more than wine; the upright love thee."

   I. Come, my brethren, let us ponder that part of OUR SAVIOR'S JOY WHICH
   IS GIVEN HIM BY HIS FATHER.

   To a degree the Redeemer possessed this joy even while he was here on
   earth. We are not sure that the early life of the Savior was full of
   sorrow. As he grrew in wisdom and in stature, he also grew in favor
   both with God and man; and favor with God and man would probably give
   the youthful Jesus an unusual degree of holy happiness. When he entered
   upon his public ministry, sorrows in troops beset him, so that the
   countenance once fairer than the children of men, became more marred
   than that of any man, and at the age of thirty-two or thirty-three he
   was taken to be near fifty, from the effect of labor, hardship and woe.
   Yet, even in the days of his affliction, the Great Mourner was not
   utterly wretched, even amid the wormwood and the gall there were drops
   of joy. When, in his baptism, the heavens were opened, and the Spirit
   descended, did that divine Dove bring no peace, no comfort upon his
   wings? When the Father bare witness, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I
   am well pleased," did those approving words from the opening heavens
   afford no satisfaction to the mind of the obedient Son? Brethren, the
   perfect nature of our Redeemer could not but rejoice exceedingly in the
   smile of the Father and the descent of the Holy Ghost. When in the
   wilderness, after the forty days of fasting and of temptation, the
   angels ministered unto him, did they bring him no celestial joys, no
   consolations of God? Did he know no secret joys upon the mountain-tops,
   where he communed with God at midnight? Was it no delight to him to
   utter sweet invitations and loving words of mercy? Surely those lips
   were blessed which poured forth benedictions, and there must have been
   some comfort in the hands which bound up the broken-hearted and opened
   the prisons of the captives. We read that Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and
   said, "Father, I thank thee, that thou hast hid these things from the
   wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes; even so, Father,
   for so it seemed good in thy sight." The doctrine of electing love
   stirred the deeps of his great soul, and made the floods clap their
   hands. "The King shall joy in thy strength, O Lord; and in thy
   salvation how greatly shall he rejoice."

   Do you think, brethren, our Savior lived in this world, doing so much
   good, without receiving some joy in his acts of mercy? To teach, to
   labor, and to make men holy, must give joy to a benevolent mind. It
   could not be otherwise than pleasant to a good man to do good. If God
   deligllteth in mercy, surely his express image must do the same. To
   restore the dead to their sorrowing relations, was this no
   satisfaction? Did the widow's grateful eye in the gates of Nain kindle
   no joy-flashes in his heart? Bid the thankfulness of Mary and Martha
   inspire no comfort in the Life-giver? Think you that it was not
   gladsome work to feed the famishing multitudes? Who could look upon the
   feasting thousands without rejoicing? To heal the leper, to restore the
   lame, to give eyes to the blind and ears to the deaf, who could do all
   this and not be happy in distributing the boons? Surely, brethren,
   there were some hosannas in Jesu's ears, and though he could always
   bear the cry of "Crucify him! Crucify him!" yet he must have felt the
   wondrous joy of doing good, which is one of the delights entailed on
   all self-sacrificing lovers of others.

   Bethink you, beloved, of his character, and surely he must have known
   the joy of being good; for there is a deep gladness in holiness, a
   blessed peacefulness in righteousness. The holiness of angels is their
   happiness, and although to a large degree the Savior laid his peace
   aside, yet there is a rest of soul from which virtue cannot separate.
   Distractions of conscience he never knew, disturbance of mind, on
   account of sin he did not feel on his own account, although as our
   substitute he was made sin for us. He suffered. Mark, I am not for a
   moment detracting from his sufferings, high mountains of grief I see;
   the eagle's wing cannot reach their summit, nor foot of angel climb
   their brows; but lo, I see leaping streams of pleasure running adown
   the rugged steeps, and amid the hollows of the desolate hills I gaze
   upon deep lakes of joy unfathomable by mortal line.

   Brethren, we have every reason to believe that our Savior permanently
   found a solace while on earth, in the consideration that he was doing
   his Father's will. He said, "It is my meat and my drink, to do the will
   of him that sent me." "Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's
   business?" On several occasions the voice from heaven proclaimed the
   Father's good pleasure in his only begotten: once the glory of heaven
   enwraps him on the holy mount; and during his whole life he had the
   presence of God until the moment of necessary desertion, when we find
   him, for the first and only time, crying, "My God, my God, why hast
   thou forsaken me!" To do a work which he had contemplated from all
   eternity, to engage in an occupation which had always been most
   delightful in prospect, could not have been altogether and only
   sorrowful. It was a Passover with many bitter herbs, but with desire
   had he desired to eat of it. It was a baptism, and a baptism of blood,
   but he was straitened until it was accomplished. Of old, in expectation
   his delights were with the sons of men. Were there none in the work?
   Brethren, let your Lord speak for himself--"Lo, I come: in the volume
   of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God:
   yea, thy law is within my heart."

   In the glorious prospect which this great work opened to him when it
   should he completed, I am absolutely sure our Savior found comfort.
   Think not I speak too strongly; I have scriptural warrant. Turn to the
   twenty-second Psalm, which is the soliloquy of Christ upon the cross,
   and you find him, after he bemoaned his desolate condition, comforting
   himself thus, "All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto
   he Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.
   All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go
   down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own
   soul. A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a
   generation. They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a
   people that shall be born, that he hath done this." He saw with
   prescient eye through the thick darkness which enveloped the cross, the
   rising of the bright sun of heaven's eternal noon. He saw, when he hung
   upon the cross, not only the mocking eyes of multitudes of enemies, but
   the loving eyes of millions of souls whom he should redeem from hell;
   he heard not only the shouts of the ribald mob, but the songs of
   blood-redeemed spirits. When he saw the lions and heard them roar, was
   it not a comfort to the shepherd that he had kept the sheep, and none
   of them had perished. Indeed, my brethren, there is more than enough of
   evidence to prove that a rich anointing of gladness rested on the head
   of the Man of Sorrows.

   Still, dear friends, this may be viewed by some as a moot point; we
   allow that there is room for difference of opinion; but not so as to
   the great joy which Christ obtained after he had endured the cross,
   despising the shame. Let us enter into the secret joys of our Beloved.
   Consider, my brethren, the work accomplished; Chiist has borne the
   wrath of God; God is reconciled to his people; death has been
   destroyed; Christ as risen from the dead; the dragon's head has been
   broken, the powers of sin have been subdued; our Lord ascends to heaven
   with a shout, with the trump of the archangel; the glorified spirits
   accord him a triumphal entry. "Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be
   ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors, that the King of Glory may come
   in!" He sits down upon his throne at his Father's right hand, and then
   it is that he is anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows.

   I should not have failed to remark that, as God, our Redeemer always
   possessed fullness of joy and pleasures for evermore, We are speaking
   of him in his complex person as man and God, and in his official
   character as Mediator, it is his delight in this capacity which we now
   consider.

   The joy of the risen Mediator laid, first of all, in this, that he had
   now accomplished a work which he had meditated upon from all eternity.
   Before the day-star marked the dawn; before the calm of space had ever
   been stirred by wing of angel, or the solemnity of silence had been
   startled with song of seraph, Christ had purposed to redeem his people,
   It was in the eternal purpose of the great Second Person in the Divine
   Unity, from before all worlds, to redeem unto himself a people by
   price. What joy must it give him now that he can say, "I have finished
   transgression, made an end of sin, and brought in everlasting
   righteousness."

   His heart had not only meditated, but had been mightily set upon his
   work. He had bound his people's names upon his breast; he had graven
   them upon the pylons of his hands. His ears were bored, for he intended
   to serve even until death. What if I say that, from before all worlds,
   he thirsted and panted that he might do the Father's will, and redeem
   his people from their ruin! Now, brethren, that desire which had been
   in him like coals of juniper, unquenchable, is now fulfilled to the
   uttermost; how can he be otherwise than anointed with the oil of
   gladness above his fellows, since none other ever purposed so firmly or
   succeeded so perfectly.

   Consider, too, how great the pains which he endured, and we must
   believe the joy to be commensurate with the pain. In the accomplishing
   of his great iife-purpose, he descended to the cross of deepest woe.
   Have I not tried to paint in my poor way the mysterious agonies of our
   blessed Savior? but I feel that I have failed. Now when all this had
   been suffered, what joy to look back upon it! Never day so bright as
   that which follows black darkness; never calm so sweet as that which
   succeeds hurricane and tempest; never native place so delightful as to
   the long exiled pilgrim. So deep the sorrow, so high the joy; so
   unspeakable the grief, so unutterable the bliss.

   Remember, beloved brethren, the enemies he had overcome, and you will
   not marvel that his joy was matchless. Had he not worsted Death--grim
   tyrant--vanquisher of all mankind? Had he not broken the head of the
   old serpent, who in his crushing coils had bound and pressed a universe
   of souls? Did he not defeat in battle all the fiends in hell? Was not
   evil for ever dethroned? Did not goodness sit upon a glorious high
   throne? Was not virtue exalted to the highest heaven, and sin cast down
   to the lowest hell in that day of the judgment of this world, when the
   Prince of Darkness was cast out? "Behold," he might have said, "I see
   Satan falling like lightning from heaven; the dragon bound with a great
   chain. Lo, hell's gates are shut upon the saints, the grave is rifled
   of its spoils, heaven is crowded with the saved, and earth purified
   from sin." O Jesus, thou mighty conqueror, thy glorious victories must
   surely give to thee, as they do to us, a blessed anointing with the oil
   of gladness!

   Our Lord possesses in heaven now, as perfect man, the joy of looking
   back upon a life without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; the
   satisfaction of seeing this perfect obedience covering all his people,
   till they stand lovely in his loveliness; the equal delight of
   observing the efficacy of his blood to wash the foulest, and make them
   whiter than snow, while his intercession scatters mercy in one
   everlasting shower upon the sons of men. Since his heart was love his
   joy must be in deeds of love, and as he has become a fountain always
   welling up with loving gifts towards the chosen sons of men, his
   delight must be unchanging like his nature, and unbounded like his
   divinity. "God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
   above thy fellows."

   We pause a moment, having tried to dwell upon the joy, to notice the
   cause of it. "Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness,
   therefore God hath anointed thee." It seems, then, that the first cause
   why Jesus Christ has received fullness of joy lies in his having loved
   righteousness. This he did necessarily because of the spotless purity
   of his nature; this he did practically in the hallowed sincerity and
   integrity of his life. Of whom could it be said so truly as of our
   Lord, that the law of God was in his heart. How abundantly did he prove
   his love to righteousness, by vindicating it in his death, fulfilling
   in his own person all the sentence of divine wrath taking upon himself
   all the curses which fell upon offenders. You cannot suppose
   righteousness to be more clearly manifested than in the living works of
   Jesus, nor more completely avenged than in the dying throes. How
   sovereign is that righteousness to which even the Son of God bowed his
   head and gave up the ghost. The world deluged with water, the plains of
   Sodom smoking with brimstone, the land of Egypt vexed with plagues, all
   these terrible things in righteousness manifest the justice of God, but
   none of them so solemnly as the voluntary sacrifice of Jesus. Our
   Beloved loved righteousness indeed when he emptied out all his
   heart-floods that he might make us righteous. Moreover, as in his life
   and death we see that he loved righteousness, we discern it too in the
   constant effect of his work. His gospel makes men righteous. Does it
   not give them a legal righteousness by imputation, a real righteousness
   by infusion, a righteousness which covers them with fine linen without
   and makes them all glorious within. The spirit of the gospel which we
   preach is to magnify that which is pure and lovely and of good repute.
   Wherever the Lord Jesus displays his gracious power, sins yields the
   throne, purity wins the scepter, grace reigns through righteousness
   unto eternal life through the perfect sacrifice, the living power of
   Jesus.

   The text adds, "Thou hatest wickedness." A man's character is not
   complete without a perfect hatred of sin. "Be ye angry, and sin not."
   There can hardly be goodness in a man if he be not angry at sin; he who
   loves truth must hate every false way. How our Lord Jesus hated it when
   the temptation came! Thrice it assailed him in different forms, but
   ever it was, "Get thee behind me, Satan." How he hated it when he saw
   it in others; none the less fervently because he showed his hate
   oftener in tears of pity than in words of rebuke; yet what language
   could be more stern, more Elijah-like, than the words, "Woe unto you,
   scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and
   for a pretense make long prayer." He hated wickedness so much that he
   bled that he might wound it to the heart; he died that it might die; he
   was buried that he might bury in his tomb; and he rose that he might
   for ever trample it beneath his feet. Christ is in the Gospel, my
   brethren, and you all know low utterly that Gospel is opposed to
   wickedness in every shape. No matter how wickedness may array itself in
   fair garments, and imitate the language of holiness, the precepts of
   Jesus, like his famous scourge of small cords, chase wickedness out of
   the temple, and will not let it have peaceful lodging in the Church. So
   too, in the heart where Jesus reigns, what war there is between Christ
   and Belial? And when our Redeemer shall come to be our judge, in those
   thundering words, "Depart, ye cursed," which are, indeed, but al
   prolongation of his life-teaching concerning sin, then shall it be
   seen, I say, that he hated wickedness. As warm as is his love to
   sinners, so hot is his hatred of sin; as perfect as is the
   righteousness which he completed, so perfect shall be the destruction
   of every form of wickedness. Oh thou glorious champion of right, and
   destroyer of wrong, for this cause hath God, even thy God, anointed
   thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.

   But, beloved, we must dwell for one moment upon another thought
   supplied by the text. The character of this joy is hinted at by way of
   comparison--"God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of
   gladness above thy fellows." And who are his fellows? Suppose his
   fellows to be the kings and princes of this world, for the psalm is
   descriptive of Christ in his royalty. Well, is he not anointed with
   gladness above them all? Kings rejoice in their dominions, their extent
   and population: our King looks from shore to shore, and from the river
   even to the ends of the earth, and of his dominion there is no end.
   Princes delight in the fame and honor which their office and deeds may
   bring them; but before the Lord Jesus Christ the fame of monarchs
   dwindles into nothing. His name shall endure for ever; throughout all
   generations the people shall praise him. Monarchs delight in the riches
   and treasure which their dominions yield; Christ receiveth a wealth of
   love and homage from his people, before which the riches of Croesus
   become poverty itself. "The daughter of Tyre shall be there with a
   gift; even the rich among the people shall entreat thy favor." Kings
   are wont to rejoice in the victories they have achieved. He that cometh
   from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah, travelling in the greatness
   of his strength, hath more joy than they. They boast the sureness of
   their throne; but "thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever." The inward
   thought of some kings may be that they are invincible in power, and
   that their will is law; but at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow,
   and his enemies shall become as the fat of rams; into smoke shall they
   consume, yea, into smoke shall they consume away. Good kings rejoice in
   the beneficence of their rule, and the happiness of their subjects; our
   King may surely glory in the favors which he has scattered from his
   scepter. But time would hail us if we were to complete the contrast
   here. Kings of the earth, ye may take off your crowns, and remain
   uncrowned in the presence of lying Jesus, for on his head are many
   crowns. O ye lords and mighty men, ye may lay down your dignities and
   honors, for ye are unhonoured and undignified in the presence of him
   who is above his fellows!

   My brethren, where shall his fellows be found? Search ye among the
   wise, and who shall match the gladness of incarnate wisdom, for man's
   wisdom bringeth sorrow. Go ye, and travel among the famous, and who
   shall be compared with his illustrious name, where else is there a name
   so full of joy? Search out the mighty, who hath an arm like his? Go ye,
   and search among the good and excellent, who have blessed their kind by
   philanthropy; who among them is so anointed as the Man of Nazareth? As
   the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the
   sons. Standing as high above all the rest of men as the heavens are
   above the earth; he is, indeed, anointed with the oil of gladness above
   his fellows. I find that some interpreters read it--"The oil of
   gladness for his fellows." The rendering is probably incorrect, but it
   bears a very truthful, sweet, and comfortable thought in it. If the
   saints are his fellows, and he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
   then the oil of gladness was first poured on his head, that it might
   descend even to the skirts of his garments, and that all the saints
   might be made partakers of his joy.

   We have said enough, we think, on this first point; here is the
   material for much meditation. Search, my brethren, and learn how the
   Lord, even our God, has glolified his Son Jesus.

   II. Turn we now to THE GLADNESS AFFORDED BY THE CHURCH. "All thy
   garments smell of myrrh, and cassia, and aloes, out of the ivory
   palaces, whereby they have made thee glad." His garments have been
   saturated with very precious and fragrant odours; this is the work of
   his Church. In the phrase, "ivory palaces" the allusion is to certain
   costly structures which some Oriental kings erected, plated within and
   without with ivory. We read of Ahab that he built an ivory house; and
   it was a solemn threat from the lip of Amos, "the houses of ivory shall
   perish." These ivory houses relate, I suppose, either to the courts of
   glory, or, more consistently with our interpretation this morning, to
   the hearts of believers; or, better still, to the churches, which are
   like palaces of ivory, both for glory and majesty, for richness, and
   for purity. The saints' graces, their love, their praise, their
   prayers, their faith, are like myrrh, cassia, and aloes, and the
   Savior's garments are so perfumed therewith, that when he rides in his
   triumphal chariot he scatters sweet odours all around. It is a great
   and certain truth, that Christ finds an intense satisfaction in his
   Church. "He will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love;
   he will joy over thee with singing." In his people, as the objects of
   his choice, he finds satisfaction; tis true there is nothing in them
   naturally; they are by nature heirs of wrath, even as others; but
   having set his love upon them, having determined to make them his
   people, he takes a delight in the objects of his choice because of that
   choice. Nothing in us could have been the origin of the Saviours first
   delight in us. Now, doubtless, that we are his workmanship, he takes a
   delight in the works of his own hands; but when we were like broken
   potsherds, thrown away upon the dunghill of the fall, if he saw
   anything in us it must have been in his own eyes.

   But, dear friends, as men always take a deep interest in that which has
   cost them dearly, so since that triumphant day when Jesus stretched out
   his hands upon the tree and paid the price for his people, he has found
   an infinite solace and delight in them. He sees in every believer's
   face a memento of his groans; he looks into the eye of every penitent,
   and sees his own tears there; he hears the cry of every mourner, and
   there hears his own groans over again; he beholds the reward of his
   soul's travail in every regenerate heart, and hence, as the purchase of
   his blood, we make him glad.

   Again, as his workmanship, as he sees us day by day more conformed to
   his image, he rejoices in us. Just as you see the sculptor with his
   chisel fetching out the statue which lies hidden in the block of
   marble, taking off a corner here, and a chip there, and a piece
   here--see how he smiles when he brings out the features of the form
   divine--so our Savior, as he proceeds with his graving tool, working
   through the operation of the Spirit, and making us like unto himself,
   finds much delight in us. The painter makes rough drafts at first, and
   lays on the colors roughly; some do not understand what he is doing,
   and for three or four sittings the portrait is much unlike the man it
   aims at representing; but the painter can discern the features in the
   canvass; he sees it looming through that mist and haze of color; he
   knows that beauty will yet beam forth from yonder daubs and blotches.
   So Jesus, though we are yet but mere outlines of his image, can
   discover his own perfection in us where no eye but his own, as the
   Mighty Artist, can perceive it. Dear friends, it is for this reason,
   because we are the work of his hands, that he taketh delight in us.

   Know ye not that we are his brethren--and brothers should delight in
   brothers. Nay, we are his spouse--and where should the husband find his
   comfort but in his bride? We are his body--shall not the head be
   content with the members? We are one with him, vitally, personally,
   everlastingly one; and it is little marvel, therefore, if we have a
   mutual joy in each other, so that his garments smell of myrrh, aloes,
   and cassia, out of the ivory palaces of his Church, wherein he hath
   been made glad.

   Let us think how we can make him glad. Brethren, our love to
   Christ--oh! we think it so cold, so little, and so, indeed, we must
   sorrowfully confess it to be, but it is very sweet to Christ. We can
   never compare our love to Christ with his love to us, and yet he does
   not despise it. Hear his own eulogy of his Church in the Song, "Thou
   hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my
   heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck. How fair is
   thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine!
   and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!" "Thou art beautiful,
   O my love, as Tirza, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with
   banners. Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me." See,
   see, my brethren, his delight in you. When you lean your head on his
   bosom, you not only receive, but you give him joy; when you gaze with
   love upon his beauteous face, you not only receive comfort, but give
   delight. Our praise, too, gives him joy, when from our hearts we sing
   his name, and when gratefully, though silently, we breathe a song up to
   his throne. As princes are delighted with incense, so is Christ
   delighted with the praise of his people. And our gifts, too, delight
   him. As the son of our good Queen accepts rich tokens of kindness from
   the people of his land, so our Lord Jesus is charmed with the offerings
   of his people. He loves to see us lay our time, our talents, our
   substance upon his altar, not for the value of what we give, but for
   the sake of the motive from which the gift springs. He takes far more
   delight in what we do for him than our Queen's son could take in
   splendid arches, or in the glorious pageantry of yesterday. To Christ
   the shouts of his people are better than the cheers of the most
   enthusiastic populace, and to him the lowly offerings of his saints are
   more acceptable than thousands of gold and silver. Forgive your enemy,
   and you make Christ glad; distribute of your substance to the poor, and
   he rejoices; be the means of saving souls, and you give him to see of
   the travail of his soul; preach his gospel, and you are a sweet savor
   unto him; go among the ignorant and among the hopeless, and try to lift
   them up, and you have given him satisfaction. I tell you, brother, it
   is in your power this very day to break the alabaster box and pour the
   precious ointment on his head, as did the woman of old, whose memorial
   is to this day set forth. You can anoint him above all his fellows with
   the oil of gladness.

   I think I see a great procession. It is Jesus Christ riding alone
   through the tens of thousands of souls whom he has redeemed with his
   own blood. I think I see him looking to the right hand and to the left
   as he rides along the centuries. See how every windows of every age are
   crowded! Glorified spirits look down from the housetops of heaven: the
   Church militant looks up from the streets of earth, multitudes upon
   multitudes of souls that love him, and call him King, salute him as
   their Redeemer. I notice that, as he goes along in this great
   procession, his eyes are bright with joy. We liked to see the Prince
   and Princess happy yesterday but their joy could be nothing compared
   with that of Christ as he rides along in triumph. How the multitudes
   delight him; the ten thousand times ten thousand--who shall tell how
   many Christ has redeemed? Their number is beyond all human count; so
   many are they that, as they clap their hands and shout to his name, I
   hear a voice like many waters, or like great thunders, while they cry
   "Hallelujah, Sweet Prince! ride on triumphantly! and reign for ever and
   ever!" There is one thing Christ feels as he looks upon the crowd
   around him, which our Prince could not feel yesterday. He knows that
   everyone of these would lay down their lives for him. Of all those whom
   Jesus bought with blood; among those who are renewed in heart; there is
   not one who would not bleed for him. To the stake they walk, and sing
   amidst the flames. To the dungeon they go, and praise him while they
   rot in darkness. They are dragged at the heels of horses, they are
   stoned, they are sawn in sunder, they wander about in sheep-skins and
   in goat-skins, and they glory in all these things that they may show
   their love to Christ. Every eye in the vast throng which gathers about
   the triumphal chariot of Christ beams with intense love to him; and
   when they shout, each one shouts louder than his fellow; each one in
   the whole throng feels he owes more to the great King than anyone else;
   there is something special about each face the King looks on, and as he
   remembers the special circumstances, he perceives the reason for that
   special love. Either it is much forgiven, or else it is much trial
   averted, or much strength conferred by which to perform labor. I am
   sure that when you and I are in that throng loolking upon him, we may
   truly say--

   "Then loudest of the crowd I'll sing,

   While heaven's resounding mansions ring

   With shouts of sovereign grace."

   Ye did well to applaud your Prince yesterday, but what had he ever done
   for you? What debt did you owe to him? Owed he not far more to you? But
   our King as he rides along in the midst of the joyful hosts of the
   blood-bought, has this upon his mind--"I bought all these souls with my
   blood." He recollects, as he looks upon them, where they would have
   been but for his grace, and the very pangs of hell must add joy to his
   soul, when he remembers that he saved them from passing into the pit.
   He recollects, too, what they once were--how full of sin, what enemies
   to God, how they crucified him, how they trampled on his precious
   blood, and now he sees them bowing, before him, too glad to catch but a
   glimpse of him as he rides by, too happy to be as the dust of his feet
   if he will but honor them by treading upon them that he might be lifted
   the higher. O my brethren, we love the Lord Jesus Christ, and our
   hearts give him a reception such as never was accorded to earthly
   Prince. Pile the arches! pile the arches! Let hearts pour forth their
   life-blood, if in no other way the banners can be dyed red! Strew the
   streets; strip off your garments if in no other way the pageant can be
   made illustrious! bring forth the royal diadem, and let every saint
   renounce wealth and comfort if by no other means Jesus can be crowned!
   Empty heaven, if by no other way Jesus can be attended with guards of
   honor. Come, all ye sons and daughters of his great family, and offer
   yourselves a living sacrifice, if there can be no other incense! We are
   all prepared--I speak for the sacramental host of God's elect--we are
   all prepared by his grace to follow him through floods and through
   flames! We are prepared to give him all the honor that heart can
   conceive. We are prepared to kiss his feet as well as to crown his
   head. Bring forth the royal diadem to-day and crown him Lord of all;
   and each day as he rides along, till he shall deliver up the kingdom to
   God, even the Father, let him be crowned King of kings and Lord of
   lords.

   III. Now for another text, but not another sermon. It is in the fourth
   verse of the first chapter of the Song of Solomon:--"WE WILL BE GLAD
   AND REJOICE IN THEE."

   God has made the king glad, and his saints make him glad; let us be
   glad too. But let us mind that our gladness is of the right sort. "We
   will rejoice and be glad in thee." That man is glad in his farm; that
   other in his merchandise; that one yonder in his wealth; that woman in
   her jewels; that other in her beauty; "We will rejoice and be glad in
   thee." But in what? We will rejoice, more especially, in his love to
   us. You remember Jesus Christ said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of
   Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?" Interpreters read that two
   ways. Some think he meant, "Lovest thou me more that thou lovest these
   nets, and this fishery, and this thine earthly calling and these thy
   friends?" I think I hear Jesus Christ speaking this morning, and he
   says, "My people, I love you more than these." He points to spirits
   that once stood around his throne, angels that have sinned; they fell
   like lightning from heaven, and there they lie in flames, and Christ
   says, "I loved you more than these; I let these perish, but I saved
   you." Pointing to the kings and princes of this world, the great, the
   mighty, and the learned men, and to all the nations that sit in
   darkness, he says, "I love you more than these; I gave Ethiopia and
   Seba for you." Then taking a higher range he joints to heaven. There
   sit the angels before the throne, and he says, "I loved you more than
   these; I left their company for yours." He bids you listen to their
   harps and to their songs, and he says, "I loved you more than these; I
   left all these melodies that I might be able to meet your groans." Yea,
   he points to his own throne, so bright with glory that mortal eyes
   scarce dare to rest upon it, and he says, "I loved you more than these,
   for I left the glory of my throne that I might redeem you with my
   blood." Saint, will you not join with me? Shall we not both say,
   "Savior, blessed be thine unexampled love! We rill rejoice and be glad
   in thee!"

   But some interpreters read the text--"Lovest thou me more than
   these?"--"Lovest thou me more than these others love me?" Jesus speaks
   to-day to us, "I have loved thee more than these; thy mother loved
   thee; strong were her pangs when thou wast born, and anxious her cares
   when she nursed thee at her bosom; but I have loved thee more than
   these, and thy brethren loved thee, and thy sisters; born of the same
   parents they watched over thee with delight, and they have been ready
   to help thee in thy time of need, but I have loved thee more than
   these: and thy husband loved thee, loved thee as his own soul, he has
   cherished thee, and has been ready to lay down his life to give thee
   back health when thou hast been sick; but I have loved thee more than
   these: thy children, too, have loved thee; they have climbed thy knee
   and smiled upon thee for all thy kindness to them, and they have
   strengthened thine old age, and thou hast leaned upon them, as upon a
   staff, when thou hast been tottering with weakness; but I have loved
   thee more than these: and thou hast had a joyous companion, a dear
   friend who has been with thee from thy youth up, and has never lifted
   his heel against thee; and thou hast had thine intimates and thy
   familars who went up to the house of God with thee, and talked
   cheerfully by the way, but I have loved thee more than these," I think
   I hear him say to me--"There are some in this congregation who would
   pluck out their own eyes to give them to thee; they love thee, for thou
   art their spiritual father, but I have loved thee more than theses."
   And he points to all the good men that have ever tried to teach you, to
   all the comforters who have given you joy, to all the helpers that have
   aided you on the road to immortality; and he says, "I have loved you
   more than these." Well, if his love be matchless like this, we will
   rejoice and be glad in him. I have nothing, else to rejoice in, the
   Lord knoweth. I cannot rejoice in myself, there are so many sins and so
   many doubts; but I will rejoice and be glad in him if he loves me like
   this. He has finished the work for me, given me a perfect
   righteousness, washed me in his blood, taken off his robe to clothe me,
   given his life that he may make me live, entered the grave to bring me
   out of it, and said that I shall shortly be enthroned with him above
   the sky. I will rejoice and be glad in him. When King Solomon was
   crowned, all the people rejoiced; and shall we be mourners when Christ
   sits upon his throne? Let the heaviest heart begin to leap; and if you
   have to bear your burdens to-morrow, yet do throw them off to-day. "We
   will rejoice and be glad in thee." I should not like one Christian to
   go down these aisles this morning without some light of heaven's
   brightness on his cheek--without some note of heaven's music in his
   ear. "Oh!" says the Christian, "Yes. I will; the cross is heavy, but I
   will hope beneath it; the furnace is hot, but I will sing in it; the
   way is rough, but I will tread it with light footsteps, for I will
   rejoice and be glad in him who has loved me and given himself for me."
   Well, you see, there is a glad Christ in heaven, and here is a glad
   Church on earth; there is Christ anointed by his Father, here are his
   people sharing that anointing; here is Christ giving you joy, and you
   giving Christ joy. Belt the world with happiness; fire zodiac with joy.
   Lift up the ladder of your songs; while the bottom rests on earth, let
   the top reach to heaven; and ye angels of God, hold fellowship to-day
   with God and with us through the joy and peace which God the Father
   gives us, while we rejoice and are glad in him.

   I would you all understood this subject, but some of you are strangers
   to it altogether! Remember, there is no joy anywhere but in Christ. It
   is all poor mockery which you get elsewhere. Jesus Christ is to be had,
   and whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting
   life.

   The Lord give you his benediction, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                           The Clean and the Unclean

   A Sermon

   (No. 499)

   By the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which
   ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. Whatsoever
   parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the
   beasts, that shall ye eat."--Leviticus 11:2, 3.

   THE MOSAIC LAW ATTACHED great importance to meats and drinks: the
   Christian religion attaches none. The apostle Peter was shown by the
   vision of a sheet let down from heaven, not only that all nations were
   now to receive the gospel message, but that all kinds of food were now
   clean, and that all the prohibitions which had formerly been laid upon
   them for legal purposes were now once for all withdrawn. A Christian
   may, if he pleases, put himself under restrictions as to these matters.
   You will remember that the apostle Paul says, "I know and am persuaded
   of the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself, but to him
   that esteemeth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean." I wot our
   apostle was tender of weak consciences; but he could expostulate with
   the brethren somewhat thus, "If ye be dead with Christ from the
   rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, do ye
   dogmatize--touch not this, taste not that, handle not the other--and
   all about things which perish with the using?" The doctrine of the New
   Testament is expressly laid down, "Every creature of God is good and
   nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving." And as for
   the practice enjoined upon believers, "All things are lawful, but all
   things are not expedient." In the example of Paul we have full liberty;
   he would put no embargo upon the conscience. But in his example we have
   also fervent charity; he would put no stumbling-block in his brother's
   way. "If meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the
   world standeth." The levitical law enjoined many precepts as to meats
   and drinks; but those carnal ordinances were imposed until the time of
   reformation. Since then, this Mosaic institution was not designed to be
   perpetual, we feel certain that it must have had some use at the time
   when it was first established, and during the time in which it was
   sustained. As that was pecuharly a typical dispensation, we feel
   persuaded that we shall not exaggerate the uses of the text if we show
   that there was something instructive to us and something typical of the
   better covenant in the command that the people were to eat no creatures
   but those which divided the hoof and those which chewed the cud.

   I. It is our firm belief that these distinctions of meats were laid
   down on purpose TO KEEP THE JEWS AS A DISTINCT PEOPLE, and that herein
   they might be a type of the people of God, who are also, throughout all
   ages, to be a distinct and separate people--not of the world, even as
   Christ was not of the world.

   You that are conversant with the old Levitical rule, well know that it
   was quite impossible for the Hebrews to mix with any other nation,
   without violating the statutes they were commanded to keep. Their food
   was so restricted that they could not possibly enter into social
   intercourse with any of the neighboring peoples. The Canaanites, for
   instance, ate everything, even the flesh that had been torn by dogs,
   and the dogs themselves. Now, a Jew could never sit at a Canaanites
   table, because he could never be sure that there would not be the flesh
   of some unclean and accursed thing upon it. The Jews could not even eat
   with the Arabs, who were near akin to them, for they frequently partook
   of the flesh of the camels, the hare, and the coney, all which, as we
   shall see presently, were forbidden to the Jew. The Arabs on the south,
   and the Canaanitish nations all round Palestine, were the most likely
   people with whom the Jews would associate, and this command about what
   they should and should not eat prevented them for ever from mingling
   with these people, and made them a distinct and isolated republic so
   long as they were obedient to the law. We are told by Eastern travelers
   that the Mohammedan regulations, which are far less strict than those
   of the Jew, prevent their becoming socially intermingled either with
   the idolaters or with Christians. It is a well-known fact that no
   people that have prescriptions about meats and drinks have ever changed
   their religion to that of another people, because the famiharity which
   seems necessary in order to proselyte is quite prevented by the barrier
   that precludes from intercourse at the table. It is at the social table
   men enjoy the most genial intercourse; it is there they pour out their
   souls with the least reserve, and mix their thoughts one with another
   in the greatest freedom of conversation. Check them there; prevent
   their sitting at the same board, and there is no likehhood that they
   will ever blend or intermingle in any kind of affinity, the races must
   be distinct. I believe, dear fiiends, though I have been somewhat prosy
   in explaining myself, that it was God's real intention, to keep the
   children of Israel, until the coming of Christ, separate from all the
   nations that were upon the face of the earth. They could not join in
   the worship of other nations, for other nations sacrificed to their
   gods the very animals which to the Jew were unclean. They could not
   join in social intercourse, as we have already seen; and hence marriage
   with any other nation would be, not only, as it was, prohibited by the
   law, but would be actually prevented by the possibilities of the case.
   It must in each instance put the transgressor beyond the pale of his
   own tribe. They would remain as much a distinct people, as if a great
   wall of brass had been built all around them, or as if they had been
   transported to some island, and an impassable gulf had been put between
   them and any other kindred upon earth. They were separated for ever.
   Now friends, you will say, "What is the use of this to us?" I answer,
   it is the earthly type of a heavenly mystery. When the Jews were put
   away as the people of God for a time, then the Gentiles were grafted
   into their olive, and though we did not inherit the ceremonies, we did
   inherit all the privileges to which those ceremonies point. Thus all of
   you who name the name of Christ and are truly what you profess to be,
   are solemnly bound to be for ever separated from the world. Not that
   you are to leave off your daily intercourse with men. Our Savior did
   not do so. He was holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners.
   Yet, you know, he was always in the company of sinners, sitting at
   their table, seeking their good, and hunting after their souls. He was
   with them, but he was never of them; he was among them, but always
   distinct and separate from them; not conforming himself to them, but
   transforming them to himself. He hath set us an example. It is not the
   seclusion of a hermit, nor the exclusion of yourselves in a monastery,
   where you would be of no service to your fellow-men, but it is a higher
   and more spiritual separation which I claim of Christians to-night. You
   are to be in the world, and among the world, you are to mingle with all
   sorts and conditions of men, but still to maintain the dignity of your
   newborn character, and to let men see that you are among them as a
   speckled bird, as a light in the midst of darkness, as salt scattered
   over putridity, as heavenly angels in the midst of fallen men. So are
   ye to be a distinct people, a chosen generation.

   But you will ask of me in what respects are you to be distinguished? In
   a pure consistency always, in a vain eccentricity never. This shall be
   my first reply. Not in your garments, my brethren. All those inventions
   of broad-brimmed hats, and coats without collars, perish in the using.
   Let your dress be, nevertheless, so distinguished from that of some
   other men, that there shall be none of the pride and foppery in which
   they delight. The Apostle Peter has well laid down the regulations by
   which our sisters in Christ are to adorn themselves, but I need not
   mention what you know so well and practice so little--that chaste and
   becoming neatness which is always right in the sight of God, and
   beautiful in the assembly of Christians. Not by my pecuhar Jargon in
   your speech are you to be known. For my part I abhor in any man that
   sanctimonious tone and sacred whine which many affect; even in the
   pulpit I despise it. I believe that the reason why the pulpit has lost
   so much of its former power is because men must needs mouth our blessed
   Saxon tongue, and talk as if everything natural were to be eschewed
   there, and men, metamorphosed into ministers, were to be as unnatural
   and grotesque in their modes of speech as possible. No, not these, not
   these; all such artificial separations we leave to the people whose
   vanity feeds on its own conceit. Nor need you make any straining effort
   to be distinguished by any stiff buckram of your own; do not try to
   make yourself look like a Christian. True Christians can do a great
   many things that sham Christians must not do. As for me, I am never
   afraid to laugh, for I shall never crack the paint on my face, laugh as
   I may. A sincere man may do a great many things that a hypocrite dare
   not do, for he will spht the garments of his hypocrisy if he ventures
   to run as a Christian may. Heavenly realities within do not always need
   to be plastered up and labelled outside, so that everybody may see and
   recognize you, and say, "There goes a saint." There are other modes of
   being distinguished from the world than any of these.

   What are they then? Well, brethren, we ought ever to be distinguished
   from the world in the great object of our life. As for worldly men,
   some of them are seeking wealth, others of them fame; some seek after
   comfort, others after pleasure. Subordinately you may seek after any of
   these, but your main and principal motive as a Christian should always
   be to live for Christ. To live for glory? Yes, but for his glory. To
   live for comfort? Yes, but be all your consolation in him. To live for
   pleasure? Yes, but when you are merry, sing psalms, and make melody in
   your hearts to the Lord. To live for wealth? Yes, but to be rich in
   faith. You may lay up treasure; but lay it up in heaven, where neither
   moth nor rust doth corrupt, where thieves break not through nor steal.
   It is thought, you know, that ministers do live for God; merchants
   should do the same. I would, my brethren, that you would trade, and do
   your merchandise for his service; or do ye plough, and sow, and reap,
   and mow, do it for Christ! Would God you could do this quite as much in
   his service, as we do ours, when we preach for Christ! You can make the
   commonest calling become really sacred. You may take the highest orders
   by dedicating your daily life wholly to the service of Jesus. There is
   such a thing--and let those that deny the possibility stand
   self-convicted that they obey not the precept--"Whether ye eat or
   drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God."

   By your spirit as well as your aim you should likewise be
   distinguished. The spirit of this world is often selfish; it is always
   a spirit that forgets God, that ignores the existence of a Creator in
   his own world, the land which he makes fat by his own bounty. Men with
   God's breath in their nostrils forget him who makes them live. Now,
   your spirit should be one of unselfish devotion, a spirit always
   conscious of his presence, bowed down with the weight, or raised up
   with the cheer of Hagar's exclamation--"Thou God seeest me;" a spirit
   which watcheth humbly before God, and seeketh to know his will and to
   do it through the grace of God given to you. Such a spirit as this,
   without the drab of one sect, or the phylacteries of another, will soon
   make you quite as distinct from your fellow men as ever meats and
   drinks could make the Jews a separate people.

   Your maxims too, and the rules which regulate you, should be very
   different from those of others. The world says "Well, it is usual in
   the trade; there is no use in being over scrupulous; we must not be too
   Puritanic, or too severe; we shall never get on if we are picking at
   this and frowning at that." A Christian never considers what is usual,
   but what is right; he does not estimate a wrong by its commonness; he
   counts that a fraud, and a falsehood will be as much fraud and
   falsehood, though all the world shall agree to practice it, as though
   but one man should do it in the dark. The believer reads things, not in
   man's light, in the obscurity of which so many blind bats are willing
   to fly, but he reads things in the sunlight of heaven. If a thing be
   right though he lose by it, it is done; if it be wrong, though he
   should become as rich as Croesus by allowing it, he scorns the sin for
   his Master's sake. We want our merchants on the Exchange, our traders
   in their shops, and our artisans in their factories; yea, and we want
   all masters, employers, and overseers too, to be distinguished, as the
   clean from the unclean, in the maxims that govern their daily life, and
   thus manifestly separate from the world.

   This will naturally lead to the next point--the Christian should be
   separate in his actions. I would not give much for your religion unless
   it can be seen. I know some people's religion is heard of, but give me
   the man whose religion is seen. Lamps do not talk, but shine; a
   lighthouse sounds no drum, it beats no gong, and yet far over the
   waters its friendly spark is seen by the mariner. So let your actions
   shine out your religion. Let your conduct talk out your soul. Let the
   main sermon of your life be illustrated by all your conduct, and it
   shall not fail to be illustrious. Have I not told you before that the
   only bit of ecclesiastical history we have in the whole New Testament
   is--what? The sermons of the Apostles? No, no, the "Acts of the
   Apostles." So let your history be written, so that it may have this
   title--"The acts of such-and-such a man." This will furnish the best
   proof that you have been with Jesus.

   A Christian is distinguished by his conversation. He will often trim a
   sentence where others would have made it far more luxuriant by a jest
   which was not altogether clean. Following Herbert's advice--"He pares
   his apple--he would cleanly feed." If he would have a jest, he picks
   the mirth but leaves the sin; his conversation is not used to levity;
   it is not mere froth, but it ministereth grace unto the hearers. He has
   learned where the salt-box is kept in God's great house, and so his
   speech is always seasoned with it, so that it may do no hurt but much
   good. Oh! commend me to the man who talks like Jesus, who will not for
   the world suffer corrupt communications to come out of his mouth. I
   know what people will say of you if you are like this: they will say
   you are straight-laced, and that you will not throw much life into
   company. Others will call you mean-spirited. Oh, my brethren!
   bold-hearted men are always called mean-spirited by cowards. They will
   admonish you not to be singular, but you can tell them that it is no
   folly to be singular, when to be singular is to be right. I know they
   will say you deny yourselves a great deal, but you will remind them
   that it is no denial to you. Sheep do not eat carrion, but I do not
   know that sheep think it a hardship to turn away from the foul feast.
   Eagles do not prefer to float on the sea, but I do not read that eagles
   think it a denial when they can soar in higher atmosphere. Do not talk
   of self-denial. You have other ends and other aims; you have welds of
   comfort that such men know not of. It would be a shame for you to be
   eating husks with swine, when your Father's table is loaded with
   dainties. I trust, my dear brethren, that you know the value of the
   gold of heaven too well to pawn it away for the counterfeits of earth.
   "Come ye out from among them; be ye separate, and touch not the unclean
   thing." By a holiness which merely moral men cannot equal, stand as on
   a pedestal aloft above the world. Thus men may know you to be of the
   seed of Jesus, even as they knew the Jew to be the seed of Israel.

   How shall I urge you to give more earnest heed to this holy separation?
   Let me add the voice of warning to that of entreaty. If we do not see
   to this matter we shall bring sorrow on our own souls; we shall lose
   all hope of honoring Christ, and we shall sooner or later bring a great
   disaster on the world. You know the world is always trying to
   nationalize the Church. What a mercy it is that there are some who will
   not have it! If you could once make the Church and the nation one, what
   would follow? It must be destroyed; it must fall. It was when the
   church and the world became one in Noah's day that the Lord sent the
   flood to destroy all people. No, the proper position of a Christian is
   not with the world, even in its best state and its most exalted
   condition. We are to be separated from this present evil world
   according to the will of God. Our position to-day is as much as in
   Christ's day, outside the camp, not in it; we are still to be
   protesters, still to be testifiers against the world. "Ye are of God,
   little children, and the whole world lieth in the wicked one."
   Scripture never supposes that the world will get better till the coming
   of Christ. It does not propose to lift the world up and marry it with
   the Church. It always supposes the Church to be as an alien and a
   stranger here until Christ, her husband shall come. On which side will
   you rank? Truce there cannot be, links between the two there must not
   be. God and mammon cannot go together. For which will you be--for
   God--for truth--for right? Or for Satan--for the he--for the wrong?
   Which shall it be? May the Spirit of God whisper in your heart
   to-night, and say, "Believe thou in Christ Jesus; take up thy cross and
   follow him, and be enlisted on his side henceforth and for ever."

   II. We have now a second and an important matter to bring forward. The
   distinction drawn between clean and unclean animals was, we think,
   intended by God TO KEEP HIS PEOPLE ALWAYS CONSCIOUS THAT THEY WERE IN
   THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF SIN.

   Just let me picture it. I have caught the idea from Mr. Bonar, though I
   fear I cannot paint it in words so well as he has done. An oriental
   Jew, sensible and intelligent, walks out in the fields. He walks along
   close by the side of the high-road, and what should he see but a string
   of camels going along? "Ah!" he says to himself "those are unclean
   animals." Sin, you see, is brought at once before his mind's eye. He
   turns away from the road and walks down one of his own fields, and as
   he goes along a hare starts across his path. "Ah!" says he, "an unclean
   animal again; there is sin in my path." He gets into a more retired
   place, he walks on the mountains; surely he shall be alone there. But
   he sees a coney burrowing among the rocks; "Ah!" says he, "unclean;
   there is sin there!" He lifts his eye up to heaven; he sees the osprey,
   the bald eagle, flying along through the air, and he says, "Ah! there
   is an emblem of sin there!" A dragon-fly has just flitted by him--there
   is sin there. There are insects among the flowers; now every creeping
   thing, and every insect, except the locust, was unclean to the Jew.
   Everywhere he would come in contact with some creature that would
   render him ceremonially unclean, and it were impossible for him, unless
   he were brutish, to remain even for ten minutes abroad without being
   reminded that this world, however beautiful it is, still has sin in it.
   Even the fish, in sea, or river, or inland lake, had their divisions;
   those that had no scales or fins were unclean to the Jew, so the little
   Hebrew boys could not even fish for minnows in the brook but they would
   know that the minnow was unclean, and so their young hearts were made
   to dread little wrongs and little sins, for there were little sins in
   the little pools even as there were leviathan sins floating in the deep
   and nude sea. Ah! friends, we want to have this more before our minds.
   Look at the fairest landscape that your eye has ever beheld; see the
   towering Alp, the green valley, and the silver stream

   "These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,

   Almighty,"

   but the slime of the serpent is on them all,

   "Keep me, O, keep me King of kings,

   Beneath the shadow of thy wings."

   When I walk abroad in this temple of nature, and seek to behold
   nature's God, I may not light upon a spot in the universe where the
   curse of sin has never inflicted a blight, or where the hope of
   redemption should not inspire a prayer. Sometimes, brethren you get all
   alone and quiet, but do not imagine that you are even there free from
   sin. As the most beautiful landscape, so the sweetest retirement cannot
   shut out uncleanness. As the fly or the insect would intrude into the
   arbour where the Jew would worship, so sin will haunt and molest us
   even in the closet of devotion. Get up Christians, and be upon your
   watch-towers. You may sleep, but your enemies never will; you may
   suppose yourselves safe, but then are you most in danger. See that you
   put on the whole panoply of God, and are armed from head to foot, and
   having done all, watch and pray lest ye enter into temptation. Every
   morning we ought to ask the Lord to keep us from unknown sins, to
   preserve us from temptations that we cannot foresee, to check us in
   every part of life if we are about to go wrong, and to hold us up every
   hour that we sin not. You will say it must have been an unpleasant
   thing for the Jew always to have sin before his eye, nor would you wish
   every aspect of life to be thus fouled before your eye; but it will not
   be so unpleasant for you, my brother, because you know there is a
   redemption, and your faith can realize the end of the curse by sin
   being put away. Shut not your eyes to sin, but keep Christ always
   before you, and you will walk aright. I wish that some of my hearers
   had sin before their eyes now. Oh! you that trifle with it, you do not
   know what it is! Fools make a mock of sin. You laugh at it now; you do
   not understand what a fire it is that you have kindled to consume your
   soul! Oh! you that think it is such a little thing, its deadly poison
   will soon envenom all your blood, and then you will discover that he
   that plays with sin plays with damnation. May the Lord set sin straight
   before your eyes, and then set the cross of Christ there too, and so
   you will be saved. Two prayers I ask all my hearers to pray--they are
   very brief--"Lord show me myself." If there is any man here who says he
   would pray but he does not know what to pray, for; pray that every
   night and morning--"Lord show me myself;" and if God hear you, you will
   soon be in such a wretched state that you will want another prayer, and
   then I give you this--"Lord show me thyself;" and then if he shall show
   you himself hanging on the tree, the expiation for guilt, the Great God
   become man that he might put away sin, your salvation will be
   accomplished. Tis all the prayer that is wanted--"Lord show me myself;
   Lord show me thyself; reveal sin and reveal a Savior." Lord, do this
   for all of us for thy name's sake.

   III. And now, I come to show you a third teaching of my text. As this
   injunction was meant to separate the Jews from other nations, and to
   keep the pious Israelite in constant remembrance of his danger of
   falling into sin, so it was also intended to be A RULE OF
   DISCRIMINATION BY WHICH WE MAY JUDGE WHO ARE CLEAN AND WHO ARE UNCLEAN,
   THAT IS, WHO ARE SAINTS AND WHO ARE NOT.

   There are two tests, but they must both be united. The beast that was
   clean was to chew the cud: here is the inner-life; every truehearted
   man must know how to read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest the sacred
   Word. The man who does not feed upon Gospel truth, and so feed upon it,
   too, that he knows the sweetness and relish of it, and seeks out its
   marrow and fatness, that man is no heir of heaven. You must know a
   Christian by his inwards, by that which supports his life and sustains
   his frame. But then the clean creatures were also known by their walk.
   The Jew at once discovered the unclean animal by its having an
   undivided hoof; but if the hoof was thoroughly divided, then it was
   clean, provided that it also chewed the cud. So there must be in the
   true Christian a pecuhar walk such as God requires. You cannot tell a
   man by either of these tests alone; you must have them both. But while
   you use them upon others apply them to yourselves. What do you feed on?
   What is your habit of life? Do you chew the cud by meditation? When
   your soul feeds on the flesh and blood of Christ have you learned that
   his flesh is meat indeed, and that his blood is drink indeed? If so tis
   well. What about your life? Are your conversation and your daily walk
   according to the description which is given in the Word of believers in
   Christ? If not, the first test will not stand alone. You may profess
   the faith within, but if you do not walk aright without, you belong to
   the unclean. On the other hand, you may walk aright without but unless
   there is the chewing of the cud within, unless there is a real feeding
   upon precious truth in the heart, all the right walking in the world
   will not prove you to be a Christian. That holiness which is only
   outward in moral not spiritual; it does not save the soul. That
   religion, on the other hand, which is only inward is but fancy; it
   cannot save the soul either. But the two together; the inward parts
   made capable of knowing the lusciousness, the sweetness, the fatness of
   Christ's truth; and the outward parts conformed to Christ's image and
   character: these conjoined point out the true and clean Christian with
   whom it is blessed to associate here, and for whom a better portion is
   prepared hereafter.

   If you read the chapter through you will find there were some two or
   three animals about which the Jew would have some little difficulty.
   There was the camel that did chew the cud, but did not exactly divide
   the hoof. Now this animal seems to me fitly to represent--though it may
   not have been so intended--those men who seem really to feed on the
   truth and yet their walk and conversation are not aright. Their feet
   have been formed rather for the sandy desert of sin than for the sacred
   soil of godliness. Oh! I know some of you--come, let us be
   personal--there are some of you if I would always preach the doctrine
   of predestination, or some other doctrine of that kind, how sweet it
   would be to you! But your lives are not what they should be. Thank God
   there are not many of that sort who come here. They get angry with me
   very soon, and go off to other places where they can get sweet and
   savoury morsels, which exactly suit their taste, and hear no
   admonitions about their lives whatever. May the Lord deliver my
   ministry from ever being comfortable and flattering to souls that live
   in sin. I hope you will sometimes have to say, "I must either give up
   that sin or else give up my seat there." I know one who said, "Well! it
   has come to this: I cannot go there on Sunday evening and keep my shop
   open in the morning; it will not do for me to go and sit there, and
   hear the Word, and sing with those people on Sunday evening, and then
   hear songs and join in revelries on week-nights." I hope the Word of
   God here will be such a searching Word to some of you that you will
   even gnash your teeth at the preacher. He would sooner for you to do
   that than for you to say; "Peace, peace, where there is no peace,"
   sucking in sweet doctrine, and yet living in sin. God deliver us from
   Antinomianism! We do preach against Arminianism, but that is a white
   devil compared with the black devil of Antinomianism. God save us from
   that! If there is any religion that will drug conscience, stimulate
   crime, crowd jails, and turn this world into an Aceldema, it is the
   religion of the man who preaches divine sovereignty but neglects human
   responsibility. I believe it is a vicious, immoral, and corrupt manner
   of setting forth doctrine, and cannot be of God. It would undermine
   morality, and put the very life of society in peril if it were largely
   believed, or if it were preached by men of any great weight who should
   have any great numbers to follow them. Oh, dear friends! be not as the
   animal which cheweth the cud but yet divideth not the hoof. Seek not
   merely to get precious doctrine, comforting to yourselves, but see that
   your walk is such as it should be.

   Then there was another animal. It did not chew the cud, still the Jews
   thought it did. This was the coney--the nearest approach to it is the
   rabbit of our land--"The coney, because he cheweth the cud but divideth
   not the hoof; he is unclean." The coney was a very timid creature,
   which burrowed in the rocks. "The coneys be a feeble folk, but they
   make their dwellings in the rocks," says Solomon. Now, there are some
   people who seem as if they like the gospel truth, and they may be put
   down in the class in which Moses puts the coney, which appeared to chew
   the cud, though it did not really do so. There are hundreds of this
   sort we know. They like the gospel, but it must be very cheap. They
   like to hear it preached, but as to doing anything to extend it, unless
   it were to lend their tongues an hour, they would not dream of it. The
   coney, you know, lived in the earth. These people are always scraping.
   John Bunyan's muck-rake is always in their hands. Neither to dig nor to
   beg are they ashamed. They are as true misers, and as coyetous, as if
   they had no religion at all. And many of these people get into our
   Churches, and are received when thee ought not to be. Coyetousness
   ought to exclude a man from Church fellowship as well as fornication,
   for Paul says, "Coyetousness, which is idolatry." He puts the brand
   right on its forehead, and marks what it is. We would not admit an
   idolater to the Lord's table; nor ought we to admit a coyetous man;
   only we cannot always know him. St. Francis Sales, who had a great many
   people come to him to confession, makes this note, that he had many men
   and women come to him who confessed all sorts of most outrageous
   crimes, but he never had one who confessed coyetousness. It is a kind
   of sin that always comes in at the back-door, and it is always
   entertained at the back-part of the house. People do not suspect it as
   an inmate of their own hearts. Mr. Coyetousness has changed his name to
   Mr. Prudent-Thrifty; and it is quite an insult to call him other than
   by his adopted name. Old vices, like streets notorious for vice, get
   new names given them. Avaricious grasping, they call that only "the
   laws of social economy;" screwing down the poor is "the natural result
   of competition;" withholding corn until the people curse oh! that is
   "just the usual regulation of the market." People name the thing
   prettily, and then they think they have rescued it from the taint.
   These people, who are all for earth, are like the coneys, who, though
   they chew the cud, burrow in the ground. They love precious truth, and
   yet they are all for this earth. If there are any such here, despite
   their fine experience, we pronounce them unclean--they are not heirs of
   heaven.

   The next creature mentioned in the chapter is the hare--"The hare,
   because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean."
   See how he fhes with bounding step over the ground! A clapping of the
   hands, and how he starts and is away! The hare is such a timid
   creature; she leayeth her food, and fleeth before the passer-by. I
   would not say a hard thing, but there are some people who appear to
   chew the cud, they love to hear the gospel preached; their eyes will
   sparkle sometimes when we are talking of Christ, but they do not divide
   the hoof: Like the hare, they are too timid to be domesticated among
   the creatures whom the Lord has pronounced clean. They do not come out
   from the world, enter into the Church, and manifest themselves wholly
   on the Lord's side. Their conscience tells them they should baptized as
   believers--but they dare not; they should be united with the people of
   God, and confess Christ before men--but they are ashamed, ashamed,
   ashamed! One fears lest his wife should know it, and she might
   ridicule. Some start abashed lest their friends should know it, for the
   finger of scorn or the breath of raillery could frighten them out of
   their senses. Others of them are alarmed because the world might,
   perchance, give them an ill name. Do you know where the fearful go? Not
   the fearing, not the doubting--for there are many poor, humble doubters
   and fearers that are saved--but do you know where the fearful go? The
   fearful that are afraid of being persecuted, mocked, or even laughed at
   for Christ--do you know where they go? You will find it in the Book of
   the Revelation--"But the fearful and unbelieving shall have their part
   in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second
   death." Have you never read that sentence which says, "Whosoever shall
   be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be
   ashamed when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and
   of the holy angels?" There you are, young men! you are ashamed of
   Christ. You have just come up from the country, and you did not pray to
   God the other night because there was another young man in the room,
   and you were ashamed of him! In the name of God I do entreat you, nay,
   I command you, be not ashamed of your Master, Christ, and of the
   religion which you learned at your father's knee. There are others of
   you who work in a large shop, and you do not want to be jeered at, as
   the other young fellow is who works with you, because he is a
   Christian. You keep your love as a secret do you, and will not let it
   out? What! if Christ had only loved you in secret, and had never dared
   to come here on earth to be despised and rejected of men, where would
   you have been? "No man lighteth a candle and putteth it under a
   bushel." Do you think that Christ has lit a candle in your hearts that
   you may hide it? Oh! I pray you, be not like the hare. Let your hoof be
   so divided from the rest of mankind that they may say, "There is a
   man--he is not as bold as a hon, mayhap, but he is not ashamed to be a
   follower of Jesus; he does bear the sneer and gibe for him, and counts
   it his honor to be thought evil of for Jesus' sake." Oh! be not, I pray
   you, like the timid hare, lest you be found among the unclean!

   There is one other creature mentioned--"The swine, though he divide the
   hoof, and be cloven-footed, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean
   to you." Now, the swine is the emblem of those who do act rightly. They
   make a profession; before men they are the most upright and the most
   devout; but then the inner part is not right; they do not chew the cud.
   The foot is right, but not the inward part. There is no chewing, no
   masticating, no digesting the Word of Life. "But," says one, "why pick
   out a swine, because that does not seem to be a fair comparison." Yes
   it is, for there are no people in the world more like swine than those
   Pharisees who make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; whose
   hoof is divided enough, but whose inward part is very wickedness. I do
   not know an animal that might more filly picture out those vile,
   unclean Pharisees. You may say you think it is too hard a picture for
   you. You are put down thus in the catalogue, and I have no other place
   in which to put you. You are like swine, unless the grace of God be in
   you. What good does the swine do? Of what concern is life to him but to
   feed grossly and slumber heavily? And so your life, since the inward
   part is wrong, you bring no glory to God, you bring no good to your
   fellow-men. Oh! that the Lord would show you that dead morality,
   unattended by the love of God in the soul, will most certainly be of no
   avail! "You must be born again." "Except ye be converted, and become as
   little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven."

   My text seems to be a dividing one; it divides the house in two.
   Remember, dear friends, the day is coming when a greater division than
   that which description can give will occur to all of us. But the same
   rule will be enforced. We shall be assembled in one crowd, a mightier
   crowd than language can picture, or imagination grasp. The books shall
   be opened--books more terrible than this Book of Mercy. The Book of
   Life shall be unfolded and read, in which those washed in Jesu's blood,
   and so made clean, shall find their names recorded. They are borne to
   heaven. Listen to the music of the angels as they bear them up to God's
   right hand! Where will you be? Will you be with those who mount to
   heaven, or with yonder trembling, shrieking, screaming souls, who, as
   hell opens her mouth, descend alive into the pit? God help you if you
   are not on the righthand side! It is not too late. Jesus Christ is
   still preached to you. The way of salvation is very plain. It is
   this--Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved. Believe
   thou in Jesus. Then make a profession of thy faith in God's own
   ordained way and method, and you have his promise for it that you will
   be saved. God help you to believe, and you shall be saved through
   Jesus, and unto him shall be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.

   A Sermon

   (No. 500)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, March 15th, 1863, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and
   called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped
   us."--1 Samuel 7:12.

   IT IS CERTAINLY A VERY DELIGHTFUL THING to mark the hand of God in the
   lives of ancient saints. How profitable an occupation to observe God's
   goodness in delivering David out of the jaw of the hon and the paw of
   the bear; his mercy in passing by the transgression, iniquity, and sin
   of Manasseh; his faithfulness in keeping the covenant made with
   Abraham; or his interposition on the behalf of the dying Hezekiah. But,
   beloved, would it not be even more interesting and profitable for us to
   remark the hand of God in our own lives? Ought we not to look upon our
   own history as being at least as full of God, as full of his goodness
   and of his truth, as much a proof of his faithfulness and veracity as
   the lives of any of the saints who have gone before? I think we do our
   Lord an injustice when we suppose that he wrought all his mighty acts
   in days of yore, and showed himself strong for those in the early time,
   but doth not perform wonders or lay bare his arm for the saints that
   are now upon the earth. Let us review, I say, our own diaries. Surely
   in these modern pages we may discover some happy incidents, refreshing
   to ourselves and glorifying to our God. Have you had no deliverances?
   Have you passed through no rivers, supported by the Divine presence?
   Have you walked through no fires unharmed? Have you not been saved in
   six troubles? yea, in seven hath not Jehovah helped you? Have you had
   no manifestations? The God that spoke to Abraham at Mamre, hath he
   never spoken to you? The angel that wrestled with Jacob at Peniel, hath
   he never wrestled with you? He that stood in the fiery furnace with the
   three holy children, hath he never trodden the coals at your side? O
   beloved, he has manifested himself unto us as he doth not unto the
   world. Forget not these manifestations; fail not to rejoice in them.
   Have you had no choice favors? The God that gave Solomon the desire of
   his heart, hath he never listened to you and answered your requests?
   That God of lavish bounty, of whom David sang, "Who satisfieth thy
   mouth with good things, so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's,"
   hath he never satiated you with fatness? Have you never been made to he
   down in green pastures? Have you never been led by the still waters?
   Surely, beloved, the goodness of God of old has been repeated unto us.
   The manifestations of his grace to those gone to glory has been renewed
   to us, and delivering mercies as experienced by them are not unknown
   even to us, upon whom the ends of the world are come.

   I beg you, therefore, dear friends, for a little time this morning, to
   fix your thoughts upon your God in connection with yourselves; and,
   while we think of Samuel piling the stones and saying, "Hitherto hath
   the Lord helped us," let us lay the emphasis upon the last word and
   say, "Hitherto hath the Lord helped US," and if you can put it in the
   singular, and say, "Hitherto hath the Lord helped ME," so much the
   better.

   Again, it is a very delightful exercise to remember the various ways in
   which the grateful saints recorded their thankfulness. Who can look
   without pleasure upon the altar which Noah reared after his
   preservation from the universal deluge? Have not our eyes often
   sparkled as we have thought of Abraham building the altar and calling
   it "Jehovah-jireh, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen?" Have we
   not read with intense satisfaction, of Jacob setting up the stone which
   had been his pillow, and pouring oil upon it, and calling upon the name
   of the Lord, naming the place Bethel, though the name thereof was Luz
   at the first? Who has failed to rejoice in the martial music of
   Miriam's timbrel, and the glorious notes of Moses' song at the Red Sea?
   And have we not paused and looked at the twelve stones set up in the
   midst of Jordan by good old Joshua when Jordan was driven back, that
   the hosts of Israel might go through dryshod? Surely, brethren, we have
   rejoiced in this stone which Samuel set up and called Ebenezer? And, in
   looking upon all the various ways in which the saints of God have
   recorded his lovingkindness of old, we have felt a satisfaction in
   beholding the perpetuity of God's glory, since one generation showeth
   forth to another all his mighty acts. Oh, would it not be quite as
   pleasant, and more profitable for us to record the mighty acts of the
   Lord as we have seen them? Should not we set up the altar unto his
   name, or weave his mercies into a song? Should we not take the pure
   gold of thankfulness, and the jewels of praise, and make them into
   another crown for the head of Jesus? Ought not our souls to give forth
   musics as sweet and exhilarating as ever came from David's harp? Ought
   not the feet of our gratitude to trip as lightly as Miriam's when she
   led the daughters of Israel? Have we not some means of praising God?
   Are there no methods by which we may set forth the gratitude we feel
   within? I trust we can make an offering unto our Lord. We can entertain
   our beloved with the spiced wine of our pomegranate, and the choice
   drops of our honeycomb. I hope that this day our souls may suggest unto
   themselves some way in which we may record the Lord's mighty deeds, and
   hand down to coming generations our testimony of his faithfulness and
   of his truth.

   In the spirit of these two observations then, looking at God's hand in
   our own life, and acknowledging that hand with some record of
   thankfulness, I, your minister, brought by divine grace to preach this
   morning the five hundredth of my printed sermons, consecutively
   published week by week, set up my stone of Ebenezer to God. I thank
   Him, thank Him humbly, but yet most joyfully for all the help and
   assistance given in studying and preaching the word to these mighty
   congregations by the voice, and afterwards to so many nations through
   the press. I set up my pillar in the form of this sermon. My motto this
   day shall be the same as Samuel's, "Hitherto, the Lord hath helped me."
   And as the stone of my praise is much too heavy for me to set it
   upright alone, I ask you, my comrades in the day of battle, my
   fellow-laborers in the vineyard of Christ, to join with me in
   expressing gratitude, while together we set up the stone of memorial
   and say, "Hitherto the Lord hath helped us."

   This morning there are three things I want to talk about--three yet
   only one. This stone of help was suggestive as to the place of its
   erection, as to the occasion of its setting up, and as to the
   inscription which it bore.

   I. First, then, much valuable instruction, much excitement to devout
   thankfulness may be found in THE SPOT WHERE THE STONE OF EBENEZER WAS
   SET UP.

   Twenty years before on that field Israel was routed. Twenty years
   before, Hoplini and Phineas, the priests of the Lord, were slain upon
   that ground, and the ark of the Lord was taken, and the Philistines
   triumphed. It was well that they should remember the defeat they had
   sustained, and that amidst the joyous victory they should recollect
   that the battle had been turned into a defeat unless the Lord had been
   upon their side. Brethren, let us remember our defeats. Have we
   forgotten when we went out in our own strength determined to subdue our
   corruptions, and found ourselves weak as water? Have you forgotten when
   you reposed in the ark of the Lord, when you rested in ceremonies and
   ordinances, and not in the rock of your salvation? Have you forgotten,
   I say, how you were discomfited before your sins and found no place of
   refuge from your adversaries? Have we forgotten our pitiful failures in
   preaching and prayer when we waited not upon God for strength? O those
   times of groaning, when none have believed our report because the
   Lord's arm was not revealed. I call to remembrance all my failures as I
   stand on this hill of joy. I doubt not, that on the field of Ebenezer
   there were the graves of thousands who had been slain in fight. Let the
   graves of our past proud notions, the graves of our self-confidence,
   the graves of our creature-strength and boasting, stir us up to praise
   the Lord who hath hitherto helped us. Perhaps on that spot there stood
   a trophy raised by the insulting Philistines. Oh, let the remembrance
   of the boasting of the adversary, when he said, "Aha! aha!" let that
   come into our ears to sweeten the shout of triumph while we glorify the
   God of Israel. Have you done anything for God? You would have done
   nothing without him. Look to your former defeats. Do you return
   victorious? You would have returned with your garments trailed in the
   mire, and your shield dishonored, if God had not been upon your side.
   Oh, ye that have proven your weakness, perhaps by some terrible fall,
   or in some sad disappointment, let the recollection of the spot where
   you were vanquished constrain you the more to praise the Lord who hath
   helped you even to this day to triumph over your adversaries.

   The field between Mizpeh and Shen would also refresh their memories
   concerning their sins, for it was sin that conquered them. Had not
   their hearts been captured by sin, their land had never been captured
   by Philistia. Had they not turned their backs upon their God, they
   would not have turned their backs in the day of conflict. Brethren, let
   us recollect our sins; they will serve as a black foil on which the
   mercy of God shall glisten the more brightly. Egypt's fertility is the
   more wonderful because of its nearness to the Lybian sands, which would
   cover it altogether if it were not for the Nile. That God should be so
   good is marvellous, but that he should be so good to you and to me, who
   are so rebelhous, is a miracle of miracles. I know not a word which can
   express the surprise and wonder our souls ought to feel at God's
   goodness to us. Our hearts playing the harlot; our lives far from
   perfect; our faith almost blown out; our unbelief often prevailing; our
   pride lifting up its accursed head; our patience a poor sickly plant,
   almost nipped by one night's frost; our courage little better than
   cowardice; our love lukewarmness; our ardor but as ice--oh, my dear
   brethren, if we will but think any one of us what a mass of sin we are,
   if we will but reflect that we are after all, as one of the fathers
   writes, "walking dunghills," we should indeed be surprised that the sun
   of divine grace should continue so perpetually to shine upon us, and
   that the abundance of heaven's mercy should be revealed in us. Oh,
   Lord, when we recollect what we might have been, and what we really
   have been, we must say, "Glory be unto the gracious and merciful God
   who hitherto hath helped us."

   Again, that spot would remind them of their sorrows. What a mournful
   chapter in Israel's history is that which follows their defeat by the
   Philistines. Good old Eli, you remember, fell backward and broke his
   neck; and his daughter-in-law in the pangs of her travail cried,
   concerning her child, "Call him Ichabod, for the glory has departed,
   because the ark of the Lord is taken." Their harvests were snatched
   away by the robbers; their vintage was gleaned for them by alien hands.
   Israel had twenty years of deep and bitter sorrow. They might have said
   with David, "We went through fire and through water; men did ride over
   our heads." Well, friends, let the remembrance of our sorrows also
   inspire us with a profounder thankfulness while we erect the stone of
   Ebenezer. We have had our sorrows as a Church. Shall I remind you of
   our black and dark day? Never erased from our memory can be the time of
   our affliction and trial. Death came into our windows, and dismay into
   our hearts. Did not all men speak ill of us? Who would give us a good
   word? The Lord himself afflicted us, and broke us as in the day of his
   anger--so it seemed to us, then. Ah, God thou knowest how great have
   been the results which flowed from that terrible calamity, but from our
   souls the memory never can be taken, not even in heaven itself. In the
   recollection of that night of confusion, and those long weeks of
   slander and abuse, let us roll a great stone before the Lord, and let
   us write thereon, "Hitherto the Lord hath helped us." Little I ween did
   the devil get by that master-stroke; small was the triumph which he
   earned by that piece of malice. Greater multitudes than ever flocked to
   listen to the word, and some here who otherwise might never have
   attended the preaching of the gospel, remain as living monuments of
   God's power to save. Of all evil things out of which good has arisen,
   we can always point to the Surrey Hall catastrophe as one of the
   greatest goods which ever befel this neighborhood, notwithstanding the
   sorrows which it brought. This one fact is but a sample of others; for
   it is the Lord's rule to bring good out of evil, and so to prove his
   wisdom and magnify his grace. O ye that have come from beds of
   languishing, ye that have been bowed down with doubt and fear, and ye
   that have been poverty-stricken, or slandered, or apparently deserted
   by your God, if this day the glory of God's grace resteth upon you,
   pile the stone, and anoint the pillar, and write thereon, "Ebenezer,
   hitherto the Lord hath helped us."

   While dwelling upon the pecuharity of the locality, we must remark,
   that, as it had been the spot of their defeat, their sin, their sorrow,
   so now before the victory, it was the place of their repentance. You
   see, beloved, they came together to repent, to confess their sins, to
   put away their false gods, to cast Ashtaroth from their houses and from
   their hearts. It was there that they saw God's hand and were led to
   say, "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us." When you and I are most
   diligent in hunting sin, then God will be most vahant in routing our
   foes. You look to the work within and overcome sin, and God will look
   to the work without and overcome your troubles and your trials for you.
   Ah, dear friends, as we pile that stone thinking how God has helped us,
   let us shed tears of sorrow to think how ungrateful we have been. On
   earth penitence and praise must always sing together. Just as in some
   of our tunes there are two or three parts, we shall always need
   repentance to take the bass notes while we are here, while faith in
   praise can mount up to the very highest notes of the divine gamut of
   gratitude. Yes, with our joy for pardoned guilt we mourn that we
   pierced the Lord, and with our joy for strengthened graces and ripening
   experience, we must mourn over ingratitude and unbelief. Hitherto the
   Lord hath helped thee, and yet thou didst once say, "My God has
   forgotten me." Hitherto the Lord hath helped thee, and yet thou didst
   murmur and complain against him. Hitherto the Lord hath helped thee,
   and yet thou didst once deny him like Peter. Hitherto the Lord hath
   helped thee, and yet thine eye hath gone astray after vanity, and thy
   hand hath touched sin, and thy heart hath played the wanton. Let us
   repent, my brethren, for it is through our tears, that we shall best
   perceive the beauty of these grateful words, "Hitherto hath the Lord
   helped us."

   You must remember, too, that Ebenezer was the place of lamentation
   after the Lord. They came together to pray God to return to them. We
   shall surely see God when we long after him. How delightful it is to
   see a Church earnest after revivals, crying, pleading for God to come
   into her midst. When you know, brethren, that without God your
   ordinances are nothing, when you cannot rest satisfied with the dead,
   dry letter, but really want to have the power and the presence of God,
   then it will not be long before you have it. So while you and I express
   gratitude for the past, let us breathe another prayer to God for
   renewed grace. If you personally have lost the light of his face, pray
   this morning--

   "Return, O holy Dove! return,

   Sweet messenger of rest!

   I hate the sins that made thee mourn,

   And drove thee from my breast."

   And if it be the entire Church, and in any measure our love has grown
   cold, and the converting and sanctifying spirit has departed, let us
   pray also the same prayer.

   "Savior, visit thy plantation;

   Grant us, Lord, a gracious rain!

   All will come to desolation,

   Unless thou return again;

   Lord, revive us,

   All our help must come from thee!"

   The place of revival should be the place of gracious thankfulness.

   On that day, too, Mizpeh was the place of renewed covenant, and its
   name signifies the watch-tower. These people, I say, came together to
   renew their covenant with God, and wait for him as upon a watch-tower.
   Whenever God's people look back upon the past they should renew their
   covenant with God. Put your hand into the hand of Christ anew, thou
   saint of the Most High, and give thyself to him again. Climb thy
   watch-tower and watch for the coming of thy Lord. See whether there be
   sin within thee, temptation without thee,--duty neglected or lethargy
   creeping over thee. Come to Mizpeh, the watch-tower; come to Mizpeh the
   place of the renewal of the covenant, and then set up your stone and
   say, "Hitherto, the Lord hath helped us."

   It seems to me that the spot where Samuel said "Ebenezer," was
   exceedingly similar in many respects to the position occupied by us
   this day. I do not think the children of Israel could with heartier joy
   say "Ebenezer!" than we can. We have had many sins, a share of sorrows,
   and some defeats by reason of our own folly. I hope we have humbled
   ourselves before God, and lament after him, and desire to behold him,
   and to dwell very near him, and that our soul doth bless his name while
   we renew the covenant again this day, and while we come to the
   watch-tower and wait to hear what God the Lord will speak unto us.
   Come, then, in this great house which the Lord's favor has builded for
   us, let us sing together, "Hitherto the Lord hath helped us."

   II. We now change the subject to look at the OCCASION OF THE ERECTION
   OF THIS MEMORIAL.

   The tribes had assembled unarmed to worship. The Philistines, hearing
   of their gathering, suspected a revolt. A rising was not at that time
   contemplated, though no doubt there was lurking in the hearts of the
   people a hope that they would somehow or other be delivered. The
   Philistines being as a nation far inferior in numbers to the children
   of Israel, they had the natural suspiciousness of weak oppressors. If
   we must have tyrants let them be strong ones, for they are never so
   jealous or cruel as those little despots who are always afraid of
   rebelhon. Hearing that the people had come together, the Philistines
   determined to attack them; to attack an unarmed company, mark you, who
   had come together for worship. The people were alarmed; naturally they
   might be. Samuel, however, the prophet of God, was equal to the
   occasion. He bade them bring a lamb. I do not know that the lamb was
   offered according to the Levitical rites, yet prophets in all ages had
   a right to dispense with ordinary laws. This was to show that the legal
   dispensation was not permanent, that there was something higher than
   the Aaronic priesthood, so that Samuel and Elijah, men in whom God
   expressly dwelt, were mightier than the ordinary officiating priests of
   the sanctuary. He takes the lamb, puts it on the altar, offers it, and
   as it smokes to heaven he offers prayer. The voice of man is answered
   by the voice of God; a great thunder dismays the Philistines, and they
   are put to rout.

   We, I think, have been in similar circumstances. Hear the parallel. The
   victory obtained was by the lamb. As soon as the lamb was slaughtered,
   and the smoke went up to heaven, the blessing began to descend upon the
   Israelites, and the curse upon the foes. "They smote them"--note the
   words--they "smote them until they came under Betlicar," which, being
   interpreted, signifies "the house of the Lamb." At the offering of the
   lamb the Israelites began to fight the Philistines, and slew them even
   to the house of the lamb. Brethren, if we have done anything for
   Christ, if we have achieved any victories, if in this house any souls
   have been converted, any hearts sanctified, any drooping spirits
   comforted, bear witness that it has been all through the Lamb. When we
   have pictured Christ slaughtered, have described the agonies which he
   endured upon the cross, when we have tried to preach fully though
   feebly the great doctrine of his substitutionary sacrifice, have set
   him forth as the propitiation for sins, then it is that the victories
   have begun. And when we have preached Christ ascending up on high,
   leading captivity captive, and when we have glorified in the fact that
   he ever liveth to make intercession for us, and that he shall come to
   judge the quick and dead, if any good has been accomplished it has been
   through the Lamb--the Lamb slain, or else the Lamb exalted. Hark you,
   dear friends, as we pile our Ebenezer this morning, we do it honoring
   him. "Unto the Lamb once slain be glory for ever and ever." You have
   overcome your foes, you have slaughtered your sins, you have mastered
   your troubles. How has it been? From the altar of that bleeding lamb,
   onward to the throne of him who is to reign for ever and ever, the
   whole road has been stained with the crimson blood of your enemies: you
   have overcome through the blood of the Lamb. The Lamb shall overcome
   thee. He that rides on the white horse goeth before us; his name is the
   Lamb. And all the saints shall follow him on the white horses, going
   forth conquering and to conquer. "Ebenezer; hitherto the Lord hath
   helped us." But the help has always been through the Lamb, the
   bleeding, the living, the reigning Lamb.

   As in this occurrence the sacrifice was exalted, so also was the power
   of prayer acknowledged. The Philistines were not routed except by
   prayer. Samuel prayed unto the Lord. They said, "Cease not to cry unto
   the Lord for us." Brethren, let us bear our witness this morning that,
   if aught of good has been accomplished here, it has been the result of
   prayer. Often have I solaced my heart by the recollection of the
   prayers offered in our former house of meeting at New Park-street. What
   supplications have I heard there; what groans of wrestling spirits;
   times we have known when the minister has not had the heart to say a
   word, because your prayers to God have melted him--stopped his
   utterance, and he has been fain to pronounce a benediction and send you
   away, because the Spirit of God has been so present that it was hardly
   the time to speak to man, but only to speak to God. I do not think we
   always have the same spirit of prayer here, and yet in this I must and
   will rejoice--I know not where the spirit of prayer is to be found more
   in exercise than in this place. I know you hold up my hands, you that
   are like Aaron and Hur upon the mountains. I know that you intercede
   with God for the conversion of this neighborhood, and the
   evangelization of this great city. Young and old, you do strive
   together that the kingdom may come, and the Lord's will may be done.
   But, oh, we must not forget as we look upon this vast Church--two
   thousand and more members walking in the fear of God--we must not
   forget that this increase came as the result of prayer, and that it is
   in prayer still that our strength must he. I charge you before the Most
   High, never depend upon my ministy. What am I? What is there in me? I
   speak, and when God speaks through me I speak with a power unknown to
   men in whom the Spirit dwells not; but if He leave me, I am not only as
   weak as other men, but less than they, for I have no wisdom of years, I
   have no human learning, I have taken no degree in the university, and
   wear no titles of learned honor. If God speak by me, he must have all
   the glory; if he saves souls by such a frail being, he must have all
   the glory. Give unto the Lord glory and strength; lay every particle of
   the honor at his feet. But do continue to pray, do plead with God for
   me that his power may still be seen, his arm still put mightily to his
   work. Prayer honored must be recollected when we set up the Ebenezer
   and say, "Hitherto the Lord hath helped us."

   Again, as there was prayer and sacrifice, you must remember that in
   answer to the sweet savor of the lamb and the sweet perfume of Samuel's
   intercession, Jehovah came forth to rout his foes. I read not that
   Israel shouted a war-cry. No, their shouts would not have been heard
   amid those great thunders. I find that they dashed to battle; but it
   was not their bow, their spear, their sword, that gained the viotory.
   Hearken, my brethren, the voice of God is heard! Crash--crash! Where
   are you now, ye sons of Anak! The heavens shake, the earth rocks, the
   everlasting hills do bow, the birds of the air fly to the coverts of
   the forest to hide themselves, the timid goats upon the mountains seek
   the clefts of the rocks. Peal on peal the thunders roll till mountain
   answers mountain in loud uproar of affright. From crag to crag leaps
   the live lightning, and the Philistines are all but blinded by it, and
   stand aghast, and then take to their heels and fly. Quit yourselves
   like men, O Philistines, that ye be not servants to the Hebrews. Quit
   yourselves like men, but unless ye be gods ye must tremble now. Where
   are your bucklers and the bosses thereof? Where are your spears and the
   sheen thereof? Now let your swords flash from their scabbards; now send
   out your giants and their armor-bearers! Now let your Gohaths defy the
   Lord God of hosts! Aha! Aha! Ye become like women, ye quake! ye faint!
   See, see! they turn their backs and fly before the men of Israel, whom
   they counted but as slaves. They flee. The warrior fhes and the stout
   heart quails, and the mighty man fhes like a timid dove to his
   hiding-place. "Glory be unto the Lord God of Israel: his own right hand
   and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory."

   Beloved, if aught of good has been accomplished, or if you and I have
   routed sin, how hath it been? Not by our strength, not by our power,
   but by the glorious voice of God. When the gospel is truly preached it
   is God thundering. It may sound as feebly as a child's voice when we
   tell of Jesus crucified, but it is God thundering, and I tell you,
   sirs, the thunders of God never so smote the heart of the Philistines
   as the gospel of Christ does the heart of convinced sinners. When we
   preach and God blesses it, it is God's lightnings, it is God's flashes
   of divine fire, the glittering of his spear; for never were Philistines
   so smitten with the blaze of lightning in their faces as sinners are
   when God's law and gospel flash into their dark eyes. But to God be the
   glory--to God--to God--to God alone! Not a word for man, not a syllable
   for the son of man. "Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our
   sins in his blood, unto him be glory." This is the song of perfect
   saints above; shall it not be the song of imperfect ones below? "Not
   unto us--not unto us," the seraphs cry as they veil their faces with
   their wings, and cast their crowns at Jehovah's feet. "Not unto us, not
   unto us," must we say while we exult in his power and magnify the God
   of our salvation.

   III. This was the occasion then. I need not tarry longer, but turn at
   once to THE INSCRIPTION UPON THE MEMORIAL, "Ebenezer, hitherto the Lord
   hath helped us." The inscription may be read in three ways.

   You must read first of all its central word, the word on which all the
   sense depends, where the fullness of it gathers. "Hitherto the LORD
   hath helped us." Note, beloved, that they did not stand still and
   refuse to use their weapons, but while God was thundering they were
   fighting, and while the lightnings were dashing in the foeman's eyes
   they were making them feel the potency of their steel. So that while we
   glorify God we are not to deny or to discard human agency. We must
   fight because God fighteth for us. We must strike, but the power to
   strike and the result of striking must all come from him. You see they
   did not say, "Hitherto our sword hath helped us, hitherto Samuel has
   encouraged us." No, no--"hitherto the Lord has helped us." Now you must
   admit that everything truly great must be of the Lord. You cannot
   suppose a thing so great as the conversion of sinners, the revival of a
   Church can ever be man's work. You see the Thames when the tide is
   ebbing what a long reach of foul, putrid mud, but the tide returns.
   Poor unbeliever, you who thought the river would run out till it was
   all dry and the ships be left aground, see, the flood comes back again,
   joyfully filling up the stream once more. But you are quite certain
   that so large a river as the Thames is not to be flooded except by
   ocean's tides. So you cannot see great results and ascribe them to man.
   Where there is little worlk done men often take the credit themselves,
   but where there is great work done, they dare not. If Simon Peter had
   been angling over the side of his ship and had caught a fine fish, he
   might have said, "Well done fisherman!" But when the boat was full of
   fish, so that it began to sink, he could not think of himself then. No,
   down he goes with "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord." The
   greatness of our work compels us to confess that it must be of God, it
   must be of the Lord alone. And, dear friends, it must be so if we
   consider the little with which we began. Jacob said as he came over
   Jordan, "With my staff I crossed this Jordan, but now am I become two
   bands." Surely his becoming two bands must be of God, for he had
   nothing but his staff. And do you not remember some few of you here
   present one morning when we crossed this Jordan with a staff? Were we a
   hundred when first I addressed you? What hosts of empty pews, what a
   miserable handful of hearers. With the staff we crossed that Jordan.
   But God has multiphed the people and multiphed the joy, till we have
   become not only two bands but many bands; and many this day are
   gathering to hear the gospel preached by the sons of this church,
   begotten of us, and sent forth by us to minister the word of life in
   many towns and villages throughout these three kingdoms. Glory be unto
   God, this cannot be man's work. What effort made by the unaided
   strength of man will equal this which has been accomplished by God. Let
   the name of the Lord, therefore, be inscribed upon the pillar of the
   memorial. I am always very jealous about this matter. If we do not as a
   Church and a congregation, if we do not as individuals, always give God
   the glory, it is utterly impossible that God should work by us. Many
   wonders I have seen, but I never saw yet a man who arrogated the honor
   of his work to himself, whom God did not leave sooner or later.
   Nebuchadnezzar said, "Behold this great Babylon that I have builded."
   Behold that poor lunatic whose hair has grown like eagle's feathers,
   and his nails like bird's claws--that is Nebuchadnezzar. And that must
   be you, and that must be me, each in our own way, unless we are content
   always to give all the glory unto God. Surely, brethren, we shall be a
   stench in the nostrils of the Most High, an offense, even like carrion,
   before the Lord of Hosts, if we arrogate to ourselves any honor. What
   doth God send his saints for? That they may be demigods? Did God make
   men strong that they may exalt themselves into his throne? What, doth
   the King of kings crown you with mercies that you may pretend to lord
   it over him? What, doth he dignify you that you may usurp the
   prerogatives of his throne? No; you must come with all the favors and
   honors that God has put upon you, and creep to the foot of his throne
   and say, What am I, and what is my father's house that thou hast
   remembered me. "Hitherto the Lord hath helped us."

   I said this text might be read three ways. We have read it once by
   laying stress upon the center word. Now it ought to be read looking
   backward. The word "hitherto" seems like a hand pointing in that
   direction. Look back, look back. Twenty
   years--thirty--forty--fifty--sixty--seventy--eighty--"hitherto!" say
   that each of you. Through poverty--through wealth--through
   sickness--through health--at home--abroad--on the land--on the sea--in
   honor--in dishonor--in perplexity--in joy--in trial--in triumph--in
   prayer--in temptation--hitherto. Put the whole together. I like
   sometimes to look down a long avenue of trees. It is very delightful to
   gaze from end to end of the long vista, a sort of leafy temple with its
   branching pillars and its arches of leaves. Cannot you look down the
   long aisles of your years, look at the green boughs of mercy overhead,
   and the strong pillars of lovingkindness and faithfulness which bear
   your joys? Are there no birds in yonder branches singing? Surely, there
   must be many. And the bright sunshine and the blue sky are yonder; and
   if you turn round in the far distance, you may see heaven's brightness
   and a throne of gold. "Hitherto! hitherto!"

   Then the text may be read a third way,--looking forward. For when a man
   gets up to a certain mark and writes "hitherto," he looks back upon
   much that is past, but "hitherto" is not the end, there is yet a
   distance to be traversed. More trials, more joys; more temptations,
   more triumphs; more prayers, more answers; more toils, more strength;
   more fights, more victories; more slanders, more comforts; more hons
   and bears to be fought, more tearings of the hon for God's Davids, more
   deep waters, more high mountains; more troops of devils, more hosts of
   angels yet. And then come sickness, old age, disease, death. Is it over
   now? No, no, no! We will raise one stone more when we get into the
   river, we will shout Ebenezer there: "hitherto the Lord hath helped
   us," for there is more to come. An awakening in his likeness, climbing
   of starry spheres, harps, songs, palms, white raiment, the face of
   Jesus, the society of saints, the glory of God, the fullness of
   eternity, the infinity of bliss. Yes, as sure as God has helped so far
   as to-day, he will help us to the close. "I will never leave thee, I
   will never forsake thee; I have been with thee, and I will be with thee
   to the end." Courage, brethren, then; and as we pile the stones,
   saying, "Hitherto the Lord hath helped us," let us just gird up the
   loins of our mind, and be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that
   is to be revealed in us, for as it has been, so it shall be world
   without end.

   I want some oil to pour on this pillar--I want some oil. Jacob poured
   oil upon it and called upon the name of the Lord. Where shall I get my
   oil. Grateful hearts, have ye any oil? Prayerful spirits, have ye any?
   Companions of Jesus, have ye any? Ye that commune with him day and
   night, have ye any? Pour it out, then. Break your alabaster boxes, oh
   ye Mary's. Pour out your prayers this morning with mine. Offer your
   thanksgivings with my grateful expressions of thanks. Come each of you,
   pour this oil upon the top of this Ebenezer to-day. I want some oil, I
   wonder whether I shall get it from yonder heart. Oh, says one, my heart
   is as a flinty rock. I read in scripture that the Lord brought oil out
   of the flinty rock. Oh, if there should be a soul led to believe in
   Christ this morning, if some heart would give itself up to Christ
   to-day! Why not so? why not? The Holy Ghost can melt flint and move
   mountains. Young man, how long are we to preach to you, how long to
   invite you, how long to pain you, how long to entreat you, to implore
   you? Shall this be the day that you will yield? Dost thou say, "I am
   nothing?" Then Christ is everything. Take him, trust him. I know not a
   better way of celebrating this day of Ebenezer and thanksgiving, than
   by some hearts this day accepting the marriage ring of Christ's love,
   and being affianced unto the Son of God for ever and ever. God grant it
   may be so. It shall be so if you pray for it, O true hearts.

   And unto God be glory for ever. Amen.

   "Great God, we sing that mighty hand,

   By which supported still we stand:

   The opening year thy mercy shows;

   Let mercy crown it till it close.

   By day, by night, at home, abroad,

   Still we are guarded by our God:

   By his incessant bounty fed,

   By his unerring counsel led.

   With grateful hearts the past we own;

   The future, all to us unknown,

   We to thy guardian care commit,

   And peaceful leave before thy feet.

   In scenes exalted or depress'd,

   Be thou our joy, and thou our rest;

   Thy goodness all our hopes shall raise,

   Adored through all our changing days.

   When death shall interrupt these songs,

   And seal in silence mortal tongues,

   Our helper God, in whom we trust,

   In better worlds our souls shall boast."

                                Grace Abounding

   A Sermon

   (No. 501)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, March 22nd, 1863, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "I will love them freely."--Hosea 14:4.

   THIS SENTENCE IS A BODY of divinity in miniature. He who understands
   its meaning is a theologian, and he who can dive into its fullness is a
   true Master in divinity. "I will love them freely," is a condensation
   of the glorious message of salvation which was delivered to us in
   Christ Jesus our Redeemer. The sense hinges upon the word "freely." "I
   will love them freely." Here is the glorious, the suitable, the divine
   way by which love streams from heaven to earth. It is, indeed, the only
   way in which God can love such as we are. It may be that he can love
   angels because of their goodness; but he could not love us for that
   reason; the only manner in which love can come from God to fallen
   creatures is expressed in the word "freely." Here we have spontaneous
   love flowing forth to those who neither deserved it, purchased it, nor
   sought after it.

   Since the word "freely" is the very key-note of the text, we must
   observe its common meaning among men. We use the word "freely" for that
   which is given without money and without price. It is opposed to all
   idea of bargaining, to all acceptance of an equivalent, or that which
   might be construed into an equivalent. A man is said to give freely
   when he bestows his charity on applicants simply on the ground of their
   poverty, hoping for nothing again. A man distributes freely when,
   without asking any compensation, he finds it more blessed to give than
   to receive. Now God's love comes to men all free and unbought; without
   our having merit to deserve, or money to procure it. I know it is
   written, "Come, buy wine and milk," but is it not added "Without money
   and without price?" "I will love them freely;" that is "I will not
   accept their works in barter for my love; I will not receive their love
   as a recompense for mine; I will love them, all unworthy and sinful
   though they be."

   Men give "freely" when there is no inducement. A great many presents of
   late have been given to the Princess of Wales, and tis well and good;
   but the position of the Princess is such that we do not view it as any
   great liberality to subscribe to a diamond necklace, since those who
   give are honored by her acceptance. Now the freeness of God's love is
   shown in this, that the objects of it are utterly unworthy, can confer
   no honor, and have no position to be an inducement to bless them. The
   Lord loves them freely. Some persons are very generous to their own
   relations, but here, again, they can hardly be said to be free, because
   the tie of blood constrains them. Their own children, their own
   brother, their own sister--if men will not be generous here, they must
   be mean through and through. But the generosity of our God is commended
   to us in that he loved his enemies, and while we were yet sinners in
   due time Christ died for us. The word "freely" is "exceeding broad"
   when used in reference to God's love to men. He selects those who have
   not the shadow of a claim upon him, and sets them among the children of
   his heart.

   We use the word "freely," when a favor is conferred without its being
   sought. It can hardly be said that our King in the old histories
   pardoned the citizens of Calais freely when his Queen had first to
   prostrate herself before him, and with many tears to induce him to be
   merciful. He was gracious, but he was not free in his grace. When a
   person has been long dogged by a beggar in the streets, though he may
   turn round and give liberally to be rid of the clamorous applicant, he
   does not give "freely." Remember, with regard to God, that his grace to
   man was utterly unsought. He does give grace to those who seek it, but
   none would ever seek that grace unless unsought grace had first been
   bestowed. Sovereign grace waiteth not for man, neither tarrieth for the
   sons of men. The love of God goes forth to men when they have no
   thought after him; when they are hastening after all manner of sin and
   wantonness. He loves them freely, and as the effect of that love, they
   then begin to seek his face. But it is not our seeking, our prayers,
   our tears, which incline the Lord to love us. God loves us at first
   most freely, without any entreaties or beseechings, and then we come
   both to entreat and to beseech his favor.

   That which comes without any exertion on our part comes to us "freely."
   The rulers digged the well, and as they digged it they sang "Spring up,
   O well!" In such a case, where a well must be digged with much labor,
   the water can hardly be described as rising freely. But yonder, in the
   laughing valley, the spring gushes from the hill-side, and lavishes its
   crystal torrent among the shining pebbles. Man pierced not the
   fountain, he bored not the channel, for, long ere he was born, or ever
   the weary pilgrim bowed himself to its cooling stream, it had leaped on
   its joyous way right freely, and it will do so, as long as the moon
   endureth, freely, freely, freely. Such is the grace of God. No labor of
   man procures it; no effort of man can add to it. God is good from the
   simple necessity of his nature; God is love, simply because it is his
   essence to be so, and he pours forth his love in plenteous streams to
   undeserving, ill-deserving, hell-deserving objects, simply because he
   "will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and he will have
   compassion on whom will have compassion," for it is not of him that
   willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.

   If you ask an illustration of the word "freely," I point to yonder sun.
   How freely he scattereth his life-giving beams. Precious as gold are
   his rays, but he scattereth them like the dust; he sows the earth with
   orient pearl, and bejewels it with emerald and ruby and sapphire, and
   all most freely. You and I forget to pray for the sun's light, but it
   comes at its appointed season; yea, on that blasphemer who curses God,
   the day ariseth, and the sunlight warms him as much as the most
   obedient child of the heavenly Father. That sunbeam falls upon the farm
   of the miser, and upon the field of the churl, and bids the grain of
   the wicked expand in its genial warmth and produce its harvest. That
   sun shines into the house of the adulterer, into the face of the
   murderer, and the cell of the thief. No matter how sinful man may be,
   yet the light of day descends upon him unasked for and unsought. Such
   is the grace of God; where it comes it comes not because sought, or
   deserved, but simply from the goodness of the heart of God, which, like
   the sun, blesseth as it wills. Mark you the gentle winds of heaven, the
   breath of God to revive the languishing, the soft breezes. See the sick
   man at the sea-side, drinking in health from the breezes of the salt
   sea. Those lungs may heave to utter the lascivious song, but the
   healing wind is not restrained, and whether it be breast of saint or
   sinner, yet that wind ceaseth not from any. So in gracious visitations,
   God waiteth not till man is good before he sends the heavenly wind,
   with healing beneath its wings; even as he pleaseth so it bloweth, and
   to the most undeserving it cometh. Observe the rain which drops from
   heaven. It falls upon the desert as well as upon the fertile field; it
   drops upon the rock that will refuse its fertilizing moisture as well
   as upon the soil that opens its gaping mouth to drink it in with
   gratitude. See, it falls upon the hard-trodden streets of the populous
   city, where it is not required, and where men will even curse it for
   coming, and it falls not more freely where the sweet flowers have been
   panting for it, and the withering leaves have been rustling forth their
   prayers. Such is the grace of God. It does not visit us because we ask
   it, much less, because we deserve it; but as God wills it, and the
   bottles of heaven are unstopped, so God wills it, and grace descends.
   No matter how vile, and black, and foul, and godless, men may be, he
   will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and that free, rich,
   overflowing goodness of his can make the very worst and least deserving
   the objects of his best and choicest love.

   Do understand me. Let me not leave this point till I have well defined
   its meaning. I mean this, dear friends: when God says, "I will love
   them freely," he means that no prayers, no tears, no good works, no
   almsgivings are an inducement to him to love men, nay, that not only
   nothing, in themselves, but nothing anywhere else was the cause of his
   love to them; not even the blood of Christ; not even the groans and
   tears of his beloved Son. These are the fruits of his love, not the
   cause of it. He does not love because Christ died, but Christ died
   because the Father loved. Do remember that this fountain of love has
   its spring in itself, not in you, nor in me, but only in the Father's
   own gracious, infinite heart of goodness. "I will love them freely,"
   spontaneously, without any motive ab extra, but entirely because I
   choose to do it.

   In the text we have two great doctrines. I will announce the first one;
   establish it; and then endeavor to apply it.

   I. The first great doctrine is this, that THERE IS NOTHING IN MAN TO
   ATTRACT THE LOVE OF GOD TO HIM.

   We have to establish this doctrine, and our first argument is found in
   the origin of that love. The love of God to man existed before there
   was any man. He loved his chosen people before any one of them had been
   created; nay, before the world had been made upon which man dwells he
   had set his heart upon his beloved and ordained them unto eternal life.
   The love of God therefore existed before there was any good thing in
   man, and if you tell me that God loved men because of the foresight of
   some good thing in them, I again reply to that, that the same thing
   cannot be both cause and effect. Now it is quite certain that any
   virtue which there may be in any man is the result of God's grace. Now
   if it be the result of grace it cannot be the cause of grace. It is
   utterly impossible that an effect should have existed before a cause;
   but God's love existed before man's goodness, therefore that goodness
   cannot be a cause. Brethren, the doctrine of the antiquity of divine
   love is graven as with the point of a diamond upon the very forehead of
   revelation; when the children were not yet born, neither having done
   good nor evil, the purpose of election still stood; while we were yet
   like clay in the mass of creatureship, and God had power to make of the
   same dump a vessel to honor or a vessel to dishonor, he chose to make
   his people vessels unto honor; this could not possibly have been
   because of any good thing in them, for they themselves were not, much
   less their goodness. Our Savior's words--"Even so, Father, for so it
   seemed good in thy sight," reveal not only the sovereignty but the
   freeness of divine affection.

   Do you not know, dear friends, in the second place, that the whole plan
   of divine goodness is entirely opposed to the old covenant of works.
   Paul is very strong on this point, where he expressly tells us that if
   it be of grace it cannot be of works, and if it be of works it cannot
   be of grace, the two having no possibility of commingling. Our God,
   speaking by the prophet, says, "Not according to the covenant that I
   made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to
   bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake,
   although I was an husband unto them." The covenant of grace is as wide
   as the poles asunder from the covenant of works. Now the tenour of the
   covenant of works is this--"This do and thou shalt live;" if, then, we
   do the thing which the covenant of works requires of us we live, and we
   live as the result of our own doing. But the very opposite must be the
   case in the covenant of grace. It can never be as the result of
   anything we do that we are saved under that covenant, or else the two
   are the same, or at least similar, whereas, the whole Bible through
   they are set in contradistinction the one against the other, as
   arranged upon opposite principles, and acting from different springs.
   Oh! you who think that anything in you can make God love you, stand at
   the foot of Sinai and learn the only thing that can lead God to accept
   man on the ground of law, and that is perfect obedience. Read the ten
   commandments through and see if you can keep one of them in the
   fullness of its spirit; and I am sure you will be compelled to cry
   out--"Thy commandment is exceeding broad. Great God, I have sinned."
   And yet if you would stand on the footing of what you are, you must
   take the whole ten, and you must keep them throughout an entire life,
   and never fail in the slightest point, or else abhorred of God you must
   certainly be. The covenant of grace does not speak on that wise at all.
   It views man as guilty, and having nothing to merit; and it says, "I
   will, I will, I will;" it says not "If they will," but "I will and they
   shall. I will sprinkle pure water upon them and they shall be clean,
   and from all their iniquities I will cleanse them." That covenant does
   not look upon man as innocent, but as guilty. "When I passed by I saw
   them in their blood, and I said live; yea, when I saw them in their
   blood I said, live." The first covenant was a contract: "Do this and I
   will do that;" but the next has not the shadow of a bargain in it; it
   is--"I will bless you, and I will continue to bless you; though you
   abound in transgressions, yet I will continue to bless till I make you
   perfect and bring you to my glory at the last." It cannot be, then,
   that there is anything in man that makes God love him, because the
   whole plan of the covenant is opposed to that of works.

   Thirdly, the substance of Gods love--the substance of the covenant
   which springs from God's love--clearly proves that it cannot be man's
   goodness which makes God love him. If you should tell me that there was
   something so good in man that therefore God gave him bread to eat and
   raiment to put on, I might believe you. If you tell me that man's
   excellence constrained the Lord to put the breath into his nostrils,
   and to give him the comforts of this life, I might yield to you. But I
   see yonder, God himself made man; I see that God, that man, at last
   fastened to the tree; I see him on the tree expiring in agonies
   unknown, I hear his awful sliviek,--"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani; "I
   see the dreadful sacrifice of God's only-begotten Son, who was not
   spared but freely delivered up for us all, and I feel certain that it
   would be nothing short of blasphemy if I should admit that man could
   ever deserve such a gift as the death of Christ. The very angels in
   heaven with an eternity of obedience, could never have deserved so
   great a gift as Christ in the flesh dying for them; and oh! shall we
   who are all over foul and defiled, shall we look to that dear cross,
   and say, "I deserved that Savior?" Brethren, this were the height of
   infernal arrogance; let it be far from us; let us rather feel that we
   could not deserve such love as this, and that if God loves us so as to
   give his Son for us, it must be from some hidden motive in his own
   will, it cannot be because of any good thing in us.

   Further, if you will remember the objects of God's love as well as the
   substance of it, you will soon see that it could not be anything in
   them which constrains God to love them. Who are the objects of God's
   love? Are they Pharisees, the men who fast twice in the week and pay
   tithes of all they possess? No, no, no. Are they the moralists who
   touching the law are blameless, and who walk in all the observances of
   their religion without a slip? No; the publicans and harlots enter the
   kingdom of heaven before them. Who are they who are the chosen of God?
   Let the whole tribe now in heaven speak for themselves, and they will
   say, "We have washed our roses; (they needed it; they were black,) and
   we have made them white in the blood of the Lamb." Appeal to any of the
   saints on earth, and they will tell you that they never could perceive
   any good thing in themselves. I have searched my own heart I hope with
   some degree of earnestness, and so far from finding any reason in
   myself why God should love me, I can find a thousand reasons why he
   should destroy me, and drive me for ever from his presence. The best
   thoughts we have are defiled with sin, our very faith is mixed with
   unbelief; the noblest devotion which we ever paid to God is far
   inferior to his deserts, and is marred with infirmity and fault.
   Remember that many of those who are the true servants of God were once
   the very worst servants of Satan. Does it not surprise you that men who
   were the companions of the harlot are now saints of the Most high? The
   drunkard, the blasphemer, the man who defied man's laws as well as
   God's--such were some of us, but we are washed, but we are cleansed,
   but we are sanctified. I never did meet, and I never expect to meet
   with any saved soul that would ever for a moment tolerate the thought
   of there being any goodness in itself to merit God's esteem. No; vile
   and full of sin I am, and if thou hast mercy on me, O God, it is
   because thou wilt, for I merit none.

   Further, constantly are we informed in Scripture that the love of God
   and the fruit of the love of God are a gift. "The wages of sin is
   death, but the gift of God is eternal life." Now, if the Lord stands
   bargaining with you and with me, and says, "I will give you this
   if--if--if--" then he does not love freely; but if, on the other hand,
   it is simply, and purely, and only a gift bestowed as such, not for any
   recompence afterwards to be given, then the gift is a pure and true
   gift, and so the text is warranted in saying, "I will love them
   freely." Now, the gift of God is eternal life, and dear friends, if you
   and I ever get it, we must obtain it as a free gift from God, but by no
   means as wages which we have earned, for our poor earnings will bring
   us death; only God's gift can yield us life.

   Everywhere throughout the Word the Lord's love is greatly and
   wonderfully commended. We are told that as high as the heavens are
   above the earth so high are his ways above our ways. Now, if the Lord
   loved men for some loveliness in them, there would be nothing wonderful
   in it; you and I can do the same. I hope I can love a man who possesses
   moral excellence. You feel, each of you, that if a man's conduct
   towards you is grateful and good, you cannot but love him, or if you do
   not, it becomes a fault on your part. With reverence let me say it, if
   there be something good in man it is no wonder that God should love
   him; it would be unjust if he did not. If naturally in man there be any
   virtue, if there be any praise, if there be any commendable repentance,
   or any acceptable faith, man ought to be loved; this is not a thing to
   amaze the ages, nor to set the angels singing, nor to move the
   mountains and hills in astonisliment; but for God to love a man who is
   bad all over; to love him when there is every reason for hating him,
   when there is not a trace of goodness in him, oh! this is enough to
   make the rocks break their silence and the hills burst forth into
   music.

   This is the first doctrine. I cannot preach upon it as I would this
   morning, for my voice is very weak, and the pain of speaking distracts
   my mind; but it matters not how I preach upon it, for the subject
   itself is so exceedingly full of comfort to a really awakened soul,
   that it needs no garnishing of mine: choice dainties need no skill in
   the carver--their own lusciousness secures them rich acceptance.

   But what is the practical use of it? To you who are going about to
   establish your own righteousness, here is a death-blow to your works,
   and carnal trustings. God will not love you meritoriously. God will
   love you freely. Wherefore go ye about, then, spending your money for
   that which is not bread, and your labor for that which satisfieth not.
   You may boast as you will, but you will have to come to God on a par
   with the worst of the worst; when you do come you will have to be
   accepted, you that are the best of men, just on the same terms as if
   you had been the foulest of the foul. Therefore go not about, busy not
   yourselves with all this fancied righteousness, but come to Jesus as
   you are, come now, without any works of yours, for you must so come or
   not at all. God has said, "I will love them freely," and depend upon it
   he will never love you in any other way. You may think you are toiling
   to heaven, when you shall be only tunnelling your way through mountains
   of self-righteousness down to the depths of hell.

   This doctrine offers comfort to those who do not feel fit to come to
   Christ. Do you not perceive that the text is a death-blow to all sorts
   of fitness? "I will love them freely." Now if there be any fitness
   necessary in you before God will love you then he does not love you
   freely, at least this would be a mitigation and a drawback to the
   freeness of it. But it is "I will love you freely." You say "Lord, but
   my heart is so hard." "I will love you freely." "But I do not feel my
   need of Christ as I could wish." "I will not love you because you feel
   your need; I will love you freely." "But I do not feel that softening
   of spirit that I could desire." Remember, the softening of spirit is
   not a condition, for there are no conditions; the covenant of grace has
   no conditionality whatever. These are the unconditional, sure mercies
   of David; so that you without any fitness may come and venture upon the
   promise of God which was made to you in Christ Jesus, when he said, "He
   that beheyeth on him is not condemned." No fitness is wanted; "I will
   love them freely." Sweep all that lumber and rubbish out of the way!
   Oh! for grace in your hearts to know that the grace of God is free, is
   free to you, without preparation, without fitness, without money, and
   without price!

   Nor does the practical use of our doctrine end here. There are some of
   you who say, "I feel this morning that I am so unworthy; I can well
   believe that God will bless my mother; that Christ will pity my sister;
   I can understand how yonder souls can be saved, but I cannot understand
   how I can be; I am so unworthy." "I will love them freely." Oh! does
   not that meet your case? If you were the most unworthy of all created
   beings, if you had aggravated your sin till you had become the foulest
   and most vile of all sinners, yet "I will love them freely," puts the
   worst on an equality with the best, sets you that are the devil's
   cast-aways, on a par with the most hopeful. There is no reason for
   God's love in any man, if there is none in you, you are not worse off
   than the best of men, for there is none in them; the grace and love of
   God can come as freely to you as they can to those that have long been
   seeking them, for "I am found of them that sought me not."

   Yet once more here. I think this subject invites backsliders to return;
   indeed, the text was specially written for such--"I will heal their
   backsliding; I will love them freely." Here is a son who ran away from
   home. He enlisted for a soldier. He behaved so badly in his regiment
   that he had to be drummed out of it. He has been living in a foreign
   country in so vicious a way that he has reduced his body by disease.
   His back is covered with rags; his character is that of the vagrant and
   felon. When he went away he did it on purpose to vex his father's
   heart, and he has brought his mother's grey hairs with sorrow to the
   grave. One day the young lad receives a letter full of love. His father
   writes--"Return to me, my child; I will forgive you all; I will love
   you freely." Now if this letter had said--"If you will humble yourself
   so much, I will love you; if you will come back and make me
   such-and-such promises, I will love you;" if it had said, "If you will
   behave yourself for the future, I will love you,"--I can suppose the
   young man's proud nature rising; but surely this kindness will melt
   him. Methinks the generosity of the invitation will at once break his
   heart, and he will say, "I will offend no longer, I will return at
   once." Backslider! without any condition you are invited to return. "I
   am married unto you," saith the Lord. If Jesus ever did love you he has
   never left off loving you. You may have left off attending to the means
   of grace; you may have been very slack at private prayer, but if you
   ever were a child of God you are a child of God still, and he cries
   "How can I give thee up? How can I set thee as Admah? How can I make
   thee as Zeboim? My repentings are kindled together; I am God, and not
   man; I will return unto him in mercy. Return, backslider, and seek
   thine injured Father's face. I think I hear a murmur somewhere--"Well,
   this is very, very, very Antinomian doctrine." Ay, objector, it is such
   doctrine as you will want one day; it is the only doctrine which can
   meet the case of really awakened sinners. "God commendeth his love
   toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, in due time, Christ died
   for the ungodly."

   II. Since it is written. "I will love them freely," we believe that
   NOTHING IN MAN CAN BE AN EFFECTUAL BAR TO GOD'S LOVE.

   This is the same doctrine put in another shape. Nothing in man can be
   the cause of God's love, so nothing in man can be an effectual
   hindrance to God's love--I mean such an effectual hindrance as to
   prevent God from loving man. How shall I prove it? If there be anything
   in any man which can be a bar to God's grace, then this would have been
   an effectual hindrance to its coming to any of the human race. All men
   were in the loins of Adam, and if there were a bar in you to God's
   love, that would have been in Adam; consequently, being in Adam, it
   would have been a block to God's love to the race altogether. If there
   be some sin in you, I say, which can effectually prevent God from
   showing grace to you, then that was in Adam, seeing you were in the
   loins of Adam, and it would therefore have been an effectual hindrance
   to God's grace from the race in any one of its members. Seeing God's
   grace found no barriers over which it could not leap, no floodgates
   which it could not burst, no mountains it could not overtop, I am
   persuaded there is nothing in you why God should not show his grace to
   you.

   Besides, one would think that if there be a bar in any it would have
   prevented the salvation of those who are undoubtedly saved. Mention any
   sin you like, and I will assure you upon divine authority that men have
   committed such sins and have yet been saved. Talk of a deed that has
   blackened the man's character for ever, that deed of foul adultery and
   murder; yet that did not stop God's love from flowing to David; and
   even if you have gone that length, and I suppose there is no person
   here who has gone farther, even that cannot prevent divine love from
   lighting upon you. As God does not love because there is excellence, so
   he does not refuse to love because there is sin. Let me select the case
   of Manasseh; he shed innocent blood very much; he bowed before idols;
   what was worse, he made his children to pass through the fire to the
   son of Hinnom, put his own child to death as a sacrifice to the false
   god, and yet for all that God's love laid hold upon him, and Manasseh
   became a bright star in heaven, though once as vile as the lost in
   hell. If there be anything in you, then, that makes you think God
   cannot love you, I reply, Impossible, for surely your sins do not
   exceed those of the chief of sinners. Paul says he was the chief of
   sinners, and he meant it; he spoke by inspiration, and there is no
   doubt he was. Now if the biggest of sinners has passed through the
   strait gate, there must be room for the next biggest; if the greatest
   sinner in the world has been saved, then there is a possibility for you
   and for me, for we cannot be such great sinners as the very chief of
   sinners. But I will dare to say that even if we were, even if we could
   exceed Paul, yet even that could be no barrier; for man's sin, to say
   the most of it, is but the act of a finite creature, but God's grace is
   the act of infinite goodness. God forbid that I should depreciate your
   offenses, they are loathsome, they are hellish in themselves; still
   they are only a creature's deeds, the deeds of a worm that to-day is
   and to-morrow is crushed; but the grace, the love, and the pity of God,
   oh! these are infinite, eternal, everlasting, boundless, matchless,
   quenchless, unconquerable, and therefore the grace of God can overcome
   and prove itself mightier than your guilt and sin. There is no bar,
   then, or else there would have been a bar in the case of others.

   Would it not mar the sovereignty of God if there should be a man in
   whom there was something that would effectually prevent God's love from
   flowing to him? Then it would not be, "I will have mercy on whom I will
   have mercy;" no, it would be "I will have mercy on those I can have
   mercy on; but there is such-and-such a man, I cannot have mercy on him,
   for he is gone too far." No, glory be to God for that sentence--"I will
   have mercy upon whom I will have mercy." The devil may say, "What, on
   that man, on that man! He has gone too far." "Ah!" but says God, "if I
   will it, he has not gone too far; I will have mercy on him." I do not
   know that I ever felt more the boundless sovereignty of the grace of
   God than when I looked that text in the face and saw it--not "I will
   have mercy on those that are vialing to have it;" or, "I will have
   mercy on penitents," no--"I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy."
   And so, if God wills to save you, there can be no bar to it, or else
   that would be a marring and a limiting of the sovereignty of God.

   Would not this be a great slur cast upon the grace of God? Suppose I
   could find out a sinner so vile that Jesus Christ could not reach him;
   why then the devils in hell would take him through their streets as a
   trophy; they would say, "This man was more than a match for God; his
   sin was too great for God's grace." What says the Apostle? "Where sin
   abounded"--that is you, poor sinner;--"where sin abounded"--what sins
   you plunged into last night, and on other black occasions,--"where sin
   abounded"--what? Condemnation? Hopeless despair? No, "Where sin
   abounded grace did much more abound." I think I see the conflict in the
   great arena of the universe. Man piles a mountain of sin, but God will
   match it, and he upheaves a loftier mountain of grace; man heaps up a
   still huger hill of sin, but the Lord overtops it with ten times more
   grace; and so the contest continues till at last the mighty God plucks
   up the mountains by the roots and buries man's sin beneath them as a
   fly might be buried beneath an Alp. Abundant sin is no barrier to the
   superabundant grace of God.

   And then, dear friends, would it not detract glory from the gospel, if
   it could be proved that there was some man in whom the gospel could not
   work its way? Suppose that the gospel which is "worthy of all
   acceptation" could not meet certain cases. Suppose I picked out twelve
   men who were so diseased that the gospel remedy could not meet their
   case; oh! then I think I should stop my mouth from all glorying in the
   cross. I could no more say with the apostle, "God forbid that I should
   glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ," for then it would
   not be the power of God unto salvation to every one that beheyeth. No,
   it would be the power of God to all except that dozen. But oh! as often
   as I come into this pulpit, it gives me joy to know that I have a
   gospel to preach which is suitable to every case. A friend told me the
   other day that many notorious characters stole in at times. Thank God
   for that. "Ah!" said some, "but they come only to laugh." Never mind;
   thank God if they come. "Oh! but they will make mockery of it." Nay,
   the Lord knows how to turn mockers into weepers. Let us hope for the
   worst, and labor for the most hopeless.

   The love of God has provided means to meet the extremest case. They are
   twofold; the power of Christ, and the power of the Spirit. Do you tell
   me that sin is a barrier? I answer, "All manner of sin and of blasphemy
   shall be forgiven unto men." "The blood of Jesus Christ, his Son,
   cleanseth from all sin." The atonement of Christ is capable of removing
   from men, all sorts, sizes, and dyes of iniquity. "Though your sins be
   as scarlet they shall be as wool; though they be red like crimson they
   shall be whiter than snow." "Ah," cries one, "man's hard-heartedness
   stands in the way of God's love." Beloved, the Holy Spirit is ready to
   meet the case of the hard heart. "Limit not the Holy One of Israel." Is
   anything too hard for the Lord? You tell me that unbelief is a bar. I
   answer "No," for cannot the Holy Spirit make the unbelieving believe,
   yea, if the Holy Spirit once comes into effectual contact with the most
   unbelieving and obstinate spirit it must believe at once. Look at the
   jailer, a few minutes ago he had been putting Paul in the stocks. What,
   what, what, what is this that comes over him? "What must I do to be
   saved?" "Believe," says the Apostle, and he does believe, and becomes
   as phant as a child. Out on the men who think that man is master over
   God! If he willed to stop at this moment the most bloody persecutor,
   the most filthy and licentious man, if he willed to turn the
   blackest-hearted atheist into one of the most brilhant of saints, there
   is nothing in his way to stop him; in a moment omnipotent love can do
   it; the means are provided, both in the blood of Christ for cleansing,
   and in the power of the Spirit for renewing the inner man. Therefore, I
   say it is established beyond doubt, that there is nothing in man which
   can conquer divine love.

   "What is the practical use of this," says one. The practical use of
   this is to set the gate of mercy wide open. I like always to preach
   sermons which leave the door of mercy on the jar for the worst of
   sinners, but this morning I set it wide open. A man has dropped in here
   who has been thinking for years, "I gave myself up to sin in my youth,
   and I have gone astray ever since--there is no hope for me." I tell
   you, soul, all that you have ever done is no bar to God's love to you,
   for he does not love you because of anything good in you, and that
   which is black in you cannot prevent his loving you if he so wills it.
   I tell thee what I would have thee do. I have seen those like unto thee
   come to the foot of the cross, and they have said--

   "Just as I am, and waiting not

   To rid my soul of one dark blot,

   To thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,

   O Lamb of God, I come."

   If thou in thy soul canst now trust the love of God in Christ, thou art
   saved; no matter whosoever thou mayest be, thou art saved this morning,
   and thou shalt go out of this house a regenerate soul, for thou hast
   believed in Jesus, therefore the love of God is come to thee, all thy
   past life is forgotten and forgiven; all thy past ingratitude, and
   blasphemy, and sin are cast into the depths of the sea; and, as far as
   the east is from the west, so far hath he removed thy transgressions
   from thee. I have known the time when, if I had heard the sermon of
   this morning, faint and feeble though it be, I should have danced for
   joy. I feel an intense inward satisfaction and delight while preaching
   it, for I believe it is the opening of the prison to them that are
   bound. Christ died not for the righteous but for sinners. He gave
   himself for our sins and not for our righteousness; this old Lutheran
   doctrine--this grand doctrine which shook old Rome to her very
   foundations, methinks must give poor sinners comfort and peace. I know
   that many will see nothing in it. Of course, none but the sick see any
   value in the healing medicine. I know there are some here who will
   think the sermon is not for them. Oh! may the Spirit of God make some
   accept of this comfort; but they will not unless the Spirit of God
   makes them. Too many of us are like foolish patients, who will not take
   the physician's medicine, and he has need to hold us, and thrust it
   down before we will take it. This is how the Lord dealeth with many,
   not against their will, but yet against their will as it used to be, he
   giveth them the medicine of his grace, and maketh them whole.

   To sum up all in one, what I mean is this: there have straggled in here
   this morning the poor working man, the struggling mechanic, the gay
   young fop, the man who leads a fast life, the wretch who leads a coarse
   life, the woman, perhaps, who has gone far astray; I mean to say to
   such, you are lost, but the Son of man is come to seek and to save you.
   I mean to say to you, sons and daughters of moral parents, who are not
   converted, but perhaps feel yourselves even worse than the immoral, I
   mean to say to you that you are not past hope yet. God will love you
   freely, and this is how his love is preached to you--"Whosoever
   beheyeth on the Lord Jesus Christ shall be saved." Come as you are; God
   will accept you as you are. Come as you are, without any preparation or
   fitness; come as you are, and where the cross is lifted high with the
   bleeding Son of God upon it, fall flat on your face, accepting the love
   manifested there, willingly receiving this day the grace which God
   willingly and freely gives.

   As sinners, without any qualification, as sinners, as undeserving
   sinners, my Lord will receive you graciously and love you freely.

                                 A Jealous God

   A Sermon

   (No. 502)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, March 29th, 1863, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "For the Lord, whose name is jealous, is a jealous God."--Exodus 34:14.

   THE PASSION OF JEALOUSY IN MAN is usually exercised in an evil manner,
   but it is not in itself necessarily sinful. A man may be zealously
   cautious of his honor, and suspiciously vigilant over another, without
   deserving blame. All thoughtful persons will agree that there is such a
   thing as virtuous jealousy. Self-love is, no doubt, the usual
   foundation of human jealousy, and it may be that Shenstone is right in
   his definition of it as "the apprehension of superiority," the fear
   lest another should by any means supplant us; yet the word "jealous" is
   so near akin to that noble word "zealous," that I am persuaded it must
   have something good in it. Certainly we learn from Scripture that there
   is such a thing as a godly jealousy. We find the Apostle Paul declaring
   to the Corinthian Church, "I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy,
   for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a
   chaste virgin to Christ." He had an earnest, cautious, anxious concern
   for their holiness, that the Lord Jesus might be honored in their
   lives. Let it be remembered then, that jealousy, like anger, is not
   evil in itself, or it could never be ascribed to God; his jealousy is
   ever a pure and holy flame. The passion of jealousy possesses an
   intense force, it fires the whole nature, its coals are juniper, which
   have a most vehement flame; it resides in the lowest depths of the
   heart, and takes so firm a hold that it remains most deeply rooted
   until the exciting cause is removed; it wells up from the inmost
   recesses of the nature, and like a torrent irresistibly sweeps all
   before it; it stops at nothing, for it is cruel as the grave (Cant.
   8:6), it provokes wrath to the utmost, for it is the rage of a man,
   therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance (Proverbs 6:34),
   and it over throws everything in the pursuit of its enemy, for "wrath
   is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before
   jealousy?" For all these reasons jealousy is selected as some faint
   picture of that tender regard which God has for His own Deity, honor,
   and supremacy, and the holy indignation which he feels towards those
   who violate his laws, offend his majesty, or impeach his character. Not
   that God is jealous so as to bring him down to the likeness of men, but
   that this is the nearest idea we can form of what the Divine Being
   feels--if it be right to use even that word toward him--when he beholds
   his throne occupied by false gods, his dignity insulted, and his glory
   usurped by others. We cannot speak of God except by using figures drawn
   from his works, or our own emotions; we ought, however, when we use the
   images, to caution ourselves and those who listen to us, against the
   idea that the Infinite mind is really to be compassed and described by
   any metaphors however lofty, or language however weighty. We might not
   have ventured to use the word, "jealousy" in connection with the Most
   High, but as we find it so many times in Scripture, let us with solemn
   awe survey this mysterious display of the Divine mind. Methinks I hear
   the thundering words of Nahum, "God is jealous and the Lord revengeth,
   the Lord revengeth and is furious, the Lord will take vengeance on his
   adversaries, and he reseryeth wrath for his enemies." My soul be thou
   humbled before the Lord and tremble at his name!

   I. Reverently, let us remember that THE LORD IS EXCEEDINGLY JEALOUS OF
   HIS DEITY.

   Our text is coupled with the command--"Thou shalt worship no other
   God." When the law was thundered from Sinai, the second commandment
   received force from the divine jealousy--"Thou shalt not make unto thee
   any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in the heaven
   above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under
   the earth; Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for
   I the Lord thy God am a jealous God." Since he is the only God, the
   Creator of heaven and earth, he cannot endure that any creature of his
   own hands, or fiction of a creature's imagination should be thrust into
   his throne, and be made to wear his crown. In Ezekiel we find the false
   god described as "the image of jealousy which provoketh to jealousy,"
   and the doom on Jerusalem for thus turning from Jehovah runs thus,
   "Mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will
   recompense their way upon their head." False gods patiently endure the
   existence of other false gods. Dagon can stand with Bel, and Bel with
   Ashtaroth; how should stone, and wood, and silver, be moved to
   indignation; but because God is the only living and true God, Dagon
   must fall before his ark; Bel must be broken, and Ashtaroth must be
   consumed with fire. Thus saith the Lord, "Ye shall destroy their
   altars, break their images, and cut down their groves;" the idols he
   shall utterly abolish. My brethren, do you marvel at this? I felt in my
   own soul while meditating upon this matter an intense sympathy with
   God. Can you put yourselves in God's place for a moment? Suppose that
   you had made the heavens and the earth, and all the creatures that
   inhabit this round globe; how would you feel if those creatures should
   set up an image of wood, or brass, or gold, and cry, "These are the
   gods that made us; these things give us life." What--a dead piece of
   earth set up in rivalry with real Deity! What must be the Lord's
   indignation against infatuated rebels when they so far despise him as
   to set up a leek, or an onion, or a beetle, or a frog, preferring to
   worship the fruit of their own gardens, or the vermin of their muddy
   rivers, rather than acknowledge the God in whose hand their breath is,
   and whose are all their ways! Oh! it is a marvel that God hath not
   dashed the world to pieces with thunderbolts, when we recollect that
   even to this day milhons of men have changed the glory of the
   incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to
   birds and four-footed beasts, and creeping things. With what
   unutterable contempt must the living God look down upon those idols
   which are the work of man's hands--"They have mouths, but they speak
   not: eyes have they, but they see not: they have ears, but they hear
   not: noses have they, but they smell not: they have hands, but they
   handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they
   through their throat." God hath longsuffering toward men, and he
   patiently endureth this madness of rebelhon; but, oh! what patience
   must it be which can restrain the fury of his jealousy, for he is a
   jealous God, and brooks no rival. It was divine jealousy which moved
   the Lord to bring all his plagues on Egypt. Careful reading will show
   you that those wonders were all aimed at the gods of Egypt. The people
   were tormented by the very things which they had made to be their
   deities, or else, as in the case of the murrain, their sacred animals
   were themselves smitten, even as the Lord had threatened--"Against all
   the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am Jehovah." Was it not
   the same with ancient Israel? Why were they routed before their
   enemies? Why was their land so often invaded? Why did famine follow
   pestilence, and war succeed to famine? Only because "they provoked him
   to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their
   graven images. When God heard this, he was Froth, and greatly abhorred
   Israel." (Psalm 78:58-59.) How was it that at the last the Lord gave up
   Jerusalem to the flames, and bade the Chaldeans carry into captivity
   the remnant of his people? How was it that he abhorred his heritage,
   and gave up Mount Zion to be trodden under foot by the Gentiles? Did
   not Jeremiah tell them plainly that because they had walked after other
   gods and forsaken Jehovah, therefore he would cast them out into a land
   which they knew not?

   Brethren, the whole history of the human race is a record of the wars
   of the Lord against idolatry. The right hand of the Lord hath dashed in
   pieces the enemy and cast the ancient idols to the ground. Behold the
   heaps of Nineveh! Search for the desolations of Babylon! Look upon the
   broken temples of Greece! See the ruins of Pagan Rome! Journey where
   you will, you behold the dilapidated temples of the gods and the ruined
   empires of their foolish votaries. The moles and the bats have covered
   with forgetfulness the once famous deities of Chaldea and Assyria. The
   Lord hath made bare his arm and eased him of his adversaries, for
   Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.

   With what indignation, then, must the Lord look down upon that apostate
   harlot, called the Romish Church, when, in all her sanctuaries, there
   are pictures and images, relics and slivines, and poor infatuated
   beings are even taught to bow before a piece of bread. In this country,
   Popish idolatry is not so barefaced and naked as it is in other lands;
   but I have seen it, and my soul has been moved with indignation like
   that of Paul on Mars' Hill, when he saw the city wholly to idolatry; I
   have seen thousands adore the wafer, hundreds bow before the image of
   the Virgin, scores at prayer before a crucifix, and companies of men
   and women adoring a rotten bone or a rusty nail, because said to be the
   relic of a saint. It is vain for the Romanist to assert that he
   worships not the things themselves, but only the Lord through them, for
   this the second commandment expressly forbids, and it is upon this
   point that the Lord calls himself a jealous God. How full is that cup
   which Babylon must drink; the day is hastening when the Lord shall
   avenge himself upon her, because her iniquities have reached unto
   heaven, and she hath blasphemously exalted her Pope into the throne of
   the Host High, and thrust her priests into the office of the Lamb.
   Purge yourselves, purge yourselves of this leaven. I charge you before
   God, the Judge of quick and dead, if ye would not be partakers of her
   plagues, come out from her more and more, and let your protest be
   increasingly vehement against this which exalteth itself above all that
   is called God. Let our Protestant Churches, which have too great a
   savoar of Popery in them, cleanse themselves of her fornications, lest
   the Lord visit them with fire and pour the plagues of Babylon upon
   them. Renounce, my brethren, every ceremony which has not Scripture for
   its warrant, and every doctrine which is not established by the plain
   testimony of the Word of God. Let us, above all, never by any sign, or
   word, or deed, have any complicity with this communion of devils, this
   gathering together of the sons of Behal: and since our God is a jealous
   God, let us not provoke him by any affinity, gentleness, fellowship, or
   amity with this Mother of Harlots and abominations of the earth.

   With what jealousy must the Lord regard the great mass of the people of
   this country, who have another God beside himself! With what
   indignation doth he look upon many of you who are subject to the prince
   of the power of the air, the god of this world! To you Jehovah is
   nothing. God is not in all your thoughts; you have no fear of Him
   before your eyes. Like the men of Israel, you have set up your idols in
   your heart. Your god is custom, fashion, business, pleasure, ambition,
   honor. You have made unto yourselves gods of these things; you have
   said, "These be thy gods, O Israel." Ye follow after the things which
   perish, the things of this world, which are vanity. O ye sons of men,
   think not that God is blind. He can perceive the idols in your hearts;
   he understandeth what be the secret things that your souls lust after;
   he searcheth your heart, he trieth your reins; beware lest he find you
   sacrificing to strange gods, for his anger will smoke against you, and
   his jealousy will be stirred. O ye that worship not God, the God of
   Israel, who give him not dominion over your whole soul, and live not to
   his honor, repent ye of your idolatry, seek mercy through the blood of
   Jesus, and provoke not the Lord to jealousy any more.

   Even believers may be reproved on this subject. God is very jealous of
   his deity in the hearts of his own people. Mother, what will he say of
   you, if that darling child occupies a more prominent place in your love
   than your Lord and Savior Jesus Christ? Husband, what shall he say to
   you, and with what stripes shall he smite you, when your wife reigns as
   a goddess in your spirit? And wife, thou shouldest love thy
   husband--thou doest well in so doing; but if thou exaltest him above
   God, if thou makest him to have dominion over thy conscience, and art
   willing to forsake thy Lord to please him, then thou hast made to
   thyself another god, and God is jealous with thee. Ay, and we may thus
   provoke him with the dead as well as with the living. A grief carried
   to excess, a grief nurtured until it prevents our attention to duty, a
   grief which makes us murmur and repine against the will of Providence
   is sheer rebelhon; it hath in it the very spirit of idolatry; it will
   provoke the Lord to anger, and he will surely chasten yet again, until
   our spirit becomes resigned to his rod. "Hast thou not forgiven God
   yet?" was the language of an old Quaker when he saw a widow who for
   years had worn her weeds, and was inconsolable in her grief--"Hast thou
   not forgiven God yet?" We may weep under bereavements, for Jesus wept;
   but we must not sorrow so as to provoke the Lord to anger, we must not
   act as if our friends were more precious to us than our God. We are
   permitted to take solace in each other, but when we carry love to
   idolatry, and put the creature into the Creator's place, and rebel, and
   fret, and bitterly repine, then the Lord hath a rod in his hand, and he
   will make us feel its weight, for he is a jealous God. I fear there are
   some professors who put their house, their garden, their business,
   their skill, I know not what, at seasons into the place of God. It were
   not consistent with the life of godliness for a man to be perpetually
   an idolater, but even true believers will sometimes be overcome with
   this sin, and will have to mourn over it. Brethren, set up no images of
   jealousy, but like Jacob of old cry to yourselves and to your famihes,
   "Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean." Let me
   warn those of you who neglect this that if you be the Lord's people you
   shall soon smart for it, and the sooner the better for your own
   salvation; while, on the other hand, to those ungodly persons who
   continue to live for objects other than divine, let me say, you not
   only smart in this life by bitter disappointments, but you shall also
   suffer eternal wrath in the life to come.

   Come, let me push this matter home upon your consciences; let me carry
   this as at point of bayonet. Why, my hearers, there are some of you who
   never worship God. I know you go up to his house, but then it is only
   to be seen, or to quiet your conscience by having done your duty. How
   many of you merchants aim only to accumulate a fortune! How many of you
   tradesmen are living only for your famihes! How many young men breathe
   only for pleasure! How many young women exist only for amusement and
   vanity. I fear that some among you make your belly your god, and bow
   down to your own personal charms or comforts. Talk of idolaters! They
   are here to-day! If we desire to preach to those who break the first
   and second commandments we have no need to go to Hindostan, or traverse
   the plains of Africa. They are here. Unto you who bow not before the
   Lord let these words be given, and let them ring in your ears--"The
   Lord whose name is jealous, is a jealous God." Who shall stand before
   him when once he is angry? When his jealousy burneth like fire and
   smoketh like a furnace, who shall endure the day of his wrath. Beware,
   lest he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver. Dreadful
   shall it be for you, if at the last you shall behold an angry God
   sitting in judgment. Pause now and meditate upon your doom, and think
   you see the Almighty robed in tempest and whirlwind.

   "His throne a seat of dreadful wrath,

   Girt with devouring flame;

   The Lord appears consuming fire,

   And Jealous is his name."

   God save you for Jesus' sake.

   II. The Lord IS JEALOUS OF HIS SOVEREIGNTY.

   He that made heaven and earth has a right to rule his creatures as he
   wills. The potter hath power over the clay to fashion it according to
   his own good pleasure, and the creatures being made are bound to be
   obedient to their Lord. He has a right to issue commands, he has done
   so--they are holy, and just, and wise; men are bound to obey, but,
   alas, they continually revolt against his sovereignty, and will not
   obey him; nay, there be men who deny altogether that he is lying of
   kings, and others who take counsel together saying, "Let us break his
   bands in sunder, and cast away his cords from us." He that sitteth in
   the heavens is moved to jealousy by these sins, and will defend the
   rights of his crown against all comers, for the Lord is a great God,
   and a great King above all gods.

   This reminds us of the Lord's hatred of sin. Every time we sin, we do
   as much as say, "I do not acknowledge God to be my sovereign; I will do
   as I please." Each time we speak an ill-word we really say, "My tongue
   is my own, he is not Lord over my lips." Yea, and everytime the human
   heart wandereth after evil, and lusteth for that which is forbidden, it
   attempts to dethrone God, and to set up the Evil One in his place. The
   language of sin is "Who is the Lord that I should obey his voice; I
   will not have God to reign over me." Sin is a deliberate treason
   against the majesty of God, an assault upon his crown, an insult
   offered to his throne. Some sins, especially, have rebelhon written on
   their forehead--presumptuous sins, when a man's conscience has been
   enlightened, and he knows better, and yet still forsakes the good and
   follows after evil; when a man's conscience has been aroused through
   some judgment, or sickness, or under a faithful ministry; if that man
   returns, like a dog to his vomit, he has, indeed, insulted the
   sovereignty of God. But have we not all done this, and are there not
   some here in particular of whom we once had good hope, but who have
   turned back again to crooked ways? Are there not some of you who,
   Sabbath after Sabbath, get your consciences so quickened that you
   cannot be easy in sin as others are and though you may, perhaps,
   indulge in sin, yet it costs you very dearly, for you know better? Did
   I not hear of one who sits in these seats often, but is as often on the
   ale bench? Did I not hear of another who can sing with us the hymns of
   Zion, but is equally at home with the lascivious music of the drunkard?
   Do we not know of some who in their business are anything but what they
   should be, yet for a show can come up to the house of God? Oh, sirs,
   oh, sirs, ye do provoke the Lord to jealousy! Take heed, for when he
   cometh out of his resting-place, and taketh to himself his sword and
   buckler, who are you that you should stand before the dread majesty of
   His presence! Tremble and be still! Humble yourselves, and repent of
   this your sin.

   Surely, if sin attacks the sovereignty of God, self-righteousness is
   equally guilty of treason: for as sin boasts, "I will not keep God's
   law," self-righteousness exclaims, "I will not be saved in God's way; I
   will make a new road to heaven; I will not bow before God's grace; I
   will not accept the atonement which God has wrought out in the person
   of Jesus; I will be my own redeemer; I will enter heaven by my own
   strength, and glorify my own merits." The Lord is very wroth against
   self-righteousness. I do not know of anything against which his fury
   burneth more than against this, because this touches him in a very
   tender point, it insults the glory and honor of his Son Jesus Christ.
   Joshua said to the children of Israel when they promised to keep the
   law--"Ye cannot serve the Lord, for he is an holy God; he is a jealous
   God; and he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins." So I
   may well say to every self-righteous person, "You cannot keep the law,
   for God is a jealous God," carefully marking every fault, and just to
   mark your iniquities; nor will he forgive your iniquities so long as
   you attempt to win his favor by works of law. Throw away thy
   self-righteousness, thou proud one; cast it with all other idols to the
   moles and to the bats, for there is no hope for thee so long as thou
   dost cling to it. Self-righteousness is in itself the very height and
   crowning-point of rebelhon against God. For a man to say, "Lord, I have
   not sinned," is the gathering-up, the emphasis, the climax of iniquity,
   and God's jealousy is hot against it.

   Let me add, dear friends, I feel persuaded that false doctrine,
   inasmuch as it touches God's sovereignty, is always an object of divine
   jealousy. Let me indicate especially the doctrines of free-will. I know
   there are some good men who hold and preach them, but I am persuaded
   that the Lord must be grieved with their doctrine though he forgives
   them their sin of ignorance. Free-will doctrine--what does it? It
   magnifies man into God; it declares God's purposes a nullity, since
   they cannot be carried out unless men are willing. It makes God's will
   a waiting servant to the will of man, and the whole covenant of grace
   dependent upon human action. Denying election on the ground of
   injustice it holds God to be a debtor to sinners, so that if he gives
   grace to one he is bound to do so to all. It teaches that the blood of
   Christ was shed equally for all men and since some are lost, this
   doctrine ascribes the difference to man's own will, thus making the
   atonement itself a powerless thing until the will of man gives it
   efficacy. Those sentiments dilute the scriptural description of man's
   depravity, and by imputing strength to fallen humanity, rob the Spirit
   of the glory of his effectual grace: this theory says in effect that it
   is of him that willeth, and of him that runneth, and not of God that
   showeth mercy. Any doctrine, my brethren, which stands in opposition to
   this truth--"I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy," provokes
   God's jealousy. I often tremble in this pulpit lest I should utter
   anything which should oppose the sovereignty of my God; and though you
   know I am not ashamed to preach the responsibility of man to God--if
   God be a sovereign, man must be bound to obey him--on the other hand, I
   am equally bold to preach that God has a right to do what he wills with
   his own, that he giveth no account of his matters and none may stay his
   hand, or say unto him, "What doest thou?" I believe that the free-will
   heresy assails the sovereignty of God, and mars the glory of his
   dominion. In all faithfulness, mingled with sorrow, I persuade you who
   have been deluded by it, to see well to your ways and receive the truth
   which sets God on high, and lays the creature in the dust. "The Lord
   reigneth," be this our joy. The Lord is our King, let us obey him and
   defend to the death the crown rights of the lying of kings, for he is a
   jealous God.

   While tarrying upon this subject, I ought also to remark that all the
   boastings of ungodly men, whenever they exalt themselves, seeing that
   they are a sort of claim of sovereignty, must be very vexatious to God,
   the Judge of all. When you glory in your own power, you forget that
   power belongeth only unto God, and you provoke his jealousy. When
   kings, parhaments, or synods, trespass upon the sacred domains of
   conscience, and say to men, "Bow down, that we may go over you"--when
   we make attempts to lord over another man's judgment, and to make our
   own opinions supreme, the Lord is moved to jealousy, for he retains the
   court of conscience for himself alone to reign in. Let us humbly bow
   before the dignity of the Most High, and pay our homage at his feet.

   "Glory to th' eternal King,

   Clad in majesty supreme!

   Let all heaven his praises sing,

   Let all worlds his power proclaim.

   O let my transported soul

   Ever on his glories gaze!

   Ever yield to his control,

   Ever sound his lofty praise!"

   Let us crown him every day! Let our holy obedience, let our devout
   lives, let our hearty acquiescence in all his will, let our reverent
   adoration before the greatness of his majesty, all prove that we
   acknowledge him to be King of kings, and Lord of lords, lest we provoke
   a jealous God to anger.

   III. THE LORD IS JEALOUS OF HIS GLORY.

   God's glory is the result of his nature and acts. He is glorious in his
   character, for there is such a store of everything that is holy, and
   good, and lovely in God, that he must be glorious. The actions which
   flow from his character, the deeds which are the outgoings of his inner
   nature, these are glorious too; and the Lord is very careful that all
   flesh should see that he is a good, and gracious, and just God; and he
   is mindfill, too, that his great and mighty acts should not give glory
   to others, but only to himself.

   How, careful, then, should we be when we do anything for God, and God
   is pleased to accept of our doings, that we never congratulate
   ourselves. The minister of Christ should unrobe himself of every rag of
   praise. "You preached well," said a friend to Jolin Bunyan one morning.
   "You are too late," said honest Jolin, "the devil told me that before I
   left the pulpit." The devil often tells God's servants a great many
   things which they should be sorry to hear. Why, you can hardly be
   useful in a Sunday School but he will say to you--"How well you have
   done it!" You can scarcely resist a temptation, or set a good example,
   but he will be whispering to you--"What an excellent person you must
   be!" It is, perhaps, one of the hardest struggles of the Christian life
   to learn this sentence--"Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy name be
   glory." Now God is so jealous on this point that, while he will forgive
   his own servants a thousand things, this is an offense for which he is
   sure to chasten us. Let a believer once say, "I am," and God will soon
   make him say "I am not." Let a Christian begin to boast, "I can do all
   things," without adding "through Christ which strengtheneth me," and
   before long he will have to groan, "I can do nothing," and bemoan
   himself in the dust. Many of the sins of true Christians, I do not
   doubt, have been the result of their glorifying themselves. Many a man
   has been permitted by God to stain a noble character and to ruin an
   admirable reputation, because the character and the reputation had come
   to be the man's own, instead of being laid, as all our crowns must be
   laid, at the feet of Christ. Thou mayest build the city, but if thou
   sayest with Nebuchadnezzar, "Behold this great Babylon which I have
   builded!" thou shalt be smitten to the earth. The worms which ate Herod
   when he gave not God the glory are ready for another meal; beware of
   vain glory!

   How careful ought we to be to walk humbly before the Lord. The moment
   we glorify ourselves, since there is room for one glory only in the
   universe, we set ourselves up as rivals to the Most High. Penitent
   souls are always accepted, because they are not in God's way; proud
   souls are always rejected, because they are in God's way. Shall the
   insect of an hour glorify itself against the Sun which warmed it into
   life? Shall the potsherd exalt itself above the man that fashioned it
   upon the wheel? Shall the dust of the desert strive with the whirlwind?
   Or the drops of the ocean struggle with the tempest? O thou nothingness
   and vanity, thou puny mortal called man, humble thyself and reverence
   thy Great Creator.

   Let us see to it that we never misrepresent God, so as to rob him of
   his honour. If any minister shall preach of God so as to dishonor him,
   God will be jealous against that man. I fear that the Lord hath heavy
   wrath against those who lay the damnation of man at God's door, for
   they dishonor God, and he is very jealous of his name. And those, on
   the other hand, who ascribe salvation to man must also be heavily
   beneath God's displeasure, for they take from him his glory. Ah,
   thieves! ah, thieves! will ye dare to steal the crown-jewels of the
   universe! Whither go ye, whither bear ye the bright pearls which ought
   to shine upon the brow of Christ? To put them on the brow of man? Stop!
   stop! for the Lord will not give his glory to another! Give unto the
   Lord, all ye righteous, give unto the Lord glory and strength; give
   unto him the honor that is due unto his name! Any doctrine which does
   not give all the honor to God must provoke him to jealousy.

   Be careful, dear friends, that you do not misrepresent God yourselves.
   You who murmur; you who say that God deals hardly with you, you give
   God an ill character; when you look so melancholy, worldlings say, "The
   religion of Jesus is intolerable;" and so you stain the honor of God.
   Oh, do not do this, for he is a jealous God, and he will surely use the
   rod upon you if you do.

   A flash of holy pleasure crosses my mind. I am glad that he is a
   jealous God. It is enough to make us walk very carefully, but, at the
   same time, it should make us very joyful to think that the Lord is very
   jealous of his own honor. Then, brethren, if we believe in Christ, you
   and I are safe, because it would dishonor him if we were not; for his
   own name's sake and for his faithfulness' sake, he will never leave one
   of his people; since "His honor is engaged to save the meanest of his
   sheep." Now, if Christ could trifle with his own honor, if he had no
   jealousy, you and I might be afraid that he would suffer us to perish;
   but it never shall be. It shall be said on earth and sung in heaven at
   the last, that God has suffered no dishonorable defeats from the hands
   of either men or devils. "I chose my people," saith the Eternal Father,
   "and they are mine now that I make up my jewels." "I bought my people,"
   saith the eternal Son, "I became a surety for them before the Most
   High, and the infernal hon could not rend the meanest of the sheep." "I
   quickened my people," saith the Holy Spirit; the temptations of hell
   could not throw them down; their own corruptions could not overpower
   them; I have gotten the victory in every one of them, not one of them
   is lost; they are all brought safely to my right hand." Hide
   yourselves, then, under the banner of Jehovah's jealousy. It is bloody
   red, I know; its ensign bears a thunderbolt and a flame of fire; but
   hide yourselves, hide yourselves under it, for what enemy shall reach
   you there? If it be to God's glory to save me, I am entrenched behind
   munitions of stupendous rock. If it would render God inglorious to let
   me, a poor sinner, descend into hell; if it would open the mouths of
   devils and make men say that God is not faithful to his promise, then
   am I secure, for God's glory is wrapped up with my salvation, and the
   one cannot fail because the other cannot be tarnished. Beloved, let us
   mind that we be very jealous of God's glory ourselves since he is
   jealous of it. Let us say with Elijah--"I am very jealous for the Lord
   God of hosts." May our lives, and conduct, and conversation prove that
   we are jealous of our hearts lest they should once depart from him; and
   may we smite with stern and unrelenting hand every sin and every
   thought of pride that might touch the glory of our gracious God; living
   to him as living before a jealous God.

   IV. In the highest sense, THE LORD IS JEALOUS OVER HIS OWN PEOPLE.

   Let me only hint, that human jealousy, although it will exercise itself
   over man's reputation, rights, and honor, hath one particularly tender
   place: jealousy guardeth, like an armed man, the marriage-covenant. A
   suspicion here is horrible. Even good old Jacob, when he came to die,
   could not look upon his son Reuben without remembering his offense. "He
   went up to my couch," said the old man--and, as if the remembrance was
   too painful for him, he hurried on from Reuben to the next. The Lord
   has been graciously pleased to say of his people, "I am married unto
   you." The covenant of grace is a marriage-covenant, and Christ's Church
   has become his spouse. It is here that God's jealousy is peculiarly
   liable to take fire. Men cannot be God's favourites without being the
   subjects of his watchfulness and jealousy: that which might be looked
   over in another will be chastened in a member of Christ. As a husband
   is jealous of his honor, so is the Lord Jesus much concerned for the
   purity of his Church.

   The Lord Jesus Christ, of whom I now speak, is very jealous of your
   love, O believer. Did he not choose you? He cannot hear that you should
   choose another. Did he not buy you with his own blood? He cannot endure
   that you should think you are your own, or that you belong to this
   world. He loved you with such a love that he could not stop in heaven
   without you; he would sooner die than that you should perish; he
   stripped himself to nakedness that he might clothe you with beauty; he
   bowed his face to shame and spitting that he might lift you up to honor
   and glory, and he cannot endure that you should love the world, and the
   things of the world. His love is strong as death towards you, and
   therefore will be cruel as the grave. He will be as a cruel one towards
   you if you do not love him with a perfect heart. He will take away that
   husband; he will smite that child; he will bring you from riches to
   poverty, from health to sickness, even to the gates of the grave,
   because he loves you so much that he cannot endure that anything should
   stand between your heart's love and him. Be careful Christians, you
   that are married to Christ; remember, you are married to a jealous
   husband.

   He is very jealous of your trust. He will not permit you to trust in an
   arm of flesh. He will not endure that you should hew out broken
   cisterns, when the overflowing fountain is always free to you. When we
   come up from the wilderness leaning upon our Beloved, then is our
   Beloved glad, but when we go down to the wilderness leaning on some
   other arm; when we trust in our own wisdom or the wisdom of a
   friend--worst of all, when we trust in any works of our own, he is
   angry, and will smite us with heavy blows that he may bring us to
   himself.

   He is also very jealous of our company. It were well if a Christian
   could see nothing but Christ. When the wife of a Persian noble had been
   invited to the coronation of Darius, the question was asked of her by
   her husband--"Did you not think the king a most beautiful man?" and her
   answer was--"I cared not to look at the king; my eyes are for my
   husband only, for my heart is his." The Christian should say the same.
   There is nothing beneath the spacious arch of heaven comparable to
   Christ: there should be no one with whom we converse so much as with
   Jesus. To abide in him only, this is true love; but to commune with the
   world, to find solace in our comforts, to be loving this evil world,
   this is vexing to our jealous Lord. Do you not believe that nine out of
   ten of the troubles and pains of believers are the result of their love
   to some other person than Christ? Nail me to thy cross, thou bleeding
   Savior! Put thy thorn-crown upon my head to be a hedge to keep my
   thoughts within its bound! O for a fire to burn up all my wandering
   loves. O for a seal to stamp the name of my Beloved indelibly upon my
   heart! O love divine expel from me all carnal worldly loves, and fill
   me with thyself!

   Dear friends, let this jealousy which should keep us near to Christ be
   also a comfort to us, for if we be married to Christ, and he be jealous
   of us, depend upon it this jealous husband will let none touch his
   spouse. Joel tells us that the Lord is jealous for his land, and
   Zechariah utters the word of the Lord, "I am jealous for Jerusalem, and
   for Zion with a great jealousy;" and then he declares that he will
   punish the heathen. And will he not avenge his own elect who cry unto
   him day and night? There is not a hard word spoken but the Lord shall
   avenge it! There is not a single deed done against us, but the strong
   hand of him who once died but now lives for us, shall take terrible
   vengeance upon all his adversaries. I am not afraid for the Church of
   God! I tremble not for the cause of God! Our jealous Husband will never
   let his Church be in danger, and if any smite her he will give them
   double for every blow. The gates of hell shall not prevail against his
   Church, but she shall prevail against the gates of hell. Her jealous
   Husband shall roll away her shame; her reproach shall be forgotten; her
   glory shall be fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an
   army with banners, for he that is jealous of himself is jealous for her
   fair fame. The subject is large and deep; let us prove that we
   understand it, by henceforth walking very carefully; and if any say
   "Why are you so precise?" let this be our answer--"I serve a jealous
   God."

                            Death and Life in Christ

   A Sermon

   (No. 503)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, April 5th, 1863, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with
   him: knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more;
   death hath no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto
   sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye
   also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through
   Jesus Christ our Lord."--Romans 6:8-11.

   THE apostles never traveled far from the simple facts of Christ's life,
   death, resurrection, ascension, exaltation, and second advent. These
   things, of which they were the witnesses, constituted the staple of all
   their discourses. Newton has very properly said that the two pillars of
   our religion are, the work of Christ for us, and his work in us by the
   Holy Spirit. If you want to find the apostles, you will surely discover
   them standing between these two pillars; they are either discoursing
   upon the effect of the passion in our justification, or its equally
   delightful consequence in our death to the world and our newness of
   life. What a rebuke this should be to those in modern times who are
   ever straining after novelties. There may be much of the Athenian
   spirit among congregations, but that should be no excuse for its being
   tolerated among ministers; we, of all men, should be the last to spend
   our time in seeking something new. Our business, my brethren, is the
   old labor of apostolic tongues, to declare that Jesus, who is the same
   yesterday to-day and for ever. We are mirrors reflecting the
   transactions of Calvary, telex scopes manifesting the distant glories
   of an exalted Redeemer. The nearer we keep to the cross, the nearer, I
   think, we keep to our true vocation. When the Lord shall be pleased to
   restore to his Church once more a fervent love to Christ, and when once
   again we shall have a ministry that is not only flavoured with Christ,
   but of which Jesus constitutes the sum and substance, then shall the
   Churches revive--then shall the set time to favor Zion come. The goodly
   cedar which was planted by the rivers of old, and stretched out her
   branches far and wide, has become in these modern days like a tree
   dwarfed by Chinese art; it is planted by the rivers as aforetime, but
   it does not flourish, only let God the Holy Spirit give to us once
   again the bold and clear preaching of Christ crucified in all
   simplicity and earnestness, and the dwarf shall swell into a forest
   giant, each expanding bud shall burst into foliage, and the cedar shall
   tower aloft again, until the birds of the air shall lodge in the
   branches thereof. I need offer you no apology, then, for preaching on
   those matters which engrossed all the time of the apostles, and which
   shall shower unnumbered blessings on generations yet to come.

   I. THE FACTS REFERRED TO IN THESE FOUR VERSES CONSTITUE THE GLORIOUS
   GOSPEL WHICH WE PREACH.

   1. The first fact here very clearly indicated is that Jesus died. He
   who was divine, and therefore immortal, bowed his head to death. He
   whose human nature was alhed to the omnipotence of his divine nature,
   was pleased voluntarily to submit himself to the sword of death. He who
   was pure and perfect, and therefore deserved not death, which is the
   wages of sin, nevertheless condescended for our sake to yield himself
   up to die. This is the second note in the Gospel scale. The first note
   is incarnation, Jesus Christ became a man; angels thought this worthy
   of their songs, and made the heavens ring with midnight melodies. The
   second note is this, I say, that, being found in fashion as a man, he
   humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the
   cross. He died as a sacrifice. Methinks, after many lambs from the
   flocks of men had poured out their blood at the foot of the altar, it
   was a strange spectacle-to see God's Lamb brought to that same altar to
   be sacrificed. He is without spot or blemish, or any such thing. He is
   the firstling of the flock; he is the only one of the Great Master; a
   right royal, heavenly lamb. Such a Lamb had never been seen before. He
   is the Lamb who is worshipped in heaven, and who is to be adored world
   without end. Will that sacred head condescend to feel the axe? Will
   that glorious victim really be slain? Is it possible that God's Lamb
   will actually submit to die? He does so without a struggle; he is dumb
   in the shambles before the slaughterers; he gives up the warm blood of
   his heart to the hand of the executioner, that he might expiate the
   wrath of God. Tell it. Let heaven ring with music, and let hell be
   filled with confusion! Jesus, the Eternal Son of God, the Lamb of
   Jehovah's Passover, died. His hands were pierced; and his heart was
   broken; to prove how surely the spear had struck the mark, the vital
   fluid flowed in a double flood, even to the ground:--Jesus died. If
   there were any doubt about this, there were doubt about your salvation
   and mine. If there were any reason to question this fact, then we might
   question the possibility of salvation. But Jesus died, and sin is put
   away. The sacrifice smokes to heaven; Jehovah smelleth a sweet savor,
   and is pleased through Christ the victim to accept the prayers, the
   offerings, and the persons of his people. Nor did he die as a victim
   only. He died as a substitute. We were drawn as soldiers for the great
   warfare, and we could not go, for we were feeble, and should have
   fallen in the battle, and have left our bones to be devoured of the
   dogs of hell. But he, the mighty Son of God, became the substitute for
   us; entered the battle-field; sustained the first charge of the
   adversary in the wilderness; three times he repulsed the grim fiend and
   all his host, smiting his assailants with the sword of the Spirit,
   until the enemy fled, and angels waited upon the weary Victor. The
   conflict was not over, the enemy had but retired to forge fresh
   artillery and recruit his scattered forces for a yet more terrible
   affray. For three years the great Substitute kept the field against
   continual onslaughts from the advance guard of the enemy, remaining
   conqueror in every skirmish. No adversary dared to show his face, or if
   he shot an arrow at him from a distance, our substitute caught the
   arrow on his shield, and laughed his foes to scorn. Devils were cast
   out of many that were possessed; whole legions of them were compelled
   to find refuge in a herd of swine; and Lucifer himself fell like
   lightning from the heaven of his power. At last the time came when hell
   had gathered up all its forces, and now was also come the hour when
   Christ, as our substitute, must carry his obedience to the utmost
   length; he must be obedient unto death. He has been a substitute up
   till now; will he now throw down his vicarious character? Will he now
   renounce our responsibilities, and declare that we may stand for
   ourselves? Not he. He undertook, and must go through. Sweating great
   drops of blood, he nevertheless flinches not from the dread assault.
   Wounded in hands and in feet he still maintained his ground, and
   though, for obedience sake, he bowed his head to die, yet in that dying
   he slew death, put his foot upon the dragons' neck, crushed the head of
   the old serpent, and beat our adversaries as small as the dust of the
   threshing-floor. Yes, the blessed Substitute has died. I say if there
   were a question about this, then we might have to die, but inasmuch as
   he died for us, the believer shall not die. The debt is discharged to
   the utmost farthing; the account is cleared; the balance is struck; the
   scales of justice turn in our favor; God's sword is sheathed for ever,
   and the blood of Christ has sealed it in its scabbard. We are free, for
   Christ was bound; we live, for Jesus died. Dying thus as a sacrifice
   and as a substitute, it is a comfort to us to know that he also died as
   Mediator between God and man. There was a great gulf fixed, so that if
   we would pass to God we could not, neither could he pass to us if he
   would condescend to do so. There was no way of filling up this gulf,
   unless there should be found one who, like the old Roman, Curtius,
   would leap into it. Jesus comes, arrayed in his pontifical garments,
   wearing the breast-plate, bearing the ephod, a priest for ever after
   the order of Melchisidec: his kingly character is not forgotten, for
   his head is adorned with a glittering crown, and o'er his shoulders he
   bears the prophet's mantle. How shall I describe the matchless glories
   of the prophet-king, the royal priest? Will he throw himself into the
   chasm? He will. Into the grave he plunges, the abyss is closed! The
   gulf is bridged, and God can have communion with man! I see before me
   the heavy veil which shields from mortal eyes the place where God's
   glory shineth. No man may touch that veil or he must die. Is there any
   man found who can rend it?--that man may approach the mercy-seat. O
   that the veil which parts our souls from him that dwelleth between the
   cherubims could be torn throughout its utmost length! Strong archangel,
   wouldest thou dare to rend it? Shouldest thou attempt the work, thine
   immortality were forfeited, and thou must expire. But Jesus comes, the
   King Immortal, Invisible, with his strong hands he rends the veil from
   top to bottom, and now men draw nigh with confidence, for when Jesus
   died a living way was opened. Sing, O heavens, and rejoice O earth!
   There is now no wall of partition, for Christ has dashed it down!
   Christ has taken away the gates of death, posts and bars, and all, and
   like another Samson carried them upon his shoulders far away. This,
   then, is one of the great notes of the Gospel, the fact that Jesus
   died. Oh! ye who would be save'd, believe that Jesus died; believe that
   the Son of God expired; trust that death to save you, and you are
   saved. Tis no great mystery; it needs no learned words, no polished
   plivases; Jesus died; the sacrifice smokes; the substitute bleeds; the
   Mediator fills up the gap; Jesus dies; believe and live.

   2. But Jesus rises: this is no mean part of the Gospel. He dies; they
   lay him in the new sepulclive; they embalm his body in spices; his
   adversaries are careful that his body shall not be stolen away; the
   stone, the seal, the watch, all prove their vigilance. Aha! Aha! What
   do ye, men? Can ye imprison immortality in the tomb! The fiends of
   hell, too, I doubt not, watched the sepulclive, wondering what it all
   could mean. But the third day comes, and with it the messenger from
   heaven. He touches the stone; it rolls away; he sits upon it, as if he
   would defy the whole universe to roll that stone back again. Jesus
   awakes, as a mighty man from his slumber; unwraps the napkin from his
   head and lays it by itself; unwinds the cerements in which love had
   wrapped him, and puts them by themselves; for he had abundant leisure;
   he was in no haste; he was not about to escape like a felon who bursts
   the prison, but like one whose time of jail-deliverance has come, and
   lawfully and leisurely leaves his cell; he steps to the upper air,
   bright, shining, glorious, and fair. He lives. He died once, but he
   rose again from the dead. There is no need for us to enlarge here. We
   only pause to remark that this is one of the most jubilant notes in the
   whole gospel scale; for see, brethren, the rich mysteries, which, like
   the many seeds of the pomegranate, are all enclosed in the golden apple
   of resurrection. Death is overcome. There is found a man who by his own
   power was able to struggle with death, and hurl him down. The grave is
   opened; there is found a man able to dash back its bolts and to rifle
   its treasures; and thus, brethren, having delivered himself, he is able
   also to deliver others. Sin, too, was manifestly forgiven. Christ was
   in prison as a hostage, kept there as a surety; now that he is suffered
   to go free, it is a declaration on God's behalf that he has nothing
   against us; our substitute is discharged; we are discharged. He who
   undertook to pay our debt is suffered to go free; we go free in him.
   "He rose again for our justification." Nay more, inasmuch as he rises
   from the dead, he gives us a pledge that hell is conquered. This was
   the great aim of hell to keep Christ beneath its heel. "Thou shalt
   bruise his heel." They had gotten the heel of Christ, his mortal flesh
   beneath their power, but that bruised heel came forth unwounded; Christ
   sustained no injury by his dying; he was as glorious, even in his human
   nature, as he was before he expired. "Thou wilt not leave my soul in
   hell, neither wilt thou suffer thy holy One to see corruption."
   Beloved, in this will we triumph, that hell is worsted; Satan is put to
   confusion, and all his hosts are fallen before Immanuel. Sinner,
   believe this; it is the Gospel of thy salvation. Believe that Jesus of
   Nazareth rose again from the dead, and trust him, trust him to save thy
   soul. Because he burst the gates of the grave, trust him to bear thy
   sins, to justify thy person, to quicken thy spirit, and to raise thy
   dead body, and verily, verily, I say unto thee, thou shalt be saved.

   3. We now strike a third note, without which the gospel were not
   complete. Inasmuch as Jesus died, he is now living. He does not, after
   forty days, return to the grave; he departs from earth, but it is by
   another way. From the top of Olivet he ascends until a cloud receives
   him out of their sight. And now at this very day he lives. There at his
   Father's right hand he sits, bright like a sun; clothed in majesty; the
   joy of all the glorified spirits; his Father's intense delight. There
   he sits, Lord of Providence; at his girdle swing the keys of heaven,
   and earth, and hell. There he sits, expecting the hour when his enemies
   shall be made his footstool. Methinks I see him, too, as he lives to
   intercede. He stretches his wounded hands, points to his breastplate
   bearing the names of his people, and for Zion's sake he doth not hold
   his peace, and for Jerusalem's sake he doth not rest day nor night, but
   ever pleadeth--"Oh God! bless thy heritage; gather together thy
   scattered ones; I will that they whom thou hast given me be with me
   where I am." Believer, this it a cluster of camphire to thee, a bundle
   of myrrh--be thou comforted exceedingly.

   "He lives! the great Redeemer lives!

   What joy the blest assurance gives!"

   Trembling penitent, let a living Savior cheer thee. Exercise faith in
   him who only hath immortality. He lives to hear thy prayer; cry to him,
   he lives to present that prayer before his Father's face. Put yourself
   in his hands; he lives to gather together those whom he bought with his
   blood, to make those the people of his flock who were once the people
   of his purchase. Sinner, dost thou believe this as a matter of fact? If
   so, rest thy soul on it, and make it shine as a matter of confidence,
   and then thou art saved.

   4. One more note, and our gospel-song need not rise higher. Jesus died;
   he rose; he lives; and he lives for ever. He lives for ever. He shall
   not die again. "Death hath no more dominion over him." Ages shall
   follow ages, but his raven locks shall never be blanched with years.
   "Thou hast the dew of thy youth." Disease may visit the world and fill
   the graves, but no disease or plague can touch the immortal Savior. The
   shock of the last catastrophe shall shake both heaven and earth, until
   the stars shall fall like withered fig-leaves from the tree, but
   nothing shall move the unchanging Savior. He lives for ever. There is
   no possibility that he should be overcome by a new death.

   "No more the bloody spear,

   The cross and nails no more;

   For hell itself shakes at his name,

   And all the heavens adore."

   Would it not be a strange doctrine indeed if any man should dream that
   the Son of God would again offer his life a sacrifice. He dieth no
   more. This, too, reveals another part of our precious gospel, for now
   it is certain, since he lives for ever, that no foes can overcome him.
   He has so routed his enemies and driven his foes off the battle-field,
   that they will never venture to attack him again. This proves, too,
   that his people's eternal life is sure. Let Jesus die, and his people
   die. Let Christ leave heaven, and, O ye glorified ones! ye must all
   vacate your thrones, and leave your crowns without heads to wear them,
   and your harps untouched by fingers that shall wake them to harmony. He
   lives for ever. Oh! seed of Abraham, ye are saved with an everlasting
   salvation by the sure mercies of David. Your standing in earth and
   heaven has been confirmed eternally. God is honored, saints are
   comforted, and sinners are cheered, for "he is able also to save them
   to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to
   make intercession for them."

   Now I would to God that on one of these four anchor-holds your faith
   might be able to get rest. Jesus died, poor trembler; if he died and
   took thy griefs, will not his atonement save thee? Rest here. Milhons
   of souls have rested on nothing but Jesus' death, and this is a granite
   foundation; no storms of hell can shake it. Get a good handhold on his
   cross; hold it, and it will hold you. You cannot depend on his death
   and be deceived. Try it; taste and see, and you shall find that the
   Lord is good, and that none can trust a dying Savior without being with
   him in Paradise. But if this suffice you not, he rose again. Fasten
   upon this. He is proved to be victor over your sin and over your
   adversary; can you not, therefore, depend upon him? Doubtless there
   have been thousands of saints who have found the richest consolation
   from the fact that Jesus rose again from the dead. He rose again for
   our justification. Sinner, hang on that. Having risen he lives. He is
   not a dead Savior, a dead sacrifice. He must be able to hear our plea
   and to present his own. Depend on a living Savior; depend on him now.
   He lives for ever, and therefore it is not too late for him to save
   you. If thou criest to him he will hear thy prayer, even though it be
   in life's last moment, for he lives for ever. Though the ends of the
   earth were come, and you were the last man, yet he ever lives to
   intercede before his Father's face. Oh! gad not about to find any other
   hope! Here are four great stones for you; build your hope on these; you
   cannot want surer foundations--he dies, he rises, he lives, he lives
   for ever. I tell thee, Soul, this is my only hope, and though I lean
   thereon with all my weight it bends not. This is the hope of all God's
   people, and they abide contented in it. Do thou, I pray thee, now come
   and rest on it. May the Spirit of God bring many of you to Christ. We
   have no other gospel. You thought it a hard thing, a scholarly thing, a
   matter that the college must teach you, that the university must give
   you. It is no such matter for learning and scholarship. Your little
   child knows it, and your child may be saved by it. You without
   education, you that can scarce read in the book, you can comprehend
   this. He dies; there is the cross. He rises; there is the open tomb. He
   lives; there is the pleading Savior. He lives for ever; there is the
   perpetual merit. Depend on him! Put your soul in his hand and you are
   saved.

   If I have brought you under the first head of my discourse to a
   sufficient height; you can now take another step, and mount to
   something higher; I do not mean higher as to real value, but higher as
   a matter of knowledge, because it follows upon the fact as a matter of
   experience.

   II. The great facts mentioned in our text represent THE GLORIOUS WORK
   WHICH EVERY BELIEVER FEELS WITHIN HIM.

   In the text we see death, resurrection, life, and life eternal. You
   observe that the Apostle only mentions these to show our share in them.
   I will read the text again--"Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe
   that we shall also live with him: knowing that Christ being raised from
   the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. For in
   that he died, he died unto sin once; but in that he liveth, he liveth
   unto God. Likewise reckon ye yourselves also to be dead indeed unto
   sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord."

   Well, then, it seems that as Christ was, so we also are dead. We are
   dead to sin because sin can no more condemn us. All the sins which
   God's people have ever committed dare not accuse, much less can they
   condemn those for whom Jesus died. Sin can curse an unbeliever, but it
   has no power so much as to mutter half a curse against a man in Christ.
   I cannot claim a debt of a dead debtor, and although I be a debtor to
   the law, yet since I am dead, the law cannot claim anything of me, nor
   can sin infiict any punisliment upon me. He that is dead, as says the
   preceding verse, is freed from sin; being dead to sin we are free from
   all its jurisdiction; we fear not its curse; we defy its power. The
   true believer in the day when he first came to Christ died to sin as to
   its power. Sin had been sitting on a high throne in his heart, but
   faith pulled the tyrant down and rolled him in the dust, and though it
   still survives to vex us, yet its reigning power is destroyed. From the
   day of our new birth, if we be indeed true Christians, we have been
   dead to all sin's pleasures. Madame Bubble can no longer bewitch us.
   The varnish and gilt have been worn off from the palaces of sin. We
   defy sin's most skillful enchantments; it might warble sweetest music,
   but the dead ear is not to be moved by melodies. Keep thy bitter
   sweets, O earth, for those who know no better delicacies; our mouths
   find no flavour in your dainties. We are dead to sin's bribes. We curse
   the gold that would have bought us to be untrutliful, and abhor the
   comforts which might have been the reward of iniquity. We are dead to
   its threatenings, too. When sin curses us, we are as little moved by
   its curses as by its promises. A believer is mortified and dead to the
   world. He can sing with Cowper--

   "I thirst, but not as once I did

   The vain delights of earth to share;

   Thy wounds, Emmanuel all forbid

   That I should seek my pleasures there.

   It was the sight of thy dear cross

   First wean'd my soul from earthly things;

   And taught me to esteem as dross

   The mirth of fools and pomp of kings."

   I am compelled, however, to say that this mortification is not
   complete. We are not so dead to the world as we should be. Instead of
   saying here what the Christian is, I think I may rather say what he
   should be, for where am I to look for men that are dead to the world
   now-a-days? I see professing Christians quite as fond of riches; I see
   them almost as fond of gaiety and vanity. Do I not see those who wear
   the name of Jesus whose dress is as full of vanity as that of the
   worldling; whose conversation has no more savor of Christ in it than
   that of the open sinner? I find many who are conformed to this world,
   and who show but little renewing of their minds. Oh! how slight is the
   difference now-a-days between the Church and the world! We ought to be,
   in a spiritual sense, evermore Dissenters--dissenting from the world,
   standing out and protesting against it. We must be to the world's final
   day Nonconformists, not conforming to its ways and vanities, but
   walking without the camp, bearing Christ's reproach. Do some of you
   recollect the day when you died to the world? Your friends thought you
   were mad. They said you knew nothing of life, so your ungodly friends
   put you in the sepulclive, and others of them rolled a great stone
   against you. They from that day put a ban upon you. You are not asked
   out now where you once were everybody. The seal is put upon you; they
   call you by some opprobrious epithet, and so far as the world is
   concerned, you are like the dead Christ; you are put into your grave,
   and shut out from the world's life. They do not want you any more at
   their merry-makings, you would spoil the party; you have now become
   such a Methodist, such a mean hypocrite, as they put it, that they have
   buried you out of sight, and rolled back the stone, and sealed it, and
   set watchers at the door to keep you there. Well, and what a blessed
   thing that is, for if you be dead with Christ you shall also live with
   him.

   If we be thus dead with Christ, let us see that we live with him. It is
   a poor thing to be dead to the world unless we are alive unto God.
   Death is a negative, and a negative in the world is of no great use by
   itself. A Protestant is less than a nobody if he only protests against
   a wrong; we want a proclaimer, one who proclaims the truth as well as
   protests against error. And so, if we be dead to sin we must have,
   also, the life of Christ, and I trust, beloved, we know, and it is not
   a matter of theory to us--I trust we know that in us there is a new
   life to which we were strangers once. To our body and our soul there
   has been superadded a spirit, a spark of spiritual life. Just as Jesus
   had a new life after death, so have we a new life after death,
   wherewith I trust we rise from the grave. But we must prove it. Jesus
   proved his resurrection by infallible signs. You and I, too, must prove
   to all men that we have risen out of the grave of sin. Perhaps our
   friends did not know us when we first rose from the dead. Like Mary,
   they mistook us for somebody else. They said, "What! Is this Wilham who
   used to be such a hectoring, proud, ill-humoured, domineering fellow?
   Can he put up with our jokes and jeers so patiently?" They supposed us
   to he somebody else, and they were not far from the mark, for we were
   new creatures in Christ Jesus. We talked with some of our friends, and
   they found our conversation so different from what it used to be that
   it made their hearts burn within them, just as Jesus Christ's disciples
   when they went to Emmaus. But they did not know our secret; they were
   strangers to our new life. Do you recollect, Christians, how you first
   revealed yourselves unto your brethren, the Church? In the breaking of
   bread they first knew you. That night when the right-hand of fellowship
   was given to you the new life was openly recognized, and they
   said--"Come in thou blessed of the Lord, wherefore standest thou
   without?" I trust, in resurrection-life you desire to prove to all men
   that this is not the common life you lived before, a life which made
   you serve the flesh and the lusts thereof; but that you are living now
   with higher aims, and purer intentions, by a more heavenly rule, and
   with the prospect of a diviner result. As we have been dead with
   Christ, dear brethren, I hope we have also, in our measure, learned to
   live with him.

   But now, remember, Christ lives for ever, and so do we. Christ being
   raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over
   him. The fourteenth verse is wonderfully similar--"Sin shall not have
   dominion over you, for ye are not under the law, but under grace." Sin
   made us die once in Adam, but we are not to be slain by it again. If
   Christ could die now, we could die, but since Christ can never die
   again, so the believer can never again go back to his old sin. He dies
   to sin no more; he lives, and sin hath no more dominion over him. Oh!
   this is a delightful theme! I know not how to express the joy my own
   heart feels at the sense of security arising from the fact that Christ
   dies no more. Death hath no more dominion over him; and sin hath no
   more dominion over me, if I be in Christ. Suppose, my brethren, suppose
   for a moment that Christ could die again. Bring out your funeral music!
   Let the muffled drums beat the Dead march! Let the heavens be clothed
   in sackcloth, and let the verdant earth be robed in blackness, for the
   atonement, earth's great hope, is incomplete! Christ must die again.
   The adversaries we thought were routed have gathered their strength
   again. Death is not dead; the grave is not open; there will be no
   resurrection! The saints tremble; even in heaven they fear and quake;
   the crowns upon glorified heads are trembling; the hearts that have
   been overflowing with eternal bliss are filled with anxiety, for the
   throne of Christ is empty; angels suspend their songs; the howlings of
   hell have silenced the shouts of heaven: the fiends are holding high
   holiday, and they sliviek for very joy--"Jesus dies again! Jesus dies
   again! Prepare your arrows! Empty your Quivers! Come up, Ye legions of
   hell! The famous conqueror must fight, and bleed, and die again, and we
   shall overcome him yet!" God is dishonored, the foundations of heaven
   are removed, and the eternal throne quivers with the shock of Christ
   subjected to a second death! Is it blasphemy to suppose the case? Yet,
   my brethren, it were equal blasphemy to suppose a true believer going
   back again to his old lusts and dying again by sin, for that were to
   suppose that the atonement were incomplete. I can prove that it
   involves the very same things; it supposes an unfinished sacrifice, for
   if the sacrifice be finished, then those for whom it was offered must
   be saved. It supposes hell triumphant--Christ had bought the soul, and
   the spirit had renewed it, but the devil wipes away the blood of
   Christ, expels the spirit of the living God, and gets to himself the
   victory. A saint perish! Then God's promise is not true, and Christ's
   word is false--"I give unto my sheep eternal life, and they shall never
   perish;" then the foundations are removed; eternal justice is a name,
   and the divine honesty is suspected; the purposes of God are
   frustrated, and the crown of sovereignty rolls in the mire. Weep
   angels! Be astonished, O heavens! Rock, O ye hills with earthquake! and
   hell come up and hold riot! for God himself has ceased to be God, since
   his people perish! "Because I live ye shall live also" is a divine
   necessity, and if dominion can ever be had by sin over a believer
   again, then, mark you, death can again have dominion over Christ; but
   that is impossible; therefore rejoice and be glad, ye servants of God.

   You will notice, that as they live, so, like Jesus Christ, they live
   unto God. This completes the parallel. "In that he liveth he liveth
   unto God." So do we. The forty days which Christ spent on earth he
   lived unto God, comforting his saints, manifesting his person, giving
   forth gospel precepts. For the few days we have to live here on earth
   we must live to comfort the saints, to set forth Christ, and to preach
   the gospel to every creature. And now that Christ has ascended he lives
   unto God; what does that mean? He lives, my brethren, to manifest the
   divine character. Christ is the permanent revelation of an invisible
   God. We look at Christ and we see justice, truth, power, love; we see
   the whole of the divine attributes in him. Christian, you are to live
   unto God; God is to be seen in you; you are to show forth the divine
   bowels of compassion, longsuffering, tenderness, kindness, patience;
   you are to manifest God; living unto God. Christ lives unto God, for he
   completes the divine purpose by pleading for his people, by carrying on
   his people's work above. You are to live for the same, by preaching,
   that sinners may hear and that the elect may live; by teaching that the
   chosen may be saved; teaching by your life, by your actions, that God's
   glory may be known, and that his decrees may be fulfilled. Jesus lives
   unto God, delighting himself in God. The immeasurable joy of Christ in
   his Father no tongue can tell. Live in the same way, Christian. Delight
   thyself in the Lord! Be blessed; be happy; rejoice in the Lord always,
   and again I say rejoice. Our Redeemer lives unto God, that is he lives
   in constant fellowship with God. Cannot you do so too by the Holy
   Spirit? You are dead to sin; see to it that you live for ever in
   fellowship with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.

   Now I have been talking riddles to some of you. How many of you
   understand these things? If any are troubled because they understood
   the first part and they do trust in Christ's death, but they do not
   understand the second part--ah! beloved, you shall comprehend one of
   these days; if you are resting on Christ's death, that death shall yet
   be made mighty in you. But you that have known something of this, I
   pray you struggle after more. Ask the Lord to mortify you altogether,
   to fill you with the divine life, and to help you to persevere unto the
   end. Pray that you may live unto God and unto God alone.

   III. Having brought you thus far, there is only one other step to take,
   and then we have done; let us notice that the facts of which we have
   spoken are PLEDGES OF THE GLORY WHICH IS TO BE REVEALED IN US.

   Christ died. Possibly we shall die. Perhaps we shall not; we may be
   alive and remain at the coming of the Son of man; but it may be we
   shall die. I do not think we should be so certain of death as some
   Christians are, because the Lord's coming is much more certain than our
   dying. Our dying is not certain, for he may come before we die.
   However, suppose we shall die: Christ rose, and so shall we.

   "What though our inbred sins require

   Our flesh to see the dust,

   Yet as the Lord our Savior rose,

   So all his followers must."

   Do not, my brethren, think of the cemetery with tears, nor meditate
   upon the coffin and the shroud with gloomy thoughts. You only sojourn
   there for a little season, and to you it will not appear a moment. Your
   body will sleep, and if men sleep all through a long night it only
   seems an hour to them, a very short moment. The sleeping-time is
   forgotten, and to your sleeping-body it will seem no time at all, while
   to your glorified soul it will not seem long because you will be so
   full of joy that a whole eternity of that joy would not be too long.
   But you shall rise again. I do not think we get enough joy out of our
   resurrection. It will probably be our happiest moment, or rather the
   beginning of the happiest life that we shall ever know. Heaven is not
   the happiest place. Heaven at present is happy, but it is not the
   perfection of happiness, because there is only the soul there, though
   the soul is full of pleasure; but the heaven that is to be when body
   and soul will both be there surpasses all thought. Resurrection will be
   our marriage-day. Body and soul have been separated, and they shall
   meet again to be re-married with a golden ring, no more to be divorced,
   but as one indissolubly united body to go up to the great altar of
   immortality, and there to be espoused unto Christ for ever and ever. I
   shall come again to this flesh, no longer flesh that can decay, no
   longer bones that ache--I shall come back to these eyes and these ears,
   all made channels of new delight. Say not this is a materialistic view
   of the matter. We are at least one-half material, and so long as there
   is material about us we must always expect joy that shall not only give
   spiritual but even material delight to us. This body shall rise again.
   "Can these dry bones live?" is the question of the unbeliever. "They
   must live," is the answer of faith. Oh! let us expect our end with joy,
   and our resurrection with transport. Jesus was not detained a prisoner,
   and therefore no worm can keep us back, no grave, no tomb can destroy
   our hope. Having he lives, and we shall rise to live for ever.
   Anticipate, my brethren, that happy day. No sin, no sorrow, no care, no
   decay, no approaching dissolution! Be lives for ever in God: so shall
   you and I; close to the Eternal; swallowed up in his brightness,
   glorified in his glory, overflowing with his love! I think at the very
   prospect we may well say--

   "Oh! long-expected day begin,

   Dawn on these realms of woe and sin."

   We may well cry to him to bid his chariots hasten and bring the joyous
   season! He comes, he comes, believer! Rejoice with joy unspeakable!
   Thou hast but a little time to wait, and when thou hast fallen asleep
   thou shalt leap

   "From beds of dust and silent clay,

   To realms of everlasting day;"

   and thou,

   "Far from a world of grief and sin

   With God eternally shut in,

   Shalt be for ever blest!"

   May the Lord add his blessing, for Jesu's sake. Amen.

                         I Know That My Redeemer Liveth

   A Sermon

   (No. 504)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, April 12th, 1863, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the
   latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this
   body, yet in my flesh shall I see God; whom I shall see for myself, and
   mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed
   within me."--Job 19:25-27.

   THE HAND OF GOD has been upon us heavily this week. An aged deacon, who
   has been for more than fifty years a member of this Church, has been
   removed from our midst; and a sister, the beloved wife of another of
   our Church-officers, a member for nearly the same term of years, has
   fallen asleep. It is not often that a Church is called to sorrow over
   the departure of two such venerable members--let not our ears be deaf
   to such a double admonition to prepare to meet our God. That they were
   preserved so long, and upheld so mercifully for so many years, was not
   only a reason for gratitude to them, but to us also. I am, however, so
   averse to the preaching of what are called funeral sermons, that I
   forbear, lest I appear to eulogize the creature, when my only aim
   should be to magnify the grace of God.

   Our text deserves our profound attention; its preface would hardly have
   been written had not the matter been of the utmost importance in the
   judgment of the patriarch who uttered it. Listen to Job's remarkable
   desire: "Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed
   in a book! That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock
   for ever!" Perhaps, hardly aware of the full meaning of the words he
   was uttering, yet his holy soul was impressed with a sense of some
   weighty revelation concealed within his words; he therefore desired
   that it might be recorded in a book; he has had his desire: the Book of
   books embalms the words of Job. He wished to have them graven on a
   rock; cut deep into it with an iron pen, and then the lines inlaid with
   lead; or he would have them engraven, according to the custom of the
   ancients, upon a sheet of metal, so that time might not be able to eat
   out the inscription. He has not had his desire in that respect, save
   only that upon many and many a sepulchre those words of Job stand
   recorded, "I know that my redeemer liveth." It is the opinion of some
   commentators that Job, in speaking of the rock here, intended his own
   rock-hewn sepulchre, and desired that this might be his epitaph; that
   it might be cut deep, so that ages should not wear it out; that when
   any asked, "Where does Job sleep?" as soon as they saw the sepulchre of
   the patriarch of Uz, they might learn that he died in hope of
   resurrection, resting upon a living Redeemer. Whether such a sentence
   adorned the portals of Job's last sleeping-place we know not; but
   certainly no words could have been more fitly chosen. Should not the
   man of patience, the mirror of endurance, the pattern of trust, bear as
   his memorial this golden line, which is as full of all the patience of
   hope, and hope of patience, as mortal language can be? Who among us
   could select a more glorious motto for his last escutcheon? I am sorry
   to say that a few of those who have written upon this passage cannot
   see Christ or the resurrection in it at all. Albert Barnes, among the
   rest, expresses his intense sorrow that he cannot find the resurrection
   here, and for my part I am sorry for him. If it had been Job's desire
   to foretell the advent of Christ and his own sure resurrection, I
   cannot see what better words he could have used; and if those truths
   are not here taught, then language must have lost its original object,
   and must have been employed to mystify and not to explain; to conceal
   and not to reveal. What I ask, does the patriarch mean, if not that he
   shall rise again when the Redeemer stands upon the earth? Brethren, no
   unsophisticated mind can fail to find here what almost all believers
   have here discovered. I feel safe in keeping to the old sense, and we
   shall this morning seek no new interpretation, but adhere to the common
   one, with or without the consent of our critics.

   In discoursing upon them I shall speak upon three things. First, let
   us, with the patriarch, descend into the grave and behold the ravages
   of death. Then, with him, let us look up on high for present
   consolation. And, still in his admirable company, let us, in the third
   place, anticipate future delights.

   I. First of all then, with the patriarch of Uz, LET US DESCEND INTO THE
   SEPULCHRE.

   The body has just been divorced from the soul. Friends who loved most
   tenderly have said--"Bury my dead out of my sight." The body is borne
   upon the bier and consigned to the silent earth; it is surrounded by
   the earthworks of death. Death has a host of troops. If the locusts and
   the caterpillars be God's army, the worms are the army of death. These
   hungry warriors begin to attack the city of man. They commence with the
   outworks; they storm the munition, and overturn the walls. The skin,
   the city wall of manhood, is utterly broken down, and the towers of its
   glory covered with confusion. How speedily the cruel invaders deface
   all beauty. The face gathers blackness; the countenance is defiled with
   corruption. Those cheeks once fair with youth, and ruddy with health,
   have fallen in, even as a bowing wall and a tottering fence; those
   eyes, the windows of the mind whence joy and sorrow looked forth by
   turns, are now filled up with the dust of death; those lips, the doors
   of the soul, the gates of Mansoul, are carried away, and the bars
   thereof are broken. Alas, ye windows of agates and gates of carbuncle,
   where are ye now? How shall I mourn for thee, O thou captive city, for
   the mighty men have utterly spoiled thee! Thy neck, once like a tower
   of ivory, has become as a fallen column; thy nose, so lately comparable
   to "the tower of Lebanon, which looketh toward Damascus," is as a
   ruined hovel; and thy head, which towered like Carmel, lies low as the
   clods of the valley. Where is beauty now? The most lovely cannot be
   known from the most deformed. The vessel so daintily wrought upon the
   potter's wheel, is cast away upon the dunghill with the vilest
   potsherds. Cruel have ye been, ye warriors of death, for though ye
   wield no axes and bear no hammers, yet have ye broken down the carved
   work; and though ye speak not with tongues, yet have ye said in your
   hearts, "We have swallowed her up, certainly this is the day that we
   have looked for; we have found, we have seen it." The skin is gone. The
   troops have entered into the town of Mansoul. And now they pursue their
   work of devastation; the pitiless marauders fall upon the body itself.
   There are those noble aqueducts, the veins through which the streams of
   life were wont to flow, these, instead of being rivers of life, have
   become blocked up with the soil and wastes of death, and now they must
   be pulled to pieces; not a single relic of them shall be spared. Mark
   the muscles and sinews, like great highways that penetrating the
   metropolis, carry the strength and wealth of manhood along--their
   curious pavement must be pulled up, and they that do traffic thereon
   must be consumed; each tunnelled bone, and curious arch, and knotted
   bond must be snapped and broken. Fair fabrics, glorious storehouses,
   costly engines, wonderful machines--all, all must be pulled down, and
   not one stone left upon another. Those nerves, which like telegraphic
   wires connected all parts of the city together, to carry thought and
   feeling and intelligence--these are cut. No matter how artistic the
   work might be,--and certainly we are fearfully and wonderfully made,
   and the anatomist stands still and marvels to see the skill which the
   eternal God has manifested in the formation of the body--but these
   ruthless worms pull everything to pieces, till like a city sacked and
   spoiled that has been given up for days to pillage and to flame,
   everything lies in a heap of ruin--ashes to ashes, dust to dust. But
   these invaders stop not here. Job says that next they consume his
   reins. We are wont to speak of the heart as the great citadel of life,
   the inner keep and donjon, where the captain of the guard holdeth out
   to the last. The Hebrews do not regard the heart, but the lower
   viscera, the reins, as the seat of the passions and of mental power.
   The worms spare not; they enter the secret palaces of the tabernacle of
   life, and the standard is plucked from the tower. Having died, the
   heart cannot preserve itself, and falls like the rest of the frame--a
   prey to worms. It is gone, it is all gone! The skin, the body, the
   vitals, all, all has departed. There is nought left. In a few years ye
   shall turn up the sod and say, "Here slept so-and-so, and where is he
   now?", and ye may search and hunt and dig, but ye shall find no relic.
   Mother Earth has devoured her own offspring.

   Dear friends, why should we wish to have it otherwise? Why should we
   desire to preserve the body when the soul has gone? What vain attempts
   men have made with coffins of lead, and wrappings of myrrh and
   frankincense. The embalming of the Egyptians, those master robbers of
   the worm, what has it done? It has served to keep some poor shrivelled
   lumps of mortality above ground to be sold for curiosities, to be
   dragged away to foreign climes, and stared upon by thoughtless eyes.
   No, let the dust go, the sooner it dissolves the better. And what
   matters it how it goes! If it be devoured of beasts, if it be swallowed
   up in the sea and become food for fishes! What, if plants with their
   roots suck up the particles! What, if the fabric passes into the
   animal, and from the animal into the earth, and from the plant into the
   animal again! What, if the winds blow it along the highway! What, if
   the rivers carry it to the waves of ocean! It is ordained that somehow
   or other it must be all separated--"dust to dust, ashes to ashes." It
   is part of the decree that it should all perish. The worms or some
   other agents of destruction must destroy this body. Do not seek to
   avoid what God has purposed; do not look upon it as a gloomy thing.
   Regard it as a necessity; nay more, view it as the platform of a
   miracle, the lofty stage of resurrection, since Jesus shall surely
   raise again from the dead the particles of this body, however divided
   from one another. We have heard of miracles, but what a miracle is the
   resurrection! All the miracles of Scripture, yea even those wrought by
   Christ, are small compared with this. The philosopher says, "How is it
   possible that God shall hunt out every particle of the human frame?" He
   can do it: he has but to speak the word, and every single atom, though
   it may have traveled thousands of leagues, though it may have been
   blown as dust across the desert, and anon have fallen upon the bosom of
   the sea, and then have descended into the depths thereof to be cast up
   on a desolate shore, sucked up by plants, fed on again by beasts, or
   passed into the fabric of another man,--I say that individual atom
   shall find its fellows, and the whole company of particles at the trump
   of the archangel shall travel to their appointed place, and the body,
   the very body which was laid in the ground, shall rise again.

   I am afraid I have been somewhat uninteresting while tarrying upon the
   exposition of the words of Job, but I think very much of the pith of
   Job's faith lay in this, that he had a clear view that the worms would
   after his skin destroy his body, and yet that in his flesh he should
   see God. You know we might regard it as a small miracle if we could
   preserve the bodies of the departed. If, by some process, with spices
   and gums we could preserve the particles, for the Lord to make those
   dry bones live, and to quicken that skin and flesh, were a miracle
   certainly, but not palpably and plainly so great a marvel as when the
   worms have destroyed the body. When the fabric has been absolutely
   broken up, the tenement all pulled down, ground to pieces, and flung in
   handfuls to the wind, so that no relic of it is left, and yet when
   Christ stands in the latter days upon the earth, all the structure
   shall be brought together, bone to his bone--then shall the might of
   Omnipotence be seen. This is the doctrine of the resurrection, and
   happy is he who finds no difficulty here, who looks at it as being an
   impossibility with man but a possibility with God, and lays hold upon
   the omnipotence of the Most High and says, "Thou sayest it, and it
   shall be done!" I comprehend thee not, great God; I marvel at thy
   purpose to raise my moldering bones: but I know that thou doest great
   wonders, and I am not surprised that thou shouldst conclude the great
   drama of thy creating works here on earth by re-creating the human
   frame by the same power by which thou didst bring from the dead the
   body of thy Son Jesus Christ, and by that same divine energy which has
   regenerated human souls in thine own image.

   II. Now, having thus descended into the grave, and seen nothing there
   but what is loathsome, LET US LOOK UP WITH THE PATRIARCH AND BEHOLD A
   SUN SHINING WITH PRESENT COMFORT.

   "I know," said he, "that my Redeemer liveth." The word "Redeemer" here
   used, is in the original "goel"--kinsman. The duty of the kinsman, or
   goel, was this: suppose an Israelite had alienated his estate, as in
   the case of Naomi and Ruth; suppose a patrimony which had belonged to a
   family, had passed away through poverty, it was the goel's business,
   the redeemer's business to pay the price as the next of kin, and to buy
   back the heritage. Boaz stood in that relation to Ruth. Now, the body
   may be looked upon as the heritage of the soul--the soul's small farm,
   that little plot of earth in which the soul has been wont to walk and
   delight, as a man walketh in his garden or dwelleth in his house. Now,
   that becomes alienated. Death, like Ahab, takes away the vineyard from
   us who are as Naboth; we lose our patrimonial estate; Death sends his
   troops to take our vineyard and to spoil the vines thereof and ruin it.
   But we turn round to Death and say, "I know that my Goel liveth, and he
   will redeem this heritage; I have lost it; thou takest it from me
   lawfully, O Death, because my sin hath forfeited my right; I have lost
   my heritage through my own offence, and through that of my first parent
   Adam; but there lives one who will buy this back." Brethren, Job could
   say this of Christ long before he had descended upon earth, "I know
   that he liveth;" and now that he has ascended up on high, and led
   captivity captive, surely we may with double emphasis say, "I know that
   my Goel, my Kinsman liveth, and that he hath paid the price, that I
   should have back my patrimony, so that in my flesh I shall see God."
   Yes, my hands, ye are redeemed with blood; bought not with corruptible
   things, as with silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ.
   Yes, heaving lungs and palpitating heart, ye have been redeemed! He
   that redeemed the soul to be his altar has also redeemed the body, that
   it may be a temple for the Holy Ghost. Not even the bones of Joseph can
   remain in the house of bondage. No smell of the fire of death may pass
   upon the garments which his holy children have worn in the furnace.

   Remember, too, that it was always considered to be the duty of the
   goel, not merely to redeem by price, but where that failed, to re- deem
   by power. Hence, when Lot was carried away captive by the four kings,
   Abraham summoned his own hired servants, and the servants of all his
   friends, and went out against the kings of the East, and brought back
   Lot and the captives of Sodom. Now, our Lord Jesus Christ, who once has
   played the kinsman's part by paying the price for us, liveth, and he
   will redeem us by power. O Death, thou tremblest at this name! Thou
   knowest the might of our Kinsman! Against his arm thou canst not stand!
   Thou didst once meet him foot to foot in stern battle, and O Death,
   thou didst indeed tread upon his heel. He voluntarily submitted to
   this, or else, O Death, thou hadst no power against him. But he slew
   thee, Death, he slew thee! He rifled all thy caskets, took from thee
   the key of thy castle, burst open the door of thy dungeon; and now,
   thou knowest, Death, thou hast no power to hold my body; thou mayst set
   thy slaves to devour it, but thou shalt give it up, and all their spoil
   must be restored. Insatiable Death, from thy greedy maw yet shall
   return the multitudes whom thou hast devoured. Thou shalt be compelled
   by the Saviour to restore thy captives to the light of day. I think I
   see Jesus coming with his Father's servants. The chariots of the Lord
   are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels. Blow ye the trumpet!
   blow ye the trumpet! Immanuel rides to battle! The Most Mighty in
   majesty girds on his sword. He comes! He comes to snatch by power, his
   people's lands from those who have invaded their portion. Oh, how
   glorious the victory! No battle shall there be. He comes, he sees, he
   conquers. The sound of the trumpet shall be enough; Death shall fly
   affrighted; and at once from beds of dust and silent clay, to realms of
   everlasting day the righteous shall arise.

   To linger here a moment, there was yet, very conspicuously in the Old
   Testament, we are informed, a third duty of the goel, which was to
   avenge the death of his friend. If a person had been slain, the Goel
   was the avenger of blood; snatching up his sword, he at once pursued
   the person who had been guilty of bloodshed. So now, let us picture
   ourselves as being smitten by Death. His arrow has just pierced us to
   the heart, but in the act of expiring, our lips are able to boast of
   vengeance, and in the face of the monster we cry, "I know that my Goel
   liveth." Thou mayst fly, O Death, as rapidly as thou wilt, but no city
   of refuge can hide thee from him; he will overtake thee; he will lay
   hold upon thee, O thou skeleton monarch, and he will avenge my blood on
   thee. I would that I had powers of eloquence to work out this
   magnificent thought. Chrysostom, or Christmas Evans could picture the
   flight of the King of Terrors, the pursuit by the Redeemer, the
   overtaking of the foe, and the slaying of the destroyer. Christ shall
   certainly avenge himself on Death for all the injury which Death hath
   done to his beloved kinsmen. Comfort thyself then, O Christian; thou
   hast ever living, even when thou diest, one who avenges thee, one who
   has paid the price for thee, and one whose strong arms shall yet set
   thee free.

   Passing on in our text to notice the next word, it seems that Job found
   consolation not only in the fact that he had a Goel, a Redeemer, but
   that this Redeemer liveth. He does not say, "I know that my Goel shall
   live, but that he lives,"--having a clear view of the self-existence of
   the Lord Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. And you
   and I looking back do not say, "I know that he did live, but he lives
   today." This very day you that mourn and sorrow for venerated friends,
   your prop and pillar in years gone by, you may go to Christ with
   confidence, because he not only lives, but he is the source of life;
   and you therefore believe that he can give forth out of himself life to
   those whom you have committed to the tomb. He is the Lord and giver of
   life originally, and he shall be specially declared to be the
   resurrection and the life, when the legions of his redeemed shall be
   glorified with him. If I saw no fountain from which life could stream
   to the dead, I would yet believe the promise when God said that the
   dead shall live; but when I see the fountain provided, and know that it
   is full to the brim and that it runneth over, I can rejoice without
   trembling. Since there is one who can say, "I am the Resurrection and
   the Life," it is a blessed thing to see the means already before us in
   the person of our Lord Jesus Christ. Let us look up to our Goel then
   who liveth at this very time.

   Still the marrow of Job's comfort it seems to me lay in that little
   word "My." "I know that MY Redeemer liveth." Oh, to get hold of Christ!
   I know that in his offices he is precious. But, dear friends, we must
   get a property in him before we call really enjoy him. What is honey in
   the wood to me, if like the fainting Israelites, I dare not eat. It is
   honey in my hand, honey on my lip, which enlightens mine eyes like
   those of Jonathan. What is gold in the mine to me? Men are beggars in
   Peru, and beg their bread in California. It is gold in my purse which
   will satisfy my necessities, purchasing the bread I need. So, what is a
   kinsman if he be not a kinsman to me? A Redeemer that does not redeem
   me, an avenger who will never stand up for my blood, of what avail were
   such? But Job's faith was strong and firm in the conviction that the
   Redeemer was his. Dear friends, dear friends, can all of you say, "I
   know that my Redeemer liveth." The question is simple and simply put;
   but oh, what solemn things hang upon your answer, "Is it MY Redeemer?"
   I charge you rest not, be not content until by faith you can say, "Yes,
   I cast myself upon him; I am his, and therefore he is mine." I know
   that full many of you, while you look upon all else that you have as
   not being yours, yet can say, "My Redeemer is mine." He is the only
   piece of property which is really ours. We borrow all else, the house,
   the children, nay, our very body we must return to the Great Lender.
   But Jesus, we can never leave, for even when we are absent form the
   body we are present with the Lord, and I know that even death cannot
   separate us from him, so that body and soul are with Jesus truly even
   in the dark hours of death, in the long night of the sepulchre, and in
   the separate state of spiritual existence. Beloved, have you Christ? It
   may be you hold him with a feeble hand, you half think it is
   presumption to say, "He is my Redeemer;" yet remember, if you have but
   faith as a grain of mustard seed, that little faith entitles you to
   say, and say now, "I know that my Redeemer liveth."

   There is another word in this consoling sentence which no doubt served
   to give a zest to the comfort of Job. It was that he could say, "I
   KNOW"--"I KNOW that my Redeemer liveth." To say, "I hope so, I trust
   so," is comfortable; and there are thousands in the fold of Jesus who
   hardly ever get much further. But to reach the marrow of consolation
   you must say, "I KNOW." Ifs, buts, and perhapses, are sure murderers of
   peace and comfort. Doubts are dreary things in times of sorrow. Like
   wasps they sting the soul! If I have any suspicion that Christ is not
   mine, then there is vinegar mingled with the gall of death. But if I
   know that Jesus is mine, then darkness is not dark; even the night is
   light about me. Out of the lion cometh honey; out of the eater cometh
   forth sweetness. "I know that my Redeemer liveth." This is a
   brightly-burning lamp cheering the damps of the sepulchral vault, but a
   feeble hope is like a flickering smoking flax, just making darkness
   visible, but nothing more. I would not like to die with a mere hope
   mingled with suspicion. I might be safe with this but hardly happy; but
   oh, to go down into the river knowing that all is well, confident that
   as a guilty, weak, and helpless worm I have - fallen into the arms of
   Jesus, and believing that he is able to keep that which I have
   committed to him. I would have you, dear Christian friends, never look
   upon the full assurance of faith as a thing impossible to you. Say not,
   "It is too high; I cannot attain unto it." I have known one or two
   saints of God who have rarely doubted their interest at all. There are
   many of us who do not often enjoy any ravishing ecstacies, but on the
   other hand we generally maintain the even tenor of our way, simply
   hanging upon Christ, feeling that his promise is true, that his merits
   are sufficient, and that we are safe. Assurance is a jewel for worth
   but not for rarity. It is the common privilege of all the saints if
   they have but the grace to attain unto it, and this grace the Holy
   Spirit gives freely. Surely if Job in Arabia, in those dark misty ages
   when there was only the morning star and not the sun, when they saw but
   little when life and immortality had not been brought to light,--if Job
   before the coming and advent still could say, "I know," you and I
   should not speak less positively. God forbid that our positiveness
   should be presumption. Let us try ourselves, and see that our marks and
   evidences are right, lest we form an ungrounded hope; for nothing can
   be more destructive than to say, "Peace, peace, where there is no
   peace." But oh, let us build for eternity, and build solidly. Let us
   not be satisfied with the mere foundation, for it is from the upper
   rooms that we get the widest prospect. Let us pray the Lord to help us
   to pile stone on stone, until we are able to say as we look at it,
   "Yes, I know, I KNOW that my Redeemer liveth." This, then, for present
   comfort today in the prospect of departure.

   III. And now, in the third and last place, as THE ANTICIPATION OF
   FUTURE DELIGHT, let me call to your remembrance the other part of the
   text. Job not only knew that the Redeemer lived, but he anticipated the
   time when he should stand in the latter day upon the earth. No doubt
   Job referred here to our Saviour's first advent, to the time when Jesus
   Christ, "the goel," the kinsman, should stand upon the earth to pay in
   the blood of his veins the ransom price, which had, indeed, in bond and
   stipulation been paid before the foundation of the world in promise.
   But I cannot think that Job's vision stayed there; he was looking
   forward to the second advent of Christ as being the period of the
   resurrection. We cannot endorse the theory that Job arose from the dead
   when our Lord died, although certain Jewish believers held this idea
   very firmly at one time. We are persuaded that "the latter day" refers
   to the advent of glory rather than to that of shame. Our hope is that
   the Lord shall come to reign in glory where he once died in agony. The
   bright and hallowed doctrine of the second advent has been greatly
   revived in our churches in these latter days, and I look for the best
   results in consequence. There is always a danger lest it be perverted
   and turned by fanatical minds, by prophetic speculations, into an
   abuse; but the doctrine in itself is one of the most consoling, and, at
   the same time, one of the most practical, tending to keep the Christian
   awake, because the bridegroom cometh at such an hour as we think not.
   Beloved, we believe that the same Jesus who ascended from Olivet shall
   so come in like manner as he ascended up into heaven. We believe in his
   personal advent and reign. We believe and expect that when both wise
   and foolish virgins shall slumber; in the night when sleep is heavy
   upon the saints; when men shall be eating and drinking as in the days
   of Noah, that suddenly as the lightning flasheth from hea- ven, so
   Christ shall descend with a shout, and the dead in Christ shall rise
   and reign with him. We are looking forward to the literal, personal and
   actual standing of Christ upon earth as the time when creation's groans
   shall be silenced forever, and the earnest expectation of the creature
   shall be fulfilled.

   Mark, that Job describes Christ as standing. Some interpreters have
   read the passage, "he shall stand in the latter days against the
   earth;" that as the earth has covered up the slain, as the earth has
   become the charnel-house of the dead, Jesus shall arise to the contest
   and say, "Earth, I am against thee; give up thy dead! Ye clods of the
   valley cease to be custodians of my people's bodies! Silent deeps, and
   you, ye caverns of the earth, deliver, once for all, those whom ye have
   imprisoned!" Macphelah shall give up its precious treasure, cemeteries
   and graveyards shall release their captives, and all the deep places of
   the earth shall resign the bodies of the faithful. Well, whether that
   be so or no, the posture of Christ, in standing upon the earth, is
   significant. It shows his triumph. He has triumphed over sin, which
   once like a serpent in its coils had bound the earth. He has defeated
   Satan. On the very spot where Satan gained his power Christ has gained
   the victory. Earth, which was a scene of defeated goodness, whence
   mercy once was all but driven, where virtue died, where everything
   heavenly and pure, like flowers blasted by pestilential winds, hung
   down their heads, withered and blighted--on this very earth everything
   that is glorious shall blow and blossom in perfection; and Christ
   himself, once despised and rejected of men, fairest of all the sons of
   men, shall come in the midst of a crowd of courtiers, while kings and
   princes shall do him homage, and all the nations shall call him
   blessed. "He shall stand in the latter day upon the earth."

   Then, at that auspicious hour, says Job, "In my flesh I shall see God."
   Oh, blessed anticipation--"I shall see God." He does not say, "I shall
   see the saints"--doubtless we shall see them all in heaven--but, "I
   shall see God." Note he does not say, "I shall see the pearly gates, I
   shall see the walls of jasper, I shall see the crowns of gold and the
   harps of harmony," but "I shall see God;" as if that were the sum and
   substance of heaven. "In my flesh shall I see God." The pure in heart
   shall see God. It was their delight to see him in the ordinances by
   faith. They delighted to behold him in communion and in prayer. There
   in heaven they shall have a vision of another sort. We shall see God in
   heaven, and be made completely like him; the divine character shall be
   stamped upon us; and being made like to him we shall be perfectly
   satisfied and content. Likeness to God, what can we wish for more? And
   a sight of God, what can we desire better? We shall see God and so
   there shall be perfect contentment to the soul and a satisfaction of
   all the faculties. Some read the passage, "Yet, I shall see God in my
   flesh," and hence think that there is here an allusion to Christ, our
   Lord Jesus Christ, as the word made flesh. Well, be it so, or be it not
   so, it is certain that we shall see Christ, and He, as the divine
   Redeemer, shall be the subject of our eternal vision. Nor shall we ever
   want any joy beyond simply that of seeing him. Think not, dear friend,
   that this will be a narrow sphere for our mind to dwell in. It is but
   one source of delight, "I shall see God," but that source is infinite.
   His wisdom, his love, his power, all his attributes shall be subjects
   for your eternal contemplation, and as he is infinite under each aspect
   there is no fear of exhaustion. His works, his purposes, his gifts, his
   love to you, and his glory in all his purposes, and in all his deeds of
   love--why, these shall make a theme that never can be exhausted. You
   may with divine delight anticipate the time when in your flesh you
   shall see God.

   But I must have you observe how Job has expressly made us note that it
   is in the same body. "Yet, in my flesh shall I see God;" and then he
   says again, "whom I shall see for myself, and mine eye shall behold and
   not another." Yes, it is true that I, the very man standing here,
   though I must go down to die, yet I shall as the same man most
   certainly arise and shall behold my God. Not part of myself, though the
   soul alone shall have some view of God, but the whole of myself, my
   flesh, my soul, my body, my spirit shall gaze on God. We shall not
   enter heaven, dear friends, as a dismasted vessel is tugged into
   harbor; we shall not get to glory some on boards, and some on broken
   pieces of the ship, but the whole ship shall be floated safely into the
   haven, body and soul both being safe. Christ shall be able to say, "All
   that the father giveth to me shall come to me," not only all the
   persons, but all of the persons--each man in his perfection. There
   shall not be found in heaven one imperfect saint. There shall not be a
   saint without an eye, much less a saint without a body. No member of
   the body shall have perished; nor shall the body have lost any of its
   natural beauty. All the saints shall be all there, and all of all; the
   same persons precisely, only that they shall have risen from a state of
   grace to a state of glory. They shall be ripened; they shall be no more
   the green blades, but the full corn in the ear; no more buds but
   flowers; not babes but men.

   Please to notice, and then I shall conclude, how the patriarch puts it
   as being a real personal enjoyment. "Whom mine eye shall behold, and
   not another." They shall not bring me a report as they did the Queen of
   Sheba, but I shall see Solomon the King for myself. I shall be able to
   say, as they did who spake to the woman of Samaria, "Now I believe, not
   because of thy word who did bring me a report, but I have seen him for
   myself." There shall be personal intercourse with God; not through the
   Book, which is but as a glass; not through the ordinances; but
   directly, in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be able to
   commune with the Deity as a man talketh with his friend. "Not another."
   If I could be a changeling and could be altered, that would mar my
   comfort. Or if my heaven must be enjoyed by proxy, if draughts of bliss
   must be drunk for me, where were the hope? Oh, no; for myself, and not
   through another, shall I see God. Have we not told you a hundred times
   that nothing but personal religion will do, and is not this another
   argument for it, because resurrection and glory are personal things?
   "Not another." If you could have sponsors to repent for you, then,
   depend upon it, you would have sponsors to be glorified for you. But as
   there is not another to see God for you, so you must yourself see and
   yourself find an interest in the Lord Jesus Christ.

   In closing let me observe how foolish have you and I been when we have
   looked forward to death with shudders, with doubts, with loathings.
   After all, what is it? Worms! Do ye tremble at those base crawling
   things? Scattered particles! Shall we be alarmed at these? To meet the
   worms we have the angels; and to gather the scattered particles we have
   the voice of God. I am sure the gloom of death is altogether gone now
   that the lamp of resurrection burns. Disrobing is nothing now that
   better garments await us. We may long for evening to undress, that we
   may rise with God. I am sure my venerable friends now present, in
   coming so near as they do now to the time of the departure, must have
   some visions of the glory on the other side the stream. Bunyan was not
   wrong, my dear brethren, when he put the land Beulah at the close of
   the pilgrimage. Is not my text a telescope which will enable you to see
   across the Jordan; may it not be as hands of angels to bring you
   bundles of myrrh and frankincense? You can say, "I know that my
   Redeemer liveth." You cannot want more; you were not satisfied with
   less in your youth, you will not be content with less now. Those of us
   who are young, are comforted by the thought that we may soon depart. I
   say comforted, not alarmed by it; and we almost envy those whose race
   is nearly run, because we fear--and yet we must not speak thus, for the
   Lord's will be done--I was about to say, we fear that our battle may
   last long, and that mayhap our feet may slip; only he that keepeth
   Israel does not slumber nor sleep. So since we know that our Redeemer
   liveth, this shall be our comfort in life, that though we fall we shall
   not be utterly cast down; and since our Redeemer liveth, this shall be
   our comfort in death, that though worms destroy this body, yet in our
   flesh we shall see God.

   May the Lord add his blessing on the feeble words of this morning, and
   to him be glory forever. Amen.

   Grave, the guardian of our dust!

   Grave, the treasury of the skies!

   Every atom of thy trust

   Rests in hope again to rise.

   Hark! the judgment trumpet calls;

   Soul, rebuild thy house of clay,

   Immortality thy walls,

   And Eternity thy day.

                             The Root Of The Matter

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY EVENING, APRIL 12, 1863, BY THE REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON. AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The root of the matter is found in me." Job 19:28.

   FOR the last three or four Lord's Day evenings I have been trying to
   fish with a net of small meshes. It has been my anxious desire to
   gather in and draw to shore the Much-Afraids, the Fearings, the
   Despondencies, and those of Little-Faith who seem to think it scarcely
   possible that they could belong to the people of God at all. I hope
   those sermons which have taken the lowest evidences of Christian life,
   and have been adapted rather to babes in Divine Grace than to those who
   are strong men in our Israel, will furnish comfort to many who
   beforetime had been bowed down with distress.
   In pursuance of the same purpose this evening, I take up the expressive
   figure of our text to address myself to those who evidently have the
   Grace of God embedded in their hearts, though they put forth little
   blossom and bear little fruit. I pray that they may be consoled, if
   there is clear evidence that at least the root of the matter is found
   in them incidentally. However, the same truth may be profitable, not
   only to the saplings in the garden of the Lord, but to the most goodly
   trees. For there are times and seasons when their branches do not put
   out much luxuriant foliage, and the hidden life furnishes the only true
   argument of their vitality.
   I. Our first aim, then, will be TO SPEAK OF THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE
   ESSENTIAL TO TRUE GODLINESS IN CONTRAST, OR, I might better say, IN
   COMPARISON WITH OTHER THINGS WHICH ARE TO BE REGARDED AS SHOOTS RATHER
   THAN AS ROOT AND GROUNDWORK.
   The tree can do without some of its branches, though the loss of them
   might be an injury. But it cannot live at all without its roots--the
   roots are essential--take those away, and the plant must wither. And
   thus, my dear Friends, there are things essential in the Christian
   religion. There are essential doctrines, essential experiences, and
   there is essential practice. With regard to essential doctrines, it is
   very desirable for us to be established in the faith. A very happy
   thing it is to have been taught from one's youth up the sound and solid
   doctrines which comforted the Puritans--which made blessed the heart of
   Luther and of Calvin, fired the zeal of Chrysostom and Augustine--and
   flashed like lightning from the lips of Paul.
   By such judicious training we are, no doubt, delivered from many doubts
   and difficulties which an evil system of theology would be sure to
   encourage. The man who is sound in the faith, and who understands the
   higher and more sublime doctrines of Divine Revelation, will have wells
   of consolation which the less instructed cannot know. But we always
   believe, and are ever ready to confess, that there are many doctrines
   which, though exceedingly precious, are not so essential. We believe a
   person may be in a state of Divine Grace, and yet not receive them.
   For instance--God forbid that we should regard a belief in the doctrine
   of election as an absolute test of a man's salvation--for no doubt
   there are many precious sons of God who have not been able to receive
   that precious Truth of God. Of course the doctrine is essential to the
   great scheme of Grace, as the foundation of God's eternal purpose--but
   it is not, therefore, necessarily the root of faith in the sinner's
   reception of the Gospel. And, perhaps, too, I may put the doctrine of
   the final perseverance of the saints in the same list. There are many
   who, no doubt, will persevere to the end, but who cannot accept the
   possibility of being assured of the fact.
   They are so occupied with the thoughts of their probation that they
   come not to the mature knowledge of their full salvation. They are
   securely kept while they credit not their security, just as there are
   thousands of the elect who cannot believe in election. Though
   Calvinistic doctrine is so dear to us--we feel ready to die in its
   defense--yet we would by no means set it up as being a test of a man's
   spiritual state. We wish all our Brothers and Sisters agreed with us,
   but a man may be almost blind, and yet he may live. A man with weak
   eyesight and imperfect vision may be able to enter into the kingdom of
   Heaven--indeed, it is better to enter there having but one eye, than,
   having two eyes and being orthodox in doctrine--to be cast into Hell
   fire.
   But there are some distinct truths of Revelation that are essential in
   such a sense that those who have not accepted them cannot be called
   Christians. And those who willfully reject them are exposed to the
   fearful anathemas which are hurled against apostasy. I shall not go
   into a detailed list. Let it suffice that I give you a few striking
   illustrations. The doctrine of the Trinity we must ever look upon as
   being one of the roots of the matter. When men go unsound here, we
   suspect that, before long, they will be wrong everywhere. The moment
   you get any suspicion of a man's wavering about the Divinity of Christ,
   you have not long to wait before you discover that on all other points
   he has gone wrong. Well did John Newton express it--
   "What think you of Christ is the test To try both your state and your
   scheme. You cannot be right in the rest, Unless you think rightly of
   Him."

   Almost all the forms of error that have sprung up since the days of Dr.
   Doddridge, when sundry gentlemen began to talk against the proper Deity
   of the Son of God--all the forms of error, I say, whatever department
   of the Christian system they may have been supposed to attack--have
   really stabbed at the Deity of our Redeemer. That is the one thing that
   they are angry at, as if their mother-wit taught them it was the true
   line of demarcation between natural and revealed religion. They cannot
   bear that the glorious Lord should be unto us a place of broad rivers
   and streams, and so they fly to do without Him.

   But their tacklings are loosed, they cannot well strengthen their mast,
   they cannot spread the sail. A Gospel without belief in the living and
   true God--Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity--is a rope of sand. As
   well hope to make a pyramid stand upon its apex as to make a
   substantial Gospel when the real and Personal Deity of the Father, the
   Son, and the Holy Spirit is left as a moot or disputed point. But I
   ought to mention the strange incoherency of that discourse which sets
   forth the influences of the Spirit without a due regard to His Personal
   agency. Oh, how little is the Holy Spirit known! We get beyond the mere
   exercise of opinions when we believe in Christ, know the Father, and
   receive the Holy Spirit. This is to have a knowledge of the true God
   and eternal life.

   Likewise essential is the doctrine of the vicarious sacrifice of our
   Lord Jesus Christ. Any bell that does not ring sound on that point had
   better be melted down at once. I do not think we have many in our
   denomination--we do have some who are not very clear--still, I think we
   have but few that are unsound in the doctrine of the real Substitution
   of Christ. But there are plenty elsewhere. Perhaps I need not indicate
   the locality, for in the denomination where they seem to be tolerably
   prolific, they have one earnest tongue, and one ready pen that is
   always willing at all times to expose the miscreants who thus do damage
   to the cause of Christ by giving up the precious blood of Jesus as the
   sole cause of the remission of sins, and the only means of access to
   God.

   Why, my Brothers and Sisters, we have nothing else left after we have
   given up this choice seal of the Everlasting Covenant, on which all our
   hopes depend! Renounce the doctrine of Jesus dying in our place? Better
   for us all to be offered as one great slaughter, one mighty sacrifice
   to God on one fire, than to tolerate for a moment any doubts about that
   which is the world's hope, Heaven's joy, Hell's terror, and eternity's
   song! I marvel how men are permitted to stand in the pulpit and preach
   at all, who dare to say anything against the atonement of Christ! I
   find in the Dutch Church, in the French Church, and in the German
   Churches, that men are accepted as Christian ministers who will yet
   speak hard things against the Atonement, itself, and even against the
   Deity of Him by whom the Atonement was made!

   There is no other religion in the world that has been false to its own
   doctrines in the way that Christianity has been. Imagine a Mohammedan
   allowed to come forward in the pulpit and preach against Mohammed!
   Would it be tolerated for a single moment? Suppose a Brahmin, fed and
   paid to stand up in a temple, and speak against Brahma! Would it be
   allowed? Surely not! Nor is there an Infidel lecturer in this country
   but would find his pay stopped at once, if, while pretending to be in
   the service of Atheism, he declaimed the sentiments he was sworn to
   advocate. How is it? Why is it? In the name of everything that is
   reasonable and instinctively consistent, where can it be that men can
   be called Christian ministers after the last vestige of Christianity
   has been treacherously repudiated by them?

   How is it that they can be tolerated to minister in holy things to
   people who profess and call themselves sincere followers of Jesus, when
   they tread under foot the precious blood of Christ, and, "reduce the
   mystery of godliness to a sys- tem of ethics"? To use the words of a
   Divine of the last century: "Degrade the Christian Church into a school
   of philosophy. Deny the expiation made by our Redeemer's Sacrifice.
   Obscure the brightest manifestation of Divine mercy, and undermine the
   principal pillar of practical religion. And to make a desperate
   shipwreck of our everlasting interests, they dash themselves to death
   on the very rock of salvation."

   No. We must have the Atonement, and that not tacitly acknowledged, but
   openly set forth. Charity can go a good way, but charity cannot remove
   the altar from the door of the Tabernacle, or admit the worshipper into
   the most Holy Place without the blood of propitiation. So, again, the
   doctrine ofjustification by faith is one of the roots of the matter.
   You know Luther's saying. I need not repeat it. It is the article of a
   standing, or falling Church, "By grace are you saved through faith, and
   that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God. Not of works lest any
   man should boast." Do you preach that doctrine? My hand and my heart
   are stretched out to you!

   Do you deny it? Do you stutter over it? Are you half-afraid of it? My
   back must be turned against you. I know nothing of you. You are none of
   the Lord's! What says the Apostle Paul to you? Would he have communed
   with you? He lifts his hand to Heaven and he says--"If any man preach
   any other Gospel than that you have received, let him be accursed!"
   That is Paul's saintly greeting. That is Paul's Apostolic
   malediction--an "Anathema Maranatha" upon the man that preaches not the
   Lord Jesus, and who does not vindicate the great doctrine of salvation
   by Grace and not by works.

   Well now, Friend, you may have come in here to listen to our doctrine,
   and to judge whether you can hold fellowship with us. We have been
   talking about the root of the matter. Permit me to say that if you are
   sound on these three points, the One God in Trinity, the glorious
   doctrine of the Substitution of Christ in the place of sinners, and the
   plan of salvation by simple faith in Jesus, then inasmuch as these
   roots of the matter are in you, God forbid that we should exclude you
   as heretical. If you are in other points unenlightened and groping
   about in uncertainty, doubtless the Lord will teach you--but we believe
   the root of the matter is in you so far as doctrine is concerned.

   Turning to another department of my subject. There are certain root
   matters in reference to experience. It is a very happy thing to have a
   deep experience of one's own depravity. It may seem strange, but so it
   is. A man will scarcely ever have high views of the preciousness of the
   Savior who has not also had deep views of the evil of his own heart.
   High houses, you know, need deep foundations. And when God digs deep,
   and throws out the mire of self-sufficiency. Then He puts in the great
   stone of Christ's all-sufficiency, and builds us up high in union and
   fellowship with Him.

   To read the guilt of sin in the lurid glare of Mount Sinai, to hear the
   thunder, and shrink back in wild dismay at the utter hopelessness of
   approach to God by the Law is a most profitable lesson. Yes, and to see
   the guilt of sin in the mellow light of Mount Calvary, and to feel that
   contrition, which a view of Christ Crucified alone can produce--this is
   to prepare the heart for such an ecstasy of joy in God, through whom we
   have now received the Atonement--as surpasses, I verily believe, the
   common experience of Christians. Still I dare not make a criterion of
   the profound depths of anguish with which some of us have had the
   sentence of death in ourselves.

   But it is absolutely essential that you should be brought to the end of
   all perfection in the flesh--that all your hopes of legal righteousness
   should expire--that you should be dead to the Law, in order that you
   may live unto God. This death may be with painful struggles, or it may
   be tranquil as a sleep. You may be smitten suddenly, as though an arrow
   from the Almighty were transfixed in your heart. Or you may pine away
   by a slow and tedious consumption. Yet die you must, before you can be
   made partaker of resurrection.

   This much, however, I will venture to say--you may be really a child of
   God and yet the plague of your own heart may be but very little
   understood. You must know something of it, for no man ever did or ever
   will come to Christ unless he has first learned to loathe himself and
   to see that in him, that is in his flesh, there dwells no good thing.
   You may not be able to talk, as some do, of conflicts within, and of
   the fountain of the great deep of your natural sin--and yet you may be,
   for all that--a true child of God.

   It is a happy thing, too, to have an experience which keeps close to
   Christ Jesus. To know what the word, "communion," means, without
   needing to take down another man's biography--to understand Solomon's
   Song without a commentary. To read it through and through, and say,
   "Precious Book! You did express just what I have felt, but what I never
   could have expressed." But, dear Friends, though all this is well,
   remember, it is not essential. It is not a sign that you are not
   converted because you cannot understand what it is to sit under His
   shadow with great delight. You may have been converted, and yet hardly
   have come so far as that. Always distinguish between the branches of
   the matter and the root of the matter. It is well to have branches like
   the cedars and to send up your shoots towards Heaven--but it is the
   root that is the all-important thing--the root of the matter.

   Now what is the root of the matter experimentally? Well, I think the
   real root of it is what Job has been talking about in the verses
   preceding the text--"I know," he says, "that my Redeemer lives." We
   talked of that this morning. The root of the matter in Christian
   experience is to know that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is able to
   save to the uttermost all them that come unto God by Him. And to know
   this by a personal appropriation of His power to save by a simple act
   of faith. In other words, dear Friend, you have the root of the matter
   in you if your soul can say--

   "My hope is built on nothing less Than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
   I dare not trust the sweetest frame, But wholly lean on Jesus' name. On
   Christ the solid rock I stand, All other ground is sinking sand."

   There must be in connection with this the repentance of sin, but this
   repentance may be far from perfect, and your faith in Christ may be far
   from strong. But, oh, if you hate sin, if you desire to be rid of it,
   if it is your plague, your burden, your grief. If Christ Jesus is your
   only comfort, your help, your hope, your trust--then understand--this
   is the root of the matter. I wish there were more than the root, but
   inasmuch as that is there, it is enough--you are accepted before
   God--for the root of the matter is in you. A living faith in a living
   Savior, and a real death to all creature merit and to all hope in
   creature strength--this, I take it, is that which is the root of the
   matter in spiritual experience.

   Did I not say that there was a root of the matter practically? Yes, and
   I would to God that we all practically had the branches and the fruits.
   These will come in their season, and they must come, if we are Christ's
   disciples. But nobody expects to see fruit on a tree a week after it
   has been planted. You know there are some trees that do not bring forth
   any great fruit till they have been in the ground some two or three
   years. And then at last, when the favorable season comes, they are
   white with blossoms and by-and-by are bowed to the earth with luscious
   fruit.

   It is very desirable that all Christians should be full of zeal, should
   be vehemently earnest, should go about doing good, should minister to
   the poor, should teach the ignorant, and comfort the distressed. Yet
   these things cannot be called the real root of the matter. The real
   root of the matter practically is this--"One thing I know, whereas I
   was blind, now I see. The things I once loved I now hate, the things I
   once hated I love. Now it is no more the world, but God. No more the
   flesh, but Christ, no more pleasure, but obedience. No more what I
   will, but what Jesus wills." If any of you can, from your souls, say
   that you desire the tenor of your life to be, "Lord, not as I will, but
   as You will," you have got the root of the matter practically.

   Let me guard this part of my subject with one further remark. There are
   those who do certain duties with a conscientious motive, in order to
   make themselves Christians--such as observing the Sabbath, holding
   daily worship of God with their families, and attending the public
   services of the Lord's House with regularity. But they do not
   distinguish between these external acts--which may be but the ornaments
   that clothe a graceless life, and those fruits of good living that grow
   out of a holy constitution, which is the root of genuine obedience.
   Some habits and practices of godly men may be easily counterfeited.

   Yet I think that there are certain virtues of God's children which defy
   imitation. "To bear reproach for Christ, and to suffer wrong
   patiently," is, to my mind, very much like the root in practical
   godliness. Perhaps there is a timid girl now present who has braved for
   many a month the persecution of her father and mother to serve that
   Savior whom her parents never knew. Nobody knows what rough words and
   harsh treatment she has had to encounter--all because she will come to
   Chapel. And she will steal away into her own room, sometimes, always
   with her Bible in her hand when she goes in. And she generally looks as
   if she had been crying when she comes out. Ah, poor Soul! I doubt not
   the root of the matter is in you!

   Or, see there a young man who has risked losing his employment because
   he will not conceal his attachment to Christ. Such as these, are
   sometimes brought into great straits. They do not see any precept that
   plainly says "You shall do this," or, "You shall not do that." But they
   find they must be one thing or the other. They make their choice, and
   it is against their worldly interests--it is done for the love they
   bear to the Savior's name. Their gentle courage I admire.

   Their little faith takes a strong grip. Oh, I cannot doubt the root of
   the matter is found in them! There is practical evidence of it.

   Let me pause here for a moment before leaving this first point to
   notice that you may generally ascertain whether you have got the root
   of the matter by its characteristic properties. You know a root is a
   fixing thing. Plants without roots may be thrown over the wall. They
   may be passed from hand to hand. But a root is a fixed thing. How
   firmly the oaks are rooted in the ground! You may think of those old
   oaks in the earth--ever so far off you have seen the roots coming out
   of the ground and then they go in again and you have said--"Why, what
   do these thick fibers belong to?"

   Surely they belong to one of those old oaks ever so far away. They had
   sent that root there to act a good hold, so that when the March winds
   comes through the forest and other trees are torn up--fir trees,
   perhaps--trees that have outgrown their strength at the top, while they
   have too little hold at bottom--the old oaks bow to the tempest,
   curtsey to the storm, and later they lift up their branches again in
   calm dignity. They cannot be blown down. Well now., if you have got the
   root of the matter, you are fixed. You are fixed to God, fixed to
   Christ, fixed to things Divine. If you are tempted, you are not soon
   carried away. Oh, how many professors there are that have no roots! Get
   them into godly company and they are such saints.

   But get them with other company and what if I say that they are devils?
   There you have them. Their mother is come up from the country, and she
   asked them to come tonight to hear Spurgeon. Here they are. Mother does
   not know but what John is one of the best lads anywhere while she is in
   town. Ah, but if it happens to be uncle William that comes up to London
   in a month's time, and he should ask John to go to a theater! O yes, he
   will go there, too! And you would never know that John had any
   religion, for he will put that by until mother comes back again.

   He has no roots. Give me the man that is bound hard and fast to
   Christ--lashed to the Cross by cords that even the knives of Hell
   cannot sever--lashed to the Cross forever! You have no roots unless you
   can say, "O God, my heart is fixed, my heart is fixed! By stern resolve
   and by firm covenant Yours I am! Bind the sacrifice with cords, even
   unto the horns of the altar." Again, a root is not only a fixing thing,
   but a quickening thing. What is it that first sets the sap flowing in
   the spring? Why, it is the root. Down below, beneath the earth, it
   begins to feel the genial influence of the coming spring, and it talks
   to the trunk and says, "It is time to set the sap flowing." So the sap
   begins to flow and the buds begin to burst.

   Ah, and you must have a vital principle. You must have a living
   principle. Some Christians are like those toys they import from France,
   which have sand in them. The sand runs down, and some little invention
   turns and works them as long as the sand is running. But when the sand
   is all out it stops. So on Sunday morning these people are just turned
   right, and the sand runs and they work all the Sunday. But the sand
   runs down by Sunday night and then they stand still, or else go on with
   the world's work just as they did before. Oh, this will never do! There
   must be a living principle-- something that shall be a mainspring
   within--a wheel that cannot help running on, and that does not depend
   upon external resources.

   A root, too, is a receiving thing. The botanists tell us a great many
   things about the ends of the roots. They can penetrate into the soil
   hunting after the particular food upon which the tree is fed. Ah, and
   if you have got the root of the matter in you, when you come to hear a
   sermon you will be sending out your root to look after the particular
   food which your soul wants. You will send those roots into the pages of
   Scripture--sometimes into a hymn book--often into the sermon. Even into
   a Brother's experience, and into God's Providence--seeking that
   something upon which your soul can feed.

   Therefore it follows that the root becomes a supplying thing, because
   it is a receiving thing. We must have a religion that lives upon God,
   and that supplies us with strength to live for God. Oh, how divinely
   blessed are those men in whom the root of the matter is found!

   II. Let me briefly notice, in the second place, that WHEREVER THERE IS
   THE ROOT OF THE MATTER,

   THERE IS VERY MUCH GROUND FOR COMFORT.

   Sounds there in my ears the sigh, the groan, the sad complaint?--"I do
   not grow as I could wish. I am not so holy as I want to be. I cannot
   praise and bless the Lord as I could desire. I am afraid I am not a
   fruitful bough whose branches run over the wall"? Yes, but is the root
   of the matter in you? If so, cheer up, you have cause for gratitude.
   Remember that in some things you are equal to the greatest and most
   full-grown Christian. You are as much bought with blood, O little

   Saints, as are the holy Brotherhood. He that bought the sheep, bought
   the lambs, too. You are as much an adopted child of God as any other
   Christian.

   A babe of a span long is as true a child of its parents as is the
   full-grown man. You are as truly justified, for your justification is
   not a thing of degrees. Your little faith has made you clean every
   whit. It could have done no more had it been the strongest faith in the
   world. You have as much right to the precious things of the Covenant as
   the most advanced Believers, for your right to Covenant mercies lies
   not in your growth, but in the Covenant itself. And your faith in Jesus
   may not assay to measure the extent of your inheritance in Him. So
   then, you are as rich as the richest, if not in enjoyment, yet in real
   possession.

   You are as dear to your Father's heart as the greatest among us. If
   there is a weakling in a family, the father often loves it the most, or
   at least indulges it with the most caresses. And when there is a child
   that has lost one of its senses, be it sight or hearing, you will
   notice with what assiduous care the parents watch over that one! You
   are possibly such a tender one, and Christ is very tender over you. You
   are like the smoking flax--anybody else would say, "Put out that
   smoking flax. What a smell! How it fills the room with a foul and
   offensive odor!" "But the smoking flax He will not quench."

   You are just like a bruised reed. There used to be some music in you,
   but now the reed is broken, and there is no tuneful note at all to be
   brought out from the poor, bruised, crooked and broken reed. Anyone
   else but the Chief Musician would pull you out and throw you away. You
   might think He would be sure to say, "I do not want a bruised reed. It
   is of no use at all among the pipes." But He will not break the bruised
   reed, nor quench the smoking flax. Instead of being downcast by reason
   of what you are, you should begin to triumph in Christ.

   Am I but little in Israel? Yet in Christ I am made to sit in heavenly
   places! Am I poor in faith? Still in Christ I am heir of all things! Do
   I sometimes wander? Yet Jesus Christ comes after me, and brings me
   back. Though, "less than nothing, I can boast and vanity confess." If
   the root of the matter is in me, I will rejoice in the Lord, and glory
   in the God of my salvation!

   III. This brings me to the third and closing part--WHEREVER THE ROOT OF
   THE MATTER IS, THERE WE

   SHOULD TAKE CARE THAT WE WATCH IT WITH TENDERNESS AND WITH LOVE.

   Some of you may have the notion that you are advanced in knowledge,
   that you have much skill in interpreting the Word of God, and that you
   understand the mysteries of the kingdom of Heaven. It is highly
   possible that your notion is correct. You go out into the world, and
   you meet with people who do not know quite as much as you do, and who
   have not yet learned all the doctrines of Grace as they are threaded
   together in the Divine plan of salvation. May I persuade you not to get
   into controversy, not to be continually fighting and quarrelling with
   people who do not hold to just your sentiments?

   If you discover the root of the matter in any man, say at once--"Why
   should I persecute you? Why should we fall to quarrelling with each
   other, seeing that the root of the matter is in us both?" Save your
   swords for Christ's real enemies. The way to make men learn the Truth
   of God is not to abuse them. We shall never make a Brother see a
   doctrine by smiting him in the eye. Hold your lantern up and let him
   see. I remember, when in my boyhood, I sometimes held a candle at night
   for a man sawing who was a worldling. He used to say to me--"Now, my
   lad, hold the candle so that you can see yourself, and you may depend
   upon it that I can see, too."

   And I have generally found that if you hold up the doctrines in such a
   way that you can see them yourselves, and just tell to others the way
   in which you have been led, by His Grace, to see them--and how you see
   them now--you will often give a light to other men, if they have the
   root of the matter in them. Quarrel not--fight not with them--but be
   friends and especially show yourself friendly.

   Then, again, if you meet with young professors who have the root of the
   matter in them, do not begin condemning them for lack of knowledge. I
   have heard of some old Believers, yes, and of some not very old, too,
   who had read a great deal and had, perhaps, more in the head than in
   the heart. And when young enquirers came to see them, they began to ask
   them--"Which theory do you hold, sublapsarian or supralapsarian?" I do
   not mean that they exactly said those very words, but they suggested
   some knotty points or something of that sort. And the young people have
   said--"I am sure I do not know, Sir."

   It has sometimes been the case that these young enquirers have been
   dealt very harshly with. I remember one case where a certain Brother--a
   good man, too, in his way, said--"Well, now, I am sorry to tell you
   that you are no child of God. If you die as you are, you will be
   lost"--only because the poor child did not exactly know the difference
   between two things that are amazingly alike after all. I do not think
   we ought to do this. It is not for us to go about killing all the
   lambs. For if we do this, where will the sheep come from? If we are
   always condemning those who have only begun as yet to learn their
   letters, we shall never have any readers.

   People must begin to say, "Two times two are four," before they can
   ever come to be very learned in mathematics. Should we stop them at
   once, and say--"You are no child of God, because you do not know how to
   compute the logarithms of Divine"? Why, then at once we have put out of
   the synagogue those who might have been its best ornaments! Remember,
   my dear Friends, that wherever we see the root of the matter, Christ
   has accepted the person, and therefore we ought to accept him. This is
   why I love to think that when we break bread at this table we always
   receive among us, as far as we know, all those who have got the root of
   the matter in them.

   I have heard a story of the late good Dr. Stedman, when he was tutor of
   Bradford College. It appears he was a very strict-communion Baptist,
   and carried it out conscientiously. One day he preached for some
   Independents, and in the afternoon, after the service, there was to be
   Communion. Now Mr. Stedman prayed most earnestly that the Lord would be
   pleased graciously to vouchsafe His Presence to the dear Brothers and
   Sisters when they met around His Table. After the service was over he
   was going to the vestry to put on his great coat, intending to go home.

   One of the deacons said--"Doctor, you will stop with us, will you not,
   to Communion?" "Well, my dear Brother," he said, "it is no want of
   love, but, you see, it would compromise my principles. I am a
   strict-communion Baptist, and I could not well stop and commune with
   you who have not been baptized. Do not think it is any want of love,
   now, but it is only out of respect to my principles." "Oh," said the
   deacon, "but it is not your principles, because what did you pray for,
   Doctor? You prayed your Master, the Lord Jesus, to come to His Table.
   And if according to your principles it is wrong for you to go there,
   you should not ask your Master to come where you must not go yourself.
   But if you believe that your Lord and Master will come to the table,
   surely where the Master is, it cannot be wrong for the servant to be."

   The deacon's reasoning appears to me very sound. And it is in the same
   spirit I say of any, or to any whose sincere faith I have no reason to
   doubt--if they have got the root of the matter in them, "Come and
   welcome!" We are sorry that when our friends ought to keep the feast of
   tabernacles with great branches of trees they only pull small twigs,
   and so do not get the benefit of the broader shadow. We are sorry that
   when Christ tells them to be immersed they go and sprinkle--but that is
   their own business and not ours. To their own Master they must stand or
   fall. But if the root of the matter is there, why persecute them?
   Seeing that the root of the matter is found in them, let them come. God
   has received them, and let us do the same.

   That matter about encouraging young Believers and not putting stumbling
   blocks in their path may seem to some of you decidedly unimportant. But
   I am persuaded that there are many young Christians who have been made
   to suffer for years through the roughness of some more advanced
   Believers. Christian! You that are strong--be very tender towards the
   weak--for the day may come when you will be weaker than they. Never did
   bullock push with side and shoulder the lean cattle of the herd when
   they came to drink. The Lord took away the glory from the fat bull of
   Bashan, and made him willing to associate with the very least of the
   herd.

   You cannot intimidate a child of God without making his Father angry.
   And though you are a child of God your-self--if you deal harshly with
   one of your Brothers and Sisters--you shall smart for it. The Master's
   rod is always ready, even for His own beloved children, when they are
   not tender with the sons and daughters of Zion, who are kept as the
   apple of God's eye. Remember, too, Brothers and Sisters, that the day
   may come when you will want consolation from the very friend whom you
   have treated so roughly. I have known some great people--some very
   great people--that have at last been made to sit at the feet of those
   whom before they called all sorts of ill names.

   God has His ways of taking the wind out of men's sails. While their
   sails were full, and the wind blew, they said, "No, no. We do not care
   about that little port over yonder. We do not care to put in there. It
   is only a miserable little fishing village." But when the wind came
   howling on, and the deep rolled heavily, and it seemed as if the dread
   artillery of God were all mustering for the battle, ah, how with the
   reef sail they have tried to fly, as best they could, into the little
   harbor! Do not speak ill of the little harbor. Do not be ashamed of
   little Christians. Stand up for the weaklings of the flock, and let
   this be your motto, you strong Christians--

   "There's not a lamb amidst the flock
   I would disdain to feed.
   There's not a foe before whose face
   I'd fear Your cause to plead."

   Now I ask you, by way of solemn searching investigation: Have you the
   root of the matter in you? I have spoken for your encouragement, in
   case you have the root of the matter in you. If you have not, there
   awaits you nothing but destruction--but, by His Grace, you are not
   hopelessly lost! The root of the matter is still to be had. The Holy
   Spirit can yet give you a new heart and a right spirit. Jesus Christ is
   still able and willing to save.

   Oh, look there! I see His five wounds. They flow with rivers of blood!
   Look there, Sinner! And as you look, by His Grace, you shall live!
   Whoever you may be, though you are the worst sinner out of Hell, yet--

   "While the lamp holds out to burn, The vilest sinner may return."

   Look there, Sinner, look, look and live! I think I have closed my
   sermon each night lately with those words, and I will do so again
   tonight. There is life in a look at a crucified Savior. There is life
   at this moment for you. Oh, look to Him, and you shall find that life
   for yourself. God bless you, for Jesus' sake.

   May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God our Father,
   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with all who love Jesus, now
   and eternally. Amen. Amen.

                                  Strong Meat

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL, 19, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, even those who
   by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and
   evil.'" Hebrews 5:14.

   IN most large houses we shall find humanity in all its stages. We shall
   see the infant in its cradle, children laughing in their play, young
   men working with vigor, and the old man resting in peace in such a
   mansion. If a careful Martha is in charge, provisions will be made for
   all the different ages. There will be milk provided for the babes, and
   the pantry will not be without solid meat for the full grown men.

   Now in our Father's great house, His family is always so large that you
   will always find Believers in all stages of growth. Perhaps there is
   never a moment in the year in which there is not a new birth unto God
   by the Holy Spirit. The sighing of repentance, and the crying of simple
   faith are always in our heavenly Father's ears, giving Him delight. He
   has men, babes, and for these He has abundance of nourishing food. But
   we bless His name that they are not all babes in the house. Some are
   young men, who are strong, and have overcome the Wicked One. And there
   are a few fathers who have known Him, that is, from the beginning.

   For the young men and for the hoary sires there is as plentiful and as
   fitting a provision as for the infants. He opens His hands, and
   supplies the want of every living thing. This is true, not only of the
   temporals which He gives to man and beast alike, but also of the
   spirituals which He dispenses liberally to all the new creatures in
   Christ Jesus. Now it were unfitting to give milk to the man of full
   age, and equally improper to present the strong meat to those who are
   but infants. Our Lord has, therefore, been pleased to dictate
   directions as to the persons for whom the various provisions of His
   table are intended.

   Our text talks of strong and solid meat, and it describes the persons
   who are to feed thereon. The context gives a mild rebuke to those who,
   by reason of indolence and sloth, have not attained to years of
   discernment, and cannot, therefore, feed on substantial diet.

   I. Let us, first of all, BRING FORTH SOME OF THIS STRONG MEAT AND SET
   IT UPON THE TABLE BEFORE YOU.

   A careful examination of the context will inform you that one form of
   strong meat which is only fit for full grown Christians is the
   allegorical exposition of Scriptural history. You will mark that the
   Apostle was about to allegorize upon Melchizedek. He had intended to
   set forth that that venerable and priestly king was, so far as
   Scriptural information goes, without father, without mother, without
   descent--having neither beginning of years nor end of life--and that he
   was superior to Levi seeing that Levi's progenitor paid tithes to him,
   and received his blessing.

   The Apostle was about to show that Melchizedek was a type of Jesus,
   who, as a Priest, is without father, without mother, without descent,
   having neither beginning of days, nor end of years, but is a Priest
   forever according to the power of an endless life. But the Apostle
   paused, for he felt that this allegory of Melchizedek was too strong a
   meat for those who were not full grown men. Beyond a doubt, the
   historical parts of Scriptures are intended to be instructive
   allegories, setting forth heavenly mysteries. See how the Apostle Paul
   used several of them. There is the case of Hagar and Sarah.

   Since the promise was not performed to Sarah, and no offspring had been
   born to Abraham, Sarah suggests that Abraham should take to himself a
   concubinary wife, Hagar. He does so, and she brings forth according to
   the flesh, and by the power of the flesh, Ishmael. Now the Apostle goes
   on to show that Ishmael was not the seed which God had promised and
   that, consequently, in after years, Isaac was born--not according to
   the power of the flesh--since his father and mother were past age--but
   according to the promise fulfilled by the power of God alone.

   He then goes on to show that this is an allegory. That the children of
   the flesh, that is, those who are the seed of Abraham, by natural
   birth, like Ishmael, are not the true seed. But that those who, like
   Isaac, are the fruit of God's promise, and having been once as dead,
   are given to Abraham, as Isaac was on the mountain in a figure--that
   these are the true seed, concerning whom the Covenant was made. And as
   Sarah said concerning Hagar--"Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for
   the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with
   Isaac." So the Gospel says-- "Cast out the Law, for the children of the
   Law, those who hope to be saved by legal works, shall not be heirs with
   My sons, even with those who are saved by the promise of Grace."

   Now this allegory is meat for instructed Believers. Jacob and
   Esau--born of the same parents, at the same birth, and yet separated in
   destiny by that memorable sentence, "Jacob have I loved and Esau have I
   hated"--were a type of the election of Divine Grace. And with many
   other instances, these go to prove that Holy Scripture is to be
   received not only as a literal description of facts which really did
   occur, but as a picture in which souls taught be Divine Grace,
   illuminated by the Holy Spirit, may see, portrayed in express
   characters, the great Gospel of the living God.

   Those of you who are well instructed will have found out by this time
   that the Book of Genesis is the History of Dispensations--that in all
   its types it sets forth, from Adam to Joseph--the various dispensations
   of primeval innocence. It depicts man without Law, under Law, in
   Covenant, and apart from Covenant--and many other things of which we
   cannot now speak particularly. You will have discovered that Exodus is
   the Book of Redemptions. Here is redemption by blood when the paschal
   lamb was slain, redemption by power when He broke the chivalry of
   Egypt, smiting Pharaoh in the midst of the Red Sea. The Book of
   Leviticus is the Handbook of Communion, the Guide to Access, opening to
   us the way in which God can come to man, and man can go to God.

   And I am sure the least observant of you must have discovered that the
   Book of Numbers is the Record of Experience. All those journeys of the
   children of Israel to and fro when they lived in the wilderness,
   sometimes by Marah's bitter fountain, and at other times by Elim's
   spreading palms, all describe the constant marching of the sacred army
   of God to the Promised Land. The Books of Joshua and Judges typify the
   history of the people who have entered into the land of Canaan, who are
   saved, but who have to fight with their corruptions--with the
   Canaanites that are still in the land-- and to drive them out despite
   their chariots of iron.

   I believe that every book of Scripture has some special lesson beyond
   its historical import. And perhaps when the history of the world shall
   have been fully worked out, we shall see that the books of the Bible
   were like a prophetic roll sealed to us, but yet fulfilled to the
   letter. I sometimes think that we live in the days of the Judges. God
   raises up one mighty minister after another, some Shamgar, Jephthah,
   Gideon, or Samson--and when these die the Church relapses into its
   former state of coldness and indifference. But the time is coming when
   David the King shall come, and when Solomon shall reign from the river,
   even to the ends of the earth.

   The Millennial age shall hasten its glories. And what if it should be
   succeeded by a time of falling away, as under the kings of Israel, and
   then the winding up of the dispensation of the carrying away of the
   wicked into their long and last captivity, and the setting of the
   chosen in another and a better land? If these things are so, I am not
   wrong in the remark, that these allegories are only fit for strong men,
   who, by reason of use, have had their senses exercised. See, I set the
   meat before you.

   I feel persuaded that the Apostle also more particularly referred to
   those mysterious Truths of God which have respect to the relationships
   of our Lord Jesus Christ and to His complex Person. The very simplest
   Believer understands that Christ is God and Man--that Christ stood as
   the sinner's Surety and paid his debt. But, Brothers and Sisters, when
   we come to meditate much upon the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ we
   shall soon discover that there are depths of mystery in which an
   elephant might swim, as well as shallows where a lamb might wade. His
   complex Person suggests a thousand thoughts--all of which are too high
   for comprehension or even consideration--until our senses have been
   exercised.

   The doctrine of Christ's ancient Covenant. The striking of hands
   between Jesus--Jehovah, the Surety, and Jehovah of Hosts, who accepted
   Him as the Substitute for His people--who but the perfect man can grasp
   this? Christ's frequent appearances upon earth, too, before His
   incarnation, when His delights were with the sons of men--when He
   talked with Abraham, communed with Moses, spoke to Joshua, and trod the
   coals of fire with the three holy children--what a theme! Christ's
   eternal Sonship, the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and
   the Son. The conception of Jesus as to His humanity in the womb of the
   Virgin, and others of a kindred nature, are all great mysteries.

   I do not believe that these are fit topics for babes in Grace. These
   Truths of God are as high above us as the heavens are above the earth.
   But if ever we do come to consider these sublimities, we must remember
   that they are only food for full grown men. I might go on to show that
   our union to Christ, that wonderful doctrine of our being members of
   His Body, of His flesh and of His bones, is also a mystery not to be
   trifled with by children. I might show, too, that even in Christ's
   Second Advent there are lofty questions--mighty difficulties which need
   the full grown intellect of the Believer to grapple with them. And,
   therefore, here again you have another dish loaded with solid meat.

   The doctrines of Grace are also generally esteemed to be very strong
   meat. He that is not full grown in the faith will discover much in the
   doctrine of predestination that will stagger him. No doubt many young
   Believers have felt God's foreordination to be like a stone rolled in
   their way over which they can scarcely climb. They have looked upon
   this glorious Truth of God as a mountain blocking up their path. They
   have not understood that though it is a mountain, it is one upon whose
   summit God communes with man.

   How many have been distressed with the precious doctrine of election?
   It is meat. It is hallowed meat--meat fit for the priests of God, and
   for the Lord's mightiest warriors--but many there are who have been so
   scandalized by it, that they have been glad to write bitter things
   against themselves on account of it. So with the doctrine of the
   immutability of God, and the consequent safety of the Lord's
   people--seeing that because He changes not, the sons of Jacob cannot be
   consumed. This, though sweet as honey dropping from the honeycomb, is
   not a doctrine for every man. Only they who do business upon the great
   waters, and have learned the need of solid food can usually feed on
   these things with satisfaction.

   Oh, dear Brothers and Sisters, what a mercy it is that there are such
   things as the grand old Truths which men nickname Calvinism, but which
   are the very marrow of the Gospel. I find when the heart aches, and the
   spirit is heavy, there is nothing like reading the eighth and ninth
   chapters of Romans. And when things go amiss with me, and everything is
   perversely disappointing my hopes, it is very delightful to throw
   oneself back upon the soft couch of God's eternal purpose, to pillow
   one's head upon the certainty that what He said He will perform, and
   that what He has commanded shall stand fast. Here are royal dainties!
   Costly cheer for fainting pilgrims!

   If you want the wings of eagles, study these doctrines and they shall
   bear you aloft. If you would creep along the ground and be full of
   doubts, fears, miseries, and distractions, live on baser food. But if
   you would walk in the strength of a giant, and fight with the valor of
   a David, live on these loaves of Heaven's best bread, and your youth
   shall be renewed. Yet these things are strong meat and are not for
   babes, but for men.

   Scarcely need I mention that other dish--the more advanced and
   inwrought forms of Christian experience. I believe there are saints,
   for instance, who hardly comprehend that passage where the Apostle
   speaks of the contest within-- "When I would do good, evil is present
   with me." You know there are many little saints who do not comprehend
   the fight within. The conflict is there, but they have not a clear idea
   of what that conflict is. They do not understand, with Paul, that, "It
   is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me." The doctrine of
   the two natures, and of their constant struggle with each other, is not
   at their fingertips.

   Then, again, communion with Christ is a high mystery that is never
   learned in the dame school of repentance, not often in the grammar
   school of faith--we must go the university of repentance to learn
   it--leaning our head on Jesus' bosom, and having foretastes of the
   fellowship which makes Heaven what it is. This is one of those rare
   experiences which can only belong in its frequency to the full grown
   Believer. I do not wonder that some people cannot read Solomon's Song.
   We do not expect that they should. If I put a book of algebra or a
   table of logarithms into the hand of a child who has just learned the
   multiplication table, I do not marvel that he should not understand it.

   The fact is that the Song is to the whole Bible what the Holy of Holies
   was to the Temple. You may walk into the Acts of the Apostles and the
   Gospels and say, "Here I am in the outer court of the Temple." You may
   go to the Psalms and to the Epistles, and say, "Here I am in the Court
   of the Priests." But the Canticles are the Holy of Holies. And he that
   has not learned to enter with the High Priest into that which is within
   the veil will never be able to read Solomon's Song. These experiences,
   I say, are for men of full age, who have had their senses exercised.

   I have thus set before you the various sorts of strong meat. Before we
   leave the table let me utter a word of caution. Milk you may use as you
   will. You cannot take too much of it. It will not do strong men any
   great amount of good, but it will certainly do them no harm. But the
   strong meat must always be accompanied by a word of caution when it is
   placed before the uninstructed and feeble--since such are very apt to
   do mischief, both to themselves, and to others with this strong meat.

   As for the allegories. What a world of nonsense have people talked
   about the allegories of Scripture, trying to make things run on all
   fours that were meant to walk erect. Alas, for those silly compounders
   who without the genius of old Origen, imitated his worst faults. What
   can I say that would be censure severe enough upon Origen himself, who
   never could read a chapter but he must needs twist it from its plain
   sense to make a mystery of it. We have all heard, I dare say, of the
   Divine who was foolish enough to take the three baskets full of sweet
   meats that were upon the head of Pharaoh's baker, and to say that they
   represented the Trinity.

   I have heard of another who preached from this passage in
   Ezra--"Nine-and-twenty knives," and went to show that they were types
   of the four-and-twenty elders. What he did with the surplus five I
   don't know! Was God's Book ever meant to be a toy for the amusement of
   childish imagination? Surely not! The strong meat of allegory must be
   for half-inspired saints like John Bunyan, and those masters in Israel
   who are not to be carried away upon the back of every figure, but who
   can ride their figures like good horsemen with a bit in the mouth of
   the allegory, and make it keep in a straight road, and bear them safely
   on to their destination. How many weak men are like boys on unbroken
   colts? The sooner they are off, the better, for they will hurt their
   steed, and do themselves no good.

   So must it be with the good things concerning the Person of our Lord
   Jesus Christ. The mysterious doctrine of the Trinity, and the equally
   mysterious and sublime doctrine of eternal generation are best let
   alone by feeble minds. I do not think there are half-a-dozen men alive
   who ought to meddle with the last. There has been a controversy lately,
   in a magazine, which I sometimes read for amusement rather than for
   instruction, between certain self-considered great and able Divines of
   modern times, who think they are the men, and that wisdom will die with
   them. They have been denouncing each other most heartily--and this
   seems the only thing they can do thoroughly well. They have been
   denouncing each other heartily because one believes this, and the other
   believes that, about a subject which not one of them knows anything at
   all about.

   The Sonship of our Lord is a great and marvelous mystery, to be meekly
   and reverently received. It is never to be disputed about, except by
   those gigantic minds which belong to the past, rather than the present.
   We might like to see two titanic Puritans enter the field of
   controversy--two such men, for instance, as Dr. John Owen, and
   Charnock--one might travel a thousand miles to see them grapple one of
   these lofty subjects. But when the little men of these days meddle with
   them, it saddens the humble-minded and affords enlightenment to none.

   In a measure it is so with the doctrines of Grace. The doctrines of
   Grace are to be handled with caution, for there are some folks who are
   not of full age, and have not, by reason of use, had their senses
   exercised so that they can discern both good and evil. Many love high
   doctrine, but then they want it higher than the Bible. Have we not
   known some who thought themselves very wise, but whose senses, I am
   certain, have never been well exercised? They were so fond of the
   doctrine of justification by faith that they have denied sanctification
   by the Holy Spirit--and have taught imputed sanc-tification--which is a
   doctrine of men, indeed.

   Some have so exaggerated Free Grace that they have denied the practical
   precepts. This is partly through wickedness, and partly through folly.
   It is the sure result of little minds losing their way in the great
   Truths of God, and, slipping from the high road, and falling to
   flounder in the ditch of error. Oh, my dear Brothers and Sisters, I
   would sooner you would leave these doctrines alone, than that you
   should fall into Antinomianism! Among the most damnable things which
   Satan ever sent is that which shall lead you to deny the practical
   precepts, and to forget that, "Without holiness no man shall see the
   Lord."

   Unholy fatalism is a deep ditch, and the abhorred of the Lord shall
   fall in. Those persons, too, who push the doctrines of election, and
   make it into the doctrine of reprobation show that they are foolish.
   They are not fit to deal with sublime Truth. If some persons who are
   renowned for preaching the doctrines of Grace would only hold their
   tongues till they understood them, their admirers would wait upon a
   dumb oracle. Oh, it is a grand thing to be able to receive the whole
   Truth of God--to learn human responsibility as well as Divine
   Sovereignty. To see God doing as He wills, but man bound to obey. To
   see Jehovah exalted on His Throne, King of kings and Lord of lords,
   with man's will His subject and bound to do what God bids, simply and
   only because God commands it!

   I am sure if we can couple the two things, free-agency and
   predestination, together, we shall be saved from Anti-nomianism on the
   one hand, and from infidelity on the other. It is not holding half the
   Truth of God that marks the man, that is the attainment of a babe. But
   to hold all--and to be afraid neither of high doctrines nor of low
   doctrines-- neither of Calvinism nor of Arminianism, nor any other ism
   so long as there is the Truth of God in it. To pick the Truth of God
   out, and to hold fast that which is good--this is the conduct of a full
   grown, well-developed Believer. May you have Divine Grace, dear
   Friends, as touching these Truths, to feed upon them as men and women
   who are of full age.

   I shall not say anything upon the other point, except that it is just
   the same as to advanced experience. There are some who have run to the
   extreme of despondency, and others to the verge of levity through not
   knowing that strong meat is only for men of full age. But I have said
   enough and, therefore, I now leave this point to turn to a second.

   II. Secondly, let me INVITE THE QUALIFIED PERSONS TO COME TO THE FEAST.
   Who are they? They are here described as being persons of full age.
   Understand, dear Friends, that there is no reference here at all to the
   age of a person as to human life. The Greek word is, "Men that are
   perfect." It signifies, therefore, spiritual men and women who have
   attained to the highest degree of spiritual development. Now this is
   not the result of years, for there are some gray heads that have no
   more wisdom than when they first began. And, on the other hand, there
   are some youthful Believers who are worthy to be called fathers in
   Israel, through the progress which they have made in Divine Grace.

   Growth in Grace does not run side by side with growth in years. As old
   Master Brooks says, "There are some few Believers who seem to be born
   with beards." They are ripe Christians at a very early stage of their
   spiritual existence. And there are some who, if they tarry at Jericho
   till their beards are grown, will be long in seeing the King's face.
   They are always babes, needing the spoon and the rocking chair, even in
   old age. The expression in the text, then, has no reference to age, but
   is used in a spiritual and metaphorical sense.

   But what is meant by men that are full grown? Well, you know a babe has
   the same parts as a man. The babe is perfect in its measure, but it is
   not perfectly perfect. Those limbs must expand. The little hand must
   get a wider grasp. The trembling feet must become strong pillars for
   ripening manhood--the man must swell and grow and expand and enlarge
   and be consolidated. Now when we are born to God, we have all the parts
   of the advanced Christian. Faith, hope, love, patience--they are all
   there, but they are all little, all in miniature--and they must all
   grow. And he is of full age whose faith is vigorous, whose love is
   inflamed, whose patience is constant, whose hope is bright, who has
   every Grace, in full fashion.

   Nor is it only development. The full grown man is stronger than the
   babe. His sinews are knit. His bones have become more full of solid
   material. They are no longer soft and cartilaginous, there is more
   solid matter in them. So with the advanced Christian--he is no longer
   to be bent about and twisted--his bones are as iron, and his muscles as
   steel. He moves himself in stately paces, neither needs he any upon
   whom to lean. He can plow the soil, or reap the corn. Deeds that were
   impossible to infancy are simplicities to the full grown man. Now you
   understand what the full grown Christian is. He can do, and dare, and
   suffer what would have frightened him before.

   He can fight with dragons though once he would have fled before a
   grasshopper. He can now endure to pass through deep waters, though once
   a little brook would have swept him away. There is as much difference,
   in fact, between the full grown Christian and the newly-born convert as
   between the strong, hale, hearty man of forty, and a babe of three or
   four. We must, then, before we can venture upon things hard to be
   understood, labor to arrive at full age.

   But then our text tells us that they have had their senses exercised.
   The soul has senses as well as the body. Men who have had their senses
   exercised know how to choose between good and evil. Now, what are these
   senses? Well, there are our spiritual eyes. When the babe first sees,
   it has little idea of distances. I suppose that to a babe's eyes
   everything appears as a flat surface. It is the result of experience
   which enables the man to know that such a thing is so many yards off,
   and that another is so many miles distant.

   Travelers who go to Switzerland for the first time soon discover that
   they have not had their eyes exercised. You think that you can reach
   the peak of yonder mountain in half-an-hour. There is the top of yonder
   rock. You dream that a boy might fly his kite to the summit, but it
   shall take you hours to climb there, and weary limbs, alone, can bear
   you to the dizzy height. At a distance young travelers scarcely know
   which is mountain, and which is cloud. All this is the result of not
   having the eyes exercised upon such glorious objects. It is just
   precisely so in spiritual things--unless Christians have their eyes
   exercised. I hope dear Friends, you know what it is to see Christ. Your
   eyes, by faith, have looked upon the King in His beauty. You know what
   it is, too, to see self. You have looked into the depravity of your own
   heart and have been amazed.

   Your eyes have seen the rising and the falling of many deceptions. Your
   eyes have been tried in waiting for God in many a dark night, or in
   beholding Him in the midst of many a bright Providence. Thus your eyes
   have been exercised. Now, when a doctrine is put before you, a strong
   doctrine, you look at it and say--"Ah, yes, my eye of faith tells me,
   from what I have seen before, that that is healthy food upon which I
   may feed." But if you detect something in it that is too high, or too
   low, you at once say--"No, that won't do for me," and you put it away.
   Hence it is that the man, the eye of whose faith has been tried with
   bright visions and dark revelations, is qualified to discern between
   good and evil in those great mysteries which would be too high for
   unexercised Believers.

   Then there is the ear. We hear it said of some that they have no ear
   for music. We sometimes hear it said of others that they have an ear
   for music and they can tell when people are singing half a note amiss.
   How shocked they would sometimes be with some of you who will persist
   in running away from our good leader, and getting a whole note amiss!
   But there are some who cannot tell one note from another. So is it in
   spiritual things, "Blessed are the people that know the joyful sound,"
   but many do not know the difference between the joyful sound, and that
   which is half a note lower. Why, dear Friends, when a Christian is well
   taught, he knows when a note goes too high and he says--"No, no, no.
   That jars."

   Or when it goes too low he says--"No, that is out of tune." He wants to
   have the keynote of the Gospel constantly before him, and any
   divergence from the grand old tune of orthodoxy, which he has learned
   from the Word of God, at once makes him feel wretched. He has a fine,
   keen, discerning ear. He can tell at once any mistake, and is not to be
   led astray by it. Hence it is that such persons are fit to hear the
   solid doctrines of the Gospel preached, because they have listened to
   the voice of God. They have heard the charms of evil, and, by God's
   Grace, have despised them. They have heard the conversation of educated
   saints, they have been taught in the ways of the Lord, and knowing,
   therefore, the difference between this and that, they can discern
   between good and evil, and are not to be led astray.

   Now, I know that there is always a tendency in our large congregation
   for us to lose a driblet every now and then of two sorts of people. One
   sort, when they hear an earnest sermon to sinners. When the wanderers
   are exhorted to flee to Jesus and are told that if they perish it will
   be their own fault. "Oh," these people say, "that is Arminian
   doctrine!" And off they go to some place where they can have the
   hyperism undiluted. And, then, if on another morning God's
   predestination is proclaimed, and men are told that God has chosen His
   people, that "it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of
   God that shows mercy," then certain people say, "Ah, I did not get on
   this morning. It was too high for me."

   The fault is not in either of the doctrines, for they are both
   Scriptural--the evil lies in these people's ears. They do not know the
   note which is the happy medium between the two systems--the note which
   takes in both, which shows the sinner his own responsibility--and yet
   shows to both saint and sinner, God's real Sovereignty. Happy is he
   whose ear is well tuned to discern both good and evil. Then, dear
   Friends, comes the nose, the intention of which sense is to smell
   things afar off. True Christians have smelt the fragrance of Christ's
   fellowship. "While the king sits at his table, My spikenard sends forth
   the smell thereof."

   Advanced Christians know the fragrance of Heaven. The angels have
   brought them bundles of myrrh from the other side of the stream. They
   have had their nostrils exercised, and you know the nostrils are of
   very essential use in reference to food. The nostrils can soon detect
   decay or that spiciness which the crafty trader employs to conceal it.
   There are certain persons whose ministry is putrid, but they lay on
   thick, very excellent spice about the safety of the Believer, and the
   joy and peace that there are in Christ--so that the putridity is
   somewhat checked. And some Christian people eat the nauseous morsels,
   forgetting, or not knowing what they really are, because of the sweet
   smell and flavor in which the whole is wrapped up.

   But our nostrils are given us on purpose to detect the craft and
   mischief of designing men. And the spiritual nostril that has been made
   to perceive the difference between the righteous and the wicked will
   soon be able to perceive what is true food and what is carrion. Then,
   you know, there is the taste. And this sense needs educating, too. Some
   men have no taste. To them flavor is no luxury. There are many who have
   no taste spiritually. Give them a cup of mingle-mangle-- "perhaps,"
   "ifs," "buts," "maybe," creature willings, and creature doings--and if
   it is only warm, they will drink it down and say, "Oh, how delightful!"

   If you give them a cup, on the other hand, that is full of Divine
   purposes, precious promises, and sure mercies of David--if you will
   only flavor it with a good style of oratory--they will drink that sweet
   potion, too, and relish it. The two things may contradict each other
   flatly, but these people have no discernment--they have not had their
   senses exercised. But those of you who have been made to taste the
   sweets of Covenant Grace, you, especially, who have eaten His flesh and
   drunk His blood--and you, too, who have been made to drink the
   wormwood, and the gall till your mouth knows every flavor, from the
   bitterness of death up to the glory of immortality--you may taste the
   strong meat without any fear, for your senses are exercised.

   Lastly, there is the sense of touch, and you know how in some men this
   has been developed to a very high degree. Men who are deficient in
   sight, for instance, have acquired by touch the knowledge which would,
   if they had not been blind, have been derived from their eyes. So
   Believers have been made to touch the hem of Jesus' garment. They have
   exercised the sense of feeling by joy, by rapture--perhaps by doubt and
   by fear--and their touch has become so acute, so keen, that though
   their eyes were shut, as soon as they touch a doctrine they would know
   what was of God and what of man.

   Now our text says that this comes as the result of use, and that use
   generally comes to us through affliction. Have you ever noticed how men
   get their senses clear through affliction? I read in the life of good
   Dr. Brown, that when he first preached he heard two women at the door
   talking to one another about his sermon. One of them said to the
   other--"Ah, 'twas very well, but 'twas almost all tinsel." A short time
   after, the good preacher lost his wife. His heart was broken, and his
   whole nature affected. The roots went deeper down into the solid Truth
   of God, and when he preached again, the same woman said to her
   friend--"It is all gold now."

   Afflicted Christians come to know the difference between tinsel and
   gold. I love a people who do not care always to have great garlands of
   fine flowers handed out to them. Oh, that running after oratory, that
   seeking after fine flowing sentences, that spread-eagle style which
   some adopt--why this is all folly! What the child of God wants is
   matter. He would like to have the matter given him in a good shape, but
   still it is the matter, the real solid food that he wants, and that
   ministry will always be the most acceptable to advanced Believers which
   has the most of Truth in it.

   They do not care half so much about the style as about the food that is
   served up in the sermon. They want something upon which the intellect
   may meditate, which the soul can masticate, which the heart can
   assimilate, and upon which the whole being may be nourished and
   strengthened. Young Christians very frequently like Arminian doctrines.
   But as we grow older, as men who were radicals when they were young
   grow to be conservatives when they are old, so we grow to be
   Calvinistic, for Calvinism is the conservatism of Christianity. It is
   just the conservative principle, the old, solid, stiff, unyielding
   doctrine. Though I am a long way from being anything like old, and do
   not intend to be old if I can help it for another thirty years or so,
   yet still I do find a greater and more intense love for the doctrine of
   election, the doctrine of eternal union to Christ, final perseverance,
   and all those great Truths where saints in all ages have been custom to
   find a haven for their spirits.

   III. And now we must conclude. I think our Apostle meant the text to be
   a GENTLE REBUKE TO THOSE WHO

   ARE NOT FULL GROWN MEN. The Apostle says that the Hebrew saints ought
   to have been teachers, but that they still remained infants.

   It is very pleasant to see the infant in the house. What joy there is
   in its tender cry! But suppose that our children were always to remain
   infants--that would be no happiness to the parent. If you had a son
   twenty years of age who still needed to be carried, who required still
   to hang upon the nurse's breast, would you not consider it one of the
   most serious of calamities? But you say you would pity the child. Ah,
   so you would, but suppose it was his own willful fault? Suppose the
   little one could, by some piece of willfulness, prevent itself from
   growing, and would not use the proper means for development?

   I think you would then wisely use the rod as well as show your pity.
   Twenty years of age, and yet still in long clothes! Thirty years of
   age, and still uttering a babbling cry! Forty years of age, and still
   needing milk! Ah, you smile, but did any of you smile at yourselves?
   How long have you been converted to God? How long have you known the
   Savior? Why, I have known some converts that have been in long clothes
   for thirty years after they were converted and are babies still. If you
   asked them to speak for Christ, they could only say a word or two of
   mere babble.

   And as for their confession of faith, it was not a reason. They did
   declare the hope that was in them, but they did not give a reason for
   it, for they could not give one. Then there are some who grow so slowly
   that their faith is just as weak now as it was twenty years ago. They
   go tottering along and cannot run yet. They will want always to have
   preached to them just the simple elements, and if you give them a piece
   of high doctrine they have not cut their wisdom teeth yet, and
   therefore they cannot masticate it, much less can they get any comfort
   out of it. Have I not seen some who ought to have been as patient as
   Job by this time, as fretful as they can well be?

   Dear Friends, I must just give you a word of rebuke. It must be gently,
   for you are our Brothers and Sisters, and if you are but a babe, if you
   have life in you, you are saved. But why should you always be a babe,
   dear Brother? Is it not that you have been too worldly? You have made
   money--oh, I wish you had made an increase of Divine Grace! You have
   been very attentive to those carts and horses, and to that farm and to
   that speculation--you have attended very diligently to that saleroom
   and to that exchange--oh, if only you had been as diligent in prayer!
   If only you had been as diligent for your Bible as for your ledger--and
   if only you had ridden in the chariots of salvation as often as you
   have been riding your own horse about your farm--how much better a
   Christian you might have been!

   Do you not see, Brothers and Sisters, you have been stinting yourself
   of food? You do not read the Scriptures, which are the food of the
   saints. You have stinted yourself of breath, and if a man is short of
   breath, he will not have much to boast of. If you want to grow, you
   need to pray more. My dear Brothers and Sisters, surely you have
   attached too little importance to these things. You have not considered
   them enough. Why not begin to search the Scriptures? Why not try to
   live nearer to God? Why not pant after a greater conformity to Christ's
   image? Why, what a Christian you might then be! I do ask my Lord often
   this one mercy, not only to make this Church, as it is, the largest
   Church in Christendom, but to be pleased to make us also strong men and
   women.

   Oh, if I can have in this Church a body of strong men and women who
   know what they have received, and hold it fast, and grow in Grace--who
   have their eyes lit up with enthusiasm because hearts are burning with
   a Divine fervor-- why, there is nothing impossible for you! You shall
   make the Church tell upon its age. You shall move London, which is the
   heart of the world, until it shall send out deep heart throbs that
   shall reach throughout the universe! With such multitudes as God adds
   to us continually--what might not be done if we had but the Baptism of
   fire?

   But we must be ready for the fire. We must tarry at Jerusalem and then,
   when the Holy Spirit comes down, we may speak each in his own tongue as
   the Spirit shall give us utterance--and who can tell how mightily we
   may serve the Master? Sunday school teachers, I would not have you
   ordinary teachers who merely set children reading. I would have you
   masters of the art of teaching, who are able to catechize with
   clearness and with power. You young preachers who stand in the
   streets--I would not have it said of you that you can talk but that
   there is nothing in it. You young men in our college--I hope it shall
   never be said of any of you, as you go forth, that you are deficient in
   spiritual intelligence, and that you are unenlightened.

   May you be strong men, my Brothers and Sisters, all of you--and then it
   shall be my happiness to see you like the old guard of
   Napoleon--marching irresistibly into the battle, and this shall be your
   war cry, if bad and evil times shall come--"We can die, but we can
   never surrender." For God and for His Truth you shall make your last
   charge over your enemies, and then enter into the victory which He
   reserves for all them that diligently serve Him.

   I have said nothing to those of you who are unconverted. "One word,"
   says one, "one word. One word." Well, here it is for you--I will give
   you more this evening, but I will give you one word now--"Prepare to
   meet your God!" "But how?" asks one. Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,
   and you shall be saved. Taste and see that the Lord is good. He that
   believes on Him shall never perish, but have everlasting life. To
   believe is to trust. Trust Jesus and be saved. Amen. Amen. Amen.

                 The Power Of Prayer And The Pleasure Of Praise

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 3, 1863, BY THE REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "You also helping together byprayer for us, that for the gift bestowed
   upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our
   behalf. For our rejoicing in this, the testimony of our conscience,
   that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by
   the Grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world and more
   abundantly to you." 2 Corinthians 1:11,12.

   THE Apostle Paul had, by singular Providences, been delivered from
   imminent peril in Asia. During the great riot at Ephesus, when
   Demetrius and his fellow shrine-makers raised a great tumult against
   him, because they saw that their craft was in danger, Paul's life was
   greatly in jeopardy. Consequently he writes, "We were pressed out of
   measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life." The
   Apostle attributes to God, alone, his singular preservation. And if he
   referred also to the occasion when he was stoned and left for dead,
   there is much appropriateness in his blessing "God which raised the
   dead."

   The Apostle, moreover, argues from the fact that God had thus delivered
   him in the past, and was still his helper in the present, that He would
   be with him also in the future. Paul is a master at all arithmetic--his
   faith was always a ready-reckoner--we here find him computing by the
   Believer's Rule of Three. He argues from the past to the present, and
   from the present to things yet to come. The verse preceding our text is
   a brilliant example of this arriving at a comfortable conclusion by the
   Rule of Three--"Who delivered us from so great a death and does
   deliver: in whom we trust that He will yet deliver us."

   Because our God is, "the same yesterday, today and forever," His love
   in time past is an infallible assurance of His kindness today, and an
   equally certain pledge of His faithfulness on the morrow. Whatever our
   circumstances may be, however perplexed may be our pathway, and however
   dark our horizon, if we argue by the rule of, "He has, He does, He
   will," our comfort can never be destroyed. Courage, then, O you
   afflicted seed of Israel. If you had a changeable God to deal with,
   your souls might be full of bitterness--but because He is, "the same
   yesterday, today and forever," every repeated manifestation of His
   Grace should make it more easy for you to rest upon Him. Every renewed
   experience of His fidelity should confirm your confidence in His Grace.
   May the most blessed Spirit teach us to grow in holy confidence in our
   ever faithful Lord.

   Although our Apostle thus acknowledged God's hand, and God's hand
   alone, in his deliverance, yet he was not so foolish as to deny or
   undervalue the second causes. On the contrary, having first praised the
   God of All Comfort, he now remembers with gratitude the earnest prayers
   of the many loving intercessors. Gratitude to God must never become an
   excuse for ingratitude to man. It is true that Jehovah shielded the
   Apostle of the Gentiles, but He did it in answer to prayer. The chosen
   vessel was not broken by the rod of the wicked, for the outstretched
   hand of the God of Heaven was his defense--but that hand was
   outstretched because the people of Corinth, and the saints of God
   everywhere had prevailed at the Throne of Grace by their united
   supplications.

   With gratitude those successful pleadings are mentioned in the text,
   "You also helping together by prayer for us," and he desires the
   Brothers and Sisters now to unite their praises with his, "that for the
   gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given
   by many on our behalf." He adds that he has a claim upon their love
   since he was not as some who were unfaithful to their trust, but his
   conscience was clear that he had preached the Word simply and with
   sincerity.

   While speaking upon these topics, may the anointing Spirit now descend
   to make them profitable to us. We shall, first, acknowledge the power
   of united prayer. Secondly, excite you to united praise. And then, in
   the third place, urge our joyful claim upon you--a claim which is not
   ours alone, but belongs to all ministers of God who in sincerity labor
   for souls.

   I. First, then, dear Friends, it is my duty and my privilege this
   morning to ACKNOWLEDGE THE POWER OF UNITED PRAYER.

   It has pleased God to make prayer the abounding and rejoicing river
   through which most of our choice mercies flow to us. It is the golden
   key which unlocks the well-stored granaries of our heavenly Joseph. It
   is written upon each of the mercies of the Covenant, "For this will I
   be inquired of by the house of Israel to do it for them." There are
   mercies which come unsought, for God is found of them that sought not
   for Him. But there are other favors which are only bestowed upon the
   men who ask, and therefore receive--who seek, and therefore find--who
   knock, and therefore gain an entrance.

   Why God has been pleased to command us to pray at all it is not
   difficult to discover, for prayer glorifies God, by putting man in the
   most humble posture of worship. The creature in prayer acknowledges his
   Creator with reverence and confesses Him to be the giver of every good
   and perfect gift. The eye is lifted up to behold the Glory of the Lord,
   while the knees are bent to the earth in the lowliness of acknowledged
   weakness. Though prayer is not the highest mode of adoration, or
   otherwise it would be continued by the saints in Heaven, yet it is the
   most humble, and so the most fitting, to set forth the Glory of the
   Perfect One as it is beheld by imperfect flesh and blood.

   From the "Our Father," in which we claim relationship, right on to,
   "the kingdom and the power and the glory," which we ascribe to the only
   true God, every sentence of prayer honors the Most High. The groans and
   tears of humble petitioners are as truly acceptable as the continual,
   "Holy, Holy, Holy," of the Cherubim and Seraphim. For in their very
   essence all truthful confessions of personal fault are but a homage
   paid to the Infinite perfections of the Lord of Hosts. More honored is
   the Lord by our prayers than by the unceasing smoke of the holy incense
   of the altar which stood before the veil.

   Moreover, the act of prayer teaches us our unworthiness, which is no
   small blessing to such proud beings as we are. If God gave us favors
   without constraining us to pray for them, we should never know how poor
   we are. But a true prayer is an inventory of wants, a catalog of
   necessities, a suit in forma pauperis, an exposure of secret wounds, a
   revelation of hidden poverty. While it is an application to Divine
   wealth, it is a confession of human emptiness. I believe that the most
   healthy state of a Christian is to be always empty--and always
   depending upon the Lord for supplies. To be always poor in self and
   rich in Jesus--weak as water personally--but mighty through God to do
   great exploits. And therefore the use of prayer--because while it
   adores God, it lays the creature where he should be--in the very dust.

   Prayer is in itself, apart from the answer which it brings, a great
   benefit to the Christian. As the runner gains strength for the race by
   daily exercise, so for the great race of life we acquire energy by the
   hallowed labor of prayer. Prayer plumes the wings of God's young
   eaglets that they may learn to mount above the clouds. Prayer girds the
   loins of God's warriors and sends them forth to combat with their
   sinews braced and their muscles firm. An earnest pleader comes out of
   his closet, even as the sun rises from the chambers of the east,
   rejoicing like a strong man to run his race.

   Prayer is that uplifted hand of Moses which routs the Amalekites more
   than the sword of Joshua. It is the arrow shot from the chamber of the
   Prophet foreboding defeat to the Syrians. What if I say that prayer
   clothes the Believer with the attributes of Deity, girds human weakness
   with Divine strength, turns human folly into heavenly wisdom, and gives
   to troubled mortals the serenity of the immortal God? I know not what
   prayer cannot do! I thank You, great God, for the Mercy Seat, a choice
   gift of Your marvelous loving kindness. Help us to use it aright!

   As many mercies are conveyed from Heaven in the ship of prayer, so
   there are many choice and special favors which can only be brought to
   us by the fleets of united prayer. Many are the good things which God
   will give to His lonely Elijahs and Daniels, but if two of you agree as
   touching anything that you shall ask, there is no limit to God's
   bountiful answers. Peter might never have been brought out of prison if
   it had not been that prayer was made without ceasing by all the Church
   for him. Pentecost might never have come if all the disciples had not
   been, "with one accord in one place," waiting for the descent of the
   tongues of fire. God is pleased to give many mercies to one pleader,
   but at times He seems to say, "You shall all appear before Me and
   entreat My favor, for I will not see your face, unless even your
   younger Brothers and Sisters are with you."

   Why is this, dear Friends? I take it that thus our gracious Lord sets
   forth His own esteem for the communion of saints. "I believe in the
   communion of saints" is one article of the great Christian creed, but
   how few there are who understand it. Oh, there is such a thing as real
   union among God's people. We may be called by different names--

   "But all the servants of our King In Heaven and earth are one."

   We cannot afford to lose the help and love of our Brothers and Sisters.
   Augustine says, "The poor are made for the rich and the rich are made
   for the poor." I do not doubt but that strong saints are made for weak
   saints, and that the weak saints bring special benedictions upon the
   full grown. There is a fitness in the whole body--each joint owes
   something to every other--and the whole body is bound together and
   compacted by that which every joint supplies. There are certain glands
   in the human body which the anatomist hardly understands. He can say of
   the liver, for instance, that it yields a very valuable fluid of the
   utmost value in the bodily economy. But there are other secretions
   whose distinct value he cannot ascertain. Yet , doubtless, if that
   gland were removed, the whole body might suffer to a high degree.

   And so, beloved Friends, there may be some Believers of whom we may
   say, "I do not know the use of them. I cannot tell what good that
   Christian does." Yet were that insignificant, and apparently useless
   member removed, the whole body might be made to suffer, the whole frame
   might become sick, and the whole heart faint. This is probably the
   reason why many a weighty gift of Heaven's love is only granted to
   combined petitioning--that we may perceive the use of the whole body
   and so may be compelled to recognize the real vital union which Divine
   Grace has made--and daily maintains among the people of God. Is it not
   a happy thought, dear Friends, that the very poorest and most obscure
   Church member can add something to the body's strength?

   We cannot all preach. We cannot all rule. We cannot all give gold and
   silver--but we can all contribute our prayers. There is no convert,
   though he is but two or three days old in Divine Grace, but can pray.
   There is no bedridden Sister in Jesus who cannot pray. There is no
   sick, aged, imbecile, obscure, illiterate, or penniless Believer who
   cannot add his supplications to the general stock. This is the Church's
   riches. We put boxes at the door that we may receive your offerings to
   God's cause--remember there is a spiritual chest within the Church into
   which we should all drop our loving intercessions, as into the treasury
   of the Lord. Even the widow without her two mites can give her offering
   to this treasury. See, then, dear Friends, what union and communion
   there are among the people of God, since there are certain mercies
   which are only bestowed while the saints unitedly pray.

   How we ought to feel this bond of union! How we ought to pray for one
   another! How, as often as the Church meets together for supplication,
   should we all make it our bounded duty to be there! I would that some
   of you who are absent from the Prayer Meeting upon any little excuse
   would reflect how much you rob us all. The Prayer Meeting is an
   invaluable institution, ministering strength to all other meetings and
   agencies. Are there not many of you who might, by a little pinching of
   your time and pressing of your labors, come among us a little oftener?
   And what if you should lose a customer now and then, do you not think
   that this loss could be well made up to you by your gains on other
   days? Or if not so, would not the spiritual profit much more than
   counterbalance any little temporal loss? "Not forgetting the assembling
   of yourselves together as the manner of some is."

   We are now prepared for a further observation. This united prayer
   should especially be made for the ministers of God. It is for them,
   peculiarly, that this public prayer is intended. Paul asks for
   it--"Brethren, pray for us." And all God's ministers to the latest time
   will ever confess that this is the secret source of their strength. The
   prayers of the people must be the might of the ministers. Shall I try
   to show you why the minister, more than any other man in the Church,
   needs the earnest prayers of the people? Is not his position the most
   perilous? Satan's orders to the hosts of Hell are, "Fight neither with
   small nor great, save only with the ministers of God." He knows if he
   can once smite through the heart one of these, there will be a general
   confusion. For if the champion is dead, then the people fly.

   It is around the standard bearer that the fight is thickest. There the
   battle-axes ring upon the helmets. There the arrows are bent upon the
   armor, for the enemy knows that if he can cut down the standard, or
   cleave the skull of its bearer, he will strike a heavy blow and cause
   deep discouragement. Press around us, then, you men at arms! Knights of
   the red cross rally for our defense, for the fight grows hot! We
   beseech you, if you elect us to the office of the ministry, stand fast
   at our side in our hourly conflicts. I noticed on returning from
   Rotterdam, when we were crossing the bar at the mouth of the Maas,
   where by reason of a neap tide and a bad wind, the navigation was
   exceedingly dangerous, that orders were issued--"All hands on deck!"

   So methinks the life of a minister is so perilous, that I may well cry,
   "All hands on deck"--every man to prayer! Let even the weakest saint
   become instant in supplication. The minister, standing in such a
   perilous position, has, moreover, a solemn weight of responsibility
   resting on him. Every man should be his brother's keeper in a measure,
   but woe to the watchmen of God if they are not faithful, for at their
   hands shall the blood of souls be required. At their door shall God lay
   the ruin of men if they preach not the Gospel fully and faithfully.

   There are times when this burden of the Lord weighs upon God's
   ministers until they cry out in pain as if their hearts would burst
   with anguish. I marked the captain as we crossed that bar throwing the
   lead, himself, into the sea. And when one asked why he did not let the
   sailors do it, he said, "At this point, just now, I dare not trust any
   man but myself to heave the lead, for we have hardly six inches between
   our ship and the bottom." And, indeed, we felt the vessel touch once or
   twice most unpleasantly. So there will come times with every preacher
   of the Gospel--if he is what he should be-- when he will be in dread
   suspense for his hearers. He will not be able to discharge his duty by
   proxy, but must personally labor for men--not even trusting himself to
   preach--but calling upon his God for help since he is now overwhelmed
   with the burden of men's souls.

   Oh, do pray for us! If God gives us to you, and if you accept the gift
   most cheerfully, do not so despise both God and us as to leave us
   penniless and poverty-stricken because your prayers are withheld.
   Moreover, the preservation of the minister is one of the most important
   objects to the Church. You may lose a sailor from the ship, and that is
   very bad, both for him and for you. But if the pilot should fall over,
   or the captain should be smitten with sickness, or the helmsman be
   washed from the wheel, then what is the vessel to do? Therefore, though
   prayer is to be put up for every other person in the Church, yet for
   the minister is it to be offered first and foremost, because of the
   position which he occupies.

   And then, how much more is asked of him than of you? If you are to keep
   a private table for individual instruction, he is, as it were, to keep
   a public table, a feast of good things for all comers. And how shall he
   do this unless his Master gives him rich provisions? You are to shine
   as a candle in a house--the minister has to be as a lighthouse--to be
   seen far across the deep. And how shall he shine the whole night long
   unless he is trimmed by his Master, and fresh oil is given him from
   Heaven? His influence is wider than yours--if it is for evil, he shall
   be a deadly upas, with spreading boughs poisoning all beneath his
   shadow. But if God makes him a star in His right hand, his ray of light
   shall cheer with its genial influence whole nations, and whole periods
   of time. If there is any truth in all this, I implore you, yield us
   generously and constantly the assistance of your prayers.

   I find that in the original, the word for, "helping together," implies
   very earnest WORK. Some people's prayers have no work in them. But the
   only prayer which prevails with God is a real working-man's
   prayer--where the petitioner, like a Samson, shakes the gates of Mercy,
   and labors to pull them up rather than be denied an entrance. We do not
   want fingertip prayers, which only touch the burden--we need shoulder
   prayers--which bear a load of earnestness, and are not to be denied
   their desire. We do not want those dainty runaway knocks at the door of
   mercy, which professors give when they show off at Prayer Meetings. We
   ask for the knocking of a man who means to have, and means to stop at
   Mercy's gate till it opens and all his need shall be supplied.

   The energetic, vehement violence of the man who is not to be denied,
   but intends to carry Heaven by storm until he wins his heart's
   desire--this is the prayer which ministers covet of their people.
   Melancthon, it is said, derived great comfort from the information that
   certain poor weavers, women and children, had met together to pray for
   the Reformation. Yes, Melancthon--there was solid ground for comfort
   here. Depend on it, it was not Luther only, but the thousands of poor
   persons who sung psalms at the plow-tail, and the hundreds of serving
   men and women who offered supplications, that made the Reformation what
   it was.

   We are told of Paulus Phagius, a celebrated Hebrew scholar, very useful
   in introducing the Reformation into this country, that one of his
   frequent requests of his younger scholars was that they would continue
   in prayer, so that God might be pleased to pour out a blessing in
   answer to them. Have I not said a hundred times that all the blessings
   that God has given us here, all the increase to our Church, has been
   due, under God, to your earnest, fervent supplications? There have been
   Heaven-moving seasons both in this house and at New Park Street. We
   have had times when we have felt we could die sooner than not be heard.
   When we carried our Church on our bosom as a mother carries her child.
   When we felt a yearning and a travailing in birth for the souls of men.

   We may truly say, when we see our Church daily increasing, and the
   multitudes still hanging upon our lips to listen to the Word, "What has
   God worked?" Shall we now cease from our prayers? Shall we now say unto
   the Great High Priest, "It is enough"? Shall we now pluck the glowing
   coals from the altar and quench the burning incense? Shall we now
   refuse to bring the morning and evening lambs of prayer and praise to
   the sacrifice? O children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,
   will you turn your backs in the day of battle? The flood is divided
   before you. The Jordan is driven back! Will you refuse to march through
   the depths? God, even your God, goes up before you. The shout of a King
   is heard in the midst of your hosts!

   Will you now be recreant and refuse to go up and possess the land? Will
   you now lose your first love? Shall "Ich-abod" be written upon the
   forefront of this tabernacle? Shall it be said that God has forsaken
   you? Shall the day come in which the daughters of Philistia shall
   rejoice, and the sons of Syria shall triumph? If not, to your knees
   again, with all the force of prayer! If not, to your vehement
   supplications once more! If not, if you would not see good blighted and
   evil triumphant, clasp hands again--and in the name of Him who ever
   lives to intercede--once more be prevalent in prayer that the blessing
   may again descend! "You also helping together by prayer for us."

   II. We must now EXCITE YOU TO PRAISE. Praise should always follow
   answered prayer. The mist of earth's gratitude should rise as the sun
   of Heaven's love warms the ground. Has the Lord been gracious to you,
   and inclined His ear to the voice of your supplication? Then praise Him
   as long as you live. Deny not a song to Him who has answered your
   prayer, and given you the desire of your heart. To be silent over God's
   mercies is to incur the guilt of shocking ingratitude, and ingratitude
   is one of the worst of crimes.

   I trust, dear Friends, you will not act as basely as the nine lepers,
   who after they had been healed of their leprosy, returned not to give
   thanks unto the healing Lord. To forget to praise God is to refuse to
   benefit ourselves, for praise, like prayer, is exceedingly useful to
   the spiritual man. It is a high and healthful exercise. To dance, like
   David, before the Lord, is to quicken the blood in the veins, and make
   the pulse beat at a healthier rate. Praise gives to us a great feast,
   like that of Solomon, who gave to every man a good piece of flesh, and
   a flagon of wine.

   Praise is the most heavenly of Christian duties. The angels pray not,
   but they cease not to praise both day and night. To bless God for
   mercies received is to benefit our fellow men--"the humble shall hear
   thereof and be glad." Others who have been in like circumstances shall
   take comfort if we can say, "Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let us
   exalt His name together, this poor man cried, and the Lord heard him."
   Tongue-tied Christians are a sad dishonor to the Church. We have some
   such--some whom the devil has gagged--and the loudest music they ever
   make is when they are champing the bit of their silence. I would, my
   Brothers and Sisters, that in all such cases the tongue of the dumb may
   sing.

   To go a step further here. As praise is good and pleasant, blessing man
   and glorifying God, united praise has a very special commendation.
   United praise is like music in concert. The sound of one instrument is
   exceedingly sweet, but when hundreds of instruments, both wind and
   stringed, are all combined, then the orchestra sends forth a noble
   volume of harmony. The praise of one Christian is accepted before God
   like a grain of incense, but the praise of many is like a censor full
   of frankincense smoking up before the Lord. Combined praise is an
   anticipation of Heaven, for in that general assembly they all,
   together, with one heart and voice, praise the Lord--

   "Ten thousand thousand are their tongues, But all their joys are one."

   Public praise is very agreeable to the Christian himself. How many
   burdens has it removed? I am sure when I hear the shout of praise in
   this house it warms my heart. It is at times a little too slow for my
   taste, and I must urge you to quicken your pace, that the rolling waves
   of majestic praise may display their full force! Yet with all
   drawbacks, to my heart there is no music like yours. My Dutch friends
   praise the Lord so very slowly that one might very well go to sleep,
   lulled by their lengthened strains. Even there, however, the many
   voices make a grand harmony of praise.

   I love to hear God's people sing when they really do sing, not when it
   is a drawing out somewhere between harmony and discord. O for a sacred
   song, a shout of lofty praise in which every man's soul beats the time,
   and every man's tongue sounds the tune--and each singer feels a high
   ambition to excel his fellow in gratitude and love! There is something
   exceedingly delightful in the union of true hearts in the worship of
   God--and when these hearts are expressed in song-- how sweet the
   charming sounds. I think we ought to have a Praise Meeting once a week.
   We have a Prayer Meeting every Monday, and a Prayer Meeting every
   Saturday, and a Prayer Meeting every morning, but why do we not have a
   Praise Meeting? Surely seasons should be set apart for services made up
   of praise from beginning to end. Let us try the plan at once.

   As I said about united prayer, that it should be offered specially for
   ministers, so should united praise often take the same aspect. The
   whole company should praise and bless God for the mercy rendered to the
   Church through its pastors. Hear how our Apostle puts it again--"That
   for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons, thanks may
   be given by many on our behalf." Brethren, we ought to praise God for
   good ministers that they live--for when they die much of their work
   dies with them. It is astonishing how a reformation will press on while
   Luther and Calvin live, and how it will cease as soon as the reformers
   die.

   The spirits of good men are immortal only in a sense. The Churches of
   God in this age are like the Israelites in the times of the Judges.
   When the judges died they went after graven images again. And it is so
   now. While God spares the man, the Church prospers, but when the man
   dies, the zeal which he blew to a flame smolders among the ashes in
   nine cases out of ten, if not in ninety-nine out of every hundred. The
   prosperity of a Church rests on the minister's life. God so ordains it
   to humble us. There should be gratitude, then, for spared life.

   But there should be great gratitude for preserved character, for oh,
   when a minister falls, what a disgrace it is! Why, when you read in the
   police reports the sad case of the Rev. Mr._, who chose to call himself
   a Baptist minister, everybody says, "What a shocking thing! What a bad
   set the Baptists must be." Now, any fool in the world may call himself
   a Baptist minister. Our liberty is so complete that no law or order
   exists. Any man who can get a dozen to listen to him preach is a
   minister, at least to them. Therefore you cannot suppose but what there
   will be some hypocrites who will take the name in order to get some
   sort of reputation.

   If the true minister is kept and made to hold fast his integrity, there
   should be constant gratitude to God on his behalf. If the minister is
   kept well supplied with goodly matter. If he is like a springing well.
   If God gives him to bring out of His treasury things both new and old
   to feed His people, there should be hearty thanks. And if he is kept
   sound, if he goes not aside to philosophy on the one hand, nor to a
   narrowness of doctrine on the other, there should be thanksgiving
   there. If God gives to the masses the will to hear him, and above all,
   if souls are converted and saints are edified, there should be
   never-ceasing honor and praise to God.

   Ah, I am talking now about what you all know, and you just nod your
   heads to it, and think there is not much in it. But if you were made to
   live in Holland for a little time you would soon appreciate these
   remarks. While traveling there, I stayed in houses with godly men--men
   of God with whom I could hold sweet communion--who cannot attend what
   was once their place of worship. Why not? "Sir," they say, "can I go to
   a place of worship when the most of the ministers deny every Word of
   Scripture? Not those of the Reformed Church only, but of every sect in
   Holland! How can I listen to the traitors who swear to the Calvinistic
   or Lutheran articles, and then go into the pulpit and deny the reality
   of the resurrection, or assert that the ascension of Jesus is a mere
   spiritual parable?"

   I find that in the Netherlands they are fifty years in advance of us in
   infidelity. We shall soon catch up with them if gentlemen of a certain
   school I know of are suffered to multiply. The Dutch Divines have taken
   great strides in Neologism, till now the people love the Truth of God
   and there are multitudes that are willing to hear it. But these are
   compelled absolutely to refuse to go to Church at all, lest by any
   means they should give countenance to the heretical and false doctrines
   which are preached to them every Sunday.

   Ah, if God were once to take away from England the ministers who preach
   the Gospel boldly and plainly, you would cry to God to give you the
   candlestick back again. We may indeed say of England--

   "With all your faults I love you still." We have a colonial bishop who
   avows his unbelief. We have a few men of all denominations who are
   quietly sliding from the Truth. But, thank God they are nothing as of
   yet. They are but as a drop in a bucket compared to the Churches of
   Christ, and those among us who are not quite as Calvinistic as we might
   wish. I thank God, there are many who never dispute the inspiration of
   Scripture, nor doubt the great Truth of justification by faith. We have
   still preserved among us men that are faithful to God, and preach the
   whole Truth as it is in Jesus.

   Be thankful for your ministers, I say again, for if you were placed
   where some Believers are, you would cry out to your God--"Lord, send us
   back Your Prophets. Send us a famine of bread or a famine of water, but
   send us not a famine of the Word of God!"

   I ask for myself this morning, as your minister, your thanksgivings to
   be mingled with mine in praising God for the help which He has
   vouchsafed to me in the very arduous work of the last fortnight. Praise
   be to God for the acceptance which He gave me in that country among all
   ranks of the people. I speak to His praise and not to mine, for this
   has been a vow with me, that if God will give me a harvest, I will not
   have an ear of corn of it, but He shall have it all. I found, in all
   the places where I went, great multitudes of people, crowds who could
   not understand the preacher, but who wanted to see his face, because
   God had blessed his translated sermons to their souls.

   Multitudes gave me the grip of brotherly kindness and, with tears in
   their eyes, invoked, in the Dutch language, every blessing upon my
   head. I hoped to preach to some fifties and hundreds, and instead of
   that, there were so many that the great cathedrals were not too large.
   This surprised me, and made me glad--and caused me to rejoice in
   God--and I ask you to rejoice with me. I thank God for the acceptance
   which He gave me among all ranks of the people. While the poor crowded
   to shake hands, till they almost pulled me in pieces, it pleased God to
   move the heart of the Queen of Holland to send for me, and for an hour
   and a quarter I was privileged to talk with her concerning the things
   which make for our peace.

   I sought no interview with her. It was her own wish. And then I lifted
   up my soul to God that I might talk of nothing but Christ, and might
   preach to her of nothing but Jesus. And so it pleased the Master to
   help me. And I left that very amiable lady, not having shunned to
   declare the whole counsel of God. Gratified was I, indeed, to find
   myself received cordially by all denominations, so that on the Saturday
   at Amsterdam I preached in the Mennonite Church in the morning, and at
   the Old Dutch Reformed Church in the evening. The next Sunday morning
   in the English Presbyterian Church, and then again, in the evening, in
   the Dutch Free Church.

   Sometimes I was allowed to preach in the great cathedrals, as in the
   Dom Kirk at Utrecht, and in Peter's Kirk, at Leyden, not having the
   poor only, but the nobility and the gentry of the land, who, of course,
   could understand English better than most of the poor, who have had no
   opportunity of learning it. I felt, while going from town to town, the
   Master helping me continually to preach. I never knew such elasticity
   of spirit, such bounding of heart in my life before. And I come back,
   not wearied and tired, though preaching twice every day, but fuller of
   strength and vigor than when I first set out!

   I give God the glory for the many souls I have heard of who have been
   converted through the reading of the printed sermons, and for the
   loving blessings of those who followed us to the water's edge with many
   tears, saying to us--"Do your diligence to come again before winter,"
   and urging us once more to preach the Word in that land. There may be
   mingled with this some touch of egotism. The Lord knows whether it is
   so or not, but I am not conscious of it. I do praise and bless His
   name, that in a land where there is so much philosophy, He has helped
   me to preach His Truth so simply, that I never uttered a word as a mere
   doctrinalist, but I preached Christ and nothing but Christ. Rejoice
   with me, my dear Brothers and Sisters. I must have you rejoice in it,
   or if you will not, I must rejoice alone, but my loaf of praise is too
   great for me to eat it all.

   III. And we come to a close. I have to urge THE JOYFUL CLAIMS which the
   Apostle gives in the twelfth verse, as a reason WHY THERE SHOULD BE
   PRAYER AND PRAISE. "For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our
   conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly
   wisdom, but by the Grace of God, we have had our conversation in the
   world and more abundantly to you."

   Ah, after all, a man's comfort must come, next to the finished
   salvation of God, from the testimony of his own conscience. And to a
   minister, what a testimony it is that he has preached the Gospel in
   simplicity, to which there are two senses-- preached it not with
   double-mindedness--saying one thing and meaning another. And he has
   preached it, not as oarsmen row--looking one way and pulling
   another--but preached it meaning what he said, having a single heart,
   desiring God's Glory and the salvation of men.

   And what a blessing to have preached it simply, that is to say, without
   hard words, without polished phrases, never studying elocutionary
   graces, never straining after oratorical embellishments. How accursed
   must be the life of a man who profanes the pulpit to the dignity of
   eloquence! How desperate will be his deathbed when he remembers that he
   made an exhibition of his powers of speech rather than of the solid
   things which make for the winning of souls! That conscience may well be
   easy that can speak of having dealt with God's Truth in simplicity.

   The Apostle says, also, that he had preached it with sincerity. That
   is, he had preached it meaning it, feeling it--preached it so that none
   could accuse him of being false. The Greek word has something in it of
   sunlight, and he is the true minister of God who preaches what he would
   wish to have hung up in the sunlight, or who has the sunlight shining
   right through him. I am afraid we are none of us like white glass--most
   of us are colored a little--but he is happy who seeks to get rid of the
   coloring matter as much as possible, so that the light of the Gospel
   may shine right straight, clear as it comes from the Sun of
   Righteousness, through him.

   Paul had preached with simplicity and sincerity. And he adds, "Not with
   fleshly wisdom." Oh, what stories have I heard of what fleshly wisdom
   will do! And I have learned a lesson during the last fortnight which I
   would that England would learn. There are three schools of theological
   error over yonder, and each one leaps over the back of its fellow. Some
   of them hold that all the facts of Scripture are only myths. Others of
   them say that there are some good things in the Bible, though there are
   a great many mistakes. And others go further still, and fling the whole
   Bible away altogether as to its Inspiration, though they still preach
   it, and still lean on it, saying that they do that merely for the
   edification of the vulgar--merely holding it up for the sake of the
   masses--though I ought to add merely to get their living as well.

   Sad! Sad! Sad that the Church has gone to such a length as that--the
   Old Dutch Reformed Church--the very mirror of Calvinism, standing fast
   and firm in its creeds to all the doctrines we love, and yet gone
   astray to latitudinarian and licentious liberty. Oh, how earnestly
   should we decry fleshly wisdom! I am afraid, dear Friends, that
   sometimes some of you, when you hear a minister, like him to put it
   pretty well, and you find fault unless he shows some degree of talent.
   I wonder whether that is not a sin? I am half inclined to think it is.

   I sometimes think whether we ought not to look less every day to
   talent, and more and more to the matter of the Gospel that is preached.
   Whether if a man is blessed with elocutionary power we may, perhaps, be
   more profited by him--whether that is not a weakness. Whether we had
   not better go back to the days of fishermen once again, and give men no
   sort of education whatever, but just send them to preach the Truth of
   God simply. This, rather than go the length they are now going, giving
   men, I know not what, of all sorts of learning that is of no earthly
   use to them, but which only helps them to pervert the simplicity of
   God. I love that word in my text--"Not with fleshly wisdom."

   And now I lay my claim, as my conscience bears me witness--I lay my
   claim to this boasting of our Apostle. I have preached God's Gospel in
   simplicity. I do not know how I can preach it more simply, nor can I
   more honestly declare it. I have preached it sincerely--the Searcher of
   all hearts knows that. And I have not preached it with fleshly wisdom,
   and that for one excellent reason--that I have not any--and have been
   compelled to keep to the simple testimony of the Lord. But if I have
   done anything, it has been done by the Grace of God.

   If any success has been achieved, it has been Divine Grace that has
   done it all. "And more especially to you." For though our word has gone
   forth to many lands, and our testimony belts the globe, yet, "more
   especially to you." You have we warned. You have we entreated. You have
   we exhorted. With you have we pleaded. Over you have we wept. For you
   have we prayed. To some of you we have been a spiritual parent in
   Christ. To many of you as a nursing father. To many of you as a teacher
   and an edifier in the Gospel. And we hope to all of you a sincere
   friend in Christ Jesus. Therefore do I claim your prayers--yours more
   than any other people's.

   And though there will be not a few who will remember us in their
   supplications, I do conjure you, inasmuch as it has been, "especially
   to you," let me especially have your prayers. Some will say that it is
   unkind even for me to suppose that you do not pray. Well, I do not so
   suppose it out of unkindness, but there may be some who forget--some
   who forget to plead. Oh, do pray for me still! The whole congregation
   is not saved yet. There are some that hear us that are not yet
   converted. Plead with God for their sakes. There are some hard hearts
   unbroken! Ask God to make the hammer strike. And while there are some
   still unmelted, pray God to make the Word like a fire!

   This great London needs to be stirred from end to end. Pray for all
   your ministers, that God may make them mighty. The Church wants more
   still of the loud voice of God to wake it from its sleep. Ask God to
   bless all His sent servants. Plead with Him with Divine energy, that so
   His kingdom may come, and His will may be done on earth as it is in
   Heaven.

   O that you all believed in Jesus! For until you do, you cannot pray nor
   praise! O that you all believed in Jesus! Remember, this is the only
   way of salvation. Trust Jesus, for he that believes on Him is not
   condemned, but he that believes not is condemned already, because he
   believes not on the Son of God. Trust Jesus and you shall be saved. May
   Christ accept you now, for His own love's sake. Amen.

               Comfort To Seekers From What The Lord Has Not Said

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 10, 1863, BY THE REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not
   unto the seed of Jacob, Seek you Me in vain." Isaiah 45:19.

   WE might gain much solace by considering what God has not said. What He
   has said is inexpressibly full of comfort and delight. What He has not
   said is scarcely less rich in consolation. It was one of these, "said
   nots," which preserved the kingdom of Israel in the days of Jeroboam,
   the son of Joash. "The Lord said not that He would blot out the name of
   Israel from under Heaven" (2 Kings 14:27). In our text we have an
   assurance that God will answer prayer, because He has, "not said unto
   the seed of Israel, Seek you My face in vain." You who write bitter
   things against yourselves, I would have you remember that. Let your
   doubts and fears say what they will, if God has not cut you off from
   mercy, there is no room for despair--even the voice of conscience is of
   little weight if it is not seconded by the voice of God.

   What God has said tremble at! But suffer not your own fears and
   suspicions to overwhelm you with despondency and sinful despair. Many
   timid persons have been vexed by the suspicion that there may be
   something in God's decree which shuts them out from all hope--some
   secret, written in the great roll of destiny, which renders it certain
   that if they did pray and seek the Lord--He would not be found of them.
   Our text is a complete refutation to that troublesome fear. "I have not
   spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth. I have not said," even
   in the secret of My unsearchable decree, "Seek you My face in vain."
   The decrees are "spoken in secret"--the decrees are hidden as, "in a
   dark place of the earth."

   But it is absolutely certain that the Lord has said nothing in any of
   them, or anywhere else, which can be interpreted to mean, "Seek you My
   face in vain." Oh, no, Brothers and Sisters, that Truth which God has
   so clearly revealed, that He will hear the prayer of those who call
   upon Him, cannot be contravened by anything which God may have spoken
   elsewhere. He has so firmly, so truthfully, so righteously spoken that
   there can be no equivocation. He does not, like the Sibyls, speak
   mysteriously with a double tongue. Nor does He, like the Delphic
   oracle, reveal His mind in unintelligible words. No, our God speaks
   plainly and positively, "Ask, and you shall receive."

   O that all of you would accept this sure Truth of God--that prayer must
   and shall be heard, and that never, even in the secrets of eternity,
   never, even in the council chamber of the Covenant--has the Lord said
   unto any living soul, "Seek you My face in vain."

   The proposition I come to deal with this morning is this--that those
   who seek God, through Jesus Christ, in God's own appointed way, cannot,
   by any possibility, seek Him in vain. That earnest, penitent, prayerful
   hearts, though they may be delayed for a time, can never be sent away
   with a final denial. "He that calls upon the name of the Lord shall be
   saved. He that seeks, finds. He that asks, receives. Unto him that
   knocks it shall be opened." I shall prove this, first, by the negative,
   as our text has it--"I have not said, Seek you Me in vain." And then,
   briefly, by the positive. Oh, may God give us His Holy Spirit, that
   while I am preaching, comfort may be given to many troubled hearts.

   I. First, then, BY THE NEGATIVE. It is not possible that a man should
   sincerely, in God's own appointed way, seek for mercy and eternal life
   and not find it. It is not possible that a man should earnestly, from
   his heart, pray unto God, and yet a gracious answer be finally refused.
   And that for several reasons.

   1. We will suppose the case--suppose that sincere prayer could be
   fruitless--then the question arises, Why, then, are men exhorted to
   pray at all? If prayer is not heard, if supplication may possibly end
   in a failure, why does God so constantly, so earnestly, so strenuously
   constrain and command men to call upon Him? Would it not be a heartless
   cruelty on my part, if I saw a poor farmer who could not pay his way,
   if I exhorted him to plow upon a rock, and scatter the little seed he
   had upon soil where I knew it could never grow? Or if a king imposed
   upon his poor subject a law that he should plow the seashore, and
   harrow it, and exercise all the arts of husbandry upon it--when he was
   perfectly aware that not a single grain could ever bless the farmer's
   toil?

   What would you think of any man who should advise a thirsty wretch to
   pump an empty well? Suppose some sovereign should enjoin it upon his
   subject, seeing he is ready to die of thirst, to let the bucket down
   where there is no water and to continue to do it without ceasing--to be
   always letting down the bucket and always winding it up--with the
   absolute certainty that no good can come of it! And do you think that
   God, who commands men to pray and not to faint, would bid them do it,
   if no harvest could be reaped from it? Does He tell them to continue in
   prayer, to, "pray without ceasing"--to watch unto prayer, to arise in
   the night watches and cry unto Him--and yet, after all, has He settled
   it that He will be deaf to their entreaties and despise their cries?

   Would it not be a piece of heartless tyranny if the Queen should wait
   upon a man in his condemned cell and encourage him to petition her
   favor, no, command him to do it, saying to him, "If I do not send you
   at once an answer, send another petition and another. Send to me seven
   times, yes, continue to do it, and never cease so long as you live. Be
   importunate and you will prevail." And what if the Queen should tell
   the man the story of the importunate widow, should describe to him the
   case of the man, who, by perseverance, obtained the three loaves for
   his weary friend? And then say to him, "Even so, if you ask you shall
   receive"? And yet all the while should intend never to pardon the man,
   but had determined in her heart that his death warrant should be signed
   and sealed and that on the execution morning he should be launched into
   eternity?

   I ask you, Brothers and Sisters, whether this were consistent with
   royal bounty, whether this were fit conduct for a gracious monarch. And
   can you for a moment suppose that God would bid you, as He does each
   one of you, to seek His face--would He bid you come to Him through
   Jesus Christ--and yet, secretly in His heart, intend never to be
   gracious at the voice of your cry?

   2. Further, for a second argument--if prayer could be offered
   continuously, and God could be sought earnestly-- but no mercy found,
   then he who prays would be worse off than he who does not pray. And
   supplication would be an ingenious invention for increasing the ills of
   mankind. For a man who does not pray has less woes than a man who does
   pray, if God is not the Answerer of prayer. The man who prays is made
   to hunger--shall he hunger, and not eat! Were it not, then, better
   never to hunger? How, then, can it be said, "Blessed are they that
   hunger and thirst after righteousness"? The man who prays, thirsts. As
   the hart pants after the water brooks, so he pants after his God.

   But if God will never give him the living water to drink, is not a
   thirsty soul much more wretched than one who never learned to thirst at
   all? He who has been taught to pray has great desires and wants. His
   heart is an aching void which the world can never fill. But he that
   never prays has no longings after God. He that never makes supplication
   feels no ungratified desires after eternal things. If, then, a man may
   have these vehement longings, and yet God will never grant them, then
   assuredly the man who prays is in a worse position than he who prays
   not.

   How can this be? Has God so constituted the world that virtue shall
   entail misery, and that vice shall engender happiness? Can it be, while
   God is the moral Ruler of the universe, that He will reward the man who
   forgets Him, and will pour misery into the soul of the man who
   earnestly seeks His face? It is blasphemy to suppose it! The beasts in
   the field do not lament that they are not immortal, for they never had
   aspirations after immortality. A gracious God has limited their
   ambition to their attainments--but if the ox could groan after Heaven,
   if the sheep could pray for a resurrection-- it were a wretched
   creature, indeed, to be denied these things.

   So the ungodly man, like the beast of the field, has no longing after
   God's favor. He has no yearnings after eternal life, no desire to be
   conformed to the image of Christ--and his ambitions are so far limited
   to what he gains. But shall it be that a soul shall pant to be like
   God, shall thirst to be reconciled to his Maker, shall hunger even to
   faintness, that he may find, "peace with God through Jesus Christ," and
   yet shall such desires as these be only given to make him wretched? I
   cannot suppose such a thing! The absurdity of imagining that the man
   who does pray, would be by God put in a worse position than the man who
   does not, seems to me to be at once convincing that the earnest,
   faithful prayer shall certainly, through the merit of Christ, prevail
   with God.

   3. But I go a step further. If God does not hear prayer, since it is
   clear that in that case the praying man would be more wretched than the
   careless sinner, then it would follow that God would be the Author of
   unnecessary misery. Now we know that this is inconsistent with the
   Character of our God. We look around the world and we see punishment
   for sin, but no punishment for good desires. We discover that the Fall
   has brought us loss and ruin. And we know that there is a dreadful Hell
   where justice shall be executed to the uttermost.

   But I see no chamber of arbitrary torture, where God, the Almighty,
   takes pleasure in the undeserved pangs and unmerited groans of His own
   creatures! I do not see a single invention made by God to give pain
   unnecessarily. I find not a joint of my body, no, not a sinew or a
   muscle, that is intended to cause me anguish. They may all be racked
   with aches and pains, since I am a fallen, sinful man. But the body was
   not organized with a view to pain, but for pleasure. And do you think
   that God would ingeniously put up a Mercy Seat to increase human misery
   by a mockery of Divine Grace, a mimicry of bounty?

   Do you dream that He would send out commands to men, obedience to which
   would entail upon them greater sorrow than disobedience could bring? Do
   you think that He would woo them with outstretched hands to be more
   wretched than they were before? Would He be so false and heartless as
   to bid them come, knowing that their coming would only make them
   ten-fold more unhappy than they were already, because He did not intend
   to accept them when they did come? He that can think thus of my God
   does not know Him. He who could dream that it is possible for Him to
   invite and incite in you the prayer He has promised to hear, and yet,
   after all, would reject it, must surely be comparing Jehovah to
   Juggernaut. He knows not what Jehovah is.

   Know you not that prayer, itself, is the work of God? Prayer is not the
   act of the creature, but the work of the Creator. Prayer is God in man
   coming back to God. Prayer is the fruit of Divine life. And do you
   believe that God would Himself write upon the human heart prayers which
   He did not intend to hear? Do you think the Holy Spirit would dictate
   petitions which God, the Eternal Father, had determined to reject? No,
   no, no! We must, from this negative way of reasoning, be persuaded that
   our God will hear and answer prayer.

   4. Should there still be some desponding ones, who think that God would
   invite them to pray and yet reject them, I would put it on another
   ground. Would men do so? Would even you, full of sin though you are, so
   treat your own fellow creature? I know that we should hold up to scorn
   any rich man who should say to beggars in the streets, "I live in
   such-and-such a place. It is six miles off. If you will all come
   tomorrow morning at eight o'clock and knock at my door, repeating my
   son's name, I will supply your wants." And what if, when he had
   collected the poor beggars, he should let them stand and knock
   according to his bidding till they were weary and never grant them an
   answer?

   If he should let them know that there was bread within the house, but
   not a morsel for them, we should say, "Well, if men must make
   themselves merry with practical jokes, let them not be carried out upon
   the poor and needy. Let them find some other victims, and let not the
   helpless mendicants of the streets be the victims of such foolish
   mirth." And shall it be possible for my God to be less generous than
   men?

   Do we not find continually, if there is an hospital opened to relieve
   the sick, or to heal the maimed, that when much injured persons make an
   application they are received? I know not that there are any peculiar
   hearts of compassion in those who have the oversight of the hospital,
   but I do know this--there is so much of the milk of human kindness in
   their bosoms, that the moment a poor wretch is brought to the door
   almost dead--if it were a slighter case they might take some
   exception--the very desperateness of the case throws open the hospital
   door, and at once the patient is admitted.

   Man is in such a case, near to die, no, condemned and utterly ruined by
   his sin--and I do not believe that my God will shut His door in the
   face of misery. Rather, I am persuaded that the very desperateness of
   the case will make an appeal to His heart and He will fulfill His
   promise. It is a low ground to put it on, I will admit, for God is
   infinitely more loving than man. "As the heavens are higher than the
   earth, so are His ways higher than our ways, and His thoughts than our
   thoughts." And if a man would not reject the supplication which he had
   himself invited--if a man's heart would be moved to pity by the cry of
   misery--much more the heart of the All-Bounteous God, whose very name
   is Love, and whose Nature it is to give liberally without upbraiding. I
   am persuaded, therefore, that He must, and will hear prayer.

   5. Yet further--have you forgotten that this is God's memorial, by
   which He is distinguished from the false gods? "They have ears, but
   they hear not, hands have they, but they help not their worshippers.
   And feet have they, but they come not to the rescue of their votaries.
   But our God made the heavens, and this is His memorial, the God that
   hears prayer." Has not David put it--"O You that hear prayer, unto You
   shall all flesh come"? One of the standing proofs of the Deity of
   Jehovah is that He does, to this day, answer the supplications of His
   people.

   But suppose that any one among you could seek His face day after day,
   week after week, and month after month, and yet He should refuse
   you--where would His memorial be? O if yonder poor sinner, with tears
   and plaintive cries were really to besiege the Mercy Seat in the name
   of Jesus, and God, the Almighty Father, should refuse him and drive him
   away, I say, where is the boasted name of God? I grant you, the answer
   may tarry, but only that it may be the more sweet when it comes. I know
   the ships of Heaven may be long upon the voyage, but only that they may
   bring a richer cargo to you.

   But come they must. "If the vision tarry, wait for it. It shall come.
   It shall not tarry." For otherwise, I say, where is the glory of God?
   How is He distinguished above Baal? How is He exalted above the gods of
   the heathen? Did not Elijah put it to the test? The priests of Baal
   cried--they cut themselves with knives. From morning to evening their
   shrieks went up to Heaven and the sarcastic Prophet said, "Cry aloud,
   for he is a god! Perhaps he is on a journey, or he sleeps and must be
   awakened." All day long the lancers drew forth priestly blood. But no
   voice came from Baal.

   Clear the stage and let God's servant come. He lifts his hands to
   Heaven and cries--"Lord God of Abraham, Isaac and of Israel, let it be
   known this day that You are God in Israel, and that I am Your servant,
   and that I have done all these things at Your word. Hear me, O Lord,
   hear me, that this people may know that You are the Lord God, and that
   You have turned their heart back again." Down falls the fire of the
   Lord, consuming not only the bullock, but the stones of the altar and
   the water in the trench! For our God does hear prayer.

   Now do you see, Soul, that your despair, when you say He will not hear
   you, really takes away from God one of His grandest titles? You do Him
   a serious dishonor in supposing that He will refuse to hear you. You
   cast mire upon the escutcheon of Deity, and think unworthily of the
   Most High when you imagine for an instant that He would teach you to
   pray, and come to Him through the blood of Christ--and yet refuse to
   hear the voice of your groaning.

   6. Surely these arguments might well suffice. But if unbelief has as
   many lives as a cat, as John Bunyan says, I will deal it the full nine
   blows and one over, to make assurance doubly sure.

   If God does not hear prayer--suppose such to be the case for a
   moment--then I want to know--what are the meaning of His promises? I
   ask, with all reverence, how He shall make His veracity to be proved,
   if He does not answer His people? Let me give you one or two of His own
   promises--"Call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver you,
   and you shall glorify Me." "He shall call upon Me and I will answer
   him." What does this mean, by the mouth of Isaiah--"He will be very
   gracious unto you at the voice of your cry. When He shall hear it, He
   will answer you." That is neither more nor less than a falsehood, if
   God does not hear prayer.

   What about this splendid passage--"And it shall come to pass, that
   before they call I will answer, and while they are yet speaking I will
   hear"? And this by Zechariah--"They shall call on My name and I will
   hear them. I will say, It is My people and they shall say, The Lord is
   my God"? Can there be words plainer than these, from the lips of the
   Savior-- "Ask and it shall be given you. Seek and you shall find, knock
   and it shall be opened to you. For everyone that asks receives, and he
   that seeks finds. And to him that knocks it shall be opened"? Or these,
   "If you, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
   children, how much more shall your Father which is in Heaven give good
   things to them that ask him?"

   And what is the meaning of this great promise--"And all things,
   whatsoever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive"? Are
   not these so many arrows shot at the very heart of unbelief? I begin at
   that ancient writing, the Book of Job. "He shall pray unto God, and he
   will be favorable unto Him, and he shall see His face with joy." The
   Psalms are crowded with such promises, and even the Prophet Joel, who
   is full of thunder and lightning--even he says, "Whosoever shall call
   upon the name of the Lord shall be delivered"--which the Apostle Paul,
   in the Epistle to the Romans, varies a little, and puts it--"For
   whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."

   Even James, who is all practical, and very little comforting, cannot
   get through the Epistle without saying, "Draw near to God and He will
   draw near to you." Why, even under the old Law, Deuteronomy had a
   promise like this--"If you shall seek the Lord your God, you shall find
   Him, if you seek Him with all your heart and with all your soul." Under
   the rule of the kings, we find it written, "If you seek Him, He will be
   found of you." So might I go on quoting promises, until you were weary
   with hearing my voice. But, my dear Friends, I ask you, if God does not
   hear prayer, after saying what I have repeated to you, where is His
   truthfulness?

   He must be true, if every man is a liar--God's own Word must
   stand--though Heaven and earth should pass away. Like flowers, you
   nations, you shall die. Like a dream, you kingdoms, you shall melt.
   Like a shadow, O you mountains, you shall dissolve. Like a wreck, O
   earth, you shall be broken into pieces. Like a worn out gesture, O you
   heavens, you shall be rolled up. But every Word of God is sure and
   steadfast, "yes, and amen in Christ Jesus." "The voice said, Cry. And I
   said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass and all the goodliness
   thereof is as the flower of the field. The grass withers and the flower
   thereof fades away. But the Word of the Lord endures forever." How can
   we find arguments stronger than this?

   7. Another stroke. If God has virtually said to us, "Pray, but I will
   never hear you. Seek My face in vain," then I ask, what is the meaning
   of all the provisions which He has already made for hearing prayer? I
   see a way to God. It is paved with stones inlaid in the fair crimson of
   the Savior's blood. I see a door. It is the wounded side of Jesus. Why
   was that blood shed, if God hears not prayer? Why that side rent if,
   after all, the veil still shuts out from access to the Mercy Seat?
   Moreover, in Heaven I see a Mediator between God and man. But why a
   Mediator, if God will not be at peace with man nor hear his prayer?

   Moreover, I see an Intercessor. I see the Son of God stretch His
   wounded hands, and point to His side, wearing the jeweled breastplate
   on His forefront. But why the breastplate, and why the High Priest, if
   prayer is a futile thing, and God has said, "Seek you My face in vain"?
   Moreover, I see all the marvelous transactions of the Covenant from
   first to last. And I ask, Why all this, if it is not meant for sinners
   who seek His face? Moreover, I see the blessed Spirit. He, Himself,
   condescends to dwell in us, and make, "intercession for us with
   groaning which cannot be uttered." And I ask of you, O Melancholy and
   Despair, why was this Spirit sent? Why this blood shed? Why this Savior
   ordained and exalted on high, "to give repentance and remission of
   sins," if remission is never to be given, repentance never to be
   accepted and intercession never to be heard?

   By every wound of Jesus I beg you, Sinner, to believe that God will
   hear you! By every drop of that precious blood, by every cry of those
   dying lips, by every tear of those languid eyes, by every smart of that
   bruised back, by every jewel of that crown of glory, by every precious
   stone upon that priestly breastplate, by every honor which God the
   Father has bestowed upon our Lord Jesus--yes, by all the power of the
   blessed Spirit, by all the energy with which He raised Christ from the
   dead, by all the "power" with which He is acknowledged to be God--I do
   beg you to never doubt but that God will in due time be gracious to the
   voice of your cry.

   8. Still to pursue this dying foe, whom methinks we might have slain
   outright by this time, I use the argument which the Apostle uses upon
   the resurrection. If God does not hear prayer, what Gospel have I to
   preach? As the Apostle said, concerning the resurrection, "Then is our
   preaching vain and your faith is also vain. You are yet in your sins."
   If God does not hear prayer, I say, our preaching is in vain. We are
   sent to tell men that, "though their sins are as scarlet, they shall be
   as wool. Though they are red like crimson, they shall be whiter than
   snow"--if they will turn from their evil ways, and seek the Lord.

   But if they can turn, and yet not be accepted, I, for my part, renounce
   my commission, for I have not a Gospel that is worth the preaching. And
   surely you would say, "It is not a Gospel worth our acceptance." If
   prayer, offered in Jesus' name, is not accepted, taking Paul's line of
   argument, then Christ is not accepted. If the sinner's plea, "for
   Jesus' sake," is not heard, then is Christ not heard? And if Christ is
   not heard and accepted, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith
   is in vain. Yes, and we are found false witnesses for God, because we
   have testified of God that He hears the intercession of Jesus, whom He
   hears not if He hear not those who plead His name.

   9. Further, my Brothers and Sisters--and here we strike the ninth
   blow--if this could be removed, where is the Believer's hope? Hang the
   heavens in sackcloth, let the sun be turned to darkness, let the moon
   become a clot of blood if the Mercy Seat can be proved to be a mockery!
   Oh, if God would let His people cry and not be gracious, better for us
   that we had never been born! The most happy saint, in his best moment,
   would be as wretched as the damned in Hell, if he were persuaded that
   God did not, and could not, hear prayer.

   What would we have to comfort us in our hours of trouble, what to
   strengthen us in our times of labor, what refuge from the storm, what
   cover from the heat? Where, where, my Brothers and Sisters, could we
   fly, if the Throne of Grace were a fiction? Heaven, surely, is shut,
   when the gate of prayer is shut. Surely every blessing will pass away
   at once, when prayer ceases to avail. The ladder which Jacob saw would
   be drawn up into Heaven, and from now on, there would be no communion
   between God and man. Glory be to God, such a thing cannot be! Sinner,
   you think that God would never hurt His saints, but that He would
   reject you. But see, if He refuses to hear you, the rule is broken, and
   the rule, being once broken--there being one exception--the whole
   stability of the saints' comfort is removed at a blow.

   10. I close this negative view of the subject by asking, in the tenth
   place, What would they say in Hell if a soul could really seek the Lord
   and be refused? Oh, the unholy merriment of devils! "Here's a soul,"
   says one, "that perished, though it prayed! Here's a hand that touched
   the hem of Jesus' garment, but that garment did not heal! Here are lips
   scorched with burning fire which once were warm with living prayer."
   Methinks they would drag such a one in triumph through the streets of
   Tophet. They would crowd the thoroughfares to look on. And oh, what
   dread acclaim of scorn!

   What thundering laughter would go up! "Aha! Aha! Aha," they would say,
   "Where is the boasted Savior now? He lied unto men's souls! He
   promised, but He did not give. He taught them to pray--and made them
   begin their Hell on earth--and then threw them into Hell forever."
   Could it be? Oh, could it be? What would praying men do in Hell? I
   remember that story of Mrs. Ryland, a good Christian woman, who, when
   she lay dying, was very, very sad, and her husband said to her, "You
   are dying, my Dear?" "Yes," she said. "And where are you going?" he
   asked. She replied, "Ah, John, I'm going to Hell."

   "And what will you do there?" he asked her. Well, that had not struck
   her, what she should do there. "Do you think," he asked, "you will
   leave off praying, Betsy?" "No, John," she said, "even if I were in
   Hell, I would pray." "Oh, but," said he, "they'd say, 'Here's praying
   Betsy Ryland here--turn her out--this isn't a fit place for her.' " And
   so me-thinks if one of you could go there with a prayer upon your lips,
   pleading and crying, they would either rejoice over you, as a proof
   that God was not true, or else they would say, "Turn her out. We cannot
   bear prayers in Hell. We could not bear to hear the voice of earnest
   supplication among the shrieks and curses of lost spirits."

   I have been arguing against a thing which you know theoretically is not
   possible. But yet there are some who, when they are under conviction of
   sin, still cleave to this dark delusion--that God will not hear them.
   Therefore, I have tried by blow after blow, if possible, to smite this
   fear dead. When Jael did but take one nail and hammer, she was able to
   smite Sisera through his brain with it. Since I have used ten nails,
   and have given the ten as lusty strokes with the hammer as I could give
   them, O may God make them strong enough to strike the Sisera of
   unbelief dead at your feet!

   11. Now, for a very little time, THE POSITIVE VIEW OF THE QUESTION.
   That the Lord does hear prayer, we think, may be positively
   substantiated by the following considerations:

   For the Lord to hear prayer is consistent with His Nature. Whatever is
   consistent with God's Nature, in the view of a sound judgment, we
   believe is true. Now, we cannot perceive any attribute of God which
   would stand in the way of His hearing prayer. It might be supposed that
   His justice would. But that has been so satisfied by the atonement of
   Christ, that it rather pleads the other way. Since Christ has "put away
   sin," since He has purchased the blessing, it seems but just that God
   should accept those for whom Jesus died, and give the blessing which
   Christ has bought.

   All the attributes of God say to a sinner, "Come, come! Come to the
   Throne of Grace, and you shall have what you want." Power puts out his
   strong arm and cries, "I will help you! Fear not." Love smiles through
   her bright eyes, and cries, "I have loved you with an everlasting love,
   therefore with the hands of kindness have I drawn you." Truth speaks in
   her clear, plain language, saying, "He that seeks finds. To him that
   knocks it shall be opened." Immutability says, "I am God. I change not.
   Therefore you are not consumed." Every single attribute of the Divine
   Character--you can think of these as well as I can--pleads for the man
   who prays, and I do not know--I never dreamed of a single attribute of
   Deity which could enter an objection. Therefore, methinks if the thing
   really will glorify God, and not dishonor Him, He will certainly do it.

   "Oh, but," you say, "I am such a great sinner." That gives me another
   argument. Would it not greatly extol the love and the Grace of God for
   Him to give His Grace to those that deserve it least? To give to a man
   what he deserves is no charity. To bestow a favor upon those who have a
   little offended, is no very great act of beneficence. But to choose out
   the biggest rebel in His dominions, and to say to that rebel, "I
   forgive you"! Yes, to take that rebel, and to adopt him into His
   family, adorn him with jewels, and set a crown of gold upon his
   head--is this the manner of men, O Lord God? No, it is in such cases
   that we see the broad distinction between the leniency of human
   sovereigns, and the mighty Sovereign Grace which is in the King of
   kings.

   The worse you make your case out to be, the better is my argument. The
   worse the disease, the more credit to the physician who heals. The
   worse the sin, the more glory to the astounding mercy which puts it
   away! The greater the rebel, the more triumphant that Divine Grace
   which makes that rebel into a child of God. I say that the greatness of
   your sin may act as a foil to set forth the brightness of God's love.
   And herein, because the hearing of your unworthy prayers, and the
   listening to the cry that comes out of your polluted lips--because this
   would honor Him--I am persuaded He will do it.

   Further, though these two reasons would suffice, let me notice that it
   is harmonious with all His past actions. If you want a history of God's
   dealings with men, turn to the 107th Psalm. There you find travelers
   lost, like you, in a desert. They wander in a wilderness in a solitary
   way. They find no city to dwell in. The water is spent in the bottle.
   The bread is exhausted from the camels' backs. They find no well. They
   perceive no way--they follow this path, then that. At last, hungry and
   thirsty, their souls fainted within them, up from the desert's parched
   sand there arose to the burning sky the voice of wailing, "O God, spare
   us and let us live."

   How is it written? "He delivered them out of their distresses. And He
   led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of
   habitation." For it says, "He satisfies the longing soul, and fills the
   hungry soul with goodness." That is not told us as the exception, but
   as the rule. This is God's way of dealing with men. When they are lost
   and turn to Him, He hears them. "Ah," you say, "I am lost, but I am not
   like those travelers. I am lost by reason of my own sin."

   The next case in this Psalm will suit you. Here we find rebels brought
   into prison. They have been rebelling against the Word of God, and they
   have condemned the counsel of the Most High. Therefore He brought them
   down by labor. They fell down, and there was none to help. Then they
   cried unto God in their trouble. Did He hear them? These were "rebels,"
   fitly and properly put in prison, justly and rightly fettered with
   iron. Do you wear the fetters of conscience and the chains of terror?
   Are you in the prison of the Law? So long as you are not in the final
   prison of Hell, if you call upon God in your trouble, you will find it
   with you as it was with them. "He brought them out of darkness and the
   shadow of death, and broke their bands in sunder."

   "Oh, but," says another, "I have got into trouble through my sin. But I
   do not know how to pray as I should, I am such a stupid blockhead."
   Then the next case is yours. "Fools because of their transgression, and
   because of their iniquities, are afflicted." One of these "fools" had
   brought on disease by his sin, and he was so sorely sick that he lost
   all appetite. He abhorred all manner of meat and drew near to the gates
   of death. This fool, what sort of prayer did he pray? Why, a fool's
   prayer, certainly. But even a fool's prayer God will hear, as it is
   written, "He sent His Word and healed them and delivered them from
   their destructions." So, if you are ever so great a fool, and the
   suffering you now feel has been brought on you through your own folly,
   yet He will hear you.

   "Ah, but," you say, "I have been such a bragging fellow, such a
   boaster. And I have done such terrible deeds in my day." What is the
   next case? The case of the sailor. You know, we generally reckon that
   seafaring men do not care for much. They are daredevils and rap out an
   oath without compunction. And in the olden times, I dare say, they were
   worse than they are now, so that when they did get ashore they were a
   very pattern of everything mischievous and bad. But here we have a crew
   of sailors in a storm. They had, no doubt, been cursing and swearing in
   the calm, but here comes a storm.

   They go up to Heaven, and then they go down again into the
   depths--"They reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man," for they
   cannot walk across the deck. The ship reels, "they are at their wits
   end," and they think, "Surely she will go to the bottom." Then they cry
   unto God. There was no chaplain on board. Who prayed? Why, the
   boatswain, and the captain, and the crew--and I dare say they did not
   know how to put the words together. They were more used to swearing
   than to praying--but they went down on their knees on deck--clinging to
   mast and bulwark and tiller, and they cried, "O God! O God! Save us!
   The ocean swallows us up! God of the tempest deliver us."

   And did He hear the sailor's prayer? Did He hear the cries, the frantic
   cries, of sinking men? Read here. "He makes the storm a calm, so that
   the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they are quiet.
   So He brings them unto their desired haven." Well now, you that have
   been accustomed to cursing and swearing, and say, "What is the use of
   my praying?" here is a case which just suits you. And this is the rule,
   I say again, not the exception. And I argue, therefore, from the past
   acts and ways of God, that He does hear prayer.

   Besides, here is another argument for you. What does He mean by His
   promises? As I said negatively, if He did not hear, where are His
   promises? So I say positively this time, because of His promises, He
   must hear. God is free, but His promises bind Him. God may do as He
   wills, but He always wills to do what He has said He will do. We have
   no claim upon God, but God makes a claim for us. When He gives a
   promise, we may confidently plead it. I venture to say that promises
   made in Scripture are God's engagements, and that as no honorable man
   ever runs back from his engagements, so a God of honor and a God of
   truth cannot, from the necessity of His Nature, suffer one of His Words
   to fall to the ground.

   In this little book, Clarke's Promises, which one likes to have always
   near, you find two or three chapters containing collected promises of
   the Lord--that He will answer secret prayer and listen to the voice of
   penitents. But I shall not occupy our time with promises which you can
   find in your Bibles at home. Only "let God be true and every man a
   liar." If God promises, He must and will perform, or else He were not
   true. While we dare to say that God's answering prayer is certified by
   abundance of facts in our own experience, we observe that the best
   proof is to try for yourself. It is said that there is no learning to
   ride except on a horse's back. And I believe there is no learning any
   Truth of God except by experiencing it.

   If you want to know the depravity of the human heart, you must find it
   out when you look at your daily imperfections. And if you would know
   that God hears prayer, you must test the fact, for you will never learn
   it through my saying, "He heard me"--you will only know it through His
   having heard you. And I would, therefore, exhort you--all of you who
   are now within reach of this voice of mine. Since it is not a perhaps,
   a chance, a maybe, a haphazard--but since it is a dead--I must not use
   that word--since it is a living certainty, that, "he that asks
   receives, and he that seeks finds," go to your houses, fall upon your
   knees and pray to God!

   Pray to Him even now in your pews, to save your souls. Ambition tempts
   you to disappointment. Riches charm you to speculations which will lead
   to failure. Your own passions drive you to pleasures which end in pain.
   The best the world can promise you is a perhaps. But my Master presents
   to you, "the sure mercies of David"--certainties--infallible
   certainties. Will you not have them? O may the Spirit of God lead you
   to accept them. In your pew you may pray! In that aisle the silent cry
   may go up to Heaven! In your little narrow chamber, or in the saw pit,
   or in the garden, or the field, or in the street, or in the prison
   cell--wherever you have a heart to pray, God has an ear to hear.

   No words are wanting, except such as spring spontaneously to the lips.
   Tell Him you are a wretch undone without His Sovereign Grace. Tell Him
   you have no hope in yourself. Tell Him you have no merits! Tell Him you
   cannot save yourself. Say, "Lord, save, or I perish!" It was Peter's
   sinking prayer. But it preserved him from drowning. Say, "God be
   merciful to me, a sinner"! It was the publican's prayer in the temple.
   It justified him.

   Bring a suffering Savior before a gracious God--point to the wounds of
   Jesus, and say, "O God! Though my heart is hard as a millstone,
   Christ's heart was broken. Though my conscience is not tender and is
   callous, yet the flesh of Christ was tender and it smarted sorely.
   Though I can give no atonement, Christ gave it--though I bring no
   merits, yet I plead the merits of Jesus." And let me say to you, pray
   as if you meant it, and continue as Elijah did, till you get the
   blessing.

   I would to God that some of you would never rise from your knees till
   God has heard you! Plead with Him as a man pleads for his life! Clutch
   the horns of the altar as the drowning man clutches the life buoy to
   which he clings. Lay hold on God, as Jacob grasped the angel--and do
   not let Him go until He blesses you, for "thus says the Lord, I have
   not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth. I said NOT unto the
   seed of Jacob, seek you My face in vain"!

                          Lead Us Not Into Temptation

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 17, 1863, BY THE REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil." Matthew 6:13.
   Psalms are entitled "Songs of Degrees." Certainly the prayer before us
   might be called a Prayer of Degrees. It begins where all true prayer
   must commence, with the spirit of adoption, "Our Father." There is no
   acceptable prayer until we can say with the prodigal--"I will arise and
   go unto my Father." This child-like spirit soon perceives the grandeur
   of the Father "in Heaven," and ascends to devout adoration, "Hallowed
   be Your name." The child who lisps, "Abba Father," grows into the
   cherub, crying, "Holy, Holy, Holy."

   Then there is but a step from rapturous worship to the glowing
   missionary spirit, which is a sure outgrowth of filial love and
   reverent adoration--"Your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as
   it is in Heaven." We do not commence our spiritual career with this
   mission spirit. We begin with "Our Father." We go on to feel His Glory,
   and then the next natural desire is that others may behold His
   greatness, too, till we are ready to cry with the Psalmist, "Let the
   whole earth be filled with His Glory."

   In the process of education, which this prayer so well describes, we
   find the man very early conscious of his dependence upon God. For as a
   dependent creature he cries, "Give us this day our daily bread." Being
   further illuminated by the Spirit, he discovers that he is not only
   dependent, but sinful, therefore he entreats for mercy. "Forgive us our
   debts as we forgive our debtors," and being pardoned, having the
   righteousness of Christ imputed, and knowing his acceptance with God,
   he humbly supplicates for holy perseverance, "Lead us not into
   temptation."

   The man who is really forgiven is anxious not to offend again. The
   possession of justification leads to an anxious desire for
   sanctification. "Forgive us our debts," that is justification. "Lead us
   not into temptation, but deliver us from evil," that is sanctification
   in its negative and positive forms. Now, it would not be the course of
   nature to begin a life of prayer with the supplication of this morning.
   This is a petition for men already pardoned, for those who know their
   adoption, for those who love the Lord and desire to see His kingdom
   come. Taught of the Spirit to know their pardon, adoption, and union to
   Jesus, they can cry, and they, alone--"Lead us not into temptation, but
   deliver us from evil."

   I shall this morning, first of all, anticipate an objection. Then I
   shall venture upon an exposition. And conclude with an exhortation.

   I. First let us ANTICIPATE AN OBJECTION. A great many persons have been
   troubled by that passage in James, where it is expressly said, "Let no
   man say, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be
   tempted with evil, neither tempts He any man." It has been found very
   difficult to reconcile that express declaration of the Apostle with
   this prayer of our Savior. And some good, but very ignorant men, have
   gone the length of altering our Lord's words. I have heard of one who
   was custom always to say, "Leave us not in temptation"--a most
   unwarrantable and unjustifiable alteration of Holy Scripture.

   Because sometimes a learned minister ventures, in all honesty and
   discretion, to give a more correct translation of the original--can
   this justify a foolish unlettered man in altering the original, itself,
   and perverting the sense of a passage? There is an end to Scripture
   altogether, if license is given to alter its teachings according to our
   will. To teach perfect Wisdom how to speak is too great a task to be
   ventured upon by any but the presumptuous and foolish. When our version
   is incorrect, then it is a duty to present the proper rendering, if one
   is able to find it out. But to give translations out of our whimsical
   heads, without having been taught in the original tongue is
   impertinence, indeed!

   There can be no better translation of the Greek than that which we have
   before us. The Greek does not say, "Leave us not in temptation," nor
   anything like it. It says, as nearly as English language can convey the
   meaning of the original, "Lead us not into temptation," and no sort of
   pinching, twisting, or wresting can make this prayer convey any other
   sense than that which our version conveys in so many words. Let us
   always be afraid of attempting improvements on God's perfect Word. And
   when our theories will not stand with Divinely revealed Truth, let us
   alter our theories, but let us never attempt for one single moment to
   put one Word of God out of its place.

   Neither can we get out of the difficulty by supposing that the word
   "temptation" does not mean "temptation," but must be restricted to the
   sense of "trial." Now, we grant at once that the use of the word
   "temptation" in our translation of Scripture is somewhat liable to
   mislead. The word temptation has two meanings--to try, and to entice.
   When we read that God did tempt Abraham, we are by no means to
   understand that He enticed Abraham to anything that was evil. The
   meaning of the word in that place, doubtless, is simply and only that
   God tried him.

   But permit me to say that this interpretation will not stand with this
   particular text now before us. The word here used for "temptation," is
   not the word constantly written when trial is meant. It is the very
   word which one would employ if temptation to sin were intended--and I
   cannot believe that any other translation can meet the case.
   Doddridge's paraphrase is a happy one--"Do not bring us into
   circumstances of pressing temptation lest our virtue should be
   vanquished, and our souls endangered by them. But if we must be thus
   tried, do You graciously rescue us from the power of the Evil One."

   I grant you that the word includes trial, as all temptation does, for
   all temptation, even if it is temptation from Satan, is, in fact, trial
   from God. Still there is more than trial in the text, and you must look
   at it just as it stands. As Al-ford, says, "The leading into temptation
   must be understood in its plain literal sense." Take the text just as
   you find it. It means literally and truly, without any variance, "Lead
   us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."

   "Well," says one, "if God does not tempt men, how can it be proper to
   pray, "Lead us not into temptation"? Dear Brothers and Sisters, do but
   notice the text does not say, "Tempt us not." If it did, then there
   would be a difficulty! It does not say, "Lord, tempt us not," but it
   says, "Lead us not into temptation." I think I shall very rapidly be
   able to show you that there is a vast difference between leading into
   temptation and actually tempting. God tempts no man. For God to tempt,
   in the sense of enticing to sin, would be inconsistent with His Nature
   and altogether contrary to His known Character.

   But for God to lead us into those conflicts with evil which we call
   temptations, is not only possible, but usual. Full often the Great
   Captain of Salvation leads us by His Providence to battlefields where
   we must face the full array of evil-- and conquer through the blood of
   the Lamb. This leading into temptation is by Divine Grace overruled for
   our good, since, by being tempted we grow strong in Grace and patience.
   Our God and Partner may--for wise ends, which shall ultimately serve
   His own Glory, and our profit--lead us into positions where Satan, the
   world, and the flesh may tempt us. And so the prayer is to be
   understood in that sense of a humble self-distrust which shrinks from
   the conflict.

   There is courage here, for the suppliant calmly looks the temptation in
   the face and dreads only the evil which it may work in him. But there
   is also a holy fear, a sacred self-suspicion, a dread of contact with
   sin in any degree. The sentiment is not inconsistent with, "all joy,"
   when the many different temptations do come. It is akin to the
   Savior's, "If it is possible, let this cup pass from Me," which did not
   for a moment prevent His drinking the cup, even to its dregs.

   Let me observe that God, in no sense, so leads men into temptation as
   to have any share in the blame of their sin if they fall into it. God
   cannot possibly, by any act of His, become partner with man in his
   crime. As good old Trapp well observes, "God tempts men for PROBATION,
   but never for PERDITION." The devil tempts men that he may ruin
   them--God tries men and puts them where Satan may try them--but He
   leads them into temptation for probation, that the chaff may be sifted
   from the wheat, that the dross may be separated from the fine gold.

   By these trials, hypocrites fall, being discovered in the hour of
   temptation, just as the rough March wind sweeps through the forest, and
   finding out the rotten boughs, snaps them from the tree--the fault
   being not in the wind--but in the decayed branch. James alludes to the
   actual solicitation to evil in which the most holy God can have no
   part, but our text deals with the Providential bringing about of the
   temptation which I think you can clearly see may be the Lord's work
   without His holiness in any degree being stained.

   When the Lord leads us into temptation, it is always with a design for
   our good. He leads us to battle, not that we may be wounded and
   defeated, but that we may win glorious victories which shall crown the
   head of our gracious Leader with many crowns, and prepare us for future
   deeds of valor. Temptations overcome are inestimable blessings, because
   they make us lie the more humbly at His feet, bind us more firmly to
   our Lord, and train us to help others. Tempted men can lift up the
   hands that hang down, and confirm the feeble knees. They have been
   tempted in the same manner, and can therefore succor their Brothers and
   Sisters.

   Yet, while the benefit which God brings out of our being led into
   temptation is very great, still, temptation in itself is a thing very
   dangerous. Trials and distress, in themselves, are so perilous, that it
   is right for the Christian to pray, "Lead us not into temptation."
   Though, as Martin Luther says, "Temptation is the best school into
   which the Christian can enter. Yet, in itself, apart from the Grace of
   God, it is so doubly hazardous. This prayer should be offered every
   day, 'Lead us not into temptation.' Or if we must enter into it, 'Lord,
   deliver us from evil.' "

   I do not know whether I have met the objection. Perhaps, in the
   exposition that is to follow I may be able to make it a little more
   clear. I wish to say that although God does not tempt men--that is
   affirmed in Scripture and reason--and by God's own Character--though
   all prove it to be fact, yet He may, and certainly does, lead us into
   positions in His Providence, where it is absolutely certain that we
   shall be tempted. And therefore, our consciousness of weakness should
   constrain us to plead for escape from the terrible contest--and
   deliverance out of it--if come, it must.

   II. LET US NOW EXPOUND THE TEXT. Possibly we may get at the meaning of
   the text better by supposing that we have just risen from our beds this
   morning. We are about to engage in prayer. Before we do so we endeavor
   to prepare our hearts for that hallowed exercise. We look back upon
   yesterday. We remember all our follies, our mistakes and sins. We feel
   deeply grieved. We are conscious that we are, this morning, just as
   weak as we were yesterday.

   We feel that if temptation assails us we shall as surely fall into sin
   as we did on the past day. We have gathered some experience, but we
   find we are still as weak as water, and that while the will to be holy
   is present with us, how to perform that which is good, we find not. At
   the same time we have an intense abhorrence of sin--we feel in our own
   hearts that we would sooner die than offend our God--we can contemplate
   sorrow with pleasure, but sin only with horror. We feel afraid to
   venture downstairs. We fear that temptations may await us in the
   family, and in business. We feel, therefore, constrained to pray.

   We know that there is the temptation of the theater and the music hall,
   but Divine Grace has made us resolute not to go there, for we feel we
   could not honestly ask God to preserve us from that temptation if we
   ran into it ourselves. There are our besetting sins, but being aware of
   them, we cry to God for help against them. But the black thought comes
   across our mind--"You do not know what is to happen today. You cannot
   tell what loss you may have to suffer. You do not know what trouble you
   may meet with, what rough word may be spoken to you. Your ship is on
   the sea, but you know not what rough waves will beat against it--there
   are sunken rocks and hidden quicksand--what if you should be wrecked on
   these?"

   You feel that you are about to follow the course of Divine Providence,
   that whatever happens to you will be according to your Father's will,
   and you put up this prayer, "Lord, You are to lead me this day. I would
   follow close to Your footsteps as a sheep follows its shepherd. But
   since I know not what is to happen to me, suffer me to ask one thing of
   You. Do not, I pray You, lead me away from sorrow or trouble--do as You
   will about that, O my Lord--but do not, I beseech You, lead me in Your
   Providence where I shall be tempted. For I am so feeble that, perhaps,
   the temptation may be too strong for me. Therefore, this day make a
   straight path for my feet, and suffer me not to be assailed by the
   Tempter.

   "Or if it must be, if it is better for me to be tempted, and if You do
   intend this day that I should fight with old Apol-lyon himself, then
   deliver me from evil. Oh, save me from the mischief of the temptation.
   Let me have the temptation if so it must be, but oh, let it do me no
   hurt. Let me not stain my garments. Let me not slip nor slide, but may
   I stand fast at the end of the day. May this temptation, though it be
   not joyous but grievous, have so worked out in me the comfortable
   fruits of righteousness, that it may be a part of that grand method by
   which You shall ultimately deliver me from all evil and make me
   perfectly like Yourself in Glory everlasting." That, I believe, is the
   meaning of the prayer.

   Possibly we should bring it out more clearly by taking several cases in
   which the Lord providentially leads men into temptation. There is
   poverty. No one will deny that poverty is, in many cases, directly an
   infliction from God. There are some, who by their indolence and
   debauchery, bring themselves low, but who pities them? But there are
   others who by the loss of parents are left orphans. Others who can
   never rise from the helpless penury of their first estate. God alone
   knows the mass of poverty in this city. We talk about the distress in
   Lancashire, and to some degree, I fear, Christian liberality has been
   diverted from London.

   But to my knowledge there is much distress in many of the streets of
   this huge city. Some of you ride through our fine wide streets, which
   are a sort of ornamental fringe upon the skirts of poverty, and you
   know nothing about those narrow back streets--those blind alleys and
   those courts inside of courts--where poverty is huddled together, and
   where too often sin, lust, and disease become its natural consequences.
   When a gracious man is brought very low in circumstances, it is God's
   act, an act of God which leads that man into temptation. For poverty
   necessarily has its temptations which you cannot possibly dissociate
   from it.

   Look at you poor needle girl--Stitch! Stitch! Stitch!--till the fingers
   are worn to the bone, till her eyes are red, and her heart weary. All
   that she can earn is hardly enough to keep body and soul together,
   while her clothes hang in rags about her. Do you know how stern is that
   temptation when a fallen sister whispers to her that there is money to
   be had so easily, and paints the gainful sin in flashing colors? What
   arguments can the Tempter find in that bare room, and empty cupboard,
   and thin slice of dry bread--and perhaps in a starving mother dying on
   a few rags in the corner. If throughout life we have been preserved
   from the contamination of vice, and feel at all inclined to exalt
   ourselves in our virtue, let us remember what we might have been had we
   been exposed to the same fierce solicitations. And let us pray for
   ourselves, and for all our Brothers and Sisters, "Lead us not into that
   temptation."

   Circumstances alter cases. Oh, my dear young Friends, I pray that no
   terrible circumstances may ever be able to alter you, but may the Lord
   who tries you, deliver you from evil. Sometimes the temptations of
   poverty appear in another form. A man finds that his trade does not pay
   him. He works hard, but he gets poorer and poorer. What few goods he
   had in the shop are decreasing. The stock gets lower. The children are
   crying for bread--his wife, perhaps, is an ungodly woman--and she tells
   him there is trade to be had on the Sunday, and if he will but open his
   shop he will prosper. She says everybody else in the street does it,
   and all the neighbors call him a fool for putting the shutters up.

   Oh, I admire that noble-heartedness which I have seen in some of you!
   It has made me look upon you with greater pride than ever prince did on
   his jewels, when you have said--"I can starve, but I cannot sin against
   my God." But when, to my grief, some professors yield to the
   suggestion, I cannot, and do not marvel. I can only pray for the
   steadfast and pray for myself--"Lord, lead me not into this
   temptation," for if a starving wife, wailing children, and a sickly
   infant are crying in our ears, who knows how soon we might betake
   ourselves to any means so as to satisfy their wants? Happy are they who
   have come through this temptation, and have been delivered from the
   evil of it! But happier far are they who have never been led into it.
   "Give me neither poverty nor riches," was the good prayer of Agur. And
   you that have never known poverty, and have never understood what
   shortness of bread means, pray this prayer this morning for yourselves
   and for all your Brothers and Sisters in this Church, "Lead us not into
   temptation."

   The Lord frequently leads His people into temptation from wicked men in
   the form of persecution. It often happens that in the course of
   Providence, for the wisest possible ends, a good man is put to labor
   where he finds no godly associates, but where his name is the theme of
   laughter. God is sometimes pleased to convert the woman while her
   husband remains unconverted, and perhaps he is opposed to her religion
   and will insist upon it that his wife shall not carry out her
   convictions. Now, in cases like this, God has manifestly put His people
   in a position where they are constantly tempted with the fear of men.
   This temptation is inevitably connected with persecution--a temptation
   to be ashamed of Christ, to hide one's face, to hold one's tongue when
   one should speak, to run down one's colors when they ought to be waved
   to the breeze--and like Peter, to deny our Lord.

   When some young man has been, to use a common expression, chaffed day
   after day, day after day, these cruel ridi-culings are a great deal
   harder to bear than a lash upon the back. Oh, it is a grand thing if a
   man can go through this, can endure the slow roasting alive year after
   year, and yet is delivered from evil. But, dear Brothers and Sisters, I
   think you and I may well pray, "Lead us not into temptation," for I
   fear there are some of you who are like the nautilus which, when the
   Mediterranean is all calm and quiet, floats in a gallant fleet upon the
   surface. But as soon as ever the rough waves come and the Euroclydon
   begins to blow, every nautilus draws in its tiny sail and drops to
   quiet obscurity in the bottom of the sea. There are many such
   professors, who, while everything goes smooth, float gloriously with
   us--but if rough times should come, they would be all unknown and
   unheard of.

   Many there are, I fear, who walk with Religion in her silver slippers,
   who might desert her if she had to go barefooted and ragged through the
   street, having no place to rest--her only destiny being the prison and
   the flames. We may pray, as we read the stories of martyrdom, or as we
   look upon some Brothers and Sisters in Church fellowship with us who
   have to be laughed at day by day, "Lord, lead us not into temptation,
   or if You do, be pleased to deliver us from evil." I have merely
   commenced the catalogue. Have patience with me while I mention the
   daily adversities to which we are heirs.

   Some of us fret and think that the Lord deals harshly with us. Let us
   mend our tune. What a world of mercy God gives to us compared with what
   others receive! I hear sometimes of a Believer who has lost a ship, or
   a horse, or has sustained a very serious loss with a dishonored bill,
   or a bad debt--or another of you is out of work for a week, or else
   your little ones are ill. Well, I pity you all for these trials, but
   after all, what little trials these are compared with what some endure!
   Take the case of Job--house and children, land and servants, and
   cattle--all swept away at a stroke--and his own body covered with sore
   boils. Did not the Lord lead him into temptation, and was it not a
   marvel, indeed, that Job did not go even further than cursing the day
   of his birth? Was it not a wonder that he did not yield to his wife's
   suggestion and curse God and die?

   Surely, Brothers and Sisters, when we see the way in which some saints
   have met bereavement after bereavement-- the holy courage with which
   others have sustained loss after loss. When we have marked the heroic
   resignation with which some have borne all the "ills which flesh is
   heir to"--and suffered in head and hand, and passed through painful
   surgical operations which have well near brought them to the jaws of
   the grave. When we note all this, we may well wonder how it is that
   they have been delivered from the evil of so much adversity, and we may
   with holy trembling, exclaim, "Lead us not into temptation." How
   impatient you and I might have been if we had been sorely sick, or
   bedridden for years.

   What hard things we might have thought of our God if He had swept all
   our estate away. How bitterly we might have spoken of His goodness if
   our husband were in a consumption, or if our wife were in the tomb. Our
   little ones are round about us and we hear their happy and cheerful
   voices. But oh, what a temptation to distrust God it would have been,
   if He had taken them away. Lord, do not so try us! Send not such
   adversities upon us as to lead us into temptation. But if You do this,
   be pleased to hold us up in the rough road, lest we fall into evil.

   To change the line of thought a moment. There are not only the
   temptations arising from poverty, from shame, and from trouble, but you
   know, Beloved, that by far, more dangerous temptations come from
   prosperity. You sometimes envy the very rich. You think of them as
   having more money than they can count, and broad acres, and parks, and
   lands so extensive that they hardly know their own boundaries. If you
   understood the temptations which beset their life. If you knew how hard
   it is to serve God and be rich--how difficult, especially, to be a
   courtier and at the same time a servant of the living God--you would
   not aspire to so lofty a station, but you would say, "Lead us not into
   temptation."

   Temptation must be incessant to the man who only has to wish and can
   enjoy what he wills. Many men are kept from sin by being poor. Their
   poverty is a clog to them. But when a man has strong appetites, and has
   no person to rebuke him--and has, moreover, all the means in his own
   hand of running into sin--we may well cry, "Lord, do not try me in that
   way." Perhaps you are very anxious to attain a prominent position in
   the Church. You may think, for instance, that to be a preacher,
   well-known and listened to by hundreds, is a very enviable position. It
   is about as enviable as the position of Blondin upon his high rope a
   hundred and fifty feet from the ground. If you knew the temptations
   which beset a man who lives in popularity and has constantly to preach
   the Word to thronging multitudes, you would say, "Lead me not into
   temptation, and if it is Your will that I must rise to that position,
   then deliver me from evil."

   Let me assure you, that high places and high Grace do seldom meet
   together. And that even in the Church any position of eminence is
   counterbalanced in the pleasure which it brings by the extreme danger
   to which it exposes its occupant. Long not to be too prosperous! Thank
   God for bad winds. Bless God for a little blight and mildew--yes, and
   be content to bless Him even if the fig tree should not blossom--and
   the flocks should be cut off from the field, and the herds from the
   stall. For any trial in the world is better than unbroken prosperity,
   concerning which you may well pray, "Lead us not into that temptation."

   Now you may see that the list is endless. If prosperity, honor, and
   esteem may breed in us worldliness, self-conceit, forgetfulness of God,
   reliance upon our own strength, and a departure from simple confidence
   in Him that made us what we are, then there must be trials everywhere.
   But I think I ought to add that, frequently, God leads men into
   temptation in the service which He requires of them. "Stop," you say,
   "how can that be? When God prescribes a duty, how can that lead man
   into temptation?"

   I reply that to know duty is often in itself to be tempted not to do
   it. And that when that duty is high and stern, and demands of us severe
   self-denial and earnest perseverance, we may be tempted to shun the
   engagement. Take the instance of Jonah. He is sent to Nineveh. His
   prophetic soul forewarns him that the mission will not be to his honor.
   He objects to go and attempts to fly to Tarshish to escape the mission
   of his God. Now, such a temptation is not so rare as some suppose. You
   think, "I can never face that multitude again." You have to deal,
   perhaps, with cruel tongues in a Church meeting and you think, "I can
   never fight that battle through."

   You have been preaching in the street and the whisper comes--"Never do
   that again. Never expose yourself to the insults of the passerby." You
   have been teaching in a Sunday school and you may be led into this
   temptation--"Give it up. It is of no use. The children will never be
   blessed." You may have been a tract distributor You may have attempted
   to go from house to house to speak for God and the temptation may have
   been hot upon you--"Cease from it. There's no need for you to do it."
   Your very duty has led you into temptation.

   Brethren, pray to God against it. Ask Him that the duty required of you
   may always be such as your strength shall enable you to perform--that
   you may go to His Throne daily and get such help that your arms may be
   sufficient for you. If not, even in the highest form of spiritual
   service you may be led into temptation. What if I add to this that God
   may demand sacrifices of us which lead us into temptation? Look at
   Abraham. "Take you your son, your only son Isaac, and offer him up upon
   the place that I will show you." I overheard a mother say, "I love my
   son so much, and he is such a comfort to me, that I could not give him
   up." One observed to her that she should not talk so, for the Christian
   ought to stand to the surrender every hour, and be willing to give up
   child, or husband, or friend at Christ's bidding.

   But her answer was, and it was a true one, "I could not do it. It is of
   no use my pretending that I could. I could not do it, and I am
   persuaded that if God should command me to give him up--He might take
   him away, and I would submit to it--but if I had to give him up
   voluntarily, I could not do it. It is no use in my saying I could."
   Then I suggested that therefore she ought always to pray that God would
   not try her that way, but that He would be pleased to spare her the
   sacrifice which she could not make--that in fact, He would not lead her
   into temptation, or if He did, would give her so much Divine Grace that
   she would not be tempted to rebel, but might give up her son, though he
   were to her as her own soul.

   Oh, dear Friends, there are many trials we talk about, and think we
   could bear! But if they were once to assail us, we might find it very
   difficult to do so. It is easy to be a sailor on shore, and to laugh at
   the winds when you are snug in your beds. It is all very well to sing
   of the waves and shout for--

   "The flag that braved a thousand years The battle and the breeze," but
   the battle and the breeze are very different things from what the song
   would make them out to be, and we had better, I think, while we are
   free from the trial, unanimously pray this prayer--"Lead us not into
   temptation."

   I want you to notice that word "us," for selfishness will dictate you
   to pray this prayer for yourselves. But we are more than two thousand
   strong, a great army for God united in Church fellowship. And you know
   there are many young added to the Church, though a large proportion of
   the aged also come--more, perhaps, than in any other congregation.
   Remember our young members, our young men and women, who are very
   greatly exposed. I charge you, elders of the Church. I charge you,
   seniors in the faith. I charge you, mothers in Israel, that you offer
   this prayer today and every day:

   "Lord, lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Lord,
   temper the wind to the shorn lamb. Put not the little boat upon the
   rough billows. Send not Your little ones to stern battles. And, Lord,
   since we are all weak, old as well as young--since the gray locks cover
   no more wisdom than the child's curls, except as You give wisdom--so
   keep all the Church, and lead neither pastor, nor officers, nor members
   into temptation. But if we must be led there, we take up the latter
   sentence, and pray it still more passionately, 'Deliver us from evil.'
   "

   I have heard of a poor pitman, who after being converted to God, had a
   great dread of falling into sin. One morning, after having endured much
   scorn, mockery, blasphemy, swearing, and ill-treatment from his fellow
   colliers, before he went down into the pit, knelt down and prayed that
   God would sooner let him die than fall into sin. He cried, "Lord, let
   me die sooner than fall into sin," and he did die there and then--happy
   thus to be taken up where he should no more know the annoyance of trial
   from without, or temptation from within.

   III. We close our discourse with A BRIEF EXHORTATION. I exhort you to
   pray this prayer very earnestly, dear Friends, and I bid you do it for
   several reasons.

   First, remember your own heart. A man who carries gunpowder about with
   him may well ask that he may not be led where the sparks are flying. If
   I have a heart like a bombshell, ready to explode at any moment, I may
   well pray God that I may be kept from the fire, lest my heart destroy
   me. Perhaps you have angry tempers, constitutionally so. Some men still
   remain hot and quick--some of our Welsh friends, always so. Such should
   pray every day that they may not be tempted by any jeering words. That
   they may be kept calm and quiet, and not be led into irritation. We
   have each besetting sins of some sort or another, and I do not know
   that the temptation to be hot and quick in temper is anything so bad as
   that to be dull and lumpy and stupid.

   Generally speaking, a man who has not some temper in him, is not worth
   much. And those who, as we sometimes say, are as easy as an old shoe,
   are not often worth more than that worn out article. We may have
   temptations, however, of another kind, and just there we should put up
   our prayer with great earnestness and intense passion, exclaiming,
   "Lord, lead me not into that temptation." There is a weak point in each
   of us. And remember, the strength of a rope is to be measured, not
   according to its strength in its strongest, but its weakest part. Every
   engineer will tell you that the strength of a ship should always be
   estimated, not according to her strongest, but her weakest part--for if
   the strain shall come on her weakest part, and that is broken, no
   matter how strong the rest may be, the whole ship goes down.

   Now, I say there is a weak point in every man. Indeed, where is there a
   point where we are not weak? Show me where our strength lies. It lies,
   surely, nowhere here, but only there in Him who makes us strong to do
   exploits in His name. Therefore, because of weakness and inclination to
   sin, let each man pray, and pray constantly, "Lead us not into
   temptation."

   To use another argument, how many have fallen who were led into
   temptation! Think of them, not to congratulate yourselves, nor yet to
   blame them, but to take warning. When cases of discipline come before
   the Church, I have thought how gently we ought to deal, for had we been
   put where these Brothers and Sisters have been, our fall might have
   been even more desperate than theirs. I have often grieved when a
   Brother has lost his temper, and then I have thought, "Well, I cannot
   accuse, but I must not judge uncharitably. For if I had been teased one
   half as much as he has been, I might have been worse than he."

   When I see another man shipwrecked, I should mind that I carefully
   navigate my own boat. When I see another who has caught a contagious
   disease, I should be careful not to go into those quarters where that
   disease is the most virulent, lest I catch it, too. And if I know that
   there is a great disinfectant, a heavenly remedy by which contagion may
   be stopped, how ought I to use it. That remedy is PRAYER, and the
   precise prayer is in the text--"Lead me not into temptation, but
   deliver me from evil, lest I fall as others have done and become weak
   and vile as they."

   Remember to pray this prayer, because should we fall under temptation,
   how great will be our misery. A certain high Antinomian said, one day,
   that if a Christian fell into sin, he lost nothing by it except--what
   do you think he said? Except his comfort, and his communion with God! I
   suppose he thought the Christian's comfort and his communion with God
   were a drop in a bucket! But he that has once lost his comfort, and his
   communion with God will tell you quite another tale! Oh, to lose your
   comfort, to have to groan out with David, "Make the bones which you
   have broken to rejoice. Hide your face from my sins and blot out mine
   iniquities!" Pray that Penitential Psalm over and you will soon
   discover that sin is the father of Sorrow, and that a saint cannot slip
   without much damage to himself.

   I have marked, and marked carefully, those Brothers and Sisters who
   have backslidden and fallen into sin, and have afterwards been
   restored. And though I have rejoiced in their restoration, yet I never
   can help noticing how different they are from what they used to be. So
   quiet now--so sad in appearance, too. And though, perhaps, better men
   than ever they were, yet the joy of God is gone. The spring has gone
   out of their souls! They cannot dance with David before the ark now!
   You never find David dancing after his sin with Bathsheba. Not he.
   There was no dance in him after that! He limped to the day of his
   death. Take care, man--if you would not make for yourself a garment of
   sorrows, if you would not stuff the pillow of your bed with thorns, and
   be perpetually wearing chains--take care that you pray to God to lead
   you not into temptation.

   Worse remains. Recollect what mischief a Christian's fall will do. A
   thousand Believers live in holiness, and nobody says anything about
   them. But if one of them shall fall into sin, the whole world rings
   with it. I know not why it should be, but if they can but find one bad
   fish in our net, they hawk it all round the town in four-and-twenty
   hours. "See here," they say, "here is one of the people that go to hear
   Spurgeon! Here is one of your professors! Here is one of your Baptists!
   Here is one of your Methodists!" or something of that kind. Why do they
   not look at the nine hundred and ninety-nine who stood fast? Why do
   they not talk of those who serve their Lord well, and are found
   faithful even to the end?

   But that, indeed, would not answer their purpose. Brethren, would you
   fill the mouths of the daughters of Philistia? Would you make the
   children of Gath and Askelon rejoice? Would you see the banner of Hell
   floating proudly in the breeze, and the escutcheon of our glorious
   Christ trailing in the mire? Would you grieve the Spirit? Would you
   open the wounds of Christ afresh? Would you put Him and His fair
   Spouse, the Church, to an open shame? If you would, then be slack in
   your prayers. But if you would not, if you would adorn the doctrine of
   God your Savior in all things. If you would win jewels for Christ's
   crown. If you would make men wonder at Him, and at you, because you
   have been with Him, then pray this prayer--"Lead us not into
   temptation, but deliver us from evil."

   I cannot tell why it is that this text should come on this particular
   Sunday, but it is very likely that your life this week will let you
   into the secret of it. Thus says the Lord unto some of you, "This week
   I will sift you and try you." Pray that you enter not into temptation.
   Christ pleads for you, for Satan has desired to have some of you, that
   he may sift you as wheat. Join your prayers with Christ's supplications
   that your faith fail not. I cannot tell, I am no Prophet, but I feel a
   call to warn you to watchfulness. There may happen something that may
   make us bless God for this warning note. We are forearmed because we
   are forewarned. We are able to put our helmet on in time, to gird on
   our breastplate and our shoes of brass, and to put our hand upon our
   sword. For the battle is coming, and the Lord has sounded the trumpet
   and bids us cry--"Lead us not into temptation."

   This prayer will not suit some of you. You need not be led into
   temptation, for you live in it already. A man might pray to be kept out
   of the water, but a fish cannot, for it lives in it. Even so, you whose
   native element is sin, cannot pray, "lead us not into temptation."
   There is another prayer for you to pray before you get to this, and
   that is, "Forgive us our trespasses." Pray that today, and then you
   shall pray this tomorrow. Your sins are accusing you before God today.
   Your trespasses are clamoring at the Mercy Seat. I hear their cry. They
   are crying "Justice! Justice! Justice! Lord, smite that man! Lord,
   smite that man!"

   With hoarse voices they cry aloud, "Let him be lost! Let him be cast
   away!" While your sin clamors against you, will you not pray for mercy?
   Mercy is ready to hear you. The Throne of Grace is easily accessed.
   Come before God and say, "O Lord! I know that Jesus died and took upon
   Himself the sins of all those that trust Him. I trust Him. For His
   sake, Lord, forgive my trespasses, and let my debt be blotted out by
   His blood." He will hear you, Sinner, and before you go out of yonder
   doors your sins may be forgiven, and you may be white in Christ's
   righteousness, and spotless as the newly fallen snow. After that, then,
   use my text and pray to Him who is able to keep you from falling, "Lead
   us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."

                               Peace By Believing

   A SERMON BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE,
   NEWINGTON.

   "Therefore, beingjustified by faith, we havepeace with God through
   ourLord Jesus Christ."

   Romans 5:1.

   A MOMENT'S contemplation would suffice to arouse any man to the terror
   of the position involved in being at war with God. For a subject to be
   in a state of sedition against a powerful monarch is to commit treason,
   and to incur the forfeiture of his life. But for a creature to be in
   arms against its Creator! For a thing that depends for its existence
   upon the will of God--to be at enmity with the God in whose hand its
   breath is! For a soul to know that God, who is terrible in His power,
   and Almighty to protect or to destroy, is his foe! That He whose anger
   endures forever, and His wrath burns even unto the lowest Hell, is his
   chief and grand Enemy--this is an appalling thing, indeed!

   Could any man but understand and realize this, smitten through with
   terrors as great as those which surprised Bel-shazzar when he saw the
   handwriting on the wall, he would cry out in anguish, and he would make
   a thrilling appeal for mercy. God is against you, O sinful man! God is
   against you, O you who have never submitted yourself unto His Word! God
   is against you! And woe unto you when He shall rend you in pieces, for
   none can deliver you out of His hand! Happy! Happy beyond all
   description is the man who can say with our Apostle, "We have peace
   with God." But wretched! Wretched, again, beyond all description!
   Wretched must that man be who is at war with his own Maker, and sees
   Heaven itself in arms against him!

   Chiefly, now, we shall endeavor to talk of the peace which the Believer
   enjoys. And then I shall have a few words of counsel, warning, and
   encouragement for those who have not this peace with God, or who may
   have had it, but for a time have lost the enjoyment of it.

   I. In speaking of THE PEACE OF GOD WHICH THE CHRISTIAN ENJOYS, we will
   commence with some remarks upon its basis. There is the widest possible
   difference between a man being just in his own eyes, and his being
   justified in the sight of God. Yet, perhaps no fallacy is more common
   than to mistake the one for the other. Then, as a natural consequence
   of building on a weak foundation, the structure, however fair to look
   upon, is insecure. The peace in which multitudes of professors delight
   themselves is merely peace with their own conscience and not in any
   sense peace with God.

   I know of no greater contrast than there is between that peace which is
   a mere stagnation of thought, a lull of anxiety, or a blindness to
   danger, and that soul-satisfying peace which passes all understanding.
   The true peace of God flows like a river in unceasing activity. It
   preserves a tranquil frame amidst storm, tempest, and tribulation--by
   all of which it is frequently assaulted. It is a part of the panoply of
   God with which a Christian is clothed, to withstand principalities, and
   powers, and spiritual wickedness in the evil day. Or, to change the
   figure, Christ gave His disciples this peace as a charm, when, as He
   was about Himself to depart, and go to the Father, He sent them forth
   to be buffeted about in the world.

   Just so in the text. If you pursue the subject in the next few verses,
   you will find that this peace with God is given first, and afterwards
   comes experience of tribulations everywhere else. We ourselves,
   Brothers and Sisters, have proved it. There is a natural disposition of
   sin to defile, but the blood of Christ speaks peace in the conscience.
   There is a constant tendency of the world to destroy our hope, but the
   peaceful word of Jesus comforts us. "Be of good cheer, I have overcome
   the world." There is a painful proneness of human strength to fail, but
   the promise supports us--"This One shall be peace when the Assyrian
   comes into our land." And this true peace gives to the Believer an
   inward sense of God's acceptance. As Moses never lost sight of the
   goodwill of the Dweller in the bush, so, too, there is a more blessed
   assurance of goodwill in the faith that always realizes, "God in Christ
   reconciling the world to Himself."

   And now, as to the experimental basis of that peace which the Believer
   has with his God--it must have some solid rational ground. It must have
   some basis which judgment may estimate. I know some who have an
   apprehension of peace with God that has no foundation whatever. Let me
   describe the person. "Are you living in peace with God, my Friend?"
   "Yes," says he, "thank God, I have enjoyed a sense of peace for twenty
   years." "How did you get it?" "Well, as I was walking one day, in great
   distress of mind, on such-and-such a road, a feeling of comfort came
   over me, and it has remained with me ever since." "Yes, but, Friend,
   what is the reason of your hope? What is the ground of your confidence
   that you have peace with God?"

   "Well, you see, I felt comfortable, and I believe that I have felt
   comfortable ever since." "No, no. That's not the matter at which I aim.
   What is the ground? What is the doctrinal proof? What is the matter of
   fact that gives you comfort?" "Well, do not press me," he says, "for I
   do not know. Only this I know--I did feel happy, and I have felt happy
   ever since. And I have not had any doubt." That man, mark you, if I am
   not mistaken, is under a delusion. If I err not, it is very possible
   that that man has received a draught of the opium of Hell. Satan has
   said to him, "Peace, peace," where there is no peace. He is going
   undisturbed, and quiet, down to the place where he shall lift up his
   eyes and discover too late his error.

   The peace of a Christian is not such a lull of stupefaction as that. It
   has a reason. It has some groundwork. And when you come to pull it to
   pieces, it is as completely a logical inference from certain facts as
   any deduction that could be drawn by mathematical precision. Let me,
   however, bring up a few more who think they have peace but build their
   supposition on wrong grounds. Here is a man who very flippantly and
   joyously says, "Peace with God, Sir? Yes, peace with God. I enjoy the
   unbroken satisfaction that I have made my peace with Him." "Well, how?"
   "Why, you see, some years ago I never went to a place of worship on
   Sunday at all, and I felt one day that I was doing wrong. Here was I
   going to the theater most nights, and I was doing my trade in a very
   bad way, and now and then I took too much drink.

   "I was doing a great many things that were wrong, and I thought it was
   time for me to turn over a new leaf, and I have done so. Now I
   generally go to a place of worship twice on the Sunday. I may now and
   then indulge myself--well, who is there that never does anything wrong?
   But still there is very great amendment in me. If you ask my wife, she
   sees a wonderful change. And if you ask my workpeople, they will say I
   am a different man from what I used to be. Now, I think

   1 am not like the man you brought up just now, with no ground for his
   peace. I think I have a very good ground for mine, for I am deserving
   very well of my Maker now. I feel now, if I go to a place of amusement
   where I ought not, I cannot pray that night. But the next night I try
   over again, and manage to get through my form of prayer. On the whole I
   am doing so well that I think I may say I have a good bottom and ground
   for saying that I am at peace with God."

   Now, let this man be reminded that it is written, "By the works of the
   Law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight." All these moral
   things of which he has spoken are good enough in themselves. They will
   be very excellent in the temple of Christianity if they are placed at
   the top. But, if they are used as foundations, a builder might as well
   use tiles and slates and chimney-pots for foundations and cornerstones
   as use these reformatory actions as a ground of dependence. Man! Do you
   not perceive that your foundation is not an even and secure one? For
   what about the past? What is to become of the sins already committed?
   How are you to get rid of these? Do you suppose that the payment of
   future debts will discharge old liabilities?

   Go to your tradesman and tell him that you owe him a very great sum of
   money, and you cannot pay him a farthing of it. Do you expect he will
   not sue you in court because you never intend to get into his debt any
   more? I think he will tell you that is not a method of business he
   understands. Certainly this is not the way in which God will deal with
   you. Your old sins! Your old sins! Your OLD sins! What about those?
   Those debts unpaid? Those crimes as yet unburied? Let your conscience
   give them a resurrection in your memory tonight. What about these?
   Surely you can have no peace with God while these remain unforgiven!

   Besides, you have an inward conviction that you have not peace with
   God, but only peace with yourself. You do feel a little better
   sometimes, but it is a very poor sort of confidence that you have, for
   a little sickness shakes it. How would you like to die now? Would you
   wrap yourself up in these miserable rags of yours and say, "Lord, You
   know I have sinned, but then I have done my best to make up for it."
   You know and feel that this bed is shorter than a man can stretch
   himself on, and this coverlet too narrow for a man to wrap himself in.
   Renounce this confidence, for it is one that will never stand before
   God!

   To give an instance of yet another case--one in which I tread on more
   delicate ground. Beloved, there are some who have peace which they
   explain to you in such a way that while I trust they have a peace with
   God, I fear they misunder- stand the ground of it. Some true Christians
   will talk to you in this way--"I hope I am at peace with God now, for
   my faith is in active exercise. My love is fervent. I have delightful
   seasons in prayer. The eyes of my hope are no longer dim, and my
   patience can endure many things for Christ. My courage did not fail me
   yesterday in the midst of Christ's enemies. My graces are vigorous. The
   Spirit of God has been blowing across my soul as over a garden. And all
   the graces, like flowers, have yielded their best perfume, and
   therefore I feel that I have peace with God."

   Oh, Believer, Believer! Are you so foolish as having begun in the
   Spirit by faith, to be made perfect in the flesh by your own doing?
   Remember, if you have peace, if you put your peace here upon your
   graces, then there will come another day--perhaps it may come
   tomorrow--when all those graces will droop like withered flowers,
   yielding no perfume! Instead of beauty there shall be baldness. Instead
   of ornament there shall be decay. There will come a day when you shall
   see yourself in your true natural colors, and discover yourself, like
   Job, and cry out as he did, "Lord, I am vile!" What will you do, then,
   with your peace? Why, if you have begun to look to your graces in any
   way for peace, then you are looking to a fickle source.

   You are going to the cistern, instead of living by the fountain! You
   are using Hagar's bottle, instead of sitting like Isaac at the well to
   drink from never-ceasing streams. Yet this is an evil into which we are
   so apt to fall after having done well for the Master, and being helped
   to serve Him. It is true we do not trust in these things. I hope God
   has delivered us from self-righteousness. Yet there is just that, "Now
   I must be a child of God--now I must truly be an heir of Heaven-- for
   see how I have been sanctified! Mark how I have been edified and built
   up in the faith." Ah, Brothers and Sisters! There is the cloven foot
   there! Be on your guard! It is an unclean thing. It will bring you into
   pain and bondage. It will make you sick, and put your feet in the
   stocks, and thrust you into the inner dungeon before long. Flee from it
   as you would from a serpent. Stand ever under the dear Cross of Christ,
   looking up to His wounds, rejoicing in His all-sufficiency, and
   building your peace there, and there alone.

   I fear, too, that there are not a few who, I trust, have genuine peace,
   but who, nevertheless, are tempted to found their confidence upon their
   enjoyments. We have our enjoyments--God be thanked for this. Oh, there
   are times when our communion is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus
   Christ! We have not been into Heaven, but we have heard some of the
   songs of the angels on the other side the pearly gates. Or, if not the
   songs, we have heard the echo of them in our hearts. There are times
   when we have been in prayer and our soul has been like the chariots of
   Aminadab, swift and strong. We have had our seasons, as it were, of
   witnessing the Transfiguration! We can remember Tabor's mount--well can
   we remember the hill Mizar, and the Hermonites--for there He spoke with
   us.

   We have had our experience of Jacob's dream, as well as our fellowship
   with Jacob's wrestling. We have seen the Lord, and by faith have put
   our finger into the print of the nails, and thrust our hand into His
   side. He has kissed us with the kisses of His love, and His love is
   better than wine. But the tendency is to say, "Now I have peace with
   God. Now I must be reconciled to Him. Now I will press out the wine of
   comfort from these grapes." If we do this, let us remember that perhaps
   tomorrow we may be in Gethsemane. We may have our times of agonizing
   and fruitless prayer. We may be in the valley of despondency, or in the
   blacker valley of the shadow of death.

   Brothers and Sisters, present joys, promises applied with power,
   whispers of Christ's love, sweets of His Covenant, delighting ourselves
   in the Lord--what then? Ah, my Brothers and Sisters, we shall find
   ourselves weak, because we have taken our comforts to be the basis of
   our peace, instead of continuing to look solely and only to Christ. Let
   me warn you, Beloved, though this may not seem a case as dangerous as
   some others, yet let me warn you that it is essential to our comfort
   that we should stand to this and to this only--being justified by
   faith--we have peace with God. Our peace is solely the result of a
   justification achieved through faith and not the result of enjoyments,
   nor of graces, much less of good works, or of any foolish irrational
   impression which we may think we have been favored with.

   Where, then, does lie the Christian's conviction of his peace with God?
   Well it lies in this--that he is justified by faith. The process is
   plain. It is as clear, I say, as a proposition in Euclid. Christ stood
   in my place before God. I was a sinner doomed to die. Christ took my
   place. He died for me. Well, then, how can I perish? How can I be
   punished for offenses which have been punished already in the Person of
   my Substitute? God demands of me perfectly to keep His Law. I cannot do
   it. Christ has done it for me--kept the Law--magnified it, made it
   honorable. What more can God demand of me? I, a sinner, am washed in
   Jesus' blood. I, guilty, am clothed in Jesus' righteousness.

   You say "How? I cannot see it is so." True, it is so by faith. God says
   that he who believes in Christ shall be saved--I believe in
   Christ--therefore I am saved. He says, "He that believes on Him is not
   condemned." I believe on Him. Therefore I am not condemned--this is
   clear reasoning enough. Very well, then, the man who has believed in
   Christ has his sins forgiven, and the righteousness of Christ imputed
   to him. Therefore he is at peace with God. Now this is reasoning which
   no logic can deny. There is a rebel--first he is pardoned, next merit
   is imputed to him--and he is at peace with his king, and a rebel no
   longer. There is a child. He has offended. His Father takes him,
   accepts him for his elder Brother's sake, and he is at peace with his
   Father.

   The thing is clear enough. Here is a reason for the hope that is within
   us, which we may give with meekness and fear! It is true, never with
   diffidence and timidity! We may venture to give it in the presence of
   the old dragon, and defy him to break its force. We might give it,
   even, in the midst of a congregation of assembled demons and defy them,
   if they can, to break its power. We may give it in the presence of the
   Eternal God, for He will never deny the Word on which He has caused us
   to hope. "Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died, yes, rather,
   that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also
   makes intercession for us." It stands forever.

   Stand here, and you stand so fast that no howling tempest of temptation
   can sweep you down. Stand to this, that Christ has finished your
   salvation for you, that He has done everything that Omnipotent Justice
   can ask. He has endured all the penalty, drained the cup of wrath,
   obeyed the Law completely, given to Divine equity all it can
   demand--and therefore, believing in His name, standing in His
   righteousness, accented in His suretyship--you must have peace with
   God. This is the basis of the Christian's peace--one on which he may
   sleep or wake, live or die--and live eternally, without condemnation or
   separation from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus the Lord.

   Continuing our remarks on this subject, we shall now turn your
   attention to the channel of this peace. "Therefore being justified by
   faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."

   Take it for a certain fact, then, that we are justified as the result
   of what Christ has done for us, seeing that He, "was delivered for our
   offenses and raised again for our justification." And the experience,
   insofar as we have assurance of our being personally justified, is the
   result of our trusting Christ. What then? How are we to enjoy the
   comfort of it? There are times when we begin to doubt whether we are
   justified. Brethren, we must not come to our faith to get comfort, but
   to the primary cause of our justification. The channel through which
   the comfort comes is Jesus Christ. So then, though justification by
   faith, is, in itself, a well of comfort, even from that well we cannot
   get it, except we use Christ--who dug the well--to be the Bucket to
   draw the water up from its depths.

   It must come through Christ. I will suppose, then, that I am in doubt
   and fear tonight, and want to get my peace re-stored--how shall I seek
   it? Through Jesus Christ, the Surety and Substitute Himself. How?
   First, by believing in Christ over again, just as I did at the first.
   Christ tells me that He came to save sinners. I am a sinner, therefore
   He came to save me. He says He can save me. This looks reasonable. He
   is very God. He is perfect Man. He has suffered and offered a complete
   atonement. He tells me He is willing to save me. This also appears
   reasonable, for why else should He die, if He did not wish to save?

   Then He tells me if I will trust Him, He will save me. I trust Him, and
   I have not the shadow of a doubt that He will be as good as His word.
   If He is faithful and just--of which who dares to breathe a
   suspicion?--this soul of mine, in Heaven, must be. It is committed to
   the Redeemer's charge with every pledge that God can give, with more
   security than we could ever ask. In Him I trust--in Jesus, and in
   Jesus, only. Brothers and Sisters, this is how you must get your peace
   with God tonight--through Jesus Christ--by going to Him. By a simple
   faith, just as you went at the first.

   Some silly people who have got high doctrine in their heads, so high
   that it smells offensive in the nostrils of those who read the
   Scriptures--they say we teach that man is saved by mere believing. We
   do--by mere believing. There is a poor, starving man over there. I give
   him bread--his life is spared. Why do not these people say this man was
   saved by mere eating--by mere eating! And here is another person whose
   tongue cleaves to the roof of his mouth by thirst, and is ready to die.
   I give him water, and he drinks, and his eyes sparkle--and the man is
   saved by mere drinking. And look at ourselves--why do we not drop down
   dead in our pews? Just stop your breath a little while and see. Surely
   we all live by mere breathing.

   All these operations of nature that touch the vital mysteries may be
   sneered at as merely this, or merely that. And in like manner to speak
   with disparagement of, "mere believing," is stupid nonsense. And yet,
   let me say it in my sense of the term--we are saved, we are reconciled
   to God through Jesus Christ by mere believing--by the simple act of
   trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ. And if I would get my peace made
   more full and perfect, having come to Christ by faith, I must continue
   to get peace from Him by meditation upon Him. For the more I go to
   Christ believingly, the deeper will my peace be. If I believe in
   Christ, and do not know much of Him, my faith will necessarily be
   somewhat slender.

   But if I continue, "to comprehend with all saints what are the heights,
   and depths, and lengths, and breadths, and to know the love of Christ
   which passes knowledge," then my little faith will become strong faith.
   The bruised reed shall become a cedar, and the smoking flax shall
   become a beacon flaming to the very skies! I must take care, above all,
   that I cultivate communion with Christ, for though that can never be
   the basis of my peace--mark that--yet it will be the channel of it. If
   I live near to Christ, I shall not know fear. What sheep is afraid of
   the wolf when it is close to the shepherd's hand? What child fears when
   it hangs upon its mother's breast? Who should know fear when he is
   covered with the eternal wings, and underneath him are the everlasting
   arms?

   "While His left hand is under my head, and His right hand does embrace
   me," I cannot but be at peace, and that peace, if my communion is
   continued, will be like a river--deep and broad--my righteousness being
   like the waves of the sea. It is Christ, the substance of my salvation!
   Christ, the sum of all my hope! Christ who performs all things for me,
   and Christ made of God all things to me! As Christ was the first means
   of giving us peace, so He must still be the golden conduit through
   which all peace with God must flow to our believing hearts. And all
   this through the act of merely believing, or merely trusting in Him! By
   looking to Him I drew all the faith which inspired me with confidence
   in His Grace. And the word that first drew my soul--"Look unto
   Me"--still rings its clarion note in my ears. There I once found
   conversion, and there I shall often find refreshing and renewal.

   Having thus glanced at the basis of our peace, and the channel through
   which it flows, let us pass on to notice its certainty. I like to read
   these rolling sentences of Paul, without an "if," or a "but," in
   them--"Therefore, being justified, we have peace with God." He talks as
   logically as if he were a mathematician, and as positively as though he
   could see the thing written before his eyes. Oh, how different is this
   from the way in which some talk--"I hope," "I trust," "I sometimes hope
   my poor soul may have peace with God." Now where this language is
   genuine, it deserves sympathy--but I believe in many cases it is cant.

   There is a certain class of professors who think strong faith is pride,
   and doubts and fears are humility. Therefore they look upon these
   base-born thorns as though they were choice flowers, and they will cull
   them together like a bouquet of nettles and noxious weeds--a fool's
   bouquet of flowers. Have you ever seen it in the magazines? I have
   observed it very frequently. Or they will dig up a nasty ugly thorn,
   put it in a flower pot, place it in an ornamental situation, display it
   outside the window, and call you all to admire it, as being a special,
   a wonderful piece of Christian experience.

   Well, one likes to see a thorn when it is developed to the highest
   degree, but as soon as seen, one likes to see it burned. And so with
   these doubts and fears. It is very well for us to know how far doubting
   and fearing may go, but we think we would like to have them plucked up
   by the roots and destroyed as soon as possible. Let those who are the
   subjects of these doubts be sympathized and cheered, but let their
   doubts and fears be rooted out utterly. O Christian Brothers and
   Sisters, it is not impudence, it is not presumption to believe what God
   tells you. If he says "You are justified," do not say "I hope I am."

   If I should say to some poor man--one terribly poor--"I will pay your
   rent for you tomorrow," and he should say, "Well, well, I hope you
   will," I should not feel pleased with him. If you should say to your
   child tomorrow morning, "Well William, I shall buy you a new suit of
   clothes today," and he should say, "Well, Father, I sometimes hope you
   will, I humbly trust, I hope I may say, though I sometimes doubt and
   fear, yet I hope I may say I believe you," you would not encourage such
   a child as that in his uncomely suspicions. Why should we talk thus to
   our dear Father who is in Heaven? He says to us, "I give unto you
   eternal life, and you shall never perish, neither shall any pluck you
   out of My hand." Is it humility for us to reply, "Father, I do not
   believe you, I cannot think it is possible"?

   Oh, no! That is true humility which sits at the feet of the Promiser
   because it is humble--looks up into the face of the Promiser because it
   is trustful--and coats on the word of the promise, because it is
   sincere. He will perform it. Away with you, you Fiends that make me
   doubt! His honor is engaged to the carrying out of His Covenant. He
   will perform it. He says by faith in Christ I am justified. Therefore I
   say, I am justified, and have peace with God, nor shall anyone stop me
   of this glory--I have peace with God through Jesus Christ. I should
   like to hear you all talking in this way and get- ting rid of that old
   Babylonian jargon of "ifs," and "buts," and doubts and fears! Be fully
   persuaded that what He has promised He will fulfill, as those who do
   believe what God has said, just because He has said it. Here is the
   certainty of justification by faith.

   And now, as to the effect produced. When a man can say he has peace
   with God--what then? Why, the first effect is JOY. Who can be at peace
   with God, and have Him for a Father, and yet be miserable? I think I
   told you one night that, years ago, I was waited upon by a woman who
   wished to convert me to a novel sect that had come up with a false
   prophet at its head. She talked much and talked long, and talked all to
   no purpose. At last I told her I thought it best that she should tell
   me her way in which she wished to be saved, on condition that she would
   let me tell her mine.

   I need not tell you what she said, but I said, "This is how I hope to
   be saved--it is said in God's Word, 'This is a faithful saying and
   worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to
   save sinners.' And it is also written, 'he that believes on Him shall
   be saved.' Now, I do trust in Him, and I believe that, therefore, I
   shall be saved. No, more, I am saved and my sins are all forgiven. A
   perfect righteousness, namely, that of Christ, is cast about me, and I
   am so saved today that nothing by any possibility shall ever destroy
   me. I am saved forever." The woman said, "If I believed that that were
   true, I would very gladly give up my faith for anything so bright as
   that. But you," she said, "you ought to be the happiest man in the
   world." And I said, "I thank you for that word and so will I be, God
   helping me, for I ought to be. I have the utmost cause."

   And so should every Believer feel he ought to be, because this great
   salvation, this solid hope, this rocky foundation for our everlasting
   peace should give us quiet, and calm, and security, till our joy should
   overflow and become an anticipation and an foretaste of the joy of
   Heaven. This peace should give the Believer, beyond, and in addition to
   his joy, a calm resignation, no, a delightful acquiescence in his
   Father's will. Now smite me if You will, my Father, for I am Your
   friend and You are mine. Now send the flames, for it shall only
   chasten, but cannot kill. Now take away my goods, for You are my All,
   and I cannot lose You. Now let the floods of trouble come, for You are
   my ark, and though the floods come around me higher and higher, still I
   shall abide in You, secure from reach of harm, while You shut me in!

   Thus with calm composure the Believer walks along over life's hills and
   dales. And when he comes to the valley of the shadow of death he fears
   no evil, for his God is with him, His rod and His staff do comfort him.
   What fear is there to the man that is at peace with God? Life?--God
   provides for it. Death?--Christ has destroyed it. The grave?--Christ
   has rolled away the stone and broken the seal. Affliction, tribulation,
   famine, peril, or the sword? "No, in all these things we are more than
   conquerors through Him that has loved us." To have peace with God,
   Beloved, I cannot tell you what innumerable streams of good shall flow
   to you from this ocean of pleasure, and these rivers of delight. I have
   but skimmed over one of these placid streams. There are hundreds of
   blessed practical results that are sure to follow from a certain
   conviction of our peace with God through Jesus Christ.

   II. In drawing to a close, I want to address myself to THREE CHARACTERS
   THAT I HAVE NO DOUBT ARE REPRESENTED HERE IN THIS LARGE CONGREGATION.

   There is a man here tonight--I know he is here, though I do not know
   his name--a man who many years ago was a professor of religion. He has
   never been easy in his conscience since he forsook the ways of God.
   There has been some trembling hope sometimes in him that there was a
   little life, not quite extinct. And since he has come in here, he feels
   quite like a stranger in the House of Prayer, where once faces were so
   familiar. And there is, perhaps, a groaning in his spirit as he says,
   "O that I knew the way of peace, and the sense of peace for which in
   happier days I once enquired. I have lost my roll, if I ever had it. I
   have lost my character, and with my character, my faith--and with my
   faith my hope. Can I ever be at peace with God?"

   Backslider, if you have ever been called by Divine Grace, let me ask
   you this question. Do you remember the time when you had a hope? Say,
   does not memory revive before you that time, when on your knees in
   agony, you did cry unto Him that hears prayer, and the mercy came, and
   your spirit rejoiced in pardon bought with blood? Man, do you remember
   it? The tear is on your cheeks now. You were not a hypocrite--let us
   hope that it was not all hypocrisy--not all a lie and a delusion. You
   did feel, then, that Christ could save. And you did trust yourself with
   Him.

   Now then, Man, do the same tonight--and the dew of your youth will be
   restored unto you. Your leprosy is white upon your brow, but wash in
   Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again unto you, even as a
   little child. Jehovah seeks you. He cries unto you tonight, and by the
   lips of His ambassador says, "Return, O backsliding children, return
   unto Me for I am married unto you, says the Lord. You have wearied Me
   with your sins, you have made Me to serve with your iniquities, but I,
   even I, am He that blots out your transgressions for My name's sake,
   and will not remember your sins."--

   "To your Father's bosom pressed, Once again a child confessed, From His
   house no more to roam. Come, and welcome, Sinner come."

   "Oh, but I have forsaken Him." Lay aside your "buts, "and "ifs." He
   bids you come. Away with you, you doubts and fears, and black
   despairing thoughts! The sinner comes, and Jesus meets him. There is
   the kiss of His love. "Take off his rags, clothe him, put shoes upon
   his feet, bring forth the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and
   be merry, for this, My son, which was dead, is alive again, he was lost
   and is found." O, I wish I could persuade you--though you are growing
   old now--I wish I could persuade you to fling yourself at the foot of
   His dear Cross again! His hands are still nailed--He has not moved them
   yet. His feet are still fast--He has not stirred from the place where
   He waits for you--His arms still open wide. O believe Him! He is love,
   still, and the blood is mighty, still, and the plea in Heaven is
   all-prevailing, still. "Believe in the Lord Jesus and you shall be
   saved."

   Then I wanted to have said a word to some here who are not backsliders,
   exactly, but they have lost their peace for a little time. Many young
   Christians are subject to these little fits in which their evidence
   gets dark, and they lose their peace. I have no need to say more to
   you, Brothers and Sisters, while you are walking in darkness and see no
   light. "Let him trust," is a prophetic admonition--it shall be mine
   tonight. When you cannot see a single reason why you should be saved
   except that God says you shall, let that be enough for you. When you
   have nothing here, or there, or anywhere to look to. When there is no
   hope for you except in that Man whose wounds are bleeding, always think
   that is enough-- because it is--and come to Christ just as you came at
   first.

   I find it very convenient to come every day to Christ as a sinner--as I
   came at first. "You are no saint," says the devil. Well, if I am not, I
   am a sinner--and Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners. Sink
   or swim, there I go-- I have no other hope--

   "And when your eye of faith is dim, Still trust in Jesus, sink or swim.
   And at His footstool bow your knee, For Israel's God your peace shall
   be." On Christ with all my weight I lean. And as I throw myself upon my
   bed to sleep, so on Christ will I stretch myself full length to
   rest--for He is able and He is willing. And if He can fail, then He
   fails me and fails all His Church. But if He cannot, then I shall see
   His face in Glory everlasting!

   By your leave, I must have two or three words with those who never had
   peace. I shall be brief. I have no doubt I address many here who never
   had faith, and you are wanting to get it. I ask you, first of all, not
   to seek peace at all as the first object. For, if you want peace before
   you get Divine Grace, you want the flower before you get the root--and
   you will be apt to be like little children who, when they have a piece
   of garden given them, will go and pluck up the flowers out of their
   father's bed, and put the flowers into their own ground and then say,
   "What a nice garden I have got!"

   But to their dismay, on the morrow all is withered. Better put the
   roots in, and wait a week or two till they sprout--and then the flowers
   will be living ones, not borrowed ones. Do not seek after peace first.
   Seek after CHRIST first. Peace will come next. Still, I pray you, do
   not think that peace is a qualification for Grace. If you fancy this,
   you will be in error, indeed. You are to come to Christ as Nicodemus
   did, by night, that is, in the night of your ignorance, in the night of
   your fear and trouble. You must come just as you are, bringing nothing
   to Christ, but coming empty-handed. No money, no price, no fee,
   "nothing to pay."

   He asks of you nothing but that you would take all gratis from His
   liberal hand. And will you please remember that if you put your eye on
   anything but Christ, or anything with Christ--so as to disturb your
   whole thought and attention from being directed exclusively to
   Him--then peace will be an impossibility to you. If your eye is single,
   your whole body shall be full of light. But if you mix another trust,
   and so your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. Do
   not trust your repentance! Do not trust your faith! Do not rely upon
   your feelings! Do not depend upon your knowledge--above all, do not
   depend upon your sense of need.

   Do not come to Christ as a sensible sinner--do not come trusting
   Christ, feeling that you are a man who has a right to come--that you
   answer to a certain character that may come. But come because you are a
   sinner. Because you have nothing to recommend you. Because, if God
   should search you through and through, He could not find a point in
   you, a spot in you large enough to put the point of a pin upon that
   which was good. Come because you are vile, to be pardoned. Come,
   because you are black in sin, to be washed. Come, because you are
   penniless, to be made rich.

   Look for nothing else except in Christ. Write this for your
   motto--"None but Jesus." Oh, men and women, and Brothers and Sisters,
   if those Israelites of old, who were inside their houses that night,
   had gone outside to the lintel of their doorpost and said, "Now here is
   this lintel made of very common wood, we will paint and grain it." And
   if they had then gone inside and trusted to the painting and graining
   of the lintel, the destroying angel would have found them out and
   destroyed them. If, again, they had said, "We will write up our name
   over the door--it is a respectable name. We will record the list of our
   charities and good works over the door," the angel would have smitten
   through the whole, and there would have been a wailing through the
   house as through the houses of the Egyptians.

   But what did they do? They took the blood. They marked the lintel and
   the two side posts and smeared them with a crimsoned stain. Then in
   they went, and sat contentedly down--or stood at last in peace--and ate
   the Passover with joy. And, while the shrieks of Egypt went up in the
   cold midnight air, the sons of Israel went up also into Heaven, for the
   angel of death, when he spread his wings on the blast, had seen the
   blood and by that mark he knew that he must pass by that habitation and
   smite none that were there.

   The word of the Lord was not "When I see your faith," but "when I see
   the blood, I will pass over you." Oh, Soul, if you trust Christ, the
   blood is on your brow tonight! Before the eyes of God no condemnation.
   Why, then, need you fear? You are safe, for the blood secures every
   soul that once is sheltered thereby. Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,
   and you shall be saved. But if you believe not, trust where you may,
   you shall be damned. God help you to believe in Christ for His name's
   sake. Amen.

                                   Pentecost

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 24, 1863, BY THE REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "When the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one
   accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of
   a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were
   sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire,
   and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy
   Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit ga ve them
   utterance." Acts 2:1-4.

   How absolutely necessary is the Presence and power of the Holy Spirit!
   It is not possible for us to promote the glory of God, or to bless the
   souls of men, unless the Holy Spirit shall be in us and with us. Those
   who were assembled on that memorable day of Pentecost were all men of
   prayer and faith. But even these precious gifts are only available when
   the celestial fire sets them on a blaze. They were all men of
   experience--most of them had been preachers of the Word, and workers of
   miracles. They had endured trials and troubles in company with their
   Lord, and had been with Him in His temptation.

   Yet even experienced Christians, without the Spirit of God, are weak as
   water. Among them were the Apostles and the seventy evangelists. And
   with them were those honored women in whose houses the Lord had often
   been entertained, and who had ministered to Him of their substance. Yet
   even these favored and honored saints can do nothing without the breath
   of God, the Holy Spirit. Apostles and Evangelists dare not even attempt
   anything alone. They must tarry at Jerusalem till power is given them
   from on High. It was not a want of education. They had been for three
   years in the college of Christ, with perfect Wisdom as their Tutor,
   matchless eloquence as their Instructor, and immaculate Perfection as
   their example. Yet they must not venture to open their mouths to
   testify of the mystery of Jesus until the anointing Spirit has come
   with blessed unction from above!

   Surely, my Brothers and Sisters, if it was so with them, much more must
   it be the case with us. Let us beware of trusting to our well-adjusted
   machineries of committees and schemes. Let us be jealous of all
   reliance upon our own mental faculties or religious vigor. Let us be
   careful that we do not look too much to our leading preachers and
   evangelists, for if we put any of these in the place of the Divine
   Spirit, we shall err most fatally. Let us thank God for all gifts, and
   for all offices, but oh, let us ever be reminded that gifts and offices
   are but as sounding brass and tinkling cymbals, unless the quickening
   Influence is present.

   It has been said by certain modern theologians that we make this
   doctrine of dependence upon the Holy Spirit far too prominent, and that
   our constant teaching of this Truth has a tendency to benumb all human
   effort, and foster indifference and sloth. Surely it is not so, my
   Brothers and Sisters. Let us refute this slander by our own
   earnestness, and let it be seen that those of us who confess that
   without their Lord they can do nothing, are able with His aid to do
   everything! O may we be so inflamed by the Eternal Fire that our life
   may be all zeal and love, self-sacrifice and labor! So shall we teach
   the gainsayer that the worshippers of the gracious Spirit are not
   loiterers in the vineyard of the Lord.

   I am persuaded that so far from speaking too frequent upon this matter,
   we do not often enough extol the Blessed Spirit, and certain ministries
   almost ignore His existence. You might attend some Chapels and not even
   know that there was a Holy Spirit at all except for the benediction.
   And were it not for the liturgy, and the, "Glory be to the Father and
   to the Son and to the Holy Spirit," there are many of our national
   edifices where you might never know that a Comforter had been sent to
   us.

   Now I earnestly pray that this morning I may stir up your minds by way
   of remembrance, by a simple exposition of the descent of the Holy
   Spirit at Pentecost. We are not observers of days and months, but it
   happens to be the season of the year in which the early Church was
   accustomed to celebrate the outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost. We
   commonly talk of Whitsuntide, or White Sunday--which name is not
   without its lesson in the earlier centuries on this particular day--in
   commemoration of the great Baptism of the three thousand converted
   under the preaching of Peter. It was the custom of the Church to hold a
   great Baptism, and the candidates for immersion being, as with us,
   robed in white-- (therefore the name "Candidates," or "White
   Ones")--and so that Sunday was called White Sunday.

   It was not ill that the outpouring of Pentecost should be celebrated by
   the Baptism of converts, for the cause is always best remembered by the
   effect. May our Lord help us to enjoy a Pentecost all the year round
   and may the pool of Baptism be stirred every week.

   I shall call your attention to the season when the Spirit was poured
   out. Secondly, to the manner in which it was manifested. And then to
   the matter itself. And, fourthly, to the results which followed.

   I. There is much holy teaching in THE SEASON when the Spirit of God was
   given. "When the day of Pentecost was fully come." We may observe,
   first, that the Spirit of God was given in God's chosen and appointed
   time. There is a set time to favor Zion. The Spirit is not at all times
   alike active in His manifest workings. Both to try our faith and to
   prove His own sovereignty, the right hand of the Lord is sometimes
   thrust into His bosom. He will only make bare His arm at such times and
   seasons as He, Himself, has appointed. "The wind blows where it lists,"
   is a Truth of God well calculated to hide pride from man.

   Brethren, if every drop of rain has its appointed birthday, every gleam
   of light its predestinated pathway, and every spark of fire its settled
   hour of flying upward, certainly the will, foreknowledge, and decree of
   God must have arranged and settled the period of every revival and
   place of every gracious visitation. Times of refreshing, in a Church or
   a commonwealth, come not except as the Creator-Spirit has determined.
   The day of salvation to each individual is an appointed time. The
   second birth is not left to hazard.

   Yes, more--every breath of that Divine Spirit which sweeps across the
   mind of the Believer, every drop of sacred oil which anoints him, or of
   the holy dew which quickens him--comes to him according to that
   irresistible will which looses the bands of Orion, or binds up the
   sweet influences of the Pleiades in God's accepted and appointed time.
   Therefore, the light of Heaven shall go forth, and although this is not
   to withhold or restrain us from asking for the Spirit every day, it is
   to encourage us if He does not at once begin to work, for if the vision
   tarries we are to wait for it, it shall come in due time--it will not
   tarry.

   There was a further mystery in the season, for it was after the
   ascension of our Lord. The Spirit of God was not given till after Jesus
   had been glorified. The various blessings which we receive are
   ascribable to different parts of Christ's work. His life is our imputed
   righteousness. His death brings us pardon. His resurrection confers
   upon us justification. His ascension yields to us the Holy Spirit, and
   those spiritual gifts which edify the body. He says, when He ascended
   up on High, He led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men. He gave
   some, Apostles, and some, Prophets, and some, evangelists, and some,
   pastors and teachers--for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of
   the ministry--for the edifying of the body of Christ.

   As when Roman heroes returned from blood-red fields, and the Senate
   awarded them a triumph, they rode in their chariot drawn by milk-white
   steeds through the thronging streets of the capitol. So did Jesus
   Christ, when He led captivity captive, receive a triumph at His
   Father's hands. The triumphal chariot bore Him through the streets of
   Glory, while all the inhabitants, with loud acclaim, saluted Him as
   Conqueror--

   "Crown Him! Crown Him! Crowns become the Victor's brow!" It was the
   custom of the Roman conqueror, as he rode along, to distribute large
   quantities of money which were scattered among the admiring crowd. So
   our glorified Lord scattered gifts among men, yes, to the rebellious,
   also, He gave those gifts that the Lord God might dwell among them. In
   this manner, then, to grace the triumph of Jesus, the Spirit of God was
   liberally poured out upon the Church below.

   Perhaps you remind me that our Lord had ascended ten days before. I
   know He had, but the delay might teach them patience. Not always does
   the flower bloom from the root in one hour. Christ has ascended, and
   Heaven is ringing with His praise. They have kept ten days of joyous
   holiday before the Eternal Throne, and now, when Pentecost is fully
   come, the rushing mighty wind is heard. Do you think, my Brothers and
   Sisters, that we plead Christ's ascension enough as a reason why the
   Church should be blessed with the Spirit? I know we often reach as far
   as, "By Your agony and bloody sweat, by Your Cross and passion, by Your
   precious death and burial, by Your glorious resurrection"--but do we
   proceed to, "by Your ascension we beseech You to hear us?"

   I am afraid we fail to perceive that the ascension of Christ is to be
   used as an argument in prayer, when we would have the Church revived by
   the holy breath of God, or have gifts bestowed upon her ministers and
   Church officers. Moreover, there is yet more teaching in the season. It
   was at Pentecost. Many of the early writers say that Pentecost was the
   time when the Law was proclaimed upon Mount Sinai. Others think it
   doubtful. If it is so, it was very significant that on the day when the
   Law was issued amid thunders and lightning, the Gospel--God's new and
   better Law--should be proclaimed with mighty wind and tongues of fire.

   We are clear, however, that Pentecost was a harvest festival. On that
   day the sheaf was waved before the Lord, and the harvest consecrated.
   The Passover was to our Savior the time of His sowing, but Pentecost
   was the day of His reaping, and the fields which were ripe to the
   harvest when He sat on the well, are reaped now that He sits upon the
   Throne.

   But certainly the Spirit of God was given at Pentecost because there
   was then the most need of Him. On that occasion vast crowds were
   gathered from all regions. The God of Wisdom always knows how to time
   His gifts. What would have been the use of granting the many tongues
   when no strangers were ready to hear? If there had been no Parthians
   and Medes, and Elamites, and dwellers of Mesopotamia collected in
   Jerusalem, there would have been no need for the cloven tongues. But
   inasmuch as the city was full, and the high festival was being kept by
   unusual multitudes, it was most fit and right that now the Lord should
   say--"Thrust in your sickle, for the harvest of the earth is ripe."

   Dear Friends, I think that whenever we see unusual gatherings of men,
   whenever the Spirit of hearing is poured out upon the people, we ought
   to pray for, and expect an unusual visitation of the Spirit. And when I
   look upon these crowds assembled in this house every Sunday year after
   year, I can but entreat you to cry mightily to Him with whom is the
   residue of the Spirit, that He would give us a Pentecost. Though
   neither Parthians, nor Medes, nor Elamites are here, yet there scarcely
   ever passes a Sunday without there being representatives of almost all
   nations under Heaven who hear the wonderful works of God. Not in their
   own tongue, it is true, but yet in a language which they understand.
   Oh, pray that the Spirit of God may fall upon the unexampled hosts
   assembled here!

   Still, dear Friends, we have not dwelt upon a leading reason why the
   Holy Spirit descended at this special season. "They were all with one
   accord in one place." We have been expecting to see the days of Heaven
   upon earth. Our soul has longed to hear the voice of God thundering out
   of Heaven. We have hoped for days such as our fathers have told us
   comforted them in the old times. We looked to see thousands born in a
   day--alas, the vision comes not. But look at our country! We have had
   spasms of revival--that is as much as I can say. Even the Irish
   revival, for which we can never sufficiently bless God, was but as a
   passing cloud. It was not an abiding, resting shower, and so with all
   the shakings we have had in these later times.

   We have had but glimpses where we wanted sights. We have had but
   twilight where we needed the sacred, everlasting noon. What is the
   reason for this? Perhaps it is to be found in our want of union. "They
   were all with one accord in one place." Christians cannot all be in one
   place. We have no room that would be large enough to hold them, blessed
   be God! But if they cannot all be in one place, yet they can all be of
   one accord. Oh, when there are no cold hearts, when there are no
   prejudices to divide us, no bigotries to separate us, no apathy to hold
   us down, no false doctrine to separate the flocks from one another--and
   no schism to rend the one sacred garment of Christ--then may we expect
   to see the Spirit of God resting upon us!

   And in any Church where there is no strife as to who shall be the
   greatest, no division about peculiarities, no fighting for
   respectabilities--but when the Church is of one accord--then may we
   expect to hear the sound of abundance of Heaven's rain. Note, dear
   Friends, what they were doing. They were not merely unanimous, but they
   were earnest about one grand object. They had all been praying. Read
   the first chapter and you will perceive that they had been much in
   prayer. The whole of the time since the ascent of our Lord they had
   been occupied in constant supplication. And so, pleading both day and
   night, it was no great wonder that the granaries of Heaven should be
   unlocked!

   We have had weeks of prayer at the beginning of the last few years, and
   it was well. But if we had continued in prayer all the weeks of the
   year, if we had always been with one accord still crying unto Heaven,
   still wrestling with the angel, still interceding--surely the little
   cloud, like a man's hand, which the eye of faith has seen--would by
   this time have covered all the heavens, and have discharged a plenteous
   shower upon all nations of men! There must be unity, but that unity
   must not be the frozen union of death. It must be the glorious welding
   of a glowing furnace. They had been much in prayer, and now I see them
   sitting still. Why do they sit so quietly? It is the quietude of
   expectation.

   When God's Church adds expectation to supplication, then a blessing
   tarries no longer. We ask, but we do not expect to receive. We pray,
   but probably nothing would so alarm us as the answer to our prayers.
   If, after having pleaded with God to send His Holy Spirit, the Holy
   Spirit did come, there are many who would not believe it. There are
   others who would think it a mere excitement, and there are multitudes
   who would shut their eyes to it altogether. Oh Spirit of God! Work in
   the hearts of Your children perfect harmony, intense anxiety, and
   confident expectation--and then will You come to do Your mighty deeds
   once more!

   These remarks concerning the season may lead to many practical
   questions. I will but put them rapidly and leave them. Do I help to
   hinder the coming of the Spirit by any bitterness of my temper? Do I by
   any want of love tend to divide the Church? Are my prayers such as are
   likely to prevail? And when I pray, do I expect the blessing of God? If
   not, how mournful that I should be the means of restraining and
   limiting the Holy One of Israel! That I should be a Church robber and
   commit sacrilege against the Church of God--not by stealing its gold
   and silver--but by closing the treasury of God! Let us, as a Church,
   humble ourselves under the hand of God and then, girding up the loins
   of our mind, wait upon Him with patience and earnestness until the
   Spirit is poured out from on High!

   II. I come now, dear Friends, in the second place, to notice THE MANNER
   IN WHICH THE SPIRIT WAS GIVEN. Each word here is suggestive.
   "Suddenly." No herald sounded his trumpet, but as they were expecting,
   in a moment, the celestial tempest came. If the Lord is about to do any
   great work in the world we must not be astonished if we hear of its
   coming like a thunderclap. Man sits down and plans, and arranges and
   works, and everybody knows what he is aiming at. God also plans and
   arranges, and forestalls Himself. But He does not tell man what His
   purpose is. It is the Glory of God to conceal a thing, and so, though
   the Spirit may have been secretly preparing men's hearts, yet the real
   work of revival is done suddenly, to the surprise of all observers.

   You will have noticed it was so in the great revival in New England,
   when Jonathan Edwards stood up and read his manuscript sermon, holding
   the manuscript close to his eyes, because he was nearsighted--a method
   of preaching which I should think would be the very least likely ever
   to cause an excitement in the audience. And yet while he preached from
   that text--"Their feet shall slide in due time," the Spirit of God
   suddenly came down--the people began to tremble and even cry out under
   the terrors of conviction--and the awakening spread throughout all that
   region and many thousands were added to the Church of Christ.

   Was it not so with Livingstone at the Kirk of Shotts. The presbytery
   had been holding long services and preaching sermons without any great
   results. And just at the close, Livingstone was asked to preach.
   Standing on a gravestone, in the midst of a driving shower, he
   addressed the assembled crowd, and down came the Holy Spirit--more
   mighty than the shower which fell from Heaven--and hundreds were born
   in one day to Christ. It was the same under George Whitfield, in the
   notable revivals of which he was the agent. The Spirit came like
   lightning from the skies. Do not be suspicious when you hear of these
   things suddenly appearing.

   You remember, yourselves, an instance which wakes all your hearts to
   gratitude. You remember a Chapel with but a handful of people in it who
   could scarce see from one to another. Did the crowds come by slow
   degrees? Was it a life-work to build up a Church? No, but the trumpet
   sounded. The prepared ears heard it. The house was thronged. The Church
   grew and multiplied--and now we who are members of it bless God for His
   mercies every day. When God says, "Let there be light" there is light.

   Then there was a sound. Although the Spirit of God Himself is silent in
   His operations, yet the operations are not silent in their results. The
   sound would teach them that the Spirit of God was not come to be
   concealed in their hearts as a silent guest, but to be heard throughout
   the world as the voice of God. For now faith was come by hearing, and
   hearing by the Word of God. And a sound as of a mighty rushing wind,
   was a type to them of the sound of their own testimony which was to go
   forth throughout all the world even unto the ends thereof. To their
   ears the speaking hurricane would say, "Even so, we, a handful of
   converted men, are to sweep around the globe like a mighty wind. And
   men are to be compelled to hear the sound of mercy."

   Then it was a sound, notice, as of wind. It is remarkable that both in
   the Greek and in the Hebrew tongues, the word used for wind and for
   Spirit is the same. Hence, when the Savior said to Nicodemus, "The wind
   blows where it lists, and you hear the sound thereof," the type might
   have been suggested to him by the fact of the word having the double
   signification of the wind and of the Spirit. The wind is doubtless
   chosen as a significant emblem because of its mysteriousness-- "You can
   not tell where it comes, nor where it goes." Because of its
   freeness--"It blows where it lists." Because of diversity of its
   operations, for the wind blows a gentle zephyr at one moment, and later
   it mounts to a howling blast. The Holy Spirit at one time comes to
   comfort, and at other times to alarm--at one season softly with the
   promise--and at another time terribly with the threat.

   Observe it was rushing. this portrayed the rapidity with which the
   Spirit's influences spread--rushing like a torrent. Within fifty years
   from that date of Pentecost, the Gospel had been preached in every
   country of the known world. Paul and his Brothers, the Apostles, had
   journeyed east, west, north and south. Iron gates had been , and bars
   of brass had been snapped, and the glorious life-giving Word had been
   preached to every creature under Heaven for a witness against them.
   God's Spirit does not creep and crawl as too often our unspiritual
   agencies do. When He comes, it is a rush--and half the world is lit
   with Divine light before we dream that the match has struck.

   Nor is this all, for it was mighty, a wind against which nothing could
   stand. The house itself might be shaken. They may have been greatly
   alarmed for fear the house should fall about their heads. The wind was
   irresistible, and so is the Spirit of God--where He comes, nothing can
   stand against Him. O Spirit of God, if You would but now come as a
   rough north wind, the crescent of Mohammed would be prostrate in the
   dust, and the gods of the heathen would fall upon their faces like
   Dagon before the Ark. You have but to proceed in Your sevenfold
   operations, and the harlot of Rome would lose her enchanting power. You
   can dash in pieces the hoary systems which have resisted all human
   attack. Mightier than the tooth of time, Your finger, O sacred Spirit,
   could destroy what man reckons to be his everlasting workmanship.

   Glory be to God, wherever the Spirit comes He proves Himself to be
   Divine by the Omnipotence which He displays. They heard, then, a sound
   as of a rushing mighty wind. Although we never expect to hear a sound
   like this, yet we do expect, dear Christian Friends, to have the
   reality. We hope yet to see the Spirit of God mysteriously at work, and
   we hope to hear the sound thereof, the glad tidings cheering our
   hearts. We love to see nations born in a day. We do yet believe that
   before our eyes are closed in death, we shall see God's arm stretched
   out and the irresistible might of His Spirit felt by His enemies.

   Consider the next sentence. "Which filled all the place where they were
   sitting." The sound was not merely heard by the disciples, but it
   appeared to penetrate the other chambers besides that large upper room
   where they were probably gathered together. Ah, and when the Spirit of
   God comes, He never confines Himself to the Church. The influence may
   not be saving to those without, but it is felt by them. A revival in a
   village penetrates even the pothouse. The Spirit of God at work in the
   Church is soon felt in the farmyard, known in the workroom, and
   perceived in the factory. It is not possible for the Spirit to be
   confined when once He comes.

   Oh, if He should but visit this place, Walworth and Camberwell and
   Southwark must all know it. The very streets should be made to wear a
   different aspect! And whereas we now have to walk down long rooms of
   shops still open on the Sunday, we should doubtless see them closed,
   for the Spirit of God would fill all the place where His Church was
   located. May such glad times come, when from one end of England to
   another, the Spirit of God shall fill all men in all places, because He
   dwells specially with His chosen people.

   But this was not all. I must now mention what I think was the
   appearance seen. It was a bright luminous cloud, probably, not unlike
   that which once rested in the wilderness over the tribes by night. A
   fiery pillar was seen hovering in the upper part of the room. The cloud
   is mentioned as "it," so that it seems to have been one, and yet it is
   called "tongues," so that it must have been many. In the Greek there is
   a unique commingling of singular and plural in the verbs, which can
   hardly be accounted for, unless there really did exist a singularity,
   and a plurality at the same time.

   There floated in the room, I think, one mass of flame, a great cloud of
   fire. This suddenly divided, or was cleft--and separate tongues of fire
   rested upon the head of each of the disciples. They would understand
   that thus a Divine power was given to them, for such a figure was by no
   means unusual or far-fetched. Heathens have been accustomed to
   represent in their statues, beams of light, or flames of fire
   proceeding from their false deities. And to this day the cloudy
   radiance with which Roman Catholic painters always adorn the heads of
   saints is a relic of the same idea. It was said by the an- cients of
   Hesiod, the first of all the poets, that whereas he was once nothing
   but a simple neat-herd, yet suddenly a Divine flame fell upon him, and
   he became from then on one of the noble of men.

   We feel assured that so natural a metaphor would be at once understood
   by the Apostles. A tongue of fire resting upon them would be a token of
   a special inspiration from God. Notice first it was a tongue, for God
   has been pleased to make the tongue do mightier deeds than either sword
   or pen. And though the pen shall speak to ages yet to come, yet never
   with that living force which trembles from the tongue. For what we read
   in a book is but dead, but that which we hear with the ear comes as a
   living word to the soul. It pleases God, by the foolishness of
   preaching, to save them that believe.

   Then it was a tongue of fire, to show that God's ministers speak, not
   coldly, as though they had tongues of ice. Nor learnedly as with
   tongues of gold, nor arrogantly as with tongues of brass. Nor
   plaintively as with tongues of willow, nor sternly as with tongues of
   iron--but earnestly, and in a mystery--not as with tongues of flesh,
   but with the tongue of flame. Their words consume sin, scorch
   falsehood, enlighten the darkness, and comfort the poor. Notice,
   moreover, that "it SAT upon them." It did not flicker or remove. It
   remained there. So the Spirit of God is an abiding Influence, and the
   saints shall persevere. It sat upon each of them, so that while there
   was but one fire, yet each Believer received his portion of the one
   Spirit. There are diversities of operations, but it is the same Lord.

   I will not tarry longer with the description of how the Spirit came
   except to observe that I would to God that He would manifest Himself in
   the same manner this day. We want our young men to have tongues of
   fire. And you, fathers, we long to see you also kindled by the live
   coal which touched the lips of Isaiah. Even you, my Sisters--for
   doubtless that tongue of fire rested upon the Virgin Mary and upon the
   other women--we would like to see it rest on you, that in your
   families, in your Sunday school classes, or in your visitations and
   nursing of the sick, you may have the Holy Fire abiding in you.

   Oh, may God be pleased to send forth the Comforter to each of us! May
   none of us be without His power, for the set time to favor Zion shall
   have come when both men and women of every rank and degree shall have
   received the Spirit of the blessed God. I am afraid this does not
   interest you. You think it happened a long while ago, and is not likely
   ever to occur again. And I am afraid it is not while we remain so
   indifferent to it, but, oh, if we had the anxiety to desire it, and the
   faith to expect it, we might see greater things than these. Without the
   outward sign, which was but for the babyhood of the Church, we might
   receive the inward and spiritual Grace fit for the full grown man of
   the advanced Believers of our time.

   III. Consider now THE MATTER ITSELF, the benefit which now was given.
   Of the matter itself, we react very briefly that, "they were all filled
   with the Holy Spirit." The sound was not the Holy Spirit, nor was the
   tongue of fire the Holy Spirit--these were but the symbols of His work.
   The real work was done when all present were filled with the Holy
   Spirit. What is this? What is this strange mystery? The skeptic sneers
   and says, "There is no such thing." The formal religionist says, "I
   have never felt it." And the most of Christians think it something to
   be devoutly believed in, but by no means to be experienced.

   Is there a Holy Spirit? My Hearer, you dare not ask that question,
   unless you are prepared to involve a doubt of your own conversion, for,
   "Except a man be born of the Spirit, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
   And if, therefore, the Holy Spirit does not dwell in you, and has not
   made you a new creature by His miraculous operations, you are still in
   the gall of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity. Only the true
   Christian knows what it is to receive the Spirit--but there are only a
   few Christians who know what it is to be filled with Him--to be filled
   with Him to the brim.

   There are times when the preacher has known it, when he had no need to
   ask himself what he should say, nor in what language he should couch
   his thoughts--for the thoughts were born all dressed, and armed--and
   they sprung not from him but through him, of the Holy Spirit. There are
   times when the soul is full of calm, for the dove is there--full of
   passion for the fire is there--full of life, for the wind is
   there--full of growth, for the dew is there--full of Divine priesthood
   and the power to bless, for the oil is there. And there are times when
   the soul is full of knowledge, for the light is there--purged and
   cleansed, because the fountain of Living Water flows within.

   There are, it is true, seasons when the man has to complain that he
   cannot discover any of these signs. But oh, there are glad and high
   days when God's anointed servants feel borne upon the mystic Wind aloft
   in thoughts sublime. Then they are no longer weak men, but men inspired
   to break hard hearts, to stir emotions, to quicken the dead, to open
   blind eyes, and to preach the Gospel to the poor--and all by the Power
   from on High. You who have felt the sublime sensation of being filled
   with the Spirit may read of Ezekiel's being lifted by a lock of his
   hair between earth and Heaven--but you know that to be filled with the
   Spirit is a greater wonder still, for that lifts a man up from worldly
   cares, enables him to lay hold upon God in prayer, bathes him in the
   joy of Heaven--and then sends him down with shining face to bless his
   fellow men.

   The flesh trembles in the dust because the great Spirit has come to our
   spirit's help, and flesh must lose all dominion, but our spirit
   rejoices with great joy. Observe the difference between Peter with the
   Spirit, and Peter without the Spirit! There he is, cursing and swearing
   like a sailor. He never knew Christ, he says. There he is, sinking in
   the sea, he does not believe that he can walk upon the waters, and he
   cries, "Lord, save, or I perish." Peter, the braggart, the rash man,
   and yet the coward! Look at him now--the Spirit of God has come upon
   him. How different is Peter! Fearless of all the jeers and taunts which
   the ribald crew might cast at him, he stands up to preach.

   Why has this man eloquence? He speaks mightily and not as the scribes.
   Lo, the people are moved under him as the green corn is moved by the
   wind, or as the waves of the sea are swept by the gale. And when he has
   finished preaching he goes up to the temple and commands a lame man to
   leap, and the miracle is worked! He is brought before the rulers and
   commanded to hold his peace, and he answers like a hero, "Whether it is
   right to obey man rather than God, you judge." Peter is found traveling
   over every country, preaching the Word in every tongue, and at last, he
   that was once a coward cheerfully stretches out his aged arms to be
   nailed to a cross, but head downwards, as though he felt he was not
   worthy to die like his Master. He expires upon the tree, glorifying
   Christ in his death!

   There is no comparison to be drawn. It is a case of clear contrast
   between Peter the unspiritual, and Peter full of the Holy Spirit. No
   man or woman among you knows what he might be if he were filled with
   the Spirit. What is that rough Luther? He is only fit to have been a
   killer of bullocks, or a feller of oaks in the forest. But fill Luther
   with the Holy Spirit and what is he? He takes the bull of Rome by the
   horns, slays wild beasts of error in the great arena of the Gospel, and
   is more than a conqueror through the might which dwells in him! Take
   John Calvin--fit naturally to be a cunning lawyer, cutting and dividing
   nice points, judging this precedent, and that, frittering away his time
   over immaterial niceties.

   But fill him with the Holy Spirit, and John Calvin becomes the mighty
   master of Divine Grace, the reflection of the wisdom of all past ages,
   and a great light to shed a brilliant ray even till the Millennium
   shall dawn! Chief, and prince, and king of all uninspired teachers, the
   mighty seer of Geneva, filled with the Spirit of God is no more John
   Calvin, but a God-sent angel of the Churches! Who knows what yonder
   young man may be? I know today he is but as other men--fill him with
   the Spirit, let it move him in the camp of Dan--and woe to the
   Philistines!

   Who knows what that young woman may be? She may sit under the oak
   quietly with Deborah now, but the day may come when she shall stir up
   Barak and put a song into his mouth, saying, "Awake, awake, O Barak,
   lead your captivity captive, you son of Abinoam!" Only let us be filled
   with the Spirit and we know not what we can be. We shall, "Laugh at
   impossibility and say, 'It shall be done.' " We shall attempt what we
   never dreamed of before, and accomplish that which we always thought to
   be far beyond our grasp.

   IV. Our last point is--THE RESULT OF IT ALL. Well, well, you will it a
   very commonplace sort of thing. After all this rushing mighty wind,
   this fire and so on, what are you expecting? Kings trembling in the
   dust, or riding in their chariots to do homage to the Apostles? Shall
   the wind blow down dynasties--shall the fire consume dominions? Nothing
   of the kind, my Brothers and Sisters! Nothing of the kind! Spiritual
   and not carnal, is the kingdom of God. The result lies in three
   things--a sermon, a number of enquirers, and a great Baptism! That is
   all! Yes, but though it is all, it is the grandest thing in all the
   world--for in the judgment of the angels and of those whom God has made
   wise unto salva-tion--these are three most precious matters.

   There was a sermon. The Spirit of God was given to help Peter to preach
   a sermon. You turn with interest to know what sort of a sermon a man
   would preach who was full to the brim with the Holy Spirit. You expect
   him to be more eloquent than Robert Hall, or Chalmers, of course. More
   learned than the Puritans, certainly. As for illustrations, of course
   you will have the loftiest flights of poetic genius. You may expect,
   now, to have all the orations of Cicero and Demosthenes put entirely in
   the shade. We shall have something glorious now!

   No such thing! No such thing! Never was there a sermon more commonplace
   than that of Peter's, and let me tell you that it is one of the blessed
   effects of the Holy Spirit to make ministers preach simply. You do not
   want the Holy Spirit to make them ride the high horse and mount up on
   the wings of the spread eagle to the stars. What is wanted is to keep
   them down, dealing with solemn subjects in an intelligible manner. What
   was the theme of this sermon? Was it something so intellectual that
   nobody could comprehend it, or so grand that few could grasp it?

   No, Peter just rises up and delivers himself somewhat like this--"Jesus
   Christ of Nazareth lived among you. He was the Messiah promised of old.
   You crucified Him, but in His name there is salvation, and whoever
   among you will repent and be baptized shall find mercy." That is all! I
   am sure Mr. Charles Simeon in his, "Skeleton Sermons," would not have
   inserted it as a model. And I do not suppose that any college professor
   alive would ever say to his students--"If you want to preach, preach
   like Peter." Why, I do not perceive it firstly, secondly, thirdly or
   fourthly, to which some of us feel compelled to bind ourselves. It is,
   in fact, a commonplace talking about sublime things--sublime things
   which in this age are thought to be foolishness and a stumbling block.

   Well then, may the Spirit of God be poured out to teach our ministers
   to preach plainly, to set our young men talking about Jesus Christ--for
   this is absolutely necessary. When the Spirit of God goes away from a
   Church, it is a fine thing for oratory, because then it is much more
   assiduously cultivated. When the Spirit of God is gone, then all the
   ministers become exceedingly learned, for not having the Spirit they
   need to supply the emptiness His absence has made. And then the
   old-fashioned Bible is not quite good enough. They must touch it up a
   bit, and improve upon it. The old doctrines which used to rejoice their
   grandmothers at the fireside are too stale for them--they must have an
   improved and a new theology.

   And young gentlemen nowadays show their profound erudition by denying
   everything which is the prop and pillar of our hope, and start some new
   will-o'-the-wisp which they set their people staring at. Ah, well, we
   want the Spirit of God to sweep all that away. Oh that my dear Sister
   who conducts the female class, and all who are in the Sunday school may
   be helped just to talk to you about Christ. When you get the Spirit of
   God to come upon you like fire, and like a rushing mighty wind, it will
   not be to make you doctors of divinity, and scholars, and great
   elocutionists. It will only be just for this--to make you preach Christ
   and preach Him more simply than ever you did before.

   The next result was that the people were pricked in the heart and began
   to cry, "Men and Brothers and Sisters, what shall we do?" What a
   disorderly thing to do at a sermon. Usher! Put that man out of the
   Church! We cannot allow people to be calling out, "What must I do to be
   saved?" Blessed disorder, blessed disorder, which the Spirit of God
   gives! This will be the result of all sermons in which there is the
   Presence of God. Men will feel that they have heard something which has
   gone right into their inmost nature--that they have received a wound
   which they can by no means heal. And at the next enquiry meeting there
   will be many saying, "How can I find peace? How can I get my sins
   forgiven?"

   What next? Why, where the Spirit of God is, there will be faith, and
   there will be an outward confession of it in Baptism. "Well, well,"
   says one, "I did not think we were to see all this rushing mighty wind,
   and tongues of fire just to get a few commonplace sermons and
   conversions and Baptisms." But I tell you again it is the conversions
   and baptisms which make the arches of Heaven ring! I do not believe
   there was one extra note in Heaven on the day when the Princess of
   Wales rode through London. We all went and gazed and admired, but I do
   not believe that one angel ever opened one eye to look at it. He saw
   nothing there which struck him.

   But wherever there is a groaning, and a sobbing, and a sighing after
   the Savior, a longing after reconciliation--and above all, where there
   is a renewed heart dedicating itself openly to Jesus, where there is a
   soul that says--"I will be buried with my Master. I will be obedient to
   His command, and despite every opposition, I will go down with Him into
   the liquid grave. I will be numbered with the ridiculed men and women
   who acknowledge that they are dead to the world and only alive to
   Christ"--I say it is in such a case that angels rejoice, and this it is
   for which we want the Spirit of God.

   I have done when I have sown this thought. See, dear Friends, see the
   absolute importance of repentance, and of faith, and of Baptism. I pray
   you, if the Spirit of God comes all the way from Heaven to work these,
   be not satisfied till you receive them. See, again, the importance of
   preaching, for the Spirit of God descends only to help the preacher.
   And then see, last of all, the all-importance of the Holy Spirit.
   Without Him we cannot preach, and we cannot hear so as to believe and
   be saved. May I beg you, as you go your way, to entreat the Lord to be
   with us according to His own promise--"If you, being evil, know how to
   give good gifts unto your children, much more shall your heavenly
   Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him."

                            A Precious Drop Of Honey

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 31, 1863, BY THE REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Behold, I ha ve inscribed you upon the palms of My hands." Isaiah
   49:16.
   GOD'S promises are not exhausted by one fulfillment. They are manifold
   mercies, so that after you have opened one fold and found out one
   signification, you may unfurl them still more and find another which
   shall be equally true, and then another, and another, and another,
   almost without end. Like the cherubim, God's promises have a face for
   every quarter of the earth, and like the wheels, they are full of eyes
   for every trial of the chosen people. The Lord knows how to speak
   many-handed promises. His words, like the trees of the New Jerusalem,
   bear twelve manner of fruits, and yield their fruit every month.
   No doubt the text and the preceding promises all refer to the seed of
   Abraham. God will not cast them away. He does no more forget them than
   does a woman forget her sucking child. They shall return to their own
   land and accept Messiah, the Prince whom they have so long despised.
   But the seed of Abraham is the grand type of the Church. And therefore
   we believe that every word here, in its widest and most extensive
   sense, belongs to the elect of God--those who are written in the Lamb's
   Book of Life, and for whom Jesus shed His blood. We feel persuaded that
   the favor which is shelved to the whole body is given to each member,
   and therefore any true Believer who is, through faith, one of the
   spiritual seed of Abraham, may take the promises to himself and say,
   "Thus says the Lord unto my soul. Thus and thus speaks He comfortably
   concerning me."

   I believe, I say, that the text before us belongs primarily to the seed
   of Israel. Next, to the whole Church as a body. And then to every
   individual member. Understand it so, and may each one of you, even
   though you are numbered among the little in Israel, have Divine Grace
   to draw forth marrow and fatness out of the inexpressibly rich text
   which today the Spirit of God presents to us.

   I intend, first of all, to consider our text verbally, pulling it to
   pieces word by word. Then next, to consider it as a whole. And then, to
   incite you by it as a whole, to consider what is the conduct demanded
   of you by a Truth of God so sweet.

   I. First of all, then, my text is one of those remarkable sentences in
   which EVERY SINGLE WORD DESERVES TO BE EMPHASIZED. We will begin with
   the first word, "Behold." "Behold, I have inscribed you upon the palms
   of My hands." "Behold," is a word of wonder. It is intended to excite
   admiration. Wherever you see it hung out in Scripture, it is like an
   ancient signboard, signifying that there are rich wares within, or like
   the hands which solid readers have observed in the margin of the older
   Puritan books, drawing attention to something particularly worthy of
   observation.

   Here, indeed, we have a theme for marveling. Heaven and earth may well
   be astonished that God should ever inscribe upon His hands the names of
   sinners. That rebels should attain so great a nearness to His heart as
   to be written upon the palms of His hands! Well might the angels
   wonder, and those bright spirits be lost in amazement, for unto which
   of the angels said He at any time, "I have inscribed you upon the palms
   of My hands"? What cherub ever attained this dignity, or to what seraph
   was this honor awarded? But to man, who is but a worm. To the son of
   man who is but dust and ashes. To man who has rebelled, who has lost
   all claim upon God's favor, and deserves His hottest wrath--to man is
   this consolation given, "I have inscribed you upon the palms of My
   hands."

   Speak of the seven wonders of the world! Why this is a wonder in the
   seventh heavens! No doubt a part of the wonder which is concentrated in
   the word "Behold," is excited by the unbelieving lamentation of the
   preceding sentence. Zion said, "The Lord has forsaken me, and my God
   has forgotten me." How amazed the Divine mind seems to be at this
   wicked unbelief of man! What can be more astounding than the unfounded
   doubts and fears of God's favored people? He seems to say, "How can I
   have forgotten you, when I have inscribed you upon the palms of My
   hands? How can it be? How dare you doubt My constant remembrance, when
   the memorial is set upon My very flesh?"

   Unbelief, how strange a marvel you are! I know not which most to wonder
   at, the faithfulness of God or the unbelief of His people! He keeps His
   promise a thousand times, and yet the next trial makes us doubt Him. He
   never fails. He is never a dry well. He is never as a setting sun, a
   passing meteor, or a melting vapor--and yet we are as continually vexed
   with anxieties, molested with suspicions, and disturbed with fears--as
   if our God were fickle and untrue. Here follows the great marvel--that
   God should be faithful to such a faithless people! And that when He is
   provoked with their doubts, He nevertheless abides true.

   Behold! Behold! I say and am ashamed and confounded for all your cruel
   doubts of your indulgent Lord. I remarked that the "Behold" in our text
   is intended to attract particular attention. There is something here
   worthy of being studied. If you should spend a month over such a text
   as this, you should only begin to understand it. It is a gold mine.
   There are nuggets upon the surface, but there is richer gold for the
   man who can dig deep. I can only indicate the veins of gold--it is for
   you afterwards in your meditations to follow them out.

   1 pray you, be very careful with the text--lose not a drop of the wine
   of consolation contained in its precious crystal--be prayerful and
   anxious to grind forth from this wheat every atom of its fine flour.
   Leave no meal to grow stale in this barrel. Drain all the oil from this
   cruse, for where God sets a "Behold," depend upon it, there is a
   something that is not to be trifled with, nor to be passed over in
   indifference.

   We pass on now to the next word, "Behold, I have inscribed you upon the
   palms of My hands." The Divine Artist, who has been pleased to engrave
   His people for a memorial, is none other than God Himself. Here we
   learn the lesson which Christ afterwards taught His disciples--"You
   have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you." No one can write upon the
   hands of God, but God Himself. Neither our merits, prayers, repentance,
   nor faith can write our names there, for these in their goodness extend
   not unto God so as to write upon His hands.

   Nor did blind chance or mere necessity of fate inscribe our names. But
   the living hand of a living Father, unprompted by anything except the
   spontaneous and Omnipotent love of His own heart, wrote the names of
   His people upon His own hands. How dependent are we upon God! If my
   name is in the Lamb's Book of Life, how ought I to adore the
   sovereignty of the Divine Grace which placed it there! Had it not been
   there, I could not have inscribed it. Had it not been found in the
   list, no archangel could, by any possibility, have inserted it--

   "What if my name should be left out When You for them shall call?"

   It is a black thought to any of us, but when I know that it is not left
   out, but is written there among the bright spirits chosen of God, and
   precious, how this should make me leap for joy! "I have inscribed you."
   Then, again, if the Lord has done it, there is no mistake about it. If
   some human hand had cut the memorial, the hieroglyphs might be at
   fault. But since perfect Wisdom has combined with perfect Love to make
   a memorial of the saints, no error by any possibility can have
   occurred. There can be no erasures, no crossing out of what God has
   written, no blotting out of what the Eternal has decreed. Fixed, and
   fixed forever must be the inscription which is of Divine Authorship.

   The powers of darkness cannot erase those everlasting lines. "I have
   inscribed you upon the palms of My hands." Soul, this is enough to
   overwhelm you with humble adoration that God should so much as take
   notice of you. When you receive the daily tokens of Divine care, ought
   you not to exclaim with David--"When I consider Your heavens, the work
   of Your fingers, the moon and the stars which You have ordained, what
   is man that You are mindful of him, and the son of man that You visit
   him?" But how is it, Lord, that You can go farther than this, and You
   Yourself write the names of these insignificant mortals upon Your own
   hands?

   "I have inscribed you." It is wonderful to see how God comes into
   immediate contact with His saints, and appears in Person in all His
   acts of Grace towards them. In other works it is His far-reaching
   voice, but in the wonders of His Grace it is His present hand. In the
   making of worlds, He stands at a distance, and speaks His will. But
   when He creates saints, and redeems His people, He comes out of His
   chambers--He rends the heavens and comes down--He reveals Himself as a
   God near at hand. He stands over His work as the potter over the clay
   upon the wheel.

   It is written that when He made the heavens and the earth, "the morning
   stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy." But I
   never hear that God sang. There is nothing in the merely material
   universe to stir the Infinite heart. The work is not dear enough to
   Him, nor so full of satisfaction as the grand work of redeeming love.
   When He saved His people--when He created Israel for Himself, I hear it
   said--"He shall rest in His love. He shall rejoice over you with
   singing." Oh, matchless verse, in which the Eternal Trinity burst forth
   into sacred song! Do you not catch the strain even now. "I have done
   it. I have come forth Myself out of the secret of My tabernacle wherein
   I have concealed Myself from the gaze of men, and 'I have inscribed you
   upon the palms of My hands.' "

   Take the next word. We have many wells here out of which we may draw
   water. "Behold, I have inscribed you." Not, "I will," you see. Nor yet,
   "I am doing it." It is a thing of the past, and how far back in the
   past! Oh, the antiquity of this inscription! They take us to the
   British Museum and show us most reverend writings which are the
   memorials of those hoary ages--which were the first born of the years
   beyond the flood. But here is an inscription older than them all.
   Compared with it, Assyrian antiquities and Egyptian records are things
   of yesterday. Before the young earth had burst her swaddling bands of
   mist, yes, before the globe had been begotten, or yonder sun had darted
   his infant arrows, or yonder stars had opened their eyes, the Eternal
   had fixed His eyes of love upon His favorites.

   Fly back as far as you will, until this present world and all the
   worlds within the universe sleep in the mind of God, like unborn
   forests in an acorn cup, and even then you have not reached the time.
   Before all time when it was first said-- "I have inscribed you upon the
   palms of My hands." "From everlasting to everlasting You are God." From
   everlasting to everlasting You are the same, and Your people's names
   are written on Your hands!

   Yet, methinks there may be a prophetic reference here to a later
   writing of the names, when Jesus Christ submitted His outstretched
   palms to those cruel engraving tools, the nails. Then was it surely,
   when the executioner with the hammer smote the tender hands of the
   loving Jesus, that He engraved our names upon the palms of His hands.
   And today when He points to those wounds, when by faith He permits us
   to put our fingers into the prints of the nails, He may still say to
   us--

   "Deep on the palms of both My hands I have engraved Your name."

   Well, Christian, do not these deep things comfort you? Have you no
   consolation in the ancient things of the everlasting mountains? Does
   not eternal love delight you? God is no stranger to you. He has known
   you long before you knew yourself--yes, long before you were curiously
   worked in the lowest parts of the earth--in His book all your members
   were written, which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was
   none of them. Known unto God from the foundation of the earth were you.
   He was always thinking of you. There was never a period when you were
   not in His mind and on His heart. "I have inscribed you upon the palms
   of My hands."

   But the next word is "inscribed." My dear friend, The Rev. John
   Anderson, of Helensburgh, whom I am glad to welcome here today, told me
   this morning that while traveling in the east he has frequently seen
   persons with portraits of their friends upon their hands, so that
   wherever they went, as one in this country would carry the portrait of
   a friend in a brooch or a watch, they carry these likenesses printed on
   their palms.

   I said to him, "Surely they would wash out." They might by degrees, he
   said, but they frequently had them pricked in with strong indelible
   ink, so that there, while the palm lasts, there lasts the memorial of
   the friend. Surely this is what the text refers to. I have inscribed
   you in. I have not merely printed you, stamped you on the surface, but
   I have permanently cut you into my hand with marks which never can be
   removed. That word "inscribed" sets forth the perpetuity of the
   inscription. Not on the hand of man but on the hand of God is it
   engraved.

   Oh, mysterious thought! On that hand immortal and eternal is it dug,
   engraved in. Our engravers press upon their tools. They tell us how
   stern the labor when they cut the hard metal to mark each line, and God
   has thus engraved--with the whole strength of Omnipotence He has leaned
   upon the tool to cut our names into His flesh! Was there not such an
   engraving at Calvary? Is it not written, "It pleased the Father to
   bruise Him. He has put Him to grief"? It is as if eternal strength, I
   say, leaned upon that engraving tool to write the memorial of His
   chosen people in the hands of Jesus. "I have inscribed you upon the
   palms of My hands."

   We need not indulge the dark foreboding that we shall be lost, but we
   may sing with Hammond--

   "If Jesus is ours we have a true Friend, Whose goodness endures the
   same to the end. Our comforts may vary, our frames may decline,

   We cannot miscarry. Our aid is Divine. The hills may depart and
   mountains remove, But faithful You are O fountain of love! The Father
   has inscribed our names on Your hands, Our record, in Heaven, eternally
   stands."

   Shall we stop to take that next word? Scarcely may I preach from it,
   but you should meditate upon it constantly. "I have inscribed you upon
   the palms of My hands." My Lord, do You mean me? Yes, even me, if I, by
   faith, cling to Your Cross. I am not shut out from Your heart of love,
   if by faith I have entered into Your happy family. I know that You
   remember me or You would never have helped me to remember You. Glory be
   to You, O my gracious Lord."

   But I want you, my beloved Brothers and Sisters, to notice that the
   word runs, "I have inscribed you." It does not say, "Your name." The
   name is there, but that is not all--"I have inscribed you." See the
   fullness of this! I have inscribed your person, your image, your case,
   your circumstances, your sins, your temptations, your weaknesses, your
   wants, your works. I have inscribed you--everything about you--all that
   concerns you. I have put you altogether there. It is not an outline
   sketch, you see. It is a full picture, as though the man himself were
   there. What? Do you dare dream that God forgets you? Will you ever say
   again that your God has forsaken you when He has engraved you--not your
   name, I say, but everything that concerns you--upon His own palms?

   "Oh," says one, "but I am in such a plight this morning." Well, He has
   inscribed that there. "Ah," says another, "I am so weak and so feeble!"
   That, too, is engraved there. "I have inscribed you." The Omniscient
   God knows you better than you know yourself--and whereas you are
   conscious of some sin and some imperfection--He knows that you have an
   infinitude of sin and a vastness of infirmity. He has put it all
   there--"I have engraved you." I say, again, this is a thing too great
   to be talked of, but more fit to be read, marked, learned, and digested
   in the silence of your closet.

   You have never inscribed yourselves so well upon the tablets of your
   own knowledge as God has inscribed you upon those blessed tablets--the
   palms of His hands. Yes, I dare to say it--our indulgent God as much
   thinks of one saint as if there were no other saint--and no other
   created thing in all the world. Our Covenant God so recollects and
   cares for His child, that if the whole universe were dissolved and had
   departed like a shadow, and our Lord had but one man to fix all His
   Divine Grace upon, He would not watch him more, nor more carefully and
   lovingly see after his best interests, than He now cares for each one
   of His people. "I have inscribed you upon the palms of My hands."

   We have up to now taken every word, but we must now take the next two
   or three. Remember we are inscribed, where? Upon His hands, not upon
   the works of His hands. They shall perish--yes, they shall all wax old
   as does a garment. But His hands shall endure forever and ever. We are
   not inscribed upon a seal, for a seal might be slipped from the finger
   and laid aside. The hand itself can never be separated from the living
   God. It is not inscribed or engraved on a huge rock, for a convulsion
   of nature might rend the rock by an earthquake, or the fretting tooth
   of time might eat the inscription out. Our record is on His hands,
   where it must last, world without end. Not upon the back of His hands
   where it might be supposed that in days of strife and warfare the
   inscription might suffer damage, but there upon the palms of His hands
   where it shall be well protected, so that even--

   "When God's right arm is bared for war, And thunder clouds His stormy
   cry," even then, when He smites with His fist, His people shall be well
   protected within the palms of His hands.

   The most tender part shall be made the place of the inscription, that
   to which He is most likely to look. That which His fingers of wisdom
   enclose, that by which He works His mighty wonders shall be the
   unceasing remembrance, pledging Him never to forget His chosen. Do
   notice, it does not say, "I have inscribed you upon the palm of one
   hand," but "I have inscribed you upon the palms of My hands." There are
   two memorials. His saints shall never be forgotten, for the inscription
   is put there upon the palm of this hand, the right hand of blessing,
   and upon the palm of that hand, the left hand ofjustice. I see Him with
   His right hand beckon me--"Come you blessed," and He sees me in His
   hand.

   And on that side He says, "Depart you cursed," but not to me, for He
   sees me in His hand, and cannot curse me. Oh, my Soul, how charming
   this is, to know that His left hand is under your head, while His right
   hand does embrace you. Both hands are marked with the memorial--this
   left hand, which is the hand of cursing, cannot curse me, for it is
   under my head. It cannot smite, for it has become my strength and my
   stay, my pillow and my rest. While His right hand does embrace me, to
   keep me safe from death, and Hell--and to preserve me and bring me to
   His eternal kingdom in Glory.

   Now I am conscious that I cannot work out the beauty of this passage. I
   am equally conscious that you cannot either, unless you have much
   longer time for meditation than such a short service as this can afford
   you. Take it home and look at it again and again, especially laying an
   emphasis on the word "you." And oh, if you can render it--"He has
   inscribed me, me, me, upon the palms of His hands." If your soul can
   know that God has you daily in remembrance, and neither can, nor will,
   forget you, then you will dance before the Ark of the Lord. And if
   Michal mocks, you may answer her as David did--"The God that chose me,
   made me to dance." Eternal Election and Indissoluble Union are truths
   which make Believers rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.
   "Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, you righteous, and shout for joy all
   you that are upright in heart."

   II. Now let us proceed to the second part of the subject, which is to
   CONSIDER THE TEXT AS A WHOLE. "I have inscribed you upon the palms of
   My hands." This seems to show us, first of all, that God's remembrance
   of His people is constant. The hands, of course, are constantly in
   union with the body. In Solomon's Song we read, "Set me as a seal upon
   Your hands." Now this is a very close form of remembrance, for the seal
   is very seldom laid aside by the Eastern, who not being possessed with
   skill in the art of writing his name, requires his seal in order to
   affix his signature to a document. Therefore the seal is almost always
   worn, and in some cases is never laid aside.

   A seal, however, might be laid aside, but the hands never could be. It
   has been a custom, in the olden days especially, when men wished to
   remember a thing, to tie a cord about the hand, or a thread around the
   finger by which memory would be assisted. But then the cord might be
   snapped or taken away, and so the matter forgotten. But the hand and
   that which is printed into it must be constant and perpetual. O
   Christian, remember that by night and by day God is always thinking of
   you. From the beginning of the year even to the end of the year, the
   Lord's eyes are upon you, according to His precious Word--"I, the Lord
   do keep it, I will water it every moment, lest any hurt it. I will keep
   it night and day."

   Your remembrance of God is intermittent. You thought of Him this
   morning when you rose from your beds. You are trying to think of Him
   now, and this evening, again, your thoughts will go up to Him. These
   are only times and seasons of remembrance, but God never ceases to
   recollect you. The finite mind of man cannot constantly be occupied, if
   it is to engage in other pursuits, with any one thought. But the
   gigantic mind of God can think of a million trains of thought at once.
   He is not confined to thinking of one thing, or working out one problem
   at a time. He is the great many-handed, many-eyed God. He does all
   things, and meditates upon all things, and works all things at the same
   time--therefore He never is called away by any urgent business so that
   He can forget you.

   No second person ever comes in to become a rival in His affection
   towards you. You are fast united to your great Husband, Christ, and no
   other lover can steal His heart. But Jesus, having chosen you, does
   never allow a rival to come. You are His beloved, His spouse, the
   darling of His heart, and He has Himself said, "My eyes and my heart
   are toward you continually." Every moment of every day, every day of
   every month, and every month of every year, is the Lord continually
   thinking upon you, if you are one of His.

   Still further, the text as a whole seems to show us that this
   recollection on God's part is practical. We are engraved upon His
   heart--this is to show His love. We are put upon His shoulders--this is
   to show that His strength is engaged for us. And also upon His hands,
   to show that the activity of our Lord will not be separated from us. He
   will work and show Himself strong for His people. He brings His
   Omnipotent hands to effect our redemption. What would be the use of
   having a friend who would think of us, and then let his love end in
   thought? The faithfulness we want is that of one who will act in our
   defense. We need one who so cares for us that against every arrow of
   the adversary He will lift up the shield. And for every want will find
   a supply. We want an active sympathy from God. Surely this is the
   intention of the text. "I have inscribed you upon the palms of My
   hands."

   He has done all He has done as if everything that He touched left a
   memorial of His people on it--as if every work He did, He did it with
   the same hands that carved the remembrance of His people. Do you see
   the drift of it? If He molds a world between His palms and then sends
   it wheeling in its orbit--it is between those palms which are stamped
   with the likeness of His sons and daughters--and so that new work shall
   minister to their good. If He divides a nation, it is always with the
   hand that bears the remembrance of Zion. Scripture itself tells us
   this, "When He divided the nations, He set the bounds of the people
   according to the number of the children of Israel."

   The great wheel of Providence, when God makes it revolve, works for the
   good of the people whom He has called according to His purpose. There
   are many strings, but they are all in one hand, and they all pull one
   way--to draw a weight of glory to the chosen. There are many wheels and
   innumerable cogs, and as you and I look about us, we cannot understand
   the machinery. We cry, "O wheels, what do you work?" But the end, the
   end, if you stood there and saw the end of everything, you would see
   that God has stamped all the wheels with the memory of His children, so
   that the result is always good and only good to those whom He has
   inscribed on the palms of His hands. It is, then, a practical as well
   as a constant sympathy.

   Next, dear Friends, and to the children of God this will be a
   delightful thought, this is an eternal remembrance. You cannot suppose
   it possible that any person can erase what is written on God's hands.
   The Scriptures tell us that we are in the hands of Christ, and that
   none shall pluck us out. Some Arminians say we can slip out. But how
   can we slip out if we are engraved there? We may well defy all the
   devils in Hell, with all their craft, even to forge a plan by which
   they can get at the palms of God's hands. I cannot think of a thing
   that should seem more impossible, more tremendously impossible, than
   that any creature--whether it be life or death, things present or
   things to come--should ever be able to reach the palms of God's hands,
   so as to erase our names. Our hymn is not wrong when it says--

   "Once in Christ, in Christ forever,
   Nothing from His love can sever." And Toplady made no mistake when he
   said--
   "My name from the palms of His hands
   Eternity will not erase.
   Impressed on His heart it remains
   In marks of indelible Grace--
   Yes, I to the end shall endure,
   As sure as the earnest is given.
   More happy, but not more secure,
   The glorified spirits in Heaven."
   "I have inscribed you upon the palms of My hands."

   Still I have not drained my text dry. Let the treader of the winepress
   tread the grapes once more, and more holy wine shall flow there from
   this memorial--how tender! How tender, I say, because it is inscribed
   on the hands. We have heard of one, an eastern queen, who so loved her
   husband that she thought even to build a mausoleum to his memory was
   not enough. She had a strange way of proving her affection, for when
   her husband's bones were burned she took the ashes and drank them day
   by day, that, as she said, her body might be her husband's living
   sepulcher.

   It was a strange way of showing love and there was a marvelous degree
   of strange, fanatical fondness in it. But what shall I say of this
   Divine, celestial, unobjectionable, sympathetic mode of showing
   remembrance by cutting it into the palms? Words fail to express our
   intense content with this most admirable sign of tenderness and fond
   affection. It appears to me as though the King had said, "Shall I carve
   my people upon precious stones? Shall I choose the ruby, the emerald,
   the topaz? No. For these all must melt in the last general
   conflagration. What then? Shall I write on tablets of gold or silver?
   No, for all these may canker and corrupt, and thieves may break through
   and steal.

   "Shall I cut the memorial deep on brass? No, for time would fret it,
   and the letters would not long be legible. I will write on Myself, on
   My own hands, and then My people will know how tender I am, that I
   would sooner cut into My own flesh than forget them. I will have my Son
   branded in the hands with the names of His people, that they may be
   sure He cannot forsake them. Hard by the memorial of His wounds shall
   be the memorial of His love to them, for, indeed, His wounds are an
   everlasting remembrance." How loving, then, how full of superlative,
   super-excellent affection is God toward you, and toward me in so
   recording our names.

   Weary not when I yet further remark, that this memorial is most
   surprising. Scripture, which is full of wonders, yet allows a "Behold"
   to be put before this verse--"Behold!" If the things I have been saying
   are enough to make you won-der--the deep sea of the text, without
   bottom and without shore--would much more cause you to hold up your
   hands in astonishment. Child of God, let your cheerful eyes, and your
   joyful heart testify how great a wonder it is that you, once so vile,
   so hard of heart, so far estranged from God, are this day written on
   the palms of His hands. And then I close this point by saying it is
   also most consolatory. When God would meet Zion's great doubt--"God has
   forgotten me," He cheers her with this--"I have inscribed you upon the
   palms of My hands."

   Where are you this morning, Mourner--where are you? Ah, you may well
   hide your head for shame. You said yesterday, when trial after trial
   came --

   "My God has quite forgotten me; My Lord will be gracious no more." Here
   is God's answer to you this morning--"It cannot be. I cannot forget
   you, for I have inscribed you upon the palms of My hands."--

   "Forget you, I will not, I cannot, your name Engraved on My heart does
   forever remain; The palms of My hands while I look on, I see The wounds
   I received when suffering for you." There is no sorrow to which our
   text is not an antidote. If you are a child of God, though your
   troubles have been as innumerable as the waves of the sea, this text,
   like the channels of the ocean, can contain them all. I care not this
   morning though you have lost everything, though you came here a
   penniless bankrupt beggar--so long as you have this text you are rich
   beyond a miser's dream!

   You may have forgotten your own mercy. Your own experience may seem a
   dream to you. The devil may tell you that you never knew the Lord. Your
   own sins may bear evidence in the same way--but if you have believed in
   the Lord Jesus Christ, the Covenant made with David's Lord must not,
   and cannot, be broken. "I have inscribed you upon the palms of My
   hands." Come, drooping Saint, lift up your head! You dreary, downcast
   Brother, be of good cheer! If Christ remembers you, what more can you
   want? The dying thief's extremity could not suggest a prayer larger
   than, "Lord, remember me!"--and your greatest sorrow cannot ask for a
   more complete assuagement than this--"Lord, show me that You have
   inscribed me upon the palms of Your hands."

   III. And now we come to the last point, upon which only a hint. I said
   the last point would be to EXCITE YOU TO THE DUTY WHICH SUCH A TEXT
   SUGGESTS.

   Beloved in our Lord Jesus Christ, if you are partakers of this
   inestimably precious text, let me say, first of all, is it not your
   duty to leave your cares behind you today? We do not want any valuables
   left behind in the Chapel, but these cares can be swept out tomorrow
   morning when the women clear away the rubbish--and I am sure the
   dustbin never contained viler stuff. Leave them here today. What are
   you fretting about? Is not a Christian inconsistent when he is full of
   carking care? Should not the fact that God always graciously and
   tenderly remembers you, compel you once and for all to leave your
   burden with Him who cares for you?--

   "The Lord our Leader goes before,
   Sufficient He and none besides.
   And were the dangers many more,
   We need not fear with such a Guide.
   Through snares, through dangers and through foes
   He leads, whose arm almighty is--
   What, then, if earth and Hell oppose?
   We need not fear if we are His."

   Then, if you must not have cares, I think you should not have those
   deep sorrows and despairs. Lift up your head! Jehovah remembers you,
   Man! The billows cannot drown him whom the Lord of Hosts ordains to
   bring to shore. Be glad in your God, and His perfect love. Do you not
   think that joy becomes a man to whom such a text as this belongs? Wipe
   your brow. It is true, the sweat stands on it, but your greatest labor
   is done--Christ has finished it for you. There need, at least, be no
   sweat of trepidation and alarm upon your face. He cannot forget you.
   You have what angels envy. You have what poor mourning souls would give
   their eyes to win--what troubled consciences would give their blood to
   buy.

   Be glad! Why should the children of such a King go mourning any one of
   their days? Now lift up your heads and bathe them in the sunlight of
   God. Take the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for
   the spirit of heaviness. I am certain that the man who wears such a
   gold chain about his neck need not bear the rags of penury. The man who
   wears such a diamond coronet as this upon his brow ought not to behave
   like a poor beggar in the streets. Go not clothed in rags of mourning,
   but put on the scarlet and fine linen of thanksgiving--since God gives
   you this consolation--"I have inscribed you upon the palms of My
   hands."

   One thing more and that is, if this text is not yours, how your mouths
   ought to water after it. It is wrong to covet, but not to covet such a
   thing as this. "Covet earnestly the best gifts." Is there a soul here
   who says, "O that I had a part and lot in this matter! Would God that I
   were saved, that I were written in the palms of Jesus' hands"? Poor
   Soul, if you desire Christ, He desires you. If you have a spark of love
   to Him, His soul is like a fiery furnace of love toward you--and you
   may have His pardoning love shed abroad this morning.

   "How?" you ask. "Whoever believes on Him shall never perish." To
   believe is to trust, and if you trust confidently, simply--just as a
   child trusts to its mother's arms--you shall find that He will never
   fail your trust nor prove untrue to your confidence. May God bring you
   to know yourself, and to know the sweetness of this blessed, blessed
   text, which overwhelms and destroys all power of speech in me, and
   makes me feel the poverty of my thoughts and language.

   God bless you, for Jesus' sake. Amen. Amen.

                             The Young Man'S Prayer

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JUNE 7, 1863, BY THE REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   O satisfy us early with Your mercy, that we may rejoice and be glad all
   our days."

   Psalm 90:14.

   ISRAEL had suffered a long night of affliction. Dense was the darkness
   while they abode in Egypt, and cheerless was the glimmering twilight of
   that wilderness which was covered with their graves. Amidst a thousand
   miracles of mercy, what must have been the sorrows of a camp in which
   every stop was marked with many burials--until the whole trail was a
   long cemetery? I suppose that the deaths in the camp of Israel was
   never less than fifty each day--if not three times that number--so that
   they learned experimentally that verse of the Psalm, "For we are
   consumed by Your anger, and by Your wrath are we troubled."

   Theirs was the weary march of men who wander about in search of tombs.
   They traveled towards a land which they could never reach, weary with a
   work the result of which only their children should receive. You may
   easily understand how these troubled ones longed for the time when the
   true day of Israel should dawn, when the black midnight of Egypt, and
   the dark twilight of the wilderness should both give way to the rising
   sun of the settled rest in Canaan. Most fitly was the prayer offered by
   Moses--the representative man of all that host--"O satisfy us early
   with Your mercy." Hasten the time when we shall come to our promised
   rest. Bring on speedily the season when we shall sit under own vine and
   our own fig tree, "and shall rejoice and be glad all our days."

   This prayer falls from the lips of yonder Brother, whose rough pathway
   for many a mile has descended into the Valley of Death. Loss after loss
   has he experienced, till as in Job's case, the messengers of evil have
   trod upon one another's heels. His griefs are new every morning, and
   his trials fresh every evening. Friends forsake him and prove to be
   deceitful brooks. God breaks him with a tempest. He finds no pause in
   the ceaseless shower of his troubles. Nevertheless, his hope is not
   extinguished, and his constant faith lays hold upon the promise, that,
   "weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning." He
   understands that God will not always chide, neither does He keep His
   anger forever.

   Therefore he watches for deliverance even as they that watch for the
   morning, and his most appropriate cry is, "O satisfy us early with Your
   mercy. Lift up the light of Your countenance upon us. Show Your
   marvelous loving kindness in this present hour of need. O my God, make
   haste to help me, be a very present help in time of trouble. Fly to my
   relief lest I perish from the land. Awake for my rescue, that I may
   rejoice and be glad all my days."

   See yonder sick bed! Tread lightly, lest perchance you disturb the
   brief slumbers of that daughter of affliction. She has tossed to and
   fro days and nights without number, counting her minutes by her pains,
   and numbering her hours with the attacks of her agony. From that couch
   of suffering where many diseases have conspired to torment the frail
   body of this child of woe, where the soul itself has grown weary of
   life, and longs for the wings of a dove, methinks this prayer may well
   arise, "O satisfy us early with Your mercy." "When will the eternal day
   break upon my long night? When will the shadows flee away? Sweet Sun of
   Glory! When will You rise with healing beneath Your wings? I shall be
   satisfied when I wake up in Your likeness, O Lord. Hasten that joyful
   hour. Give me a speedy deliverance from my bed of weakness, that I may
   rejoice and be glad throughout eternal days."

   Methinks the prayer would be equally appropriate from many a distressed
   conscience where conviction of sin has rolled heavily over the soul
   till the bones are sore vexed, and the spirit is overwhelmed. That poor
   heart indulges the hope that Jesus Christ will one day comfort it, and
   become its salvation--it has a humble hope that these wounds will not
   last forever but shall all be healed by Mercy's hand. That He who
   looses the bands of Orion will one day deliver the prisoner out of his
   captivity. Oh, conscience-stricken Sinner, you may on your knees now
   cry out--"O satisfy me early with Your mercy! Keep me not always in
   this house of bondage. Let me not plunge forever in this slough of
   despair. Set my feet upon a rock, wash me from my iniquities. Clothe me
   with garments of salvation and put the new song into my mouth, that I
   may rejoice and be glad all my days."

   Still, it appears to me that without straining so much as one word even
   in the slightest degree, I may take my text this morning as the prayer
   of a young heart, expressing its desire for present salvation. To you,
   young men and maidens, shall I address myself. And may the good Spirit
   cause you in the days of your youth to remember your Creator, while the
   evil days come not, nor the years draw near when you shall say, we have
   no pleasure in them. I hope the angel of the Lord has said unto me,
   "Run, speak to that young man," and that like the good housewife in the
   Proverbs, I shall have a portion also for the maidens!

   I shall use the text in two ways, first, as the ground of my address to
   the young. And then, secondly, as a model for your address to God.

   I. WE WILL MAKE OUR TEXT THE GROUND WORK OF A SOLEMN PLEADING WITH
   YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN TO GIVE THEIR HEARTS TO CHRIST THIS DAY.

   The voice of Wisdom reminds you in this, our text, that you are not
   pure in God's sight, but NEED HIS MERCY. Early as it is with you, you
   must come before God on the same footing as those who seek Him at the
   eleventh hour. Here is nothing said about merit, nothing concerning the
   natural innocence of youth or the beauty of the juvenile character. You
   are not thus flattered and deceived. But Holy Scripture guides you
   aright, by dictating to you an evangelical prayer, such as God will
   deign to accept--"O satisfy us early with your mercy."

   Young men, though as yet no outward crimes have stained your character,
   yet your salvation must be the work of reigning Grace, and that for
   several reasons. Your nature is at the present moment full of sin and
   saturated with iniquity, and therefore you are the object of God's most
   righteous anger. How can He meet an heir of wrath on terms of justice?
   His holiness cannot endure you! What if you are made an heir of Glory?
   Will not this be Divine Grace and Divine Grace alone? If ever you are
   made meet to be a partaker with the saints in light, this must surely
   be Love's own work-- inasmuch as your nature, altogether apart from
   your actions--deserves God's reprobation.

   It is mercy which spares you, and if the Lord is pleased to renew your
   heart, it will be to the praise of the glory of His Grace. Be not
   proud, repel not this certain Truth of God--that you are an alien, a
   stranger, an enemy--born in sin and shapen in iniquity! By nature you
   are an heir of wrath, even as others. Yield to its force, and seek that
   mercy which is as really needed by you as by the hoary-headed villain
   who rots into his grave, festering with debauchery and lust--

   "True you are young, but there's a stone Within the youngest breast
   One-half the crimes which you have done Would rob you of your rest."

   Besides, your conscience reminds you that your outward lives have not
   been what they should be. How soon did we begin to sin! While we were
   yet little children we went astray from the womb, speaking lies.

   How rebellious we were! How we chose our own will and way, and would by
   no means submit ourselves to our parents! How in our riper youth we
   thought it sport to scatter fire-brands and carry the hot coals of sin
   in our bosom! We played with the serpent, charmed with its azure
   scales, but forgetful of its poisoned fangs. Far be it from us to boast
   with the Pharisee--"Lord, I thank you that I am not as others." But
   rather let the youngest pray with the publican--"God be merciful to me
   a sinner." A little child, but seven years of age, cried when under
   conviction of sin--"Can the Lord have mercy upon such a great sinner as
   I am, who have lived seven years without fearing and loving Him?"

   Ah, my Friends, if this babe could thus lament, what should be the
   repentance of those who are fifteen, or sixteen, or seventeen, or
   eighteen, or twenty, or who have passed the year of manhood? What shall
   you say, since you have lived so long, wasting your precious days--more
   priceless than pearls, neglecting those golden years, despising Divine
   things and continuing in rebellion against God? Lord, You know that
   young though we are, we have multitudes of sins to confess, and
   therefore it is mercy, mercy, mercy, which we crave at Your hands!

   Remember, beloved young Friends, that if you are saved in the morning
   of life, you will be wonderful instances of preventing mercy. It is
   great mercy which blots out sin, but who shall say that it is not
   equally great mercy which prevents it? To bring home yonder sheep which
   has long gone astray, with its wool all torn, its flesh bleeding, and
   its bones broken, manifests the tender care of the Good Shepherd. But,
   oh, to reclaim the lamb at the commencement of its straying--to put it
   into the fold and to keep it there and nurture it--what a million
   mercies are here compressed into one! The young saint may sweetly
   sing--

   "I still had wandered but for You; Lord, it was Your own all-powerful
   Word, Sin's fetters broke and set me free, Henceforth to own You as my
   Lord."

   There are depths of mercy to pluck the sere brand from out of the fire
   when it is black and scorched with the flame. But are there not heights
   of love when the young wood is planted in the courts of the Lord and
   made to flourish as a cedar? However soon we are saved, the glory of
   perfection has departed from us, but how happy is he who tarries but a
   few years in a state of nature. As if the fall and the rising again
   walked hand in hand. No soul is without spot or wrinkle, but some
   stains are spots the young Believer is happily delivered from. Habits
   of vice and continuance in crime he has not known. He never knew the
   drunkard's raging thirst. The black oaths of the sailor never dirtied
   his mouth.

   This younger son has not been long in the far country. He comes back
   before he has long fed the swine. He has been black with sin in the
   sight of God, but in the eyes of men, and in the open vision of
   onlookers, the young Believer seems as if he had never gone astray.
   Here is great mercy--mercy for which Heaven is to be praised forever
   and ever. This, me-thinks, I may call distinguishing Grace with an
   emphasis. All election distinguishes, and all Divine Grace is
   discriminating. But that Grace which adopts the young child so early is
   distinguishing in the highest degree! As Hadad was brought up in the
   court of Pharaoh, and weaned in the king's palace, so are some saints
   sanctified from the womb.

   Happy is it for any young man--an elect one out of the elect is he--if
   he is weaned upon the knees of piety and candled upon the lap of
   holiness--if he is lighted to his bed with the lamps of the sanctuary
   and lulled to his sleep with the name of Jesus! If I may breathe a
   prayer in public for my children, let them be clothed with a little
   ephod, like young Samuel, and nourished in the chambers of the temple,
   like the young prince Joash. O my dear young Friends, it is mercy,
   mercy in a distinguishing and peculiar degree, to be saved
   early--because of your fallen nature, because of sins committed, and
   yet more--because of sins prevented, and distinguishing favor bestowed
   by the Grace of God!

   2. But I have another reason for endeavoring to plead with the young
   this morning, hoping that the Spirit of God will plead with them. I
   remark that salvation, if it comes to you, must not only be mercy, but
   it must be mercy through the Cross. I infer that from the text, because
   the text desires it to be a satisfying mercy, and there is no mercy
   which ever can satisfy a sinner, but mercy through the Cross of Christ.
   There is no mercy apart from the Cross. Many say that God is merciful,
   and therefore, surely, He will not condemn them. But in the pangs of
   death and in the terrors of conscience, the uncovenanted mercy of God
   is no solace to the soul.

   Some proclaim a mercy which is dependant upon human effort--human
   goodness or merit--but no soul ever yet did or could find any lasting
   satisfaction in this delusion. Mercy by mere ceremonies or mercy by
   outward ordinances is but a mockery of human thirst. Like Tantalus, who
   is mocked by the receding waters, so is the ceremonialist who tries to
   drink where he finds all comfort flying from him. Young man, the Cross
   of Christ has that in it which can give you solid, satisfying
   comfort--if you put your trust in it. It can satisfy your judgment.
   What is more logical than the great doctrine of Substitution?--God is
   so terribly just that He will by no means spare the guilty, and that
   justice is wholly met by Him who stood in the place of His people!

   Here is that which will satisfy your conscience. Your conscience knows
   that God must punish you. It is one of those Truths which God stamped
   upon it when He first made you what you are. But when your soul sees
   Christ punished instead of you, it pillows its head right softly. There
   is no resting place for conscience but at the Cross. Priests may preach
   what they will, and philosophers may imagine what they please, but
   there is in the conscience of man, in its restlessness, an indication
   that the Cross of Christ must have come from God, because that
   conscience never ceases from its disquiet till it hides in the wounds
   of the Crucified. Never again shall conscience alarm you with dreadful
   thoughts of the wrath to come, if you lay hold of that mercy which is
   revealed in Jesus Christ.

   Here, too, is satisfaction for all your fears. Do they pursue you today
   like a pack of hungry dogs in full pursuit of the stag? Fly to Christ
   and your fears have vanished! What has that man to fear for whom Jesus
   died? Need he alarm himself when Christ stands in his place before the
   Eternal Throne and pleads there for him? Here, too, is satisfaction for
   your hopes. He that gets Christ gets all the future wrapped up in Him.
   While--

   "There's pardon for transgressions past;
   It matters not how black their cast," There are also peace, and joy,
   and safety for all the years and for all the eternity to come in the
   same Christ Jesus who has put away your sin. Oh, I wish, young Man, I
   wish young Woman, that you would put your trust in Jesus now, for in
   Him there is an answer to this prayer--"O satisfy us early with Your
   mercy."

   3. Furthermore, anxiously would I press this matter of a youthful faith
   upon you, because you have a dissatisfaction even now. Do I not speak
   the truth? When looking into the bright eyes of the gayest among you, I
   venture to say that you are not perfectly satisfied. You feel that
   something is lacking. My Lad, your boyish games cannot quite satisfy
   you. There is a something in you more noble than toys and games can
   gratify. Young Man, your pursuits of business furnish you with some
   considerable interest and amusement, but still there is an aching
   void--you know there is--and although pleasure promises to fill it, you
   have begun already to discover that you have a thirst which is not to
   be quenched with water, and a hunger which is not to he satisfied with
   bread. You know it is so.

   The other evening when you were quite alone, when you were quietly
   thinking matters over, you felt that this present world was not enough
   for you. The majesty of a mysterious longing which God had put in you
   lifted up itself and claimed to be heard! Did it not? The other day,
   after the party was over at which you had so enjoyed yourself, when it
   was all done and everybody was gone--and you were quite quiet, did you
   not feel that even if you had these things every day of your life--yet
   you could not be content? You want, you know not what, but something
   you do want to fill your heart.

   We look back upon our younger days and think that they were far happier
   than our present state, and we sometimes fancy that we used to be
   satisfied then, but I believe that our thoughts imagine a great
   falsehood. I do from my soul confess that I never was satisfied till I
   came to Christ. When I was yet a child I had far more wretchedness than
   ever I have now. I will even add more weariness, more care, more
   heartache, than I know at this day. I may be singular in this
   confession, but I make it and know it to be the truth. Since that dear
   hour when my soul cast itself on Jesus, I have found solid joy and
   peace! But before that all those supposed gaieties of early youth, all
   the imagined ease and joy of boyhood were but vanity and vexation of
   spirit to me.

   You do feel, if I know anything about you, that you are not quite
   satisfied now. Well, then, let me say to you again, that I would have
   you come to Jesus. Depend upon it, there is that in Him which can
   thoroughly satisfy you. What can you want more to satisfy your heart
   than love to Him? Our hearts all crave for an object upon which they
   may be set. We often surrender ourselves to an unworthy object which
   betrays us, or proves too narrow to accommodate our heart's desire. But
   if you love Jesus you will love One who deserves your warmest
   affection, who will amply repay your fullest confidence, and will never
   betray it.

   You say that not only does your heart want something, but your head. My
   witness is that there is in the Gospel of Christ the richest food for
   the brain. Before you know Christ, you read, you search, you study, and
   you put what you learn into a wild chaos of useless confusion. But
   after you have found Christ, everything else that you learn is put in
   its proper place. You get Christ as the central sun, and then every
   science and fact begins to revolve round about Him just as the planets
   travel in their perpetual circle around the central orb. Without Christ
   we are ignorant, but with Him we understand the most excellent of
   sciences, and all others shall fall into their proper place.

   This is an age when, without a true faith in Christ, the young mind has
   a dreary pilgrimage before it. False guides are standing, arrayed in
   all sorts of garbs, ready to lead you first to doubt this book of
   Scripture, then to distrust the whole. Then to mistrust God and
   Christ--and then to doubt your own existence and to come into the
   dreary dream land where nothing is certain--where everything is myth
   and fiction. Give your heart to Christ, young Man, and He will furnish
   you with anchors and a good anchor-hold to your mind. And then when
   stormy winds of skepticism sweep across the sea, and other boats are
   wrecked, you shall outride the storm and shall evermore be safe.

   It is a strange thing that people should be so long before they are
   satisfied. Look at some of my hearers today. They mean to be satisfied
   with money. When they were apprentices they thought they should be so
   satisfied when they earned journeymen's wages. But they came to be
   journeymen, and then they were not satisfied till they were foremen.
   And then they felt they never should be satisfied till they had a
   concern of their own. They got a concern of their own and took a house
   in the city--but then they felt they could not be content till they had
   taken the adjoining premises.

   Then they had more advertising and more work to do, and now they begin
   to feel that they never shall be quite easy till they have purchased a
   snug little villa in the country. Yes, there are some here who have the
   villa, and handsome grounds, and so on. But they will not be satisfied
   till they see all their children married. And when they have seen all
   their children married, they will not be at rest then. They think they
   will, but they will not. There is always a something yet beyond. "Man
   never is, but always to be blessed," as Young puts it. There are
   Fortunate Isles for the mariner to reach, and failing these, there is
   no haven for him even in the safest port.

   We know some, too, who, instead of pursuing wealth, are looking after
   fame. They have been honored for that clever piece of writing, but they
   are desirous of more honor. They must write better, still. And when
   they have achieved some degree of notoriety through a second attempt,
   they will feel that now they have a name to keep up, and so they must
   have that name widened, and the circle of their influence must extend.
   The fact is, that neither wealth, nor honor, nor anything that is of
   mortal birth can ever fill the insatiable, immortal soul of man. The
   heart of man has an everlasting hunger given to it, and if you could
   put worlds into its mouth it would still crave for more.

   It is so thirsty that if all the rivers drained themselves into it,
   still, like the deep sea which is never full, the heart would yet cry
   out for more. Man is truly like the horseleech--he forever say, "Give!
   Give! Give!" And until the Cross is given to the insatiable heart, till
   Jesus Christ--who is the fullness of Him that fills all in all--is
   bestowed, the heart of man never can be full. Where shall we find a
   satisfied man but in the Church of Christ? And in the Church of Christ
   I find him, not in the pulpit merely, where success and position might
   satisfy, but I find him in the pew humbly receiving the

   Truth of God.

   I find him in the pew, not among the rich, where earthly comforts might
   tend to make him satisfied, but among the poor, where cold and
   nakedness might cause him to complain. I could point you today to the
   workman who earns every bit of bread he eats with more sweat of his
   brow than you would dream of, but he is content. I could point you to
   the poor work-girl who scarcely earns enough to hold body and soul
   together--and yet in this House of God her heart often leaps for
   joy--for she is wholly resigned. I could show you the bedridden woman
   whose bones come through the skin through long lying upon a bed which
   friendship would gladly make soft, but which is all too hard for her
   weakness-- and yet she is content--though a parish pittance is all that
   is given her to feed upon.

   I say we have no need to exaggerate, or strain, or use hyperboles. We
   do find in the Church of Christ those who have been, and are satisfied
   with the mercy of God. Now, would it not be a fine thing to begin life
   with being satisfied? There are some who do not end it with this
   attainment. They hunt after satisfaction till they come to their dying
   beds, and then still do not find it. But oh, to begin life with being
   satisfied! Not to say at some future date I will be satisfied, but to
   be content now. Not when I have climbed to such-and-such a pinnacle I
   shall have enough, but to have enough now. To begin with satisfaction
   before you launch upon a world of troubles! You may do so, my Brother.
   You may do so, my young Sister, if now with a true heart you look to
   Him who hangs upon yonder Cross, and commit your soul into His keeping,
   praying this prayer--"O satisfy us early with Your mercy."

   The reason which our text gives I must comment upon for a moment. Our
   text says--"O satisfy us early with Your mercy. That we may rejoice and
   be glad all our days." We never rejoice in the true sense of the term.
   We never possess solid gladness till we are satisfied with God's mercy.
   It is all a mockery and a pretence. The reality never comes to us till
   God's mercy visits our heart. But after that, what joy we know! Tell me
   that the Christian is miserable! O Sir, you do not know what the
   Christian is! We need not appear before you with laughing faces, for
   our joy is deeper than yours, and needs not express itself out in
   immodest signs.

   The poor trader puts all his goods in the window, but the rich man has
   rich stores even in the dark cellar--his warehouses are full and he
   makes no show. Still waters run deep and we are sometimes still in our
   joy because of the depth of our delight. Say we are not happy, Sirs! We
   would not change one moment of our joy for a hundred years of yours! We
   hear your joy, and we understand that it is like the crackling of
   thorns under a pot--which crackle all the louder because they burn so
   furiously and will so soon be gone. But ours is a steady fire.

   We do mourn sometimes. We mourn oftener than we ought to do. We are
   free to confess this. But it is not our religion which makes us mourn.
   It is because we do not live up to it, for when we live up to it and
   have the company of Jesus, we tell you--

   "We would not change our blessed estate
   For all that earth calls good or great. And while our faith can keep
   her hold, We envy not the sinner's gold."

   Our sickbeds are often as the doorstep of Heaven. Even when we are cast
   down, there is a sweet solace in our sorrow, and a profound joy about
   our apparent grief which we would not give away. God gave it to us and
   the world cannot destroy it.

   They who love Jesus Christ early have the best hope of enjoying the
   happiest days as Christians. They will have the most service and the
   service of God is perfect delight. Their youthful vigor will enable
   them to do more than those who enlist when they are old and decrepit.
   The joy of the Lord is our strength. And on the other hand, to use our
   strength for God is a fountain of joy. Young Man, if you give fifty
   years of service unto God, surely you shall rejoice all your days! The
   earlier we are converted, having the longer time to study in Christ's
   college, the more profound shall be our knowledge of Him.

   We shall have more time for communion, more years for fellowship. We
   shall have more seasons to prove the power of prayer, and more
   opportunities to test the fidelity of God than we should if we came
   late. Those who come late are blessed by being helped to learn so much,
   but those that come in early shall surely outstrip them. Let me be
   young, like John, that I may have years of loving service, and like he
   may have much intimate acquaintance with my Lord. Surely those who are
   converted early may reckon upon more joy, because they never will have
   to contend with and to mourn over what later converts must know.

   Your bones are not broken, you can run without weariness--you have not
   fallen as some have done--you can walk without fainting. Often the
   gray-headed man who is converted at sixty or seventy finds the
   remembrance of his youthful sins clinging to him. When he would praise,
   an old lascivious song revives upon his memory. When he would mount up
   to Heaven, he suddenly remembers some scene in a haunt of vice which he
   would be glad to forget. But you, saved by Divine Grace before you thus
   fall into the jaw of the lion, or under the paw of the bear, will
   certainly have cause for rejoicing all your life.

   If I may have heavenly music upon earth let me begin it now, Lord. Put
   not away the viol and the harp for my fingers when they tremble with
   age. Let me use them while yet I am young. Now, Lord, if there is a
   banquet, do not bring me in at the end of the feast, but let me begin
   to feast today! If I am to be married to Jesus, let it not be when my
   hair is gray, but marry me to Jesus now! What better time for joy than
   today? Now shall my joys swell and grow like a river, which rolls on to
   a mightier breadth and depth as its course is prolonged! I shall
   rejoice and be glad in You all my days, good Lord, if You will now
   begin with me, in this the morning of my days.

   I cannot put my thoughts together this morning as I could desire, but I
   still feel an earnest longing to shoot the arrow to its mark, and
   therefore one or two stray thoughts before I turn to the prayer itself,
   and these shall be very brief. My dear young Friends, you who are of my
   own age, or younger still, I beseech you ask to be satisfied with God's
   mercy early, for you may die early. It has been our grief this week to
   stand by the open grave of one who was, alas, too soon, as we thought,
   snatched away to Heaven. You may never number the full ripe years of
   manhood. We say that our years are threescore and ten, but to you they
   may not even be a score.

   Your sun may go down while it is yet noon. God often reaps His corn
   green--long before the autumn comes He cuts down His sheaves. "Because
   I will do this, prepare to meet your God." Then, on the other hand, if
   you should live--in whose service could you spend your days better than
   in the service of God? What more happy employment, what more blessed
   position than to be found, like Samuel, a waiting servant upon God
   while yet you need a mother's care? Remember how early temptations
   beset you. Would you not wish to secure your early days? And how can
   you cleanse your ways except by taking heed unto them according to
   God's Word?

   Do you not know, too, that the Church wants you? Your young blood shall
   keep her veins full of vigor and make her sinews strong. Should not the
   love of Jesus Christ win you? If He died and shed His blood for men,
   does He not deserve their best service? Would you desire to give to God
   an offering of the end of your days? What would you have thought of the
   Jew who brought an old bullock--who, after having used an ox in his own
   fields till it was worn out, should then consecrate it to God? Let the
   lambs be offered. Let the firstlings of the herd be brought. Let God
   have the first sheaves of the harvest. Surely He deserves something
   better than to have the devil's leavings put upon His holy altar!

   "Oh, but," you say, "would He accept me if I came to Him early?" Why,
   you have more promises than the old man has. It is written that God
   will be found of them that seek Him, but it is specially written, "They
   that seek Me early shall find Me." You have a peculiar promise given to
   you. If there were any who could be rejected, it could not by any
   possibility be the young. If there were one whom Jesus Christ could
   leave, it would not be you, for He gathers the lambs in His bosom.
   "Suffer the little children to come unto Me and forbid them not, for of
   such is the kingdom of Heaven." May not that cheer you, however young
   you are?

   Jesus Christ loves to see young men and maidens join in His praise. We
   find that the best of saints in the Old and New Testament were those
   who came to Jesus young. Certain it is that the pick and cream of the
   Church in modern times will be found among those who are early
   converts. Look at those who are Church officials and ministers, and in
   most cases-- and the exception only proves the rule--in most cases the
   leaders in our Israel are those who, as young Hannibal was devoted by
   his parents to the great cause of his country, were devoted by their
   parents to the great cause of Zion and to the interests of Jerusalem.

   If you would be strong for God, eminent in His service, and joyful in
   His ways. If you would understand the heights and depths of the love of
   Christ which passes knowledge, if you would give yourselves before your
   bones are broken and before your spirit has become tinctured through
   and through with habits of iniquity--then offer this prayer--"O satisfy
   us early with Your mercy, that we may rejoice and be glad all our
   days."

   II. And now very briefly we shall take the text as YOUR ADDRESS TO GOD.
   Every word here is significant. "O." This teaches us that the prayer is
   to be earnest. I will suppose that I have led some of you young people
   here now to breathe this prayer to God. Am I so unhappy as to suppose
   that none of you will do it? Are there not some who now say, "I will,
   with my whole heart, God the Holy Spirit helping me, now in my pew
   offer this supplication to Heaven." It begins with an "O." Dull prayers
   will never reach God's Throne. What comes from our heart coldly can
   never get to God's heart.

   Dull, dead prayers, ask God to deny them. We must pray out of our very
   souls. The soul of our prayer must be the prayer of our soul. "O
   satisfy us." Young Man, the Lord is willing to open the door to those
   who knock, but you must knock hard. He is fully prepared to give to
   those who ask, but you must ask earnestly. The kingdom of Heaven
   suffers violence. It is not a gentle grasp which will avail. You must
   wrestle with the angel. Give no sleep to your eyes nor slumber to your
   eyelids till you have found the Savior. Remember, if you do but find
   Him, it will well repay you though you shed drops of blood in the
   pursuit.

   If instead of tears you had given your heart's blood, and if instead of
   sighs you were to give the shrieks of a martyr, it would well
   recompense you if you did but find Jesus--therefore be earnest. If you
   find Him not, remember, you perish, and perish with a great
   destruction. The wrath of God abides on you and Hell must be your
   portion. Therefore, as one that pleads for his life, so plead for
   mercy. Throw your whole spirit into it and let that spirit be heated to
   a glowing heat. Be not satisfied to stand at the foot of the Throne and
   say, "Let God save me if He will." No, but put it thus, "Lord, I cannot
   take a denial! O satisfy me! O save me!" Such a prayer is sure to be
   accepted.

   Again, make it a generous prayer, when you are at it. "O satisfy us
   early!" I am glad to see among our young sisters in the catechumen
   class such a spirit of love for one another, so that when one is
   converted, she is sure to look round for another. The scores in that
   class who have found the Lord are always searching out some stray young
   woman in the street, or some hopeful ones attending the congregation
   whom they try to bring in, that Jesus may be glorified. The very first
   duty of a convert is to labor for the conversion of others, and surely
   it will not spoil your prayer, young Man, if when you are praying for
   yourself, you will put it in the plural--"O satisfy US."

   Pray for your brothers and sisters. I am sure we are verily guilty in
   this thing. Those that sprang from the same loins as ourselves--would
   to God that they were all saved with the same salvation. You may, some
   of you, be happy enough to be members of a family in which all are
   converted. Oh that we could all say the same! May the remembrance of
   this text provoke you and me to pray for unconverted brothers and
   sisters more than we have ever done. "O satisfy us." If you have
   brought in the eldest, Lord, stop not till the youngest is converted.
   If my brother preaches the Word, if my sister rejoices in Your fear,
   then let other sisters know and taste of Your love. You young people in
   shops, in warehouses, in factories--pray this prayer and do not exclude
   even those who have begun to blaspheme--but even in their early youth
   pray for them--"O satisfy us with Your mercy."

   See to it, dear Friends, in the next place that your prayer be
   thoroughly evangelical. "O satisfy us early with Your mercy." The
   prayer of the publican is the model for us all. No matter how amiable
   or how excellent we may be, we must all come together and say, "God, be
   merciful to me a sinner." Do not come with any hereditary godliness. Do
   not approach the Lord with the fact of your infant sprinkling. Do not
   come before Him to plead your mother's covenant. Come as a sinner, as a
   black, foul, filthy sinner, having nothing to rely on or to trust to
   but the merit of God in Christ Jesus. And let the prayer be just such
   as a thief might offer, or a prostitute might present--"O satisfy us
   early with Your mercy."

   Let the prayer be put up now at once. The text says, "O satisfy us
   early." Why not today? Oh that it had been done years ago! But there
   was time enough, you thought. There is time enough, but there is none
   to spare. Acquaint yourself now with God, and be at peace. "Today is
   the accepted time. Today is the day of salvation." I would to God we
   would not pray our prayers meaning to have them heard so late. Let it
   be--"O satisfy us early." The man who truly repents always wants to
   have pardon on the spot. He feels as if he could not rise from his
   knees till God has been favorable to him--and mark you--when a man has
   really come to that point that he must be saved now, or else he feels
   that it will be too late, then has come the solemn juncture when God
   will say, "Be it unto you even as you will."

   I must leave this poor sermon of mine with the people of God to pray
   over it. Sometimes when most I long to plead with men's souls I find
   the brain distracted although the heart is warm. God knows, that could
   I plead with the young, I would do it even unto tears. I do feel it
   such a solemn thing for our country. Happy shall she be if her sons and
   daughters give their young days to God! It will be such a blessed thing
   for London, if our young men in business, and our young women in
   families become missionaries for Christ. But what a happy thing it will
   be for them! What joy shall they know! What transports shall they feel!
   What a blessing will they be to their households! What happy families
   they will be!

   Unconverted fathers shall be made to feel the power of godliness
   through their daughters. And mothers who despise religion shall not
   dare to neglect it any longer because they see it exemplified and
   illustrated in their sons. We want missionaries everywhere! This great
   city never can by any possibility become the Lord's except by
   individual action. We must have all Christians at work, and since we
   cannot get the old ones to work as we would--since preach as we may,
   they will settle on their lees--we long for new recruits, whose ardor
   shall rekindle the dying enthusiasm of the seniors. We want to see
   fresh minds come in all aglow with holy fervor to keep the fire still
   blazing on the altar.

   For Jesus Christ's sake I do implore you, you who number but few
   years--offer this supplication in your pew. Do it now. It is a
   Brother's heart that begs the favor. It is for your own soul's sake,
   that you may be blessed on earth, and that you may have the joys of
   Heaven. There is a prayer-hearing God. The Mercy Seat is still open.
   Christ still waits. May the Spirit of God compel you now to come before
   Him in supplication. Now may He compel you to come in, with this as
   your cry--"O satisfy us early with Your mercy, that we may rejoice and
   be glad all our days."

                                  Tell It All

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JUNE 14, 1863, BY THE REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her,
   came and fell down before Him and told Him all the truth." Mark 5:33.

   JESUS was pressing through the throng to the house of Jairus to raise
   the ruler's dead daughter. But He is so profuse in goodness that He
   works another miracle while upon the road. While yet this rod of Aaron
   bears the blossom of an unaccomplished wonder, it yields the ripe
   almonds of a perfect work of mercy. It is enough for us, if we have
   some purpose, straightway to go and accomplish it. It were imprudent to
   expend our energies by the way. Hastening to the rescue of a drowning
   friend, we cannot afford to exhaust our strength upon another in like
   danger.

   It is enough for a tree to yield one sort of fruit and for a man to
   fulfill his own peculiar calling. But our Master knows no limit of
   power or boundary of mission. He is so prolific of Divine Grace, that
   like the sun which shines as it fulfils its course, His path is radiant
   with loving kindness. He is a fiery arrow of love which not only
   reaches its ordained target, but perfumes the air through which it
   flies. Virtue is always going out of Jesus, as sweet odors exhale from
   the flowers. And it always will be emanating from Him, as light from
   the central orb. What delightful encouragement this Truth of God
   affords us!

   If our Lord is so ready to heal the sick and bless the needy, then, my
   Soul, be not slow to put yourself in His way, that He may smile on you!
   Be not slack in asking if He is so abundant in bestowing! I will give
   earnest heed to His Word this morning, for it may be, though the sermon
   should be mainly intended to bless another, yet incidentally and by the
   way, Jesus may speak through it to my soul. Men speak of killing two
   birds with one stone, but my Lord heals many souls on one journey. May
   He not heal me? Son of David, turn Your eyes and look upon my distress
   and let me be made whole this day!

   The afflicted woman in the narrative came behind Jesus in the press and
   won a cure from Him--all unobserved by the multitude. Ah, how many
   there may be in the crowd who are really healed by Jesus Christ, but
   concerning whom little or nothing is known! It is delightful to see
   conversion work, to trace the good hand of the Lord, and to rejoice
   therein. But, beyond a doubt, when the secrets of all hearts shall be
   revealed, we shall find that Jesus Christ has worked ten times more
   wonders than eye has seen or ear heard. We must not dream that we know
   all that our infinite God is doing.

   The works of the Lord are great, and are sought out of all them that
   have pleasure therein, but even these seekers see not all--

   "Full many a gem of purest ray serene
   The dark unfathomed ca ves of ocean bear
   Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
   And waste its sweetness on the desert air." Let each timid hearer now
   say--"If it is so that there are many who receive God's Grace, who
   through much trembling hide themselves from the eyes of men, may it not
   be so with me? May I not this morning venture secretly to touch the
   Lord? And since the virtue streams abundantly from Him, may I not hope
   that He will bless me? Even me, unknown, unnoticed though I am."

   I commence with these two or three notes of encouragement, just to tune
   my harp, for I desire to sing a song to the Lord's Beloved, of which
   the burden shall be--"Comfort You, comfort You my people." The story of
   this trembling woman, from first to last, though it is but a piece of
   by-play, as I have said before, is one of the most touching and
   teaching of the Savior's miracles. The woman was very ignorant. She
   fondly imagined that virtue came out of Christ by a law of necessity,
   without His knowledge or direct will. She supposed that the holiness
   and Divinity of His Nature had communicated a mysterious efficacy to
   His garments.

   Just as the bones of Elisha had restored a dead man to life, so she
   conceived that the garments worn upon the living Body of the Savior
   might remove her sickness. She had true faith, but there was, to say
   the least, a tinge of superstition in it. Moreover, she was a total
   stranger to the generosity of Jesus' Character, or else she would not
   have gone behind to steal the cure which He was so ready to bestow.
   Misery should always place itself right in the face of mercy. Had she
   known the love of Jesus' heart, she would have said, "I have but to put
   myself where He can see me. His Omniscience will teach Him my case, and
   His love at once will work my cure."

   We admire her faith, but we marvel at her strange ignorance. For how
   could she imagine that she would be hidden from one whose garment could
   stanch her issue of blood? He who could cure her secret malady could
   certainly perceive her secret touch. After she had obtained the cure,
   she rejoices with trembling. Glad was she that the Divine virtue had
   worked a marvel in her, but she feared lest Christ should retract the
   blessing, and put a negative upon the grant of His Grace. How sad that
   she should have such unworthy ideas of our gracious Master--little did
   she comprehend the fullness of His love.

   You and I have not so clear a view of Him as we could wish. We know not
   the heights and depths and lengths and breadths of His love--but we
   know Him better than she did--at least we know, for sure, that He is
   too good to withdraw from a trembling soul the gift which it has been
   able to obtain. But here is the marvel of it--little as was her
   knowledge, great as was her unbelief, and astounding as was her
   misconception of our Lord--yet her faith, because it was real faith,
   saved her! If we have faith as a grain of mustard seed, there is life
   in that grain and die it cannot.

   A ray of faith ensures complete deliverance from the blackness of
   darkness forever. If in the list of the Lord's children you and I are
   written, as the feeblest of the family, yet being children and heirs
   through faith, no power, human or devilish, can reverse our adoption.
   If we cannot clasp the Lord in our hands with Simeon, if we dare not to
   lean our heads upon His bosom with John--yet if we can venture in the
   crowd behind Him, and touch the hem of His garment, we are made whole.
   Courage, you that are so timid that you seldom read your titles clear
   to mansions in the skies--the title is none the less sure, in spite of
   the fact you cannot read it!

   I would to God your faith were stronger, but God forbid that I should
   wound your sensitive spirits and discourage your growing hopes. My
   Master quenched not the smoking flax. He broke not the bruised
   reed--neither must the servant do so. I had rather see you, with all
   your timidity, exercising a real faith in Jesus, than I would have to
   mourn over you as lifted up with rash presumptuous confidence--without
   a solid ground for your boldness. Better to go limping to Heaven, than
   running to Hell. Better to enter into life halt or maimed, than having
   two hands, and two feet, and cast into Hell fire. Courage, I say, you
   Trembler. To cry "Abba," with tears and groans, is better than to shout
   with loud boastings, "Peace, Peace," where there is no peace. Happier,
   by far to be folded with the tender lambs than to be driven away with
   the strong and lusty goats.

   Now let us turn aside to hear this woman preach. She has a word for two
   classes. First, to the penitent, urging him to a full confession. "She
   told Him all the truth"--Penitent, do you the same. Next, to the true
   convert, an exhortation to an open profession. For she declared before
   them all how she had been made whole. Secret Disciple--"Go and do you
   likewise."

   I. This timid woman shall be AN EXAMPLE TO PENITENTS to make a full
   avowal of their state and condition. "She told Him all the truth."
   There need be no difficulty about the matter of prayer with a soul that
   needs help from Christ. Never question your power to pray acceptably if
   God has given you a sense of need. Say not--"I have no eloquence. I
   cannot arrange my words. I cannot fashion a suitable form of
   extemporaneous address." Remember that none of these things are
   necessary. All that is wanted for acceptable prayer is that in the name
   of Jesus you tell the Lord all the truth.

   You require no argument more moving than your misery. You need no
   description more glowing than your sad case, itself, affords you.
   Though you know not how to plead your cause as an advocate in a court
   of law, plead it as the publican in the court of mercy. The simple
   statement of your wants, and the sincere expression of your desire that
   those wants should be supplied, for Jesus' sake, is all the prayer that
   God asks of you.

   We should, dear Friends, if we would come before the Lord acceptably,
   tell Him all the truth about our disease. This woman did so. Her malady
   was such that her modesty had prompted her to conceal it from the
   throng, but she must not hide it from Jesus. Her disease had rendered
   her unclean, so that she had no right to mingle with the crowd, since
   her touch defiled all who touched her. All this defilement she must own
   in the Presence of the Healing One. Nor must she, now that her Lord
   demands it, hide it from the multitude who are round about her. Not to
   gloat over sin, but to show how sensible we are of it, we ought to make
   a full declaration of our disease to Jesus, and when He wills it, we
   must conceal from no one what sinners we were until Divine Grace
   reclaimed us.

   Sin is our disease. Sinner, acknowledge it. Go, show yourself, in all
   your foulness, to the Great High Priest. Confess the depravity of your
   nature. Tell Him that your whole head is sick, and your whole heart is
   faint. Do not draw the picture flatteringly when you are in prayer.
   Confess that your thoughts are foul, your imaginations filthy, your
   heart corrupt, and your judgment perverted. Tell Him that your memory
   will treasure up foolishness, but that it drops the Words of Wisdom
   from its feeble hands. Tell him you are altogether as an unclean thing,
   and that all your righteousnesses are as filthy rags. Make a clean
   breast of your overt acts.

   Tell Him, when you are alone in your closet, precisely what you have
   done. Do not disguise your crimes, nor mince matters by using dainty
   terms. If you have been a thief, tell Him so. If you have been a
   drunkard, confess it not thus-- "Lord, I have sometimes indulged the
   flesh." But say, "Lord, I have been drunk." Put it plainly. Acknowledge
   it in your privacy before God by its own proper name. It is a great
   temptation of Satan, with convicted souls, to induce them to apply
   grand titles to their sins. I pray you, do not do so.

   Acknowledge, Sinner, just what you have been, and wear the sackcloth
   and ashes which befit your state. Call a spade, a spade, and go not
   about trimming your way. This is not the time for your Agags to go
   delicately. They must be hewed in pieces before the Lord your God.
   Confess the aggravations of your sin. Conceal not from God that you
   sinned against light, and knowledge--against many warnings and the
   strivings of an awakened conscience. Do not hesitate to acknowledge
   that you have wiped away the tears which the Gospel forced from you,
   and have gone once again into the world's sin, and lost every good
   impression.

   It is well for us if we are seeking mercy of God, to state the worst of
   our case and not the best. It is a sure sign that mercy will soon come,
   when we are ready to confess to the full, our misery. O Sinner, where
   are you? Have you been before my God in prayer? Go again, and be more
   full and clear in your confession. You cannot describe your case in
   terms too black. It is not possible for you to exaggerate either your
   natural or acquired guilt. You are a wretch undone without His
   Sovereign Grace--admit it to Him. And if you can find no words, let the
   groans, and sighs, and sobs of confession pour forth from you--for it
   is the heart and soul of true and sincere prayer to lay yourself in the
   dust at Jesus' feet and tell Him all the truth.

   The woman next told the Lord of her sufferings. The peculiar disease
   with which she had been afflicted drained away her strength. She must
   have presented a most emaciated appearance. There was no flush of
   health upon her hollow cheek. Her gait was that of utter weakness. The
   toil which her poverty compelled her to endure to earn a livelihood
   must have been very painful to her, for she had no strength. Her purse
   was drained by physicians, and her heart by the flux of blood. Poor
   creature! We can little tell the days of languishing and the nights of
   pain she endured--and the seasons of despondency and despair which
   would come upon her spirit in consequence of the weakness of the flesh.

   But she told Him all the truth. She told Him briefly, but completely,
   all she had endured. Tried Soul! You with whom God's Spirit is at work!
   Tell the Lord, if you would pray aright, all your sufferings! Tell Him
   how your heart has been broken, how your conscience has been alarmed.
   Tell Him how your very sleep is scared with dreams, how your days are
   made as black as though they were nights by a want of hope. Tell Him
   that sin has become a torment to you, that the places in which you
   could once find pleasure have now become howling wildernesses to you.
   Tell Him the harp has lost its music, the cup its enticements, the
   table its charms, society its delights--for you are full of your own
   ways and your sins have become a burden to you. Let your sorrows flow
   in briny floods before the Lord of Hosts, for though no stranger can
   intermeddle with your sorrow, your God understands it. Tell Him, then,
   tell Him, troubled Sinner, tell Him all the truth.

   Next, I am persuaded that this woman did not hesitate to tell him of
   her futile attempts after a cure. She had been to other physicians. She
   had suffered many things by them. That is to say, some of them had put
   her under various opera- tions of the most painful character. And
   others had compelled her to drink nauseous medicine. These ancient
   professors of medicine had given her sleepless nights, and days of
   exquisite anguish--all of which she might have borne with patience if
   she had been one whit the better. But she rather grew worse.

   Her doctors, it seems, were her worst disease. They added to the issue
   of her blood a waste of her money. They gave her consumption in her
   purse, and vexed her with the plagues of fees. Her substance might have
   yielded her many little comforts and some extra nourishment to sustain
   her under the fearful drain upon her system. But the doctors sucked
   like vampires and made an issue in her pockets more rapid than that in
   her person. She tells the Lord, although that confession was as good as
   saying, "Lord, I have been everywhere else, or else I should never have
   come to You. I have tried everyone, and it is only because all others
   have failed that I present myself before You."

   You would think such a confession as that would make Him angry. But it
   was not so. I would not have you keep back this part of the tale from
   your Lord and Master. Tell Him you have been to other physicians.
   Remind Him how you went to Moses--how he took you to the foot of Sinai
   and made you exceedingly fear, and quake, but never stanched your
   wounds. Tell Him how you rested upon Mr. Civility and his father, Mr.
   Legality, who said they had skill to take the burden from your
   back--who set you this to do, and that to do most irksomely--but never
   ministered one atom to your cure.

   Tell Him of your many prayers and how you have trusted in them. Tell
   Him of your good works and how you used to repose your confidence in
   them. You may spread before Him the story of your infant sprinkling,
   your confirmation, your Church attendance, your Chapel going. Tell Him
   how you were always up to early prayers, and kept the saints' days--
   how you tried to mortify the body and to deny yourself many comforts.
   Tell Him how you did everything sooner than come to Him. And say that
   even now, if you had not been forced to it, you would not have come,
   for you are so vile by nature, and so great an enemy to the Cross of
   Christ, that you would not have come to Him if you could have found a
   shadow of hope elsewhere.

   "Well," one says, "would that be praying?" Yes, dear Brother! Yes, dear
   Sister, that is the soul of prayer--to tell Him all the truth. We
   cannot expect that He will give us pardon till we make our confession
   fully, and without any reserve. If you will cover any sin in your
   heart, your sin shall condemn you. If there is one secret corner of
   your soul in which you hide away any of your corruptions, or
   follies--there shall a cancer spring up which shall eat into your very
   soul. Tell Him all the truth! Hide nothing from Him, even this, your
   wicked, willful pride in going after your own righteousness and not
   submitting yourself to the righteousness of Christ--tell Him all the
   truth.

   This poor woman told him all her hopes. She said with many a tear,
   "Lord Jesus, when I had spent my all and could no longer run after the
   various physicians of different countries, I heard of You. It was one
   evening as I lay on my couch, too faint to sit upright. A neighbor came
   and told me that a son of hers that had been born blind had received
   his sight. And she said that the same man, named Jesus of Galilee, a
   mighty Prophet, had also restored one that was dead--a widow woman's
   son at the gates of Nain. Then I said in my heart, perhaps He will heal
   me. And my soul that had been given up to despair enjoyed for a moment
   a beam of hope, for my soul said, 'If it is possible for Him to raise
   the dead, then He can stop my issue of blood. And if He did open the
   blind eyes, then He can restore me.'

   "I thought, if the journey is ever so long I will take it. If the way
   is ever so rough, if I may but creep into His Presence, I will be among
   the company, and, perhaps, when He is stretching out His hand to bless,
   He will bless me, even me. And perhaps the Man is so full of healing
   virtue that if He will not look on me, yet if I get near enough to look
   on Him I shall be made whole." So she would tell him of that hope. She
   would also tell Him of the many disappointments that she met with when
   she was pressing through the throng. How the strong men jostled her,
   and the rough men pushed her back. How the many thoughtless told her to
   be gone, and the zealous few were jealous of her place and struggled to
   get before her.

   She would tell Him how at last she did come near enough to touch the
   hem of His garment and how she ventured to touch in the hope that she
   would be made whole. Then she would plead that as she already felt a
   change for the better, she humbly hoped that He would not take away
   this omen of love, but that He would carry out the cure and send her
   away perfectly restored.

   If you desire to pray aright, pour out your hopes before the Lord. I
   remember when I sought the Lord, I said to Him, "Lord, I have read in
   Scripture that You did hear Saul of Tarsus, and that You did save
   Manassas. I am a sinner, it is true, great as they are. But surely You
   can save me. And my soul hopes that yet You will. Turn an eye of pity
   and say unto me, 'your sins are forgiven.' " Sometimes that hope grew
   so strong that I felt as if I should be saved--I knew I should. Then,
   again, that hope went down so low that it seemed impossible that He
   could have pity upon me. And I remember I asked Him how it was He could
   have buoyed me up with that fond hope and put the Scriptures in such a
   way that they looked as if they were meant for me--and were sent to
   beckon me to Christ--and yet I could find no comfort in them.

   Now, you must do the same. Spread those disappointed hopes of yours
   before your God and tell Him all the truth. But be sure you tell Him
   also your fears. I dare say the woman said to Him, "Oh, Son of David, I
   thought at one time it was foolish of me to come to You, for I know, O
   Jesus of Nazareth, that You are very careful concerning the Law. Now
   the Law says that a woman with an issue of blood is unclean, and I
   thought I had no right to come near to You--that You would say to me,
   'Woman, Woman, how dare you to mix with the throng, and make all these
   people legally unclean? And what is this, your impudence, that you
   should think of touching Me? You whose touch is a defiling one, how
   could you venture to come near to Me?'

   "Lord, I thought of going back scores of times, but it was my necessity
   that made me bold. I felt I had no right to come. But come I must. When
   I did get the cure from You, I touched You surreptitiously without any
   invitation, without daring to do it before Your face, and now I am
   afraid You will curse me and say, 'Get you gone,' and add another
   disease to me, and so break the back that is already bent with a
   crushing load." How soon her fears were removed when she had told them!

   Now, poor Sinner, tell all your fears, whatever they may be. You think
   your sins are too great. Tell Him so. You fear you are not one of His
   chosen. Tell Him so. You think that He has never called you. Tell Him
   so. You believe that if you did come to Him He would refuse you. Tell
   Him so, if you dare. But I think you would hardly utter so flat a
   contradiction to His own words, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise
   cast out." Do you feel your heart is so hard? Tell Him it is like a
   nether millstone, that the adamant might melt before your heart would
   yield. Do you feel as if you could not tell Him? Tell Him that you feel
   as if you could not tell Him.

   Whatever it is, let all the truth come out. No, no! You need not look
   into the Prayer Book--you will not find much there that suits a
   convicted sinner. You need not buy a book of family devotions. Your own
   poor cries are better than the best written forms. "Oh, my prayer will
   be so broken!" Well, then, it will be all the more suitable for a
   broken heart. But then you say, "It is such an unworthy prayer." Yes,
   but then you are an unworthy soul. The prayer is fitting for the
   person. If the Great God should hear you, you will know that it was not
   because of your prayer, but because of Jesus. For all you did was tell
   Him the truth. And if that prevails with Him, why then, His heart of
   love, and the sufferings of the Savior must have moved Him to have pity
   upon you.

   I pray God the Holy Spirit guide these words which are meant to
   encourage you who have been seeking Jesus. Let me urge you to tell the
   whole of the story for these reasons. The Lord knows it all
   beforehand--you cannot hide it. Whatever your sins may have been,
   though they were perpetrated at night, though they were under the
   shadow of the thickest darkness, He saw them all. Secret sins are all
   committed in the face of God. Was it a theft which no one has yet
   discovered? Or was it only a thought, a black thought that no ear, not
   even your own, ever heard? God saw it--God heard it. In His book
   everything which you have done is recorded against you. Be not foolish,
   then--deny not that which is published on the housetops of Glory.

   The Judge will publish it at last. If you hide it all your life, it
   will come out then. Go then, tell it--tell it now. To tell this to God
   will be a very great service to you. It will tend to make you feel your
   need more. I believe that often, when the penitent begins his
   confession, he is not half so sensible of guilt as at the close of his
   prayer. If you will bring your soul to look at your sin, to study its
   foulness, to meditate upon its heinous ingratitude--while you are
   considering the subject, the Spirit of God will work upon you--and your
   heart, like the rock in the desert, smitten by His rod, shall gush with
   streams of penitence.

   If your heart is very grieved, do, I pray you, remember that confession
   is one of the most rapid ways of getting relief. While the banks hold
   good the lake swells. Let them break and the water is drained off. Let
   a vent be found for the swollen lake up yonder on the mountains, and
   the mass of water which might otherwise inundate the valleys will flow
   in fertilizing streams. When you have a festering, gathering wound, the
   surgeon lets in the lances and gives you ease. So con- fession brings
   peace. Would to God without any delay you who need a Savior would go to
   Him and confess your sin right plainly.

   Jesus is no hard-hearted foe, no cruel Judge. He loves you. Awakened
   Sinner, He will love to hear that story of yours. And before you have
   finished it, He will give you the kiss of love, and say, "I have
   blotted out your sins like a cloud and like a thick cloud your
   transgressions." Trust the immense generosity of Jesus' infinitely
   tender heart to give you your soul's desire--the complete and perfect
   forgiveness of your sin.

   I have thus bid this woman become the preacher of this morning and
   speak to those who are penitent. May the Word be blessed.

   II. We now change the subject for a very short time, to address THOSE
   WHO ARE CONVERTED, BUT WHO,

   LIKE THIS WOMAN, HAVE NOT YET ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR FAITH IN THE PRESENCE
   OF OTHERS.

   Our Savior will do nothing by halves. The woman may be content with
   having her body healed--Jesus is not satisfied till her soul is
   recovered, too. She has gained the cure, but she would probably go
   slinking away with the retiring multitude to hide herself from all
   observation. This will not be for her good, nor for the Master's honor,
   therefore He takes means to get a plain confession from her. Turning
   round, He says, "Who touched Me?" At first, there is no answer. He puts
   it again, "Who touched Me?" They all deny. Peter, moreover, takes upon
   him to upbraid the Savior for asking so absurd a question--"The
   multitude throng You," says he, "how can You say, 'Who touched Me?' "

   But He looked round, and probably fixing His eyes at last upon the
   woman herself, He said, "Somebody has touched Me, for I perceive that
   virtue is gone out of Me." That "somebody" came out of the crowd, and
   falling flat on her face, she declared before them all, so Luke says,
   what had been done in her. Now, in the great work of salvation, as we
   have remarked aforetime, there are many who are saved who, through
   timidity, do not come forward and confess what Jesus Christ has done
   for them. I believe that our Lord often uses singular means to make His
   secret ones come out and acknowledge Him. The words I may speak just
   now may be a part of His plan by which He will make yonder "somebody,"
   whoever that may be, this Sister somebody, this Brother somebody, who
   has touched Him, come out and declare before all what the Lord has
   done.

   His reasons for constraining her to make an open confession, were
   doubtless three. It was for His glory--

   "Why should the wonders He has worked, Be hid in darkness and forgot?"
   When I look abroad upon nature, it is true, I do not see nature fussily
   trying to make itself tidy for a visitor, as some professors do, who,
   the moment they think they are going to be looked at, trim up their
   godliness to make it look smart. But on the other hand, nature is never
   bashful. She never tries to hide her beauties from the gazer's eyes.
   You walk the valley. The sun is shining and a few raindrops are
   falling. Yonder is the rainbow--a thousand eyes gaze at it. Does it
   fold up all its lovely colors and retire? Oh, no! It shrinks not from
   the eyes of man.

   In yonder garden all the flowers are opening their lovely cups, the
   birds are singing, and the insects humming amid the leaves. It is a
   place so beautiful that God Himself might walk therein at eventide, as
   He did in Eden. I look without alarming the bashful beauties of the
   garden. Do all these insects fold their wings and hide beneath the
   leaves? Do the flowers hang down their heads? Does the sun draw a veil
   over his modest face? Does nature blush until the leaves of the trees
   are scarlet? Oh, no! Nature cares not for gazers, and when any come to
   look upon her, she does not hasten to wrap a mantle over her fair form,
   or throw a curtain before her grandeur.

   So the Christian is not to be always wishing to expose what is in him.
   That were to make himself a Pharisee. Yet, on the other hand, if God
   has put anything that is lovely and beautiful, and of good repute in
   you, anything that may glorify the Cross of Christ, and make the angels
   happy before the Eternal Throne, who are you that you should cover it?
   Who are you that you should rob God of His praise? What? Would you have
   all nature's beauties hid? Why, then, hide the beauties of Divine
   Grace? Jesus Christ deserves to be confessed before men. He is not
   ashamed to own Himself our Friend amidst the splendors of His Father's
   court. Nor was He ashamed amidst the mockery and spitting of Pilate's
   hall. Why, then, should you find it a hardship or a difficulty to
   acknowledge Him?

   Acknowledge Him! I ought to feel proud of the honor to be allowed to
   acknowledge Him! I, who am black with sin, ashamed to call Him Husband
   who is the fairest of the children of men? I, that am poor as poverty,
   blush to own that the King of kings calls Himself my Brother! I, who
   deserve the deepest Hell. I, ashamed to own that Christ has washed me
   in

   His precious blood and set my feet upon a rock, and put a new song into
   my mouth? My Master, I cannot be ashamed of You! How can it be?--

   "No, when I blush, be this my shame, That I no more revere His name!"
   My Brother, my Sister, you who keep in retirement, and hide your
   candles under a bushel, you should not do so. For the sake of His dear
   name, who loved you with an everlasting love, and has engraved you upon
   the palms of His hands-- come forth and declare your faith.

   Doubtless Christ would have her confession for the good of Jairus. Did
   that strike you? Jairus needed much faith. He was just informed that
   his child was dead. Some faith was wanted to believe that Christ could
   heal the sick. But that He could restore the dead? What faith was
   needed here? Therefore, this woman's confession is put in to nourish
   the faith of the trembling ruler of the synagogue. You do not know,
   dear Friends, of how much service your open confession of Christ might
   be to some trembling soul. One reason why we have Churches and are
   joined in fellowship, is that we may help the weak. That by our daring
   to say, "Christ has saved me," others may take heart and may come to
   Him and find the same mercy.

   "Oh, but," you say, "the Church does not want me." Then, I might say
   the same, and all Christians might say the same. Where would there be a
   visible Church on earth at all? What is right for one Christian to do
   is right for all to do. And if is right for you to neglect professing
   Christ, then it is right for all Believers to do so. And then, where is
   the Church? Where is the ministry? Where is Christ's Truth? How are
   sinners to be saved at all? Suppose, my Brothers and Sisters, that John
   Calvin and Martin Luther had said--"Well now, we know the Truths of
   God. But we had better be quiet, for we can go to Heaven much more
   comfortably. But if we begin preaching, we shall set all the world by
   the ears, and there will be a deal of mischief done. Hundreds of
   persons will have to be martyrs for their faith--and we shall be
   subject to many hardships."

   They had quite as much right to hide their religion as you have. They
   had quite as much reason for the concealment of their godliness as you
   have. But, alas, for the world, where would have been the Reformation
   if these had been as cowardly as you are, and like you, had skulked to
   the rear in the day of battle? I ask again, what would be the wretched
   lot of England, what calamities would happen to our island, if all who
   know Christ as you know Him were to act as you do? There would be no
   ministers to preach the Gospel! Why, I might today be sitting in my own
   house reading my Bible, or enjoying private prayer with much comfort. I
   certainly should not be pleading with sinners, if I imitated your
   example.

   Where would be the deacons of our Churches and other useful Church
   officers? Where? Echo only answers, "Where?" if all were like you. How
   would the heathen be converted? Who would be the missionary? Who would
   venture among the heathen if they were like you? The Christian would be
   dumb and have no testimony! In fact, I must add there could be no
   Christians! Even if there could be a number of secret Christians
   everywhere, then the world would say, "The religion of Christ is the
   most despicable religion under the sun, for those who believe in it
   will not join together. They will not even profess it. They are so
   ashamed of their Master that they will not come forward, any of them,
   to acknowledge what He has done for their souls."

   You are acting inconsistently if you will not come forward and own your
   Lord. My dear Brothers and Sisters, do not shirk it! I mean some of you
   who have been attending here for years, and ought to have been members
   of this Church years ago. And I mean others of you who have come in
   here this morning, who have known the Lord some little time, and ought
   to be united with other Christians. I say, think about how much real
   good you might do after you have once broken through the shell and told
   others what Jesus has done for you! You would find that after having
   once made a profession, you would be obliged to speak for your
   Lord--and who can tell what a career of usefulness might be opened up
   before you if you would but dare to do this for His sake?

   Moreover, I have no doubt that the main reason why Jesus Christ would
   have this woman declare what was done in her was for her own good.
   Suppose He had let her go home quietly--there she goes--when she
   reached home she would have said, "Ah, I stole that cure. I am so glad
   I have it." But there would come a dark thought--"One of these days it
   will die away. I shall be as bad as ever, for I never asked Him."
   Conscience would say to her, "Ah, it was a theft." And though she might
   excuse herself, still she would not be easy. Now Christ calls her up
   and conscience cannot disturb her, for He gave her the cure before them
   all. She will not be afraid of the return of her disease, for Jesus
   said, "Your faith has made you whole."

   What a blessing it would be to some of you if you would come out and
   confess your Lord and Master. "Well," says one, "I do not like
   Baptism." There are a great many naughty children in the world who do
   not like to do what their father tells them. But those children often
   get whipped, and this will probably be your lot. Our good Brother, who
   spoke here last Sunday evening, astounded me by leaving out part of the
   text which he most frequently quoted. If he quoted a text he should
   quote it all. "He that believes shall be saved," said he. I know no
   such text in Scripture. There are texts very like it, and the doctrine
   is true. But the text is, "He that believes and is baptized shall be
   saved." So the text stands.

   Those of us who are Baptists are supposed to lay too much stress on
   Baptism. I think the danger is in not having stress enough upon it. I
   know this, if my Master tells me to preach the Gospel to every creature
   and puts it thus, "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved," I
   dare not take the responsibility of leaving out part of my Master's
   message. I know that he who believes is saved. But, mark you, I would
   not run the risk of willfully refusing to attend to the second part of
   my Master's command. If there is anything in Scripture that is as plain
   as noonday, it is the Baptism of Believers. The deity of Christ is a
   point which might quite as readily be disputed as the Baptism of
   Believers in Jesus. Let any simple-minded man take the Bible without
   prejudice--and I conceive that it would be impossible for him to read
   it without discovering that the Believer in Jesus is to be buried with
   Christ in Baptism.

   Little do our friends know how much mischief they do by teaching infant
   sprinkling. I believe it to be the root and pillar of Popery, the
   stronghold and bastion of Puseyism. It is an invention of man, against
   which Christians ought to protest every day, because infant sprinkling
   is a practical denial of the need of personal godliness. It is not so
   intended by those who use it--but it is so read and interpreted by the
   world. It puts into the Church those who are not in the Church. It
   gives religious rites to the unconverted. It teaches men that because
   their mothers and fathers were good people, therefore they are
   Christians--whereas they are not--they are heathens and as much
   heathens as if they were born amidst the Hottentot's kraals.

   They are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity,
   notwithstanding all their parents' excellence. To give Christian
   ordinances to unconverted persons is to pervert the testimony of God's
   Church. The Baptism of the Believer in the name of Christ is, and must
   be, a significant emblem of death to the world. It is the crossing of
   the Rubicon, the throwing away of the scabbard and the drawing of the
   sword against the world forever. It is an ordinance whose sign can
   never be erased. An ordinance which disgraces and shames a man in the
   world's eyes more than anything else, the opprobrium of Christianity,
   the scoff and scorn of his religion, is Believer's Baptism. And blessed
   is that man who so can look at it--and then, for Jesus' sake--take up
   his cross and follow Him.

   "Well," says one, "I do not see it." My dear Brothers and Sisters, if
   you cannot see it, I cannot help that. Your conscience is not the rule
   of your duty, but God's Word is. And if God's Word commands it,
   whatever your conscience may say about it, you are sinning if you
   refuse to obey. Oh, I would press this point upon you of making an open
   declaration, and of doing so in Christ's way, for you have no right to
   do it in a way of your own. It is idolatry to worship the true God by a
   wrong method. Acceptable service can only be rendered to God in His own
   way. To the Law and to the Testimony. If we speak not according to that
   Word, it is because there is no light in us. I believe that after you
   have once thus professed your faith before men, your courage will grow.
   Your separation from the world will be more complete.

   You will be a marked man, often a despised man. People will point you
   out and say, "There is one of your Methodists." Your profession will
   distinguish you from the world, and will be a bond to keep you right, a
   heavenly chain of gold to bind you fast to the principles of your Lord
   and Master's Truth. Do, with this poor woman, I plead, tell all the
   truth--and tell it in your Master's way.

   Now I send you away, dear Friends, reminding Penitents of that with
   which we began, the necessity of telling Jesus all--still wishing,
   however, that you who have found a Savior, would tell the world all and
   bear your witness that, let others do as they will, as for you and your
   house, you will serve the Lord.

   And unto the name of God be glory forever. Amen.

                             The Sinner'S Advocate

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JUNE 21,1863, BY THE REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "My little children, these things write I unto you, that you sin not.
   And if any man sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
   the righteous. 1 John 2:1.

   THE Apostle John presents us with a very clear and emphatic testimony
   to the doctrine of full and free forgiveness of sin. He declares that
   the blood of Jesus Christ, God's dear Son, cleans us from all sin, and
   that if any man sins, we have an Advocate. It is most evident that he
   is not afraid of doing mischief by stating this Truth of God too
   broadly. On the contrary, he makes this statement with the view of
   promoting the sanctity of his "little children." The object of this
   bold declaration of the love of the Father to His sinning children is,
   "that you sin not." This is a triumphant answer to that grossly
   untruthful objection which is so often urged by the adversaries of the
   Gospel against the doctrines of Free Grace--that they lead men to
   licentiousness.

   It does not appear that the Apostle John thought so, for in order that
   these "little children" should not sin, he actually declares unto them
   the very doctrine which our opponents call licentious. Those men who
   think that God's Grace, when fully, fairly, and plainly preached, will
   lead men into sin, know not what they say, nor what they affirm. It is
   neither according to nature nor to Grace for men to find an argument
   for sin in the goodness of God. Human nature is bad enough--and far be
   it from me to flatter that leprous criminal, that reeking mass of
   corruption--even a natural conscience revolts at the baseness of
   sinning because Divine Grace abounds!

   Shall I hate God because He is kind to me? Shall I curse Him because He
   blesses me? I venture to affirm that very few men reason thus. Man has
   found out many inventions, but such arguments are so transparently
   abominable that few consciences are so dead as to tolerate them. Bad as
   human nature is, it seldom turns the goodness of God into an argument
   for rebelling against Him. As for souls renewed by Divine Grace, they
   never can be guilty of such infamy. The Believer in Jesus reasons in
   quite another fashion. Is God so good?--then I will not grieve Him. Is
   He so ready to forgive my trans-gressions?--then I will love Him, by
   His Grace, and offend no more. Gratitude has bands which are stronger
   than iron, although softer than silk.

   Think not, Sirs, that the Christian needs to be flogged to virtue by
   the whip of the Law! Dream not that we hate sin merely because of the
   Hell which follows it! If there were no Heaven for the righteous, the
   sons of God would follow after goodness because their regenerated
   spirit pants for it. And if there were no Hell for the wicked, from the
   necessity of his new-born nature, the true Christian would strive to
   escape from all iniquity. Loved of God, we feel we must love Him in
   return. Richly, yes, Divinely forgiven, we feel that we cannot live any
   longer in sin. Since Jesus died to rid us from all uncleanness, we feel
   that we cannot crucify our Lord afresh, and put Him to an open shame.

   We need no nobler or more cogent arguments to lead a man to thorough
   consecration to God's cause and detestation of all evil than those
   fetched from the Free Grace of God. And what if some men do pervert the
   doctrine? Do not wicked minds corrupt everything? What Truth is there
   in Scripture with which a man may not ruin himself if he wills? Did not
   the prophetic eye of our Lord anticipate this when it was written that
   to some the Word of God is, "a savor of death unto death?" Have there
   not been in all ages men who hold the Truth of God in licentiousness?
   When were there not evil men to wrest Scripture to their own
   destruction? Shall we keep back the children's bread least the dogs
   should steal the crumbs?

   Shall we destroy health-restoring drugs because fools may poison
   themselves with them? Shall all the trees be cut down for fear the owls
   should build their nests in them? Shall the sea be dried up because
   sharks swim in it? Shall the pure virgin Truth be condemned because
   gross villains have forged her name and abused her character? God
   forbid! Let us never blush to preach the whole Gospel and to preach its
   full forgiveness of sin in the boldest and baldest manner, believ- ing
   that the naked breasts of Truth are her best armor, and that she is
   least protected when she is encumbered with a coat of mail of human
   reasoning and prudence.

   As God shall help me, then, believing that the doctrine of Free Grace
   and of God's infinite love to His people is a doctrine which will lead
   the "little children of God" to avoid all sin, I intend this morning to
   preach that doctrine. May God grant that the result may be according to
   His mind and will.

   I. We commence our exposition of the text with the remark that THE
   SAINT IS STILL A SINNER. Our Apostle says--"If any man sins." The "if
   may be written in as small letters as you will, for the supposition is
   a matter of certainty. "If any man sins"? Although the gentle hand of
   the beloved disciple uses such mild and tender terms, putting it as a
   supposition--as though it were an astonishing thing after so much love
   and mercy and kindness, that we should sin-- yet John very well knew
   that all the saints do sin, for he has himself declared that if any man
   says that he does not sin he is a liar, and the Truth is not in him.

   Saints are, without exception, still sinners. Far be it from us to deny
   that Divine Grace has worked a wondrous change--it were not Grace at
   all if it had not. It will be well to note this change. The Christian
   no longer loves sin. It is the object of his sternest horror. He no
   longer regards it as a mere trifle, plays with it, or talks of it with
   unconcern. He looks upon it as a deadly serpent whose very shadow is to
   be avoided. He would no more venture voluntarily to put its cup to his
   lip than a man would drink poison who had once almost lost his life
   through it. Sin is dejected in the Christian's heart, though it is not
   ejected. Sin may enter the heart and fight for dominion, but it cannot
   sit upon the throne. It haunts the town of Mansoul and lurks in dens
   and corners to do mischief, but it is no longer honored in the streets,
   nor pampered in the palace. The head and the hands of Dagon are broken,
   although the stump remains.

   The Christian never sins with that enormity of boasting of which the
   unregenerate are guilty. Others wallow in transgressions and make their
   shame their glory, but if the Believer falls he is very quiet, mournful
   and vexed. Sinners go to their sins as children to their own father's
   orchard, but Believers slink away like thieves when they have been
   stealing forbidden fruit. Shame and sin are always in close company in
   a Christian. If he is drunken with evil he will be ashamed of himself
   and go to his bed like a whipped cur. He cannot proclaim his
   transgressions as some do in the midst of a ribald crowd, boasting of
   their exploits of evil. His heart is broken within him, and when he has
   sinned he goes with sore bones for many and many a day.

   Nor does he sin with the fullness of deliberation that belongs to other
   men. The sinner can sit down by the months together and think over the
   iniquity that he means to perpetrate, till he gets his plans well
   organized and has matured his project. But the Christian cannot do
   this. He may put the sin into his mouth and swallow it in a moment, but
   he cannot continue to roll it under his tongue. He who can carefully
   arrange and plot a transgression is still a true child of the old
   serpent.

   And again, the Believer never chews the cud of his sin. For after he
   has sinned, however sweet it may have been in his mouth, it becomes
   bitterness in his heart--and glad enough is he to be rid of it
   altogether. The retrospect of sin to a converted man is nothing but
   blackness and darkness in his heart. The Christian, unlike other men,
   never finds enjoyment in his sin. He is out of his element in it.
   Conscience pricks him. He cannot, even if he would, sin like others.
   There is a refined taste within him which all the while revolts at the
   apparently dainty morsel of sin. The finger of Divine Grace, with its
   secret and mysterious touch, turns all the honey into gall, and all the
   sweetness into wormwood.

   If the Christian shall sin, and sin, I grant he will, yet it shall
   always be with half-heartedness--still he clings to the right. The evil
   that he would not, he does, while the good that he would do, he fails
   to perform. You will notice, too, how different the Christian is as to
   the habit of sin. The ungodly man is frequent in overt deeds of
   rebellion, but the Christian, at least in open acts of crime and folly,
   rather falls into them rather than abides in them. The swallow dips
   with his wing the brook and then he is up again into the skies, soaring
   toward the sun. But the duck can swim in the pool or dive under the
   water--it is in its element. So the Christian just touches sometimes
   with his wing--alas, for him--the streams of earth, but then he is up
   again where he should be.

   It is only the sinner that can swim in sin and delight therein. You may
   drive the swine and the sheep together side by side. They come to some
   mire and they both fall into it, and both stain themselves. But you
   soon detect the difference in nature between them--for while the swine
   lies and wallows with intense gusto--the sheep is up again, escaping as
   soon as possible from the filth. So with the Christian. He falls, God
   knows how many times, but by His Grace, he rises up again--it is not
   his nature to lie in sin. He abhors himself that ever he should fall to
   the ground at all--while the ungodly goes on in his wicked way till sin
   becomes a habit and habit like an iron net has entangled him in its
   meshes.

   There are all these degrees of difference between the Christian and the
   ungodly man and far more, for the Believer is a new creature--he
   belongs to a holy generation and a peculiar people. The Spirit of God
   is in him and in all respects he is far removed from the natural man.
   But for all that we must come back to that with which we started--that
   the Christian is still a sinner. He is so from the imperfection of his
   nature. His nature is such that he cannot but sin until the old Adam
   shall die in him--and that will not be till the funeral knell is tolled
   for himself.

   Sin, by reason of his imperfection, pollutes the best thing the
   Believer does. Sin mars his repentance. There is filth in our tears and
   unbelief in our faith. The best thing we ever did apart from the merit
   of Jesus only swelled the number of our sins, for when we have been
   most pure in our own sight, yet, like the heavens, we are not pure in
   God's sight. And as He charged His angels with folly, much more must He
   charge us with it, even in our most angelic frame of mind. The song
   that thrills to Heaven and seeks to emulate seraphic strains has still
   mortal infirmity in it. The prayer which moves the arm of God is still
   a sinful prayer, and only moves that arm because the Sinless One, the
   great Mediator, has stepped in to take away the sin of our
   supplication.

   I dare to say it--the best faith or the highest degree of
   sanctification to which a Christian ever attained on earth, has still
   so much of the creature's infirmity in it as to be worthy of God's
   eternal wrath. In itself considered, there is so much sin about the
   highest and loftiest thing to which the creature can attain, that we
   mournfully confess--"We are altogether as an unclean thing and all our
   righteousnesses are but as filthy rags."

   As the Christian thus sins in his devout performances, so he constantly
   errs in the everyday tenor of his life. Sins of omission to wit--how
   many of these may be compressed into a single hour? Oh, what multitudes
   of things we have left undone! Remember that these make up a very great
   part of the sins which brings the curse. "I was thirsty and you gave Me
   no drink, sick and in prison and you visited Me not." Have we no sins
   of commission? Our thoughts, our imaginations, our words, and must I
   not say our deeds--have these been what they should be? If any man dare
   to tell me that he lives for a single day without a sinful deed, I will
   dare to tell him that he never knew himself.

   Do but look at your own chamber. If you disturb it I see but little
   dust floating about in it, but if a stray sunbeam shall enter through
   the window I see millions upon millions of little motes dancing up and
   down! And I discover that the whole of what I supposed to be clear,
   pure air, is filled with innumerable atoms of all sorts of things, and
   that I am breathing these even in the purest atmosphere. So is it with
   our heart and life. When the Spirit shines into us, we see that the
   atmosphere of life is as full of sin as it can hold. A man may sooner
   count the hairs of his head, or the sands upon the seashore, or the
   drops of the dew of the morning upon the grass, than count the sins of
   a single day.

   O Lord, You know us, but we know not ourselves. Yet this much we know,
   that we are a people full of sin and laden with iniquity. You will tell
   me these are little sins, but I remind you that a multitude of grains
   of sand may overload a vessel quite as surely as bars of iron--and
   therefore these daily iniquities should be confessed with care and
   repented of with sincerity. The Christian, then, from the imperfection
   of his nature, sins. The old unchanged fountain of Harah must send
   forth bitter water. The old Adam can do nothing else but sin.

   Fire can do nothing but burn. Water can do nothing but quench fire.
   Everything acts according to its nature. The new nature that is in us
   cannot sin, because it is born of God. It is so heavenly and Divine
   that it never stoops to anything like sin. There is a spark of the
   celestial and of the perfect within every Believer which never can be
   quenched. But the old Adam, that which made Paul cry out--"O wretched
   man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"--must
   sin and as certainly as sparks fly upward, so certainly the old nature
   will commit iniquity.

   Moreover, many Christian people sin from certain peculiar infirmities.
   You know, each of you, what your own infirmity may be, at least I hope
   you have been watchful enough to discover it. Some sin through
   shortness of temper. They are not long-winded in patience with their
   fellow creatures. They are vexed. They grow hot--perhaps they imagine
   some cause for anger where there is none--and they wax warm and speak
   unadvisedly with their tongue. This gives much trouble to many of the
   most gracious of men. A hasty temper is a perpetual temptation.

   There are others who have a high and proud spirit and if they fancy
   they are a little snubbed or put into the back ground, at once they
   feel inclined to resent it. There--listen to him--I am not to be thus
   trod upon! Who dares to treat me thus?" Many who have done good service
   for Christ have had to carry that thorn in their flesh even down to
   their graves. Sensitiveness, a high spirit, a suspicious
   temperament--these are like blisters to the feet of a pilgrim--he will
   always walk painfully, if not slowly. Some of us have to contend with
   sloth. Perhaps we are afflicted with a torpid liver, and the physician
   has never been able to touch the complaint.

   God help the man thus afflicted, for he will need to whip himself every
   day to his duty. And often he will feel so dull and sleepy, that he
   will wish for Cowper's "lodge in a vast wilderness, some boundless
   contiguity of shade," that he might hide himself in quiet from the toil
   of the spiritual harvest. How many we know, dear Friends, who have to
   contend with constant unbelief brought on through depression of
   spirits. Their nerves, perhaps, have experienced a great shock at some
   period in life and, constitutionally, they look always at the black
   side of affairs. If they see a grassy knoll they suspect it to be an
   extinct volcano. And if they happen to be in a green valley where the
   mountains frown like the battlements of Heaven, they are dreadfully
   afraid that an avalanche must certainly come down and destroy them.

   They cannot help it. It is a peculiarity of their constitution, but it
   leads them into much sin, and should cause them much repentance before
   the face of the living God. So I might go on to mention the peculiarity
   of some who are suffering from bashfulness. They will often be tempted
   to hold back where they ought to go forward--and if not to disavow
   their Master--yet not to proclaim their love for Him as boldly as they
   should do. The Christian, when he reads this verse, "If any man sins,"
   may well say--"Ah, indeed I do. Through these infirmities I constantly
   commit iniquity."

   And then, dear Friends, we all sin from the assaults of evil. There are
   times when we are not watchful, and as Satan is always on his
   watchtower he is sure to attack us just then. We wear our visor up, and
   then in flies the stone from the infernal sling. We have forgotten a
   piece of our armor and the enemy spies our nakedness and cuts us deep,
   leaving a scar for years. The temptations of the world, when we are
   thrust into ungodly company, and the trials of business, and even of
   the household--all these in unguarded moments may take the Christian
   off his feet.

   Ah, my Brothers and Sisters, Paul, who was not a whit behind the very
   chief of the Apostles, yet called himself the chief of sinners. And we
   with far inferior graces must take the lowest place, acknowledging that
   in us, that is in our flesh, there dwells no good thing. Sinner is my
   name, sinner my nature, but thanks be to Him who came to save sinners,
   I am a sinner saved by Free Grace.

   II. I now leave that point for a second one full of comfort. OUR SINS
   DO NOT DEPRIVE US OF OUR INTEREST IN CHRIST. Note the text. "If any man
   sins we have an Advocate." Yes, we have Him though we sin. We have Him
   still. It does not say, "If any man sins he has forfeited his
   Advocate," but, "we have an Advocate." Sinners though we are, all the
   sin that a Believer ever did or can be allowed to commit, cannot
   destroy his interest in the Lord Jesus Christ. Into whatever he may be
   suffered to fall, yet none of these things can by any possibility touch
   his title deeds. Indeed, in some characters Jesus is only mine when I
   can claim the name of sinner.

   I cannot have an Advocate unless I do sin, otherwise I do not need one.
   Who wants an advocate to plead his cause in a court of law if there is
   no suit against him? Sin is a charge against me. I am a sinner. I have
   an Advocate. I have today a Brother in Christ. "Go, tell my Brothers
   and Sisters," said He. And yet they had all forsaken Him, and therefore
   were all sinners--but He was their Brother still. I have a Husband in
   Christ too, though I sin. "Israel has forsaken Me," says God, "and
   played the harlot. She has gone whoring from Me, but return, return,
   for I am married unto you." She is His wife still, you see, though she
   had gone into adultery.

   The Christian, even when he has stained and fouled himself, is the
   spouse of Christ still for all that. We are members of His Body, and if
   so, the members cannot be removed or taken off and on--limbs are not so
   easily removed. Did not Christ wash Peter? Peter was a member of
   Christ's own Body, and yet Peter wanted washing. O blessed picture, the
   Head washing the feet. So at this day, stained though we are, we are
   claimants of Christ as Head of our body. And, Beloved, we know that
   notwithstanding all our sin we are perfectly justified in Christ, for
   He justifies the ungodly. We know, too, that we are perfectly accepted,
   for we are accepted in the Beloved, and not in ourselves.

   Notwithstanding all our iniquities we are pardoned, for the fountain is
   opened for sin and for all uncleanness--not for righteousness and
   purity--but for sin and for uncleanness. Therefore we conclude that all
   our sins do not deprive us of that which Christ is to us, namely, the
   Fountain of Life and light and purity and safety. Oh, my Brothers and
   Sisters, if our first title to Christ had depended on our good works,
   then it would fall when our works grew bad, but He loved us when we
   were as bad as we could be--

   "He saw us ruined in the Fall, Yet loved us notwithstanding all."

   He chose us when we were sinners. He bought us when we were sinners. He
   loved us when we were dead in trespasses and sins. And if we are as bad
   as that today, He loves us still.

   If our right to Heaven rested on the Covenant of Works, that unstable
   tenure, it would soon fail us. But seeing it rests on the Covenant of
   Grace, which has no conditions in it, but which is of pure Immutable
   Grace from first to last, therefore be it known unto you, O sons of
   God, that notwithstanding all your faults and failings, wanderings and
   back-slidings, He is your God and you are His children. He will be your
   God to all eternity and you shall be His children world without end.
   "What a bold thing to say!" says one. Yes, and did I not tell you that
   I meant to say it to the little children, that they sin not?

   I believe that the bold open statement of the fact that all the sin
   that a Believer can commit cannot mar his interest in Christ, though it
   may mar his enjoyment of that interest for the present. Believing, I
   say, that this doctrine, instead of driving men to sin, will draw them
   to love that gracious and immutable God, who notwithstanding all our
   sins and cares and woe, will never suffer us to perish.

   III. Now let us change the note a little. Our third point is THAT THE
   ADVOCATE IS PROVIDED ON PURPOSE TO MEET THE FACT THAT WE ARE STILL
   SINNERS.

   If I am a sinner, then there is a court. And there is one who sits as
   Judge--the Father. There is a charge against me, otherwise I should not
   want an Advocate to meet it--and this implies that I have sinned. There
   is an adversary to press his suit against me, and he would hardly
   venture to do this if there were no sin. There must be a right of reply
   on my part. I must have the right to put in a disclaimer in court, and
   to stand up and plead before the bar of justice. He who has a right to
   plead in court is the man who is accused--the man who has some offense.
   If I were neither accused nor had been a sinner, then I should have no
   right to occupy the time of the court. But being a sinner, and being
   brought up upon that charge and having one who presses the charge
   against me, I have a right to reply and that reply, through God's good
   Grace, I have a right to make through my Advocate.

   Let us say, concerning our Advocate, that He is ordained with a special
   view to sinners. All His names and attributes prove Him to be a
   suitable Advocate for such. You and I, who though saved, are still
   sinners, may safely put our case into His hands, for look who He
   is--"Jesus Christ the righteous." "Jesus." Ah, then He is an Advocate
   such as I want, for He loves me and takes an interest in me. Jesus is
   the name of one who became Man for my sake. He knows what sore
   temptations mean, He understands what trials mean, what afflictions
   mean. I am glad I have One who will be interested in my welfare, and
   will plead for me as a Friend for a friend, and as a Brother for a
   brother.

   I thank God, that though I sin, I still have Jesus who is my, "Brother
   born for adversity," the Friend of sinners, and will, therefore, plead
   the sinner's part. Is His name Jesus? Then He is sure to succeed,
   because, "they shall call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people
   from their sins." His very name implies His success. Is His name Jesus?
   Then if He does not succeed in my case, His honor is compromised. He is
   called Jesus because He does save sinners--if He does not save me--He
   is not Jesus. If I, a sinner, trusting in Him, give Him my cause to
   plead as my Advocate, and I am tried, and the verdict is against me, He
   is not Jesus. He may lay down His claim to be Jesus, for He does not,
   and cannot save His people from their sins.

   Beloved Friends, do you not see how the saint is regarded as a sinner
   because He who is his Advocate is the appointed Savior of sinners? He
   is put down as their Advocate, I say, because He is the sinner's
   Friend. I never heard of His pleading for the righteous. I never
   dreamed of His being the Friend of the sinless. I find Him always on
   the side of publicans and sinners--offenders, and those who have gone
   out of the way. And therefore I conclude, that sinner though I am,
   continually sinning as I am, I may leave my case with Jesus, for He is
   just the advocate the sinner wants.

   Notice, next, it is "Jesus Christ"--Christos--the Anointed. This shows
   His authority to plead. There are only certain gentlemen who can plead
   in the Court of Chancery. And only certain others that can enter the
   Common Pleas, or the King's Bench. Jesus Christ has a right to plead,
   for He is the Father's own Appointed, the Father's own Anointed. My
   Soul, you have a good Pleader, One whom God Himself has chosen to plead
   the sinner's cause. If he were of your choosing, he might fail. But if
   God has laid help upon One that is mighty, feel safe to put your
   trouble where God has laid His help. He is Christ, and therefore
   authorized.

   But I add, He is Christ and therefore qualified, for the anointing has
   also qualified Him for His work. He can plead better than Jacob pleaded
   when he spoke for Benjamin. He can plead so as to move the heart of God
   and prevail. What words of tenderness, what sentences of persuasion
   will He use when He stands up to plead for me! But more, He is
   Christ--that is, He is God's Messiah. Therefore God would not send Him
   unless He guaranteed Him. If God should send into this world a Savior
   who could not save, then God would have no mercy. God's appointing and
   sending Christ is a guarantee of Christ's success. Oh, my Soul, you
   have One well fitted to be your Advocate and One that cannot but
   succeed! Leave yourself entirely in His hands.

   Notice next, it is "Jesus Christ the righteous." This is not only His
   Character, but it is His plea. It is His Character, and if my Advocate
   is righteous, then I am sure He would not take up a bad cause. I do not
   know, it may be right for a lawyer to plead for a villain when he knows
   him to be a villain. But this I think, the greater villain the lawyer
   is the better qualified would he be to do it. But my Lord and Master,
   the great Advocate, would not plead a bad cause, for He is Jesus Christ
   the righteous. Therefore if I sin, if I am put down among the many men
   that sin--if He pleads for me, my case must be good--for He would not
   take up a bad one.

   But how can He do this? Why, because He meets the charge of
   unrighteousness against me by this plea on His part-- that He is
   righteous. He seems to say to the great Father in the day when the
   sinner stands arraigned--"Yes, my Father, that sinner was unrighteous,
   but remember that I was accepted as His Substitute. I stood to keep the
   Law for him, and gave My active obedience. I went up to the Cross and
   bled, and so gave My passive obedience. I have covered him from head to
   foot with My doing and My dying. I have so arrayed him that not even
   the angels are adorned as he is, for though they may be clothed with
   the perfect righteousness of a creature, I have given him the
   righteousness of God Himself. I am become unto My people the Lord their
   righteousness.

   "Look, I have taken the jewels out of My crown to bedeck them. I have
   taken the garments from My own back to cover them, and the blood from
   My own veins to make the dye in which I have dipped their garments,
   till they are purpled with imperial glory." What can there be asked
   more for the sinner than this? Jesus Christ the righteous stands up to
   plead for me, and pleads His righteousness. And mark, He does this not
   if I do not sin, but if I do sin. There is the beauty of my text. It
   does not say, "If any man does not sin we have an Advocate." But, "if
   any man sins we have an Advocate." So that when I have sinned and come
   creeping up to my closet with a guilty conscience and an aching heart,
   and feel that I am not worthy to be called God's son, I still have an
   Advocate, because I am one of the many men that sin. I sin and I have
   an Advocate.

   Oh, I know not how to express the joy I feel in my soul to be able to
   put it so! It is not, "If any man is righteous, we have an Advocate."
   It is not, "If any man is prayerful, and careful, and godly, and walks
   rightly and in the light," and so on, but, "If any man SINS we have an
   Advocate." Oh, my Soul, there is the music of God's heart in those
   words! Music such as the prodigal heard at the festival which welcomed
   his return. "If any man sins we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
   Christ the righteous."

   IV. And now we turn to our fourth point which is that THIS TRUTH, SO
   EVANGELICAL AND SO DIVINE,

   SHOULD BE PRACTICALLY REMEMBERED. It should be practically remembered,
   dear Friends, at all times. Every day I find it most healthy to my own
   soul to try and walk as a saint, but in order to do so, I must
   continually come to Christ as a sinner. I would seek to be perfect. I
   would strain after every virtue, and forsake every false way. But
   still, as to my standing before God, I find it happiest to sit where I
   sat when first I looked to Jesus, on the rock of His works, having
   nothing to do with my own righteousness, but only with His.

   Depend on it, dear Friends, the happiest way of living is to live as a
   poor sinner, and as nothing at all--having Jesus Christ as All in All.
   You may have all your growths in sanctification, all your progress in
   graces, all the development of your virtues that you will. But still I
   do earnestly pray you never to put any of these where Christ should be.
   If you have begun in Christ, then finish in Christ. If you have begun
   in the flesh, and then go on in the flesh, we know what the sure result
   will be. But if you have begun with Jesus Christ as your Alpha, let Him
   be your Omega. I pray you never think you are rising when you get above
   this, for it is not rising, but slipping downwards to your ruin. Stand
   still to this--

   "Nothing in my hands I bring, Simply to Your Cross I cling.
   Still a sinner. But still having an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
   Christ, the righteous--let this be the spirit of your everyday life.
   Make this essentially the rule of your life on particular occasions.
   Here let me say a word that may at once comfort and enlighten some here
   who are in darkness. When the Spirit of God gives you a clearer view of
   your own depravity, mind that you hold to this--"If any man sins we
   have an Advocate with the Father." Perhaps when you were first
   converted you did not suspect the depth of wickedness that lay in your
   heart. Perhaps you did not believe that you could be so unutterably bad
   as you really were. But lately the fountains of the great deep have
   been broken up and you have been horrified. You are almost driven mad,
   or else into despondency and despair by this discovery of your innate
   corruption, until you fly to this--"Sinner as I am and never more
   consciously so than I am now that God's Spirit has enlightened me, I
   yet know that if any man sins we have an Advocate with the Father and
   I, black, foul and filthy--more foul and filthy than I ever thought
   myself to be-- put my case into the hands of my Advocate and leave it
   there forever."

   When after this you have fallen into sin, and oh, I may address some
   member of this Church who has done this though the pastor knows it
   not--you have fallen into some sin that pricks your conscience. You
   carry about with you a something that will not let you sleep at night.
   There is a sin that disturbs you, and you wish you could forget that
   you had committed it. You have gone before God as David did. You have
   used the language of the fifty-first Psalm, but you cannot get rid of
   that sin. You believe you are a child of God sometimes, but that sin
   has got into your conscience and, like a cancer, is eating into your
   comfort.

   My Brother, now is your time--"If any man sins, we have an Advocate
   with the Father." Jesus Christ is of no use to you if He will only save
   you when you have no sin. Let me repeat it--now you are a sinner. Now
   you are condemned by the verdict of your own conscience. Now you have
   sinned, sinned willfully and foully--and God forbid that I should
   extenuate your sin. Yet, let your sin be as gross, and black, and
   hellish as it may be, if you believe in Jesus Christ you have an
   Advocate with the Father. And through that Advocate your cause shall
   rest and your sin shall be put away.

   Perhaps you will tell me that your sin has had some gross aggravation
   about it. If you are a Christian it has, for a Christian always sins
   worse than other men. If the sin is not in itself so bad as other
   men's, it is worse in you. For a king's favorite to play the traitor is
   villainy, indeed. For one that has been highly favored, as you have
   been, with visits of love from Jesus--to be false to Him--oh, this is
   shame, double shame to Him! For you who have been washed in His blood
   to crucify Him afresh, what shall I say to that? You deserve the
   hottest wrath of God and the deepest Hell. But thus says the Lord unto
   you--I have blotted out your sins like a cloud, and like a thick cloud
   your iniquities. Return unto Me." "If any man sins, we have an Advocate
   with the Father."

   It does not say, "If some men sin we have no advocate." Or, "If some
   men sin in an aggravated way." No, it is not put so. It says, "If any
   man sins, we have an Advocate with the Father." So that though you have
   heaped aggravations one upon another, and your crime has been as foul
   as any that could have been committed, still you can say, "we have an
   Advocate." Fly with a humble, contrite heart, and throw yourself at the
   feet of that Advocate, and by His blood, and by His wounds He will
   plead for you, and you shall prevail.

   What if I add to all this that you have so sinned as to bring a scandal
   upon the name of God, upon His Church, and upon His cause? Oh, my
   Brothers and Sisters, you may well weep in secret. You may weep tears
   of blood for having done this. But still, for all that, I cannot shut
   the gate where God sets it wide open. I have not a thunderbolt for you.
   If you are a child of God, mercy is still free, and still it is
   preached to you--"If any man sins," publicly, like David, so as to make
   God's enemies to blaspheme, yet still, "we have an Advocate with the
   Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." Oh, what splendid mercy is this!
   Archangel never dreamed of such mercy as this to sinners, to real
   sinners, to hugely vile sinners, to black, hellish sinners, to devilish
   sinners, to such as no adjective can be found to describe them! Yet, if
   they believe in Jesus, sin as they may, they still have, "an Advocate
   with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous."

   I wish I could meet the case of that Brother yonder, who has long given
   up all hope of ever being restored. He has been excommunicated. He has
   been driven away from the society of the godly. He thinks, though he is
   in this house this morning, he has no business here. And sometimes the
   devil has tempted him to make away with himself, and he has said, if I
   must be lost I may as well be lost at once. Ah, but, my Brother, you
   dare not do it with such a text of Scripture as this before your eyes!
   The Lord loves you still, and if He ever loved you, all your sin cannot
   wean His heart from you. You may have gone to the utmost length of your
   tether, but He has so tied you that you can never go beyond it! You may
   have gotten to the very extremity and edge of the precipice, but over
   that edge you must not, and you shall not go!

   This day He sends me to stop you. Return! Return! Return! A Father bids
   you return! You are feeding swine today, and all foul and filthy as you
   are, you would desire fill your belly with their husks. But you
   cannot--you have a hunger that husks can never satisfy. Your Father
   waits to receive you. Come, He will meet you. He will fall upon your
   neck and kiss you. He will set you at His own table and there shall be
   music and dancing for you. The best robe awaits you, Prodigal! The
   fatted calf is killed for you! Come! O believe it! Believe that God is
   able to do this great thing for you. "As high as the heavens are above
   the earth, so high are His thoughts above your thoughts, and His ways
   above your ways."--

   "What though your numerous sins exceed
   The stars that fill the skies,
   And, aiming at the Eternal Throne,
   Like pointed mountains rise," yet still the red sea of Jesus' blood
   shall cover the tops of the mountains of your sins, till, like Noah's
   ark, that floated twenty cubits upwards, the tops of the mountains
   shall be covered. "If any man sins"--here, you see, there is nothing
   said about goodness, nothing about virtue, or tenderness of heart--it
   is only put, "If any man sins, we have an Advocate."

   O you that believe in Jesus, pray for those who believe not, that they,
   too, may have an Advocate. If you and I have come and put our trust in
   Him, and found a shelter in His wounds, let us never be satisfied till
   we see our children, our brothers, our sisters, our friends, our
   kinsfolk brought to this Advocate. Go and tell it wherever your voices
   can be heard, that Jesus Christ receives SINNERS, and that He eats with
   them. Go and say that He is the sinner's Friend, and that He is willing
   to take them as they are and wash them and make them whiter than snow.

   Since you have proved it yourself, and need to prove it every day, try
   and bring others to the conviction of it, that they, with you, may sing
   to the praise of that Divine love which has given the Advocate to every
   Believer, whatever his guilt and condemnation may have been. The Lord
   bless you now, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                          The Minister'S Stock-Taking

   A SERMON DELIVERED BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN
   TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And some believed the things which were spoken and some believed not."

   Acts 28:24.

   THIS is the only proper way to calculate the results of our ministry.
   We just want the account book ruled with two columns. On one side we
   must put down the long list of the some that believe not. And on the
   brighter side we may enter what is, too often, the far less number of
   the some that believe. This is the only true method, I repeat it, by
   which we can hold a stock-taking so as to ascertain the net profit of
   the preaching of the Gospel. We must not estimate the good that is done
   by the number of those who listen. It is a very pleasant thing to see
   the House of Prayer filled to overflowing.

   It is intensely delightful to reflect that often on the Sunday evening
   in London the theatres are full, St. Paul's Cathedral is full, and
   multitudes of Churches and Chapels are crowded with willing listeners.
   Still, it is not all pleasure. Instead of its being of any advantage
   for the persons who have heard the Gospel but have not believed, it
   will rather increase their doom. If they have only heard, and the Truth
   of God has penetrated no deeper than the natural ear, then alas for the
   preachers who have spent their strength for nothing! And alas for the
   multitudes who, having ears, have heard as though they heard not!

   Nor ought we to calculate the result of our work by the persons who
   have been pleased with our ministry. What man is not gratified when he
   hears that the people have been pleased with his preaching? It were not
   in flesh and blood for a man to be unpleased by applause. The love of
   praise is ingrained in human nature--

   "The proud to gain it toils on toils endure, The modest shun it but to
   make it sure." But still, it were a miserable thing if all that a man
   accomplishes is just to win the ear and to strike the people with
   wonder at the amazing way in which he could utter forth the Words of
   Truth. Shall God's servants live upon the breath of men's nostrils? Can
   the approbation of the crowd be nutritious enough to constitute the
   solid food of a God-sent herald of the Cross?

   Never! When a man has to die, this shall give him no comfort. To have
   preached faithfully, though some were angry, will always be
   consolatory. To have preached unfaithfully, or to have held back any
   part of the Truth of God, though he may have won universal acclaim,
   would be but a passport to perdition at the last. No, no, if our
   ministry has only pleased people it is good for nothing. A sermon often
   does a man most good when it makes him most angry. Those people who
   walk down the aisles and say, "I will never listen to that man again,"
   very often have an arrow rankling in their breast.

   Smarting from a wound that never will be healed till God heals it--they
   will come again right enough. Others, alas, who are quite pleased and
   delighted, will come and go from the place of the holy, unimpressed and
   unimpressionable as slabs of marble--down which the oil runs without
   producing the slightest impression.

   Nor even dare we hastily to calculate the effect of our ministry by the
   number of persons impressed with serious convictions. Of course, it is
   a hopeful sign to see the people weep under the Word, especially if it
   is the Gospel that moves them to weep and not the pathos of the
   preacher. I do not think it does anybody much good spiritually when
   tears are excited simply by the description of a funeral, or by being
   reminded of one's childhood, or of one's parents. Some preachers appeal
   much to the passions and think when the congregation are weeping, good
   is being done. I do not see the use of it at all.

   When the preacher can make these natural emotions a platform upon which
   to stand and work upon the conscience, then it is well and good. But if
   he has only succeeded in drawing briny tears from mortal eyes, they may
   flow until the floor is watered with them without any salutary result.
   We must go deeper than the eyes. We want to make the heart weep. We
   want tears of penitence for sin, not tears of regret for departed
   husbands and wives. We want emotions which spring from a startled
   conscience--not those which come from a want of resignation to the
   Divine will. No, dear Friends, we have done nothing after we have
   preached a thousand times unless we can write down that some believe on
   the Lord Jesus.

   I. Turning to our text a little more closely, let us remark, in the
   first place, that UNDER THE BEST MINISTRY IN THE WORLD THE RESULTS WILL
   BE DIVERSE, AND THAT YOU WANT TWO COLUMNS TO WRITE THE

   ACCOUNT IN.

   There will always be the some that believe and the some that believe
   not. This is not altogether the minister's fault. It is the custom of
   the age to blame ministers very much, and I dare say we deserve it. But
   still the blame in this matter does not lay entirely with us, for even
   when Paul preached--a model preacher, he!--there were, "some believed
   the things which were spoken, and some believed not." Did I say that
   Paul was a model preacher? Let me prove it. Was he not a model preacher
   as to matter?

   There are some persons who greatly admire a doctrinal preacher. They
   like a man who will lay down the doctrines as a master-builder would
   put the stones--one here, another there--each one in its proper place.
   When they go up to the House of Prayer they say they want really to
   learn something, to get some thought, to get a deeper insight into some
   great Biblical Truth, and they are not satisfied unless their
   understandings are provided for. Mere appeals to the passions they do
   not care about. They want to have their minds enlightened.

   Well, a doctrinal preacher is an exceedingly useful man, especially if
   he does not degenerate into endless controversy, preaching Christ of
   envy and strife. I have heard it said that while a course of some
   twelve lectures by any ordinary lecturer on geology would give you a
   pretty clear idea of the science, you might sit and listen to twelve
   hundred sermons upon Christianity by some ministers and never get an
   idea of what are its fundamental doctrines. If it is so, it is a crying
   evil, and grievously will the Church have to answer for it in the ill
   that will come upon her. It may be so in some cases, but I am sure it
   was not so with the Apostle Paul.

   Who could preach doctrine more clearly than he did? If you want the
   very highest doctrine, read the ninth chapter of Romans. If you would
   have a clear system of Truth, read the Epistle to the Ephesians. If a
   young man wants to get a body of Divinity in miniature, he has only to
   read that Epistle. The Apostle is full of the most weighty matter and
   the most important Truths. He keeps back nothing that is profitable for
   the people. He can say, "I have not shunned to declare the whole
   counsel of God." To him it never was a question as to which part of the
   Truth would best please the people. He gave them the whole of it in due
   season.

   But yet even under the Apostle Paul there were some that believed not!
   And you, young Man, if you have been listening to the Gospel under any
   minister, if you have not been converted, neither would you have been
   if you had heard Paul. Having Moses and the Prophets with you at this
   day, if you do not believe them, neither would you be converted, though
   an Apostle should rise from the dead.

   I think I hear one observe--"Well, I do not care for a doctrinal
   preacher myself. I like an experimental preacher best." Be it so, dear
   Friend, and I can fully approve your choice. I like an experimental
   preacher, because he can get inside a man's heart and see what is
   there. He knows just what I am and what I feel. If I am distressed, he
   has been distressed, too. And he can talk of my temptations and of my
   trials, because they have been his own. If I am full of comfort or full
   of joy he has been up on the mountain, too, and he tells me of my
   ecstasy and of my delights. If I find some knotty passage in my inner
   life, he can translate it for me, for he has been through it all
   himself.

   Perhaps of the three orders of preachers--the doctrinal, the
   experimental, and the practical--the experimental preacher is the most
   useful. I think if one had to choose which should be his pastor, he
   should prefer such a man as this, for a ministry without any experience
   in it must be a very poor, miserable, savorless thing to the people of
   God. But do you not think that in this respect the Apostle Paul,
   himself, was a perfect model? Would you understand the conflicts of the
   human heart? Does not Paul paint them to life as he says--"When I would
   do good, evil is present with me. To will is present with me, but how
   to perform that which is good I find not"? And again, "O wretched man
   that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"

   Does he not just express the sighing and longing of all the children of
   God who have been vexed with contests within? On the other hand, if you
   have high and glorious frames, the Apostle can go with you, and beyond
   you, and tell you of times when he was caught up to the third heavens
   and heard things which it is not possible for a man to utter. Are you
   full of assurance and confidence? Then Paul preaches to you from this
   text--"I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
   principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
   height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us
   from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

   Are you full of apprehensions? Then he fears and trembles with
   you--"Lest that by any means when I have preached to others, I myself
   should be a castaway." Paul had his doubts and fears and was afraid
   that he might perish, after all. Yet he had his high flights and
   glorious confidences and knew that the Believer in Christ could never
   be cast away. But mark you, if you have listened to the preaching of
   the Gospel and have remained an unbeliever under it, neither would you
   be converted though the Apostle Paul's deep experimental knowledge
   should be brought to bear upon your conscience. For even under him
   there were some that believed not--and so I suppose it would be even
   were he here now.

   Then there is the practical preacher and some men greatly admire him.
   So do I if he does not become legal, and if he does not degenerate into
   a preacher of mere morality. If he shall urge holiness upon the people
   of God, from evangelical motives, he may be very useful. But if upon
   legal terms he strives to stir the people of God to good works, he will
   do more harm than good. Yes, the practical preacher is very useful. The
   man who tells me precisely what my duty is in my sphere of life. The
   preacher who talks to me as a husband, a master, a servant, or as a
   son--who when I come after the cares of the week and sit down in my
   pew--refreshes my memory about my week's faults, and tells me how to
   behave myself during the week that is to come--such a man is useful.

   And who ever did this so well as the Apostle Paul? That same Epistle to
   the Ephesians, which is an epitome of doctrinal theology, also contains
   the practical precepts of the Gospel fully written out. Children,
   parents, fathers, husbands, wives, servants, masters--the Apostle has a
   word to everyone. He is pre-eminently practical, generally basing his
   appeals for righteous conduct upon some Divine motive. Yet, dear
   Friends, if you have not been converted, I have no reason to believe it
   is because your ministers fail on the practical points. For even had
   you heard the Apostle, who was a pattern in this respect, neither would
   you have been converted, for under him some believed not.

   Now put the practical, the experimental, and the doctrinal together,
   and you get the model exhibited in the Apostle Paul. Would that we had
   such preachers in all pulpits, and such ministers to preside over all
   flocks. But even if such were given to us, there would still be some
   that believed not. "Yes, yes," says one, "I do not doubt that the
   matter was right enough. But you know there is more required of a
   preacher than matter. It is manner we want." Well now, I hold that the
   Apostle Paul was a model preacher as to manner, too. He was a bold
   preacher. He never feared the face of man, but preached just what the
   Lord told him, in the Lord's own words, whether men would hear or
   whether they would not.

   He was an eloquent preacher. Barnabas was no mean speaker, but Paul was
   a better speaker than he was. For at Ly-stra they called Paul,
   "Mercury," and Mercury was their god of eloquence. Perhaps the
   concluding part of the eighth chapter of Romans is the most remarkable
   piece of human language ever known. He who wrote it was a master, able
   to soar with eagle wings to any height, yet willing for the most part
   to keep near the ground. "Not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but
   with simplicity and godly sincerity he ordered his speech." He was a
   profound thinker, capable of the deepest argument or the finest
   allegory, but withal an easy talker, who loved to tell of the Grace of
   God.

   When occasion required, as an impassioned orator, his thunders could
   make Festus tremble. And his persuasive appeals could wring confessions
   from Agrippa. But as a teacher in the Church of God, he was
   proverbially plain spoken. He spoke like a child, and babes in Divine
   Grace were fed under his ministry as with pure milk. This is just the
   style we want. Not the simplicity of ignorance, but the dignified
   simplicity of the man who has really the highest intellect, if he cared
   to show it, but who rather chooses to instruct the poor and ignorant.
   Then the Apostle was very affectionate with his boldness and
   simplicity. He loved the souls of men. He felt sometimes such a
   passionate longing to save souls, that he was almost ready to lose his
   own soul, if he might but save others.

   "Oh," you say, "but that was an extravagant thing for him to say." Yes,
   love is often extravagant, and I will never believe that a man has any
   love at all if he speaks in a cold, calculating way. Love must
   sometimes speak in rapturous phrases, which in its cooler moments it
   would not endorse. When I hear the Apostle say, "I could wish myself
   accursed from Christ for my Brothers and Sisters according to the
   flesh," I understand what his love means. He feels as if his own
   personal interest in Jesus he would gladly give up, if he might but see
   his own kindred saved. It is in a spirit akin with that of Moses, when
   he said, "If not, blot my name out of the Book of Life."

   Dear, dear! How critics and commentators have stumbled over these two
   passages! They cannot make it out. They cannot understand it. But I
   tell you, Paul meant exactly what he said. I have felt the same strong
   emotion boiling in my own soul when I have looked upon some immense
   congregation and my heart has yearned for their conversion. I have felt
   that if I could die as a substitute for them I would do it. Of course,
   in more sober moments, no man would ever barter his own soul's
   salvation on any account--nor is it possible that such a ransom could
   be accepted. Still, love makes one feel as if even that were less than
   the evil that threatens our people and we exclaim, with Esther, "How
   can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?"

   The Apostle, thus full of eloquence, of love, and of holy boldness,
   seeking after souls, pressing them home with blessed arguments,
   pleading with them night and day with many tears--was a faithful and a
   perfect minister--as nearly so as mortal can be. "Oh," says one, "I
   wish I sat under such a minister!" Yes, but are you converted to God?
   For if you are not, I am not sure that you would be saved if you had
   Paul, himself, for a pastor. If at your wish he could leave his grave,
   start up, unwrap his cerements and address you from this pulpit, I have
   no reason to believe that his voice would have any more power over you
   than another man's voice. Paul would plant in vain where others have
   not been successful. And if you have not believed on Jesus with this
   Book in your houses, with your Sabbaths repeated hundreds of times,
   with earnest, affectionate parents, and with loving friends, neither
   would you be converted though Paul rose from the dead.

   II. I now proceed to notice, in the second place, THE TWO SORTS OF
   PEOPLE, AND THE REASON WHY

   SOME BELIEVED, AND WHY SOME BELIEVED NOT.

   There were some that believed. Shall I describe them? So far as one
   young man is concerned, I will just give a little sketch of his history
   and that sketch will suffice for all. He dropped in one Sunday morning
   to hear the preacher. He stood in the aisle, for he did not intend to
   stay the whole time. But the place was full and he could not get out.
   He listened. He thought it very commonplace. It did not attract his
   attention much. But all of a sudden--yes, it was so--the Truth of God
   dropped right into his heart. He listened with greater interest than he
   had done before. He gathered himself up. Another sentence came.

   When he came in, he was like a man in armor. All the shots fell upon
   his armor and were repelled. But now something had got in between the
   joints. He listened again. The preacher went on to discourse of
   righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, and the young man felt
   as if there was no one else in the place. The minister's eyes were on
   him. He began to tremble. "What must I do to be saved?" was the
   language that was in his heart, though he could not utter it with his
   lips. He walked out of that aisle a calm and quiet man. He went home.
   There was no talking on the way. He went into his chamber.

   Well, I will not say he prayed the first time but it was something like
   it, for he breathed out words like these, "Oh, ah, would that!" He
   began to have living desires after the living God. In the evening he
   went to the House of God again. It seemed that night as if the preacher
   prepared a most terrible sermon on purpose for him. The whole sermon
   through, the great hammer of God seemed to be breaking his flinty heart
   smaller and smaller till there was not a single piece of it that was
   not ground to powder. He could not help feeling that there was no hope
   for him--that mercy would never reach his case. He had thought that
   morning that he was about as good as most people, and that if it did
   not fare well with him, it would fare ill with all the world. But now
   he felt himself to be the vilest of the vile. He could not understand
   it, nor could his friends, either.

   They thought he had been taken with a fit of melancholy. They hoped it
   would wear off. But it did not wear off. He was very quiet that week.
   He could not go out with his friends to places of amusement as he had
   been accustomed to do. One of them did get him to one place, but he was
   so miserable that he came out when it was half over and said, "I have
   no taste for such things now. I cannot stay." Well, I do not know how
   long it was that this went on--in some cases it is only a few minutes,
   in others it is a long, long time. I knew one young man with whom it
   lasted for five years--and he stands here today to tell of that long
   period of affliction.

   That young man went in a state of sadness and grief on account of sin,
   seeking rest and finding none, till one morning the preacher lifted up
   Christ upon the Cross and said--this is the import of the words he
   used--"You see the Hebrew Prophet raise the brazen serpent high upon
   the Cross. Look, look, you that are bitten with serpents! Turn here
   your eyes--however swollen you are, do but look! There is life in a
   look at the brazen serpent for any of you, for all of you."

   And then the preacher said, "See Jesus hanging there on His Cross? His
   wounds are streaming. His head is bowed down with grief. There is life
   in a look at the Crucified. Sinner, there is life this moment for you."

   He explained that to look was simply to trust Christ and to put one's
   confidence in the blood and merits of the Lord Jesus. Well, the young
   man had heard that a great many times, but he had never heard it with
   his conscience before. It had never sunk deep down into his heart. Now
   it came home to him. Standing there in the aisle just as he was,
   conscious of his guilt and ruin, he turned his eyes to Jesus. He
   looked. He lived. He went his way like a man who had received a new
   life. He was blessed, happy, joyful! A tremendous burden had rolled
   into the deep sepulcher. The chains had been snapped from his manacled
   wrists. He was free! And whereas he could not creep before, he now ran
   and danced for joy and gladness of heart!

   That is how it all came about. The conversion was so worked by his
   simply hearing his ruin and learning the remedy. The young man waited
   awhile in prayer and silent meditation and matured the piety which God
   had given him. He then came forward and made a profession of his faith.
   It was a happy day when he saw the pastor and told his experience, when
   he was joined to the Church and separated from the world. From that day
   all that knew him could but marvel at the change.

   And now comes the question, "Why did some believe?" Well, it was not
   any difference in the preacher, for the same preacher addressed both.
   It was not any difference in the sermon, for the same sermon was
   preached to all the people and yet some believed and some did not. It
   could not be the power of persuasion, for there were some that were
   persuaded and some that were not by the very same address. Nor can we
   attribute it to a difference of constitution, for that were to make
   salvation of works, and not of Divine Grace. Were we to bring up the
   old legal Covenant again, and thus preach another Gospel, then we
   should be accursed. I only know of one answer to this question, "Why
   did some believe?"

   And the answer is this--because God willed it. "He will have mercy on
   whom He will have mercy, and He will have compassion on whom He will
   have compassion." "It is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs,
   but of God that shows mercy." If any man is saved, it is not because he
   willed to be saved. If any man is brought to Christ, it is not of any
   effort of his. The root, the cause, the motive of the salvation of any
   human being, and of all the chosen in Heaven is to be found in the
   predestinating purpose and sovereign distinguishing will of the Lord,
   our God. I know some Christians do not hold this as a doctrine, but I
   believe there is no Christian alive who does not believe it as a matter
   of experience.

   I was once with a good Christian man who was a little blind in both
   eyes, and he laid down this theory--if God gave Grace to one, He was
   bound--just listen to this--He was bound to give it to all. God, he
   said, was no respecter of persons, which I interpret to mean that He
   did not owe anything to anybody, but did just as He liked with them.
   But he understood it to mean that God gave alike to all, and that if He
   gave anything to one, He must give the same to another. You see,
   however, that if it is a matter of debt to anybody, then it is not a
   matter of Grace any longer. Well, after that, we had prayer, and my
   friend prayed for his own family and his unconverted relatives--yes,
   actually prayed to God to give more Grace to them that they might
   believe and be saved!

   When he had done, I said, "Well now, that would have been a very proper
   prayer for me to offer, because I think it just for God to give more to
   one than He does to another. But it was a very improper prayer for you,
   and completely subversive of your own theory. In fact, you have no
   right to make a distinction, and to pray for your own child more than
   for anybody else's child. According to your scheme you believe that God
   ought to serve all alike, whereas I believe that no man has any claim
   on God--that if He pleases to save anyone He has a right to do it--and
   that if men perish they perish because they deserve to perish. And I,
   therefore, can present special petitions to God for special persons."

   I remember hearing of a case where a very high Calvinistic Brother
   never would believe that a Wesleyan could have the Grace of God in him,
   so bigoted was he to his own views. One night there was a Prayer
   Meeting and the gas would not light. They could not get it to light,
   and at last it was proposed to hold the meeting in the dark. A Wesleyan
   prayed first. He was at the far end of the room and he prayed, oh, so
   sweetly! Our Calvinistic friend said--"What a delightful prayer! What a
   depth of doctrinal knowledge! What a blessed character that person must
   be!"

   So he watched for him when he came out--he stood at the door to find
   him. And to his surprise discovered who had been offering the prayer
   that was so full of Divine Grace and the Truth of God. I believe that
   if once we came to real, experimental godliness, we should not find a
   child of God anywhere that would not in some form or other subscribe to
   the substance of what I have asserted--that it is God who quickens the
   souls of those who believe--and that if men are saved all the glory
   must be unto God from first to last. And not an atom nor a particle can
   be attributed to the goodness, or the power, or the will of the
   creature. This is a doctrine which some people have not learned very
   fully yet, but they will have to learn it if they are God's people.

   Jonah, you know, had never learned it from the schools, but when the
   Lord got him in the whale's belly, at the bottom of the mountains, with
   the weeds wrapped about his head, then it was that he said, "Salvation
   is of the Lord." And often some sore trials and terrible afflictions
   are necessary schoolmasters to teach us this lesson--that salvation is
   of the Lord, alone.

   Now let me change the note and speak a few words respecting the some
   that believe not. They are of different characters. Some of you were
   brought up at a Sunday school. You have attended a place of worship
   nearly all your lives, and yet you have not believed in Christ. There
   are others who do not often go to the House of God--in fact they have
   got into the habit of spending their Sundays in dissipation or
   frivolity. These are among the some that believe not, and some of them
   try to quiet their conscience by pretending that they do not believe
   the Bible to be true.

   They set up for Atheists, or Deists, or Freethinkers, and when they can
   get some fools to applaud them, they vent out their spleen against the
   Saints, and their blasphemy against God--albeit they do not believe
   their own blasphemies. Their consciences are uneasy. Atheism affords no
   rest for the sole of man's foot. Let a man go to the utmost extent in
   abandoning moral restraints and disowning religious obligations, there
   is still an aching void within him which even Hell itself cannot fill.
   The man feels that he wants something, he knows not what, but it is the
   Cross of Christ and faith in a crucified Savior that alone can supply
   the cravings of man's inner nature.

   Some of these people that believe not are very moral. There is that
   young lady yonder, amiable and admirable in her degree, but she does
   not believe, therefore the crudeness of her tastes, the want of harmony
   in the colors that vary her disposition. There is that young man over
   there who is full of commercial integrity, his employer would trust him
   with a bag of untold gold. But he is among the some that believe not.
   And with strange inconsistency he relies on one virtue which procures
   him respect among men, to cover a thousand vices which proclaim his
   alienation from God.

   On the other hand, there are a great many of them who are debauched and
   who go very far astray. We must put you all down together. There are no
   third parties. You either believe or you do not. If you have believed
   in Jesus, bless and praise almighty God, but if you have not, listen a
   moment while I try to answer the question--Why do you not believe?
   There are some people who will be ready to say, "Just listen what
   contradictory doctrine is preached!" I cannot help it. The only reason
   why you do not believe in Christ is because you will not. The reason
   why you are an unbeliever at this hour is your own will, and nothing
   but your own will.

   It is not that you have not heard the Gospel. You have heard it! It is
   not because it is unworthy of your credence. It is the most reliable
   intelligence in all the world. It is not because it does not deserve
   your faith. It claims and demands it. It is not because you have never
   been aroused. You have had impressions without number. You know when
   you had that fever. You know there was a something striving with you
   that would have brought you to the Cross, but you would not come. The
   reason why you have not come to Jesus is contained in Christ's own
   words--"You will not come unto Me that you might have life."

   Give me not back an answer that would excuse yourself and charge God
   foolishly. It is not God's fault that you are not a Believer. It is
   your own fault and your own fault, alone. I know there are some very
   wicked persons, and some on the other hand, who claim to be very
   orthodox, who lay the damnation of men at God's door--but God forbid
   that your soul or mine should have any sympathy with such blasphemy as
   that! I will suppose a case. There is a woman who has stabbed her own
   child, reddened her hands with the blood of her own offspring. She is
   brought up to the court to be tried for murder, and she makes use of a
   singular defense.

   Her counsel bids her be silent. But she will speak. She says, "My Lord
   and gentlemen of the jury, I am not guilty. I did stab my child it is
   true, but I did it as the agent of God. I was decreed to do it. I could
   not help it. I was predestinated to do it, and the fault, therefore,
   lies not with me, but with God." Now the impression made in the court
   would be this--that a person whose moral sense was so depraved would be
   quite capable of murder or any other crime. A state of heart which
   would allow a person to give utterance to such a saying against God
   would allow murder to be thought of without any compunction whatever. I
   should not wonder at such a remark being made by the culprit.

   But suppose the lawyer, himself, the woman's counsel, should get up and
   claim the attention of the judge and the jury, and should say,
   "Gentlemen, really, this woman is not guilty when you come to think of
   it, for it was foreordained from before the foundation of the world
   that she should do this. She was predestinated to it, and therefore, my
   Lord, moral culpability does not rest with her." Can you think what the
   judge would say--such a man as the late good Lord Chancellor Campbell?
   Why, I think I see him rise from his seat and exclaim, "Hold your
   tongue, Sir, or else change your line of argument! For as long as I am
   one of the judges of this realm I will never sit in this court to hear
   God openly and publicly blasphemed. If you do not change your line of
   argument the usher shall put you out."

   And I am sure every Englishman in the court would applaud a judge for
   so saying. Verily you would hold your breath and feel your blood
   chilled in your veins at the very idea of murder being laid at the door
   of God. What then shall I say of those men, calling themselves
   ministers of Christ, but who become the devil's advocates, and preach
   that the ruin of men's souls is the result of Divine Sovereignty, that
   God's decree damns men, and not their own sins? O my Soul, come not
   into their secret--with their confederacy be not joined! This is sewing
   pillows to all armholes! This is, indeed, stuffing beds with down for
   sinners to sleep on, till at last they wake up in damnation!

   Sinner, you know it is a lie. It is a gross lie to say that God is
   responsible for your damnation. If your soul shall perish, it shall
   perish as a suicide. For you will have ruined yourself. "O Israel, you
   have destroyed yourself." If the damned in Hell could be made to
   believe that they did not deserve to be there, why Hell would be no
   Hell to them. But this is the sting of perdition--"I deserve this!" You
   will see written in lines of fire--"You knew your duty, but you did it
   not!" And when you cry for mercy, this shall be God's answer--"I called
   and you refused. I stretched out My hand and no man regarded it. I also
   will laugh at your calamity. I will mock when your fear comes."

   Do I hear someone say, "Why, that is Arminianism!" Precisely so. But
   some people say the truth lies between Calvinism and Arminianism. It
   does not. There is nothing between them but a barren wilderness. If you
   are asked why a man is saved, the only Scriptural answer is--"Sovereign
   Grace." Grace--unmoved by anything in the creature, flowing
   spontaneously from the mighty depths of the Divine heart. But if you
   are asked why are men damned? Answer this--"It is their own sin. Their
   own wicked, carnal, sensual, devilish nature--that they even dare to
   trample on the blood of Christ, to despise Jesus and to turn aside from
   Him that speaks from Heaven."

   Never be frightened because one man says it is too high, or because
   another says it is too low. Take the Truth of God as you find it. Take
   it as it is in the Bible. "Well but," I hear one say, "are the two
   things consistent? Can you reconcile them?" I do want to reconcile
   them. They never fell out. They are good friends. They are both true,
   and truths never quarrel. "Well," says one, "but I cannot see that they
   are quite straight." Have you ever been rowing in a boat on the water
   and remarked that your oars look bent? Are they bent? No. If you had an
   oar that was bent, and put it in a certain position it would look
   straight. But if it were a straight oar that you put in, and now that
   it should look bent is a mere optical illusion.

   Why is this? Well, we are told it is because the rays of light pass
   through two different mediums--through the air and through the waters.
   These mediums are of different density, and therefore the ray of light
   is refracted and the thing looks bent, though it really is not. Now
   part of the truth is Divine--that part which has to do with Divine
   Sovereignty. And part of the truth is human--that which has to do with
   human responsibility. A great truth in passing through two such
   different media must look bent, and if it did not look bent, it would
   be strange, indeed. You may look at two lines. They are almost
   parallel, but not quite, and they do not meet anywhere that you and I
   can see, but they do meet somewhere that God can see.

   When we get to Heaven we shall see where these two lines meet and we
   shall find, perhaps, that where we thought they were the farthest
   apart, was just the place where they touched each other. Of this,
   however, I am absolutely sure, man's conscience bears witness--it is
   one of the instinctive apprehensions of every enlightened man's
   mind--that if he is saved, it is of God's mercy. And that if he is
   lost, it is his own fault. I only want the witness of your own
   conscience to this point. In vain you drug conscience with nauseous
   doctrines. You may go and listen to something that is not pure Gospel,
   but a spurious compound. You never can stifle the deep conviction, that
   if you rebel against God you perish as the result of your own act and
   deed. The worm that never dies would cease to gnaw at your vitals if
   you could lay your ruin at God's door. And the fire that never can be
   quenched would have no meet fuel in your body and soul, if your own
   sins were not the cause of your own destruction.

   And what does all this lead to? Why, it comes to this, dear Friends,
   that I must close by dividing this house. Sometimes, in the House of
   Commons, you know, when a person has been speaking and has been very
   prosy, and another man gets up to speak whom they do not want to hear,
   they will cry out, "Divide, divide." Then the House divides and the
   "Ayes" go out on one side and the "nays" on another. Well--I have not a
   convenient place here for some of you to go on one side of the house
   and some another--I do not suppose we could carry it out. But suppose
   this aisle now to represent the great division, and that the some that
   believe had to stand on this side, and the some that do not believe on
   that side.

   There would soon be a change of seats, I expect. But do you know, I am
   afraid there would be a great number of you that would say, "Well, I
   cannot go on this side. I dare not say I do believe in Christ. And yet
   I cannot go to the other side. I dare not go there, it is such an awful
   thing to go with those that do not believe. Let me stand here in the
   aisle." No, no. There are only two places--Heaven and Hell--and there
   are only two sorts of people, the righteous and the wicked. The priests
   of Christian idolatry have been preaching about purgatory for hundreds
   of years, but we do not believe in that doctrine, except as a means of
   filling their coffers while they make merchandize of souls.

   We know that all the people that have died have either gone to Hell
   because they did not believe, or have gone to Heaven because they did.
   And we know that there has never been a cross between a Believer and an
   unbeliever. A man must be either dead or alive. There is no neutral
   ground. You must either be on one side with those who are alive, or on
   the other side with those who are dead and need to be quickened. Think
   not to halt between two opinions. For the most part those who are said
   to be halting between two opinions are really of one opinion--they do
   not intend to serve the Lord. They say in their hearts, "Who is the
   Lord that I should serve Him?"

   Now will you do me this favor? I asked it once and it was blessed to
   the conversion of several. Will you take a little time alone, perhaps
   this evening. Take a paper and pencil, and after you have honestly and
   fairly thought on your own state and weighed your own condition before
   the Lord, will you write down one of two words--if you feel that you
   are not a Believer write down this word--"Condemned." But if you are a
   Believer in Jesus and put your trust in Him, alone, write down the
   word, "Forgiven." Do it, even though you have to write down the word,
   "condemned." We lately received into Church fellowship a young man, who
   said--"Sir, I wrote down the word, "condemned," and I looked at it.
   There it was. I had written it myself--"Condemned."

   As he looked, the tears began to flow, and the heart began to break.
   And before long he fled to Christ, put the paper in the fire and wrote
   down, "Forgiven." This young man was about the sixth who had been
   brought to the Lord in the same way. So I pray you try it, and God may
   bless it to you. Remember you are either one or the other--you are
   either condemned or forgiven. Do not stand between the two. Let it be
   decided, and remember, if you are condemned today, you are not yet in
   Hell. There is hope still! Blessed be God, still is Christ lifted up
   and whoever believes on Him shall not perish but have everlasting life.

   The gate of Heaven is not closed. The proclamation of mercy is not
   hushed. The Spirit of God still goes forth to open blind eyes and to
   unstop deaf ears. It is still preached to you, to every creature under
   Heaven--"Whosoever believes on the Son of God has everlasting life. He
   that believes and is baptized shall be saved. He that be believes not
   shall be damned." Believe! God help you to believe. Trust Jesus! Trust
   Him now. And may the Lord grant that your name may be written among the
   some that believe, and not among the some that believe not.

                                  The Rainbow

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JUNE 28, 1863, BY THE REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And the bow shall be in the cloud and I will look upon it, that I may
   remember the Everlasting Covenant between God and every living creature
   of all flesh that is upon the earth."

   Genesis 9:16.

   THE story of Noah's preservation in the ark is a suggestive
   representation of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ. It is, we think,
   especially intended to depict that part of our salvation which lies in
   the washing of regeneration. In the same way as Baptism is the outward
   symbol of regeneration, so also is the ark, "wherein few, that is,
   eight souls were saved by water." The ark was immersed in those
   dreadful rains and awful waterfalls which deluged the earth, and Noah's
   family were buried in that ark to all the world.

   But by this burial they were floated out of the old condemned world
   into the new world of life and Divine Grace. Death to the world and
   burial in the ark were the means of their safety. "The like figure
   whereunto," says the Apostle Peter (1 Peter 3:21), "even Baptism does
   also now save us, (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but
   the answer of a good conscience toward God), by the resurrection of
   Jesus Christ." Baptism is a most significant picture of regeneration,
   but it is in no sense the cause of the new birth. And the blunder of
   the Puseyites lies in considering the outward manifestation of an
   accomplished fact, as though it were the means of creating that fact.

   Baptism saves no one, except, as Peter says, in figure. But as a
   figure, it is eminently full of Divine teaching, for it sets forth the
   great Truth of God that the Believer, standing today in the old world,
   is buried to that world, "buried with Jesus Christ by Baptism into
   death." And his rising from the liquid tomb is the figure of his
   resurrection in Christ, into a new world, as a new man, "that like as
   Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so
   we also should walk in newness of life" (Rom. 6:4). Would to God that
   we thought more of being dead with Christ, buried with Him and risen
   with Him. Brethren, let Noah in his ark preach the work of
   righteousness within the heart to all of us this morning.

   Do you not think, dear Friends, that the history of Noah, when he left
   the ark, in all its items, may be viewed as typical and instructive?
   Noah came out of the ark no longer cooped up and penned within its
   narrow limits. He walked abroad and the whole world was before him
   where to choose. Was not that a picture of the freedom of the Believer
   who has been "buried with Christ," and enjoys the possession of God's
   free Spirit? For him there is no spirit of bondage, he is free as a
   child in his father's house. All things are his, by gift of God, to use
   and to enjoy. He has learned the liberty wherewith Christ makes men
   free, and if the Son make us free, we are free, indeed.

   When Noah slew the bullock and the other clean beasts and offered them
   upon the altar, did he not show forth the Believer's employment? We
   also offer acceptable sacrifices of prayer and praise unto God, and we,
   ourselves, are living sacrifices unto God. Did he not as much say to
   all generations of saints, "You being thus delivered from a death which
   you deserve, are to spend your lives as priests unto your God"? When
   the Lord was pleased on that day to bless Noah and his family, bidding
   them be fruitful, did He not therein set forth the fruitfulness which
   belongs unto Believers, so that, abiding in Christ, they "bring forth
   much fruit"? May not that benediction teach us how earnestly we should
   seek to be spiritually the parents of immortal souls, travailing in
   birth till Christ is formed in them?

   When the Divine Father gave them dominion over the fowl of the air, and
   the fish of the sea, and over all cattle, did not this portray the
   power which Believers have over lust, and sin, and evil? And did it not
   prophesy the subjugation of all things by the power of their faith, so
   that they who become "priests," in sacrifice, become also "kings," by
   virtue of the charter of dominion which the heavenly Father bestows
   upon them? What do you think, Brothers and Sisters? When He enlarged
   the grant of food, and permitted them to eat flesh, did He not set
   forth that food on which true Believers feed, who now eat His flesh and
   drink His blood who has become the spiritual Food of our souls?

   Is it straining the allegory, is it carrying it too far, if I close
   this spiritualizing by observing that the very same security which God
   then gave to Noah and his descendants is that security under which we
   stand? He gave them a Covenant--a Covenant embellished with a Divine
   symbol and ratified with His own signature written out in all the
   colors of beauty. We, too, stand under a Covenant which has its own
   faithful witness in Heaven, more transcendently illustrious and
   beautiful than the rainbow--the Person of Christ Jesus our Lord.

   Leaving, however, all those points, which I have only started to excite
   thought among you, we come to this: we have Scriptural reason for
   asserting that this venerable Covenant--that the world shall no more be
   destroyed by a flood--is typical of a yet more ancient compact which
   God made with Christ. That being that He would be unto His people a
   God, and they should be His chosen ones, world without end. In the
   fifty-fourth chapter of Isaiah, (vv. 8-10), we find such language as
   this--"In a little wrath I hid My face from you for a moment. But with
   everlasting kindness will I have mercy on you, says the Lord your
   Redeemer. For this is as the waters of Noah unto Me: for as I have
   sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have
   I sworn that I would not be wroth with you, nor rebuke you.

   "For the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed. But My
   kindness shall not depart from you; neither shall the Covenant of My
   peace be removed, says the Lord that has mercy on you." The covenant of
   Noah, then, is typical of the great Everlasting Covenant made with
   Christ on behalf of His people. And the rainbow, as the symbol of the
   Covenant with Noah, is typical of our Lord Jesus, who is the Lord's
   witness to the people. You read in the fourth chapter of the book of
   Revelation, in the third verse, "there was a rainbow round about the
   Throne," showing that the bow is not a temporary symbol for earth only,
   but is a symbol of everlasting and heavenly things.

   And in the tenth chapter of the book of Revelation, if I mistake not,
   in the first verse, you will find that the mighty angel with a little
   book in his right hand, who shall put one foot upon the sea and another
   upon the land, is described as having his head crowned with a rainbow.
   In this place, our Lord Jesus Christ, in His mediatorial capacity,
   wears the symbol of the Covenant about His brow. And in the other
   passage our Lord, as King, is represented as sitting upon the Throne,
   surrounded with the insignia of the Covenant of Grace which encompasses
   the Throne, so that there are no goings forth of His majesty and His
   power and His Grace, except in a covenant way and after a covenant
   sort, since the rainbow must be passed before the bright rays of His
   power and love can reach the sons of men.

   This brings us now into the center of our discourse. We have to talk of
   two things--first, the tenor of the Covenant and secondly, the token of
   it--running a parallel all the way through between the two Covenants.
   The tenor of Noah's Covenant is the tenor of the Covenant of Grace
   (Everlasting Covenant)--just as the rainbow represents, and in some
   sense is, the token of the Covenant of Grace, also.

   I. First, then, the Covenant itself--WHAT IS ITS TENOR? We reply, that
   it is a Covenant ofpure Grace. There was nothing in Noah why God should
   make a covenant with him. He was a sinner--and proved himself to be so
   in a most shocking manner within a few days. He needed a sacrifice, for
   he afterwards became drunk. He was one of the best of men. But the best
   of men are but men at the best, and can have no claim upon the favor of
   God. He was saved by faith as the rest of us must be--and faith, we all
   know, is inconsistent with any claim of merit. At least one of his sons
   we must set down as being an open and abandoned sinner, and in him
   there could have been no ground why God should make a covenant with
   him.

   We have no reason to imagine that Noah ever sought this Covenant. He
   did offer a sacrifice. But we do not know that he ventured to indulge
   the idea that God would enter into bonds with him not to destroy the
   earth. We imagine that the very first cloud which swept across the sky
   would excite the Patriarch's alarm. The first drop which fell would
   dampen his comfort. As a preacher of righteousness he understood well
   enough that on grounds of justice he had no claim upon the Most Holy
   God, and he would not venture to plead any merit of his own. But out of
   pure favor--just as out of the mountain's side the sparkling fountain
   gushes freely without the labor of man, so this Covenant of sparing
   mercy sprang spontaneously from the overflowing, ever bounteous, and
   loving heart of God.

   Certainly it is so with that greater Covenant, whereof we strive to
   speak. For this was made with Christ, "or ever the earth was." And as
   there were no men to supplicate, it could not have been possible that
   it was due to their intercession. As there were no men to merit
   anything, it could not be bought by their worthiness. Divine
   foreknowledge well knew that man would be evil--"only evil and that
   continually from his youth up," so no foresight of human goodness could
   have suggested it. And yet, because He, "will have mercy on whom He
   will have mercy, and will have compassion on whom He will have
   compassion," He, our gracious God, whose heart was swelling like the
   deep sea with floodtides of loving kindness, was pleased to strike
   hands with Christ, our Covenant and Federal Head. And from Grace, and
   Grace, alone, He entered into engagements with Christ on our account.

   The Everlasting Covenant, we note, in the next place, was all of
   promise. You will be struck, if you read these verses, how it runs over
   and over again, "I establish." "It shall come to pass." "I will." "It
   shall." "I will." He who knows the difference between, "you shall," and
   "/ will," is a good theologian. The old Covenant of Works is, "you
   shall." "You shall not commit adultery. You shall not kill. You shall
   not steal." Death always comes to us by that Covenant of Command. But
   the new Covenant is, "/ will," and life comes to us by its promises.
   The Covenant of Grace runs on this wise-- "/ will sprinkle clean water
   upon you, and you shall be clean. From all your iniquities will /save
   you." If there is a, "you shall," it is not by way of command, but by
   way ofpromise.

   "/ will," and "you shall"! O dear Friends, one's heart rejoices to
   think of those potent shalls and wills--those immoveable pillars which
   death and Hell cannot shake--the shalls and wills of a God who, "speaks
   and it is done." God who, "commands and it stands fast." I do not see
   an if, nor a but, nor the shadow of a perhaps in it. It is all, "/
   will, / will, / will," from beginning to end. And so when God
   covenanted with Christ, it was not, "/ will save My people if they do
   this," but, "/ will," and, "they shall," from first to last--

   "It is like a living spring of waters, sweet and clear. There's not an
   if to foul the stream nor a perhaps here. Grace is its fountainhead,
   the source from where it came-- In wills and shalls of Gospel Grace,
   eternally the same." The Apostle Paul is very clear upon this. In that
   most blessed Epistle to the Galatians he calls this, "the Covenant of
   Promise," and marks the difference between Ishmael, "the son of the
   bondwoman," according to nature and according to works, and Isaac, "who
   is the child of the promise and the gift of God, above nature: not
   according to the efficacy and energy of the creature, but according to
   the will and power and truthfulness of the Most High." You and I do not
   stand today under a Covenant which demands anything of us.
   Unconditional favors, unlimited mercies made sure to all the seed by
   the oath and promise--the shall and will of God!

   Further, I would have you observe that this Covenant has up to now been
   faithfully kept. It cheered my heart, when thinking this matter over,
   to remember that although / depend upon covenant faithfulness, I am not
   alone in that dependence. Every living thing upon the face of the earth
   lives by virtue of the Everlasting Covenant of God. Covenant
   engagements preserve the world from flood--were it not for that
   Covenant, the tops of the mountains might be covered tomorrow. A
   covenant tenure is a very sure one, seeing that these thousands of
   years the world has never been destroyed by a flood. Go back to ancient
   histories and see whether the deluge God has ever again swept away the
   race of man with water, and you shall not even dare to hint that such a
   thing has been.

   No, the earth standing in the water and out of the water, since the
   fathers fell asleep, according to the testimony of scoffers themselves,
   abides still the same. And so does the Covenant of Grace. It has never
   been removed or altered, nor have its promises been broken. O Saint,
   you dwell in tabernacles which shall never be taken down! God has never
   failed His people, nor cast away His chosen. Not one promise has lost
   its fulfillment, nor one word its faithfulness--

   "This Covenant of Grace all blessings secures. Believer, rejoice, for
   all things are yours, And God from His purpose shall never remove, But
   love you and bless you and rest in His love." Beloved, there is this
   about Noah's Covenant and about the Covenant of Grace--they do not
   depend in any degree at all upon man. For, if you will notice, the bow
   is put in the cloud, but it does not say, "And when you shall look upon
   the bow, and you shall remember My Covenant, then I will not destroy
   the earth." No, it is gloriously put, not upon our memory, which is
   fickle and frail, but upon God's memory, which is infinite and
   immutable! "The bow shall be in the cloud. And / will look upon it,
   that /may remember the Everlasting Covenant." Oh, it is not my
   remembering God--it is God's remembering me! It is not my laying hold
   of His Covenant, but His Covenant laying hold on me! Glory be to God,
   the whole of the bulwarks are secured, and even the minor towers which
   we may fancy might have been left to man, are guarded by Divine
   strength!

   Even the remembrance of the Covenant is not left to our memories, for
   we might forget--but our Lord cannot, will not forget the Saints--whom
   He has inscribed on the palms of His hands. It is with us today as it
   was with Israel in Egypt. The blood was upon the lintel and upon the
   two side posts. But God did not say, "When you see the blood I will
   pass over you." No, no, "When / see the blood I will pass over you." My
   looking to Jesus brings me joy and peace, but it is God's looking to
   Jesus which secures my salvation, and that of all His elect.

   It is impossible for our God to look at Christ, our bleeding Surety,
   and then to be angry with us for sins already punished in Him. No, dear
   Friends, it is not left with us even to be saved by remembering the
   Covenant. There's no linsey-woolsey here--not a single thread of the
   creature mars the fabric. Here we have the pure gold, and not an atom
   of alloy. It is not of man, neither by man, but of the Lord alone. We
   should remember the Covenant and we shall do it, through Divine Grace.
   But the hinge of the matter does not lie there. It is God's remembering
   us, not our remembering Him.

   And therefore, for all these reasons it is an Everlasting Covenant. We
   know that as long as there is day and night, and summer and winter, and
   these shall be so long as the earth stands, the proud waves can never
   cover the earth. Forever has God established this Covenant in Heaven.
   Even so, the Everlasting Covenant is not intended to be fleeting and
   temporary. "Forever, O Lord, Your Word is settled in Heaven." "He has
   made with us an Everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure."
   "He will ever be mindful of His Covenant." If it concerns you today, it
   is, "the same yesterday, today, and forever." If the Covenant blesses
   you at this hour, it shall bless you in old age, in the time of death,
   at resurrection and throughout eternity.

   No time can change one of its stipulations. You may walk the centuries
   and fly adown the ages far into eternity, but you can never discover
   such a thing as the change or failure of one single article of the
   Covenant of Grace. Its jots and tittles are sure to all the seed--

   "He loved the world of His elect, With love surpassing thought. Nor
   will His mercy ever neglect The souls His Son has bought. The warm
   affections of His breast Towards His chosen burn, And in this love
   He'll ever rest Nor from His oath return. Still to confirm His oath of
   old, See in the heavens His bow, No fierce rebukes, but love untold,
   Awaits His children now."

   Would to God you and I studied more the doctrine of this Everlasting
   Covenant. Our old Puritan forefathers were accustomed to preach much
   about it. Those Scotch Theologians, who were a second band of Puritans,
   Erskine and the men of his day, were always dwelling upon the
   Covenants. Good Witsius has left us a marvelously learned and potent
   treatise on the same, and Fisher's Marrow of Theology is a valuable
   exposition of the matter. He who studies the doctrines of the Covenants
   is not very likely to make a mingle-mangle of his ministry, or to
   preach a yes and no Gospel.

   My dear Friends, when you think of the Covenant of Law and the Covenant
   of Grace, and remember that they are contrary the one to the other, and
   can never mingle, can never be united--so that the one can dilute the
   other--it must come out forcibly before you that we may address the
   Gospel to the sinner as a sinner, without a fitness on his part. We may
   still believe in God's love to the Saint, even though he has sinned and
   that notwithstanding all the misbehavior of any of the chosen people.
   Since they are under the Covenant of Grace and not of works, their
   salvation is never in jeopardy, never at hazard, so far as God's will
   and God's power are concerned.

   He that vowed to save them, and loved them in Christ, and has given
   them faith, which is the token of His Grace, will most assuredly save
   them and bring them to glory. The earth shall be destroyed, with water,
   long before one of God's elect shall be damned. It shall be destroyed
   with fire, we know, but when, "the mountains depart," and, "the hills
   are removed," the Covenant of His Grace shall still stand. And He will
   be mindful of all who have an interest in it.

   So much, then, concerning the tenor of the Everlasting Covenant itself.
   My Soul, search, and look, and see whether you have an interest in that
   Covenant. Can you say from your heart--

   "My hope is fixed on nothing less Than Jesus' blood and righteousness"?
   Then, my Soul, that Everlasting Covenant is yours and you are safe
   beyond risk of harm!

   II. Secondly, THE TOKEN OF THE COVENANT. The Covenant needs no token,
   as far as God is concerned. Tokens are given for us, because of our
   littleness of heart, our unbelief, our constant forgetfulness of God's
   promises. The rainbow is the symbol of Noah's Covenant. And Jesus
   Christ, who is the Covenant, is also the symbol of that Covenant to us.
   He is the Faithful Witness in Heaven.

   1. Briefly upon this part of the subject let us notice when we may
   expect to see the token of the Everlasting Covenant. The rainbow is
   only to be seen painted upon a cloud. Expect no tokens, except when you
   need them. The Lord Jesus, when He can, will trust us to our faith. For
   it is, on the whole, more healthy, more strengthening to us, to, "walk
   by faith and not by sight." Tokens are helps for our childhood--they
   would be unnecessary to us were we men. Tokens, to men whose faith is
   in vigorous order, would be as crutches to a man who is not lame, or as
   glasses to those whose eyes are perfect. The Lord is pleased to give
   tokens when tokens are wanted, I say.

   And therefore He gives them, as He gives rainbows, when there is a
   cloud. When the greatest cloud which ever gathered upon earth had
   covered Calvary with blackness. When the sun himself had suffered
   eclipse. When human sin and Divine wrath had made a tempest so black
   and terrible that all the earth was in affright--then on that black
   cloud was painted the rainbow--for Jesus was lifted up and amidst that
   thick darkness. He, the Expiation and the Atonement, offered up
   Himself, and poured forth His blood.

   When the sinner's conscience is dark with clouds. When he remembers his
   past sins. When he mourns and laments before God, Jesus Christ is
   revealed to him as the Covenant Rainbow, speaking peace. And to the
   Believer, when his trials surround him. When temptations beset him.
   When he suffers depression of spirits--then how sweet it is to behold
   the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ! To see Him bleeding for us,
   offered up for guilty men--God's Rainbow, hung over the cloud of all
   our sins, our sorrows and our woes. Look, Believer, when you have a
   cloud--look for a Token, and be not satisfied without it. The ancient
   Church said upon one occasion, "We see not our signs." And you and I
   have sometimes to say the same. But let us hasten to the Rock of our
   salvation and beseech Him to bestow upon us a comfortable sight of
   Jesus, who shall will the Covenant to our souls again.

   Nor does a cloud alone give a rainbow. There must be rain. There can be
   no rainbows, unless there are the crystal drops to reflect the light of
   the sun. So, Beloved, our sorrows must not only threaten, but they must
   really fall upon us. There had been no Christ for us if the vengeance
   of God had been merely a threat. It must fall in terrible drops upon
   Him. Christ, who sets forth to us the vengeance and the love of God at
   the same time, had not come to us unless there had been a real
   vengeance and a real punishment of sin--until there is a real anguish
   in the sinner's conscience, there is no Christ for him. And until the
   chastisement which you feel becomes grievous to you--till the big drops
   bespatter you, and you feel it is not a threat, but a real infliction
   of sorrow upon you, you cannot expect to see Jesus Christ.

   Perhaps, dear Brothers and Sisters, some of us have but slight views of
   Christ, and few have visits from Him because we have so few troubles.
   And the reason why most Saints in these days do not live so near to
   Jesus as they were custom to do in the centuries gone by may be because
   we have not so many of those showers of persecution which fell at that
   season. Why, when, in the reign of Dioclesius and in the preceding
   centuries, Believers were stoned and dragged into the amphitheatre, or
   hacked to death with knives! They saw the glory of Jesus as the rainbow
   painted on the black cloud of persecution, while the raindrops fell
   upon them. It makes us even long to suffer as they suffered, that we
   may behold Jesus as they beheld Him.

   But the day is coming when the world shall, "hear of wars and rumors of
   wars." The earth shall rock and reel and the pillars of Heaven shall be
   shaken. The stars shall fall, the moon shall be turned into a clot of
   blood, and the sun shall be black as sackcloth of hair. Ah, then how
   glorious will that Rainbow shine to all the people of God, when over
   the conflagrations of earth, and the destruction of men, and the
   melting of empires, and the blazing of earth, there shall be seen
   Christ the Mediator, securing all His people and ratifying, still, the
   Everlasting Covenant! There must be drops of rain, or else no rainbow.
   Some failings of vengeance, or else no sight of Christ.

   But then, there must be a sun. For clouds and drops of rain make not
   rainbows, unless the sun shines. Beloved, our God, who is as the Sun to
   us, always shines. But we do not always see Him. Clouds hide His face.
   But no matter what drops may be falling, or what clouds may be present,
   if He does but shine, there will be a Rainbow at once. When the blessed
   Spirit, "sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts"--when we can say,
   "Abba, Father," and a Father's love and a Father's peace are breathed
   upon us--then we see Jesus Christ, beholding the Father in the Person
   of His Son.

   It is said that when we see the rainbow, that particular shower is
   over. So good Bishop Hall tells us in his, "Contemplations." Certain it
   is, that when Christ comes, our troubles are over. When we behold
   Jesus, our sins are gone--our doubts and fears subside at His command.
   When He walks the waters of the sea, there will be a calm. But others
   say that the rainbow is the showery arch and heralds bad weather. And
   probably this is quite as true. Certainly, whenever you get a love
   token from Christ, you may expect some trouble. For He brings His
   people into the banqueting house either before a battle, or after it.
   Melchisedek came to meet Abraham when the kings had all been
   slaughtered. But sometimes our Melchisedek brings the bread and wine
   just before the battle is to commence.

   We are not always to be living upon love-tokens. Our beloved Jesus
   would rather make us live by simple faith, and therefore we, "walk in
   darkness and see no light." Still, rainbows are delightful sights, and
   a vision of Jesus is rapturous and transporting. But we cannot expect
   to see Him, I say, unless it is when the storm is over or when another
   storm is coming on, or when the cloud is there, or the drops are
   falling, or the light of God's countenance is especially shining upon
   you. We will say no more about when this token is seen, but we will now
   notice briefly, what this token is.

   2. What do we see in our Covenant Witness in Heaven? We see in Him what
   we see in the rainbow. In the rainbow we see supreme Glory and beauty.
   As one of the works of God, it is worthy to be sought out by them that
   have pleasure in them. One might stand and gaze on the rainbow with
   wonder and admiration and never be weary. I do not know whether you
   have noticed paintings of rainbows--did you ever see a good one? Will
   you ever see a good one? There are one or two in the Royal Academy this
   year--I am no judge of paintings, but I can judge that they are as much
   unlike rainbows as they well could be.

   Rainbows cannot be painted. The thing is impossible. There is such a
   melting and blending of colors, that human art shall never be able to
   rival the art of God. The Master Painter, with the black cloud for His
   palette, and the sun's rays for His brush, paints so that no artist
   shall rival Him. If you could gather together a heap of all the
   glittering gems and jewels which adorn an Oriental prince, and build a
   glorious arch--you could not make such glitter and brightness of glory
   as in the rainbow--which is the simple work of a drop of rain and a ray
   of light. But shall I compare my Lord Jesus to the rainbow? I do Him an
   injustice--

   "All human beauties, all Divine, in my Beloved meet and shine."

   You never saw a picture of His face which satisfied you, and you never
   will. You shall go all over the Continent and see some of the marvelous
   productions of the masters put up as altar pieces. And you will say
   when you see them, "That is not like Jesus Christ." They can paint
   Judas. There are some fine heads of Peter--sweet guesses at John--John
   the Baptist to life--all but that little bit of a cockleshell in his
   hand. They can paint Mary Magdalene if you will, but never Jesus
   Christ. They can never paint Him. No artist that ever lived can catch
   His expression or countenance, much less put it on canvas. And as to
   the beauty of His Character, must we not burst out with the spouse in
   the Canticles, "He is altogether lovely"?--

   "The spacious earth, the swelling flood,
   Proclaim the wise and powerful God.
   And Your rich glories from afar,
   Sparkle in every rolling star,
   But in His looks a glory stands,
   The noble labor of Your hands--
   God, in the Person of His Son,
   Has all His mightiest works outdone."

   The rainbow has been recognized by ancient poets and bards as an
   appointed messenger of God. Homer calls it the messenger of the gods,
   and the old mythologies speak of it as the Iris, the messenger of Juno.
   They knew not who had sent it, nor what was the errand on which it
   came. Still they recognized it as a Divine ambassador. And surely such
   is Christ, the Messenger of the Covenant whom we delight in. God's
   great Ambassador, who is, "our peace," "the desire of all nations," who
   shall yet come and shall be hailed as, "King of kings and Lord of
   lords." O blessed Rainbow, Jesus! When shall Your beauties be beheld by
   mortal eyes? When shall all kings fall down before You and yield their
   scepters and their crowns to You?

   Again--in the rainbow and in Christ, I see vengeance satisfied. Is not
   the bow the symbol of the warrior's power? With far-reaching arrows he
   draws the string, and woe unto his enemies. But when a hero hangs up
   his bow upon the wall, what means he but that warfare is over and peace
   is proclaimed? When he loosens the bow and leaves it without the string
   and without an arrow, it means that he will no more go out to hunt his
   adversaries. His arrows shall be no more, "drunk with the blood of the
   slain." He lays the bow aside, hangs it up on high, and leaves it
   unstrung, without an arrow. Such is the rainbow. A bow, it is true, but
   a bow hung up--a bow without string or arrow.

   And such is Christ, God's Bow. "Your arrows are sharp in the heart of
   the king's enemies, whereby the people fall under You." When He takes
   the "rod of iron," He breaks His enemies in pieces, "like a potter's
   vessel." "Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from
   Bozrah, traveling in the greatness of His strength?" Jesus, the Arrow
   of God, the polished shaft in the quiver of the Most High. But there I
   see Him--a bow still--still mighty to destroy--but yet a bow without a
   string. He threw that away, when He came from Heaven to earth, and lay
   slumbering in the manger. A bow without an arrow!--

   "No thunder clothes His brow, No bolts to drive our guilty souls To
   fiercer flames below."

   Beloved, Christ is vengeance satisfied. Those wounds, those bright and
   burnished jewels of His hands, betoken that God demands no more of man.
   The rainbow, yet again, is a token that vengeance itself has become on
   our side. You see, it is an unbroken "bow." He did not snap it across
   His knee. It is a bow still. Vengeance is there, justice is there. But
   which way is it pointed? It is turned upward. Not to shoot arrows down
   on us, but for us, if we have faith enough to string it, and to make it
   our glorious bow--to draw it with all our might, to send our prayers,
   our praises, our desires, up to the bright Throne of God. Mighty is
   that man, omnipotent is his faith, who has power to bend that bow and
   draw it and shoot his prayers to Heaven.

   No, more. Inasmuch as it is a bow not black, nor blood-red, but a bow
   painted with the colors of holiday and delight, it seems to me as if
   Heaven hangs out its streamers of joy, while angels sing, "Glory to God
   in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill towards men." They pull
   the banners from the standards of glory, and they hang them out across
   the sky, as we do on our ships upon marriage days. Heaven hangs out its
   glorious banners to show that God is so completely satisfied with
   Christ and so at peace with man, that He joys in man's joy, and
   rejoices in man's rejoicing--"rests in His love and rejoices in us with
   singing,"

   Look up, Believer, to the Person of Christ. Behold the joy of God, "the
   pleasure of the Lord," prospering, "in His hands," and your soul will
   be full of ecstasy and delight. Once again, in the rainbow we see the
   one color of light, which appears to us to be but white, broken up,
   refracted, distributed, blended, harmonized, brought out in all its
   distinct elements. There is no doubt that there are more colors in
   light than our eyes have ever seen. The spectrum of eye can only
   compass a certain quantity of the colors. But beneath the lowest, and
   above the highest, there are others. There is infinitely more in God
   than you and I will ever be able to see.

   One of the best sights of light, as dissolved and analyzed, is to be
   had in the rainbow. There you see the colors arranged in their proper
   order, and you are able to mark the red melting into the orange, and
   the orange into the yellow, and the yellow yet again into the green,
   and the green into the blue, and the blue into the indigo and violet.
   They are all there--not one put out of place, not one left out. The
   Character of God is one, like His Essence. Yet to us, that we may read
   it, it must be, as it were, broken up, but not thrown out of harmony.
   He that has seen Christ, "has seen the Father." He that sees the
   rainbow sees "Light." He that sees Christ, sees the Father--God's
   justice meeting and blending into His Truth. God's Truth melting into
   His mercy. That mercy melting into His love, that love in contact with
   His faithfulness.

   And so every attribute standing side by side with its next of kin. The
   whole of them absolutely necessary to complete the glory of that arch,
   and every one of them necessarily to be put in its proper place also,
   to make the arch a harmony and a very music of colors. Beloved, such is
   Jesus Christ. If we could but understand Jesus Christ, we could not
   make mistakes about God. In Jesus I see blood-red justice, justice as
   fierce as if there were no mercy. But what love I see also! What
   boundless love! As Watts puts it, we cannot tell--

   "Which of the letters best is writ,
   The power, the wisdom, or the Grace."

   They are all so clearly there. The whole of God written out in Christ!
   And yet, I warn you, we can never see the whole of God--in this life,
   never. I do not know whether it is quite correct, but two or three of
   the older commentators, in glossing upon that passage, "there was a
   rainbow round about the Throne," say that it means entirely round it,
   and therefore there is a complete circle--that we only see one half of
   it, but that, in fact the Covenant rainbow is a circle.

   Now, whatever you may think of that gloss, there certainly is one
   circular rainbow in the Bible, for that angel, in the tenth of
   Revelation, had "a rainbow round his head." He wore it as a crown round
   his head. We may, without straining a point, say the most we can ever
   see, even in Christ, as revealed to us, while we are here, is just a
   glorious semi-circle of Truth--an arch, like a Divine ladder, by which
   we may mount to the very loftiness of God Himself. But there is another
   half which you and I have not seen, and we shall not see it till we get
   to the Throne of God. Moreover, that rainbow that is in Heaven differs
   from ours, for there it is, "like unto an emerald." The green
   preponderates. The mild luster of the mercy of God and His love will
   seem to triumph over the fiery sardius and jacinth of His justice.

   3. How ought we to act, dear Friends, with regard to this rainbow and
   Jesus Christ as the symbol of the covenant? First, let us act like
   little children. Little children run in clapping their hands with glee,
   "Father, there's a rainbow!" Out they run to look at it, and they
   wonder whether they could find the end of it. They wish you would let
   them run till they could catch it. They look, and look, and look, and
   look, and when the shower begins to abate and it dies out, they are so
   sorrowful because they have lost the splendid vision. Beloved, let us
   be children. Whenever we think of Christ, let us be little children and
   look, and look, and look again. And let us long to get at Him, for,
   unlike the rainbow, we can get at Him.

   Pliny, who, by the way, talks a deal of nonsense, declares that
   wherever the rainbow's foot rests, the flowers are made much sweeter.
   And Aristotle says the rainbow is a great breeder of honeydew. I do not
   know how that is, but I know that wherever Jesus Christ is He makes the
   perfume of His people very sweet. "His name is as ointment poured
   forth," and I know He is, "a great breeder of honeydew." There is sure
   to be much more loving kindness in that man's heart who has seen much
   of Jesus. I recommend you to follow that Divine Rainbow till you reach
   the foot of it, and till you embrace it and say with Simeon, "Now let
   Your servant depart in peace, for my eyes have seen Your salvation."
   Play the child then.

   While we gaze, ought we not praise and admire? One or two of the
   nations of antiquity had it as a part of their religion always to sing
   hymns when they saw the rainbow. Should not we, whenever we see Christ?
   Should it not be a red-letter day marked in our diary? "This day let us
   praise His name." And as we ought always to see Him, I may improve upon
   this and bid you say--

   "I willpraise You every day. Now Your anger's passed away, Comfortable
   thoughts arise from the bleeding sacrifice."

   And again, when we see Christ, we ought to confess our sins with
   humiliation. An old writer says that the Jews confess their sins when
   they see the rainbow. I am sure, whenever we see Christ, we ought to
   remember the deluge of wrath from which He has delivered us, the flames
   of Hell from which He has saved us. And so, humbly bowing ourselves in
   the dust, let us love and praise and bless His name.

   To some of you there is nothing in this sermon, because you have never
   laid hold on the Covenant. You have never believed in Jesus. Remember,
   that a simple faith in Christ is the evidence of your being in the
   Covenant. If you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ with all your heart,
   then your name is written in the roll of the blessed. But if you will
   not believe in Him, however excellent your character, however goodly
   your works, you shall perish in your sins.

   For, "he that believes and is baptized shall be saved. He that believes
   not," be he who he may or what he may, "shall be damned." Believe, and
   believing you put yourself under the Divine arch of the blessed
   Covenant. You shall see its glorious colors with exultation and
   delight, and you shall be secure, whatever catastrophes shall shake the
   earth, whatever calamities shall trouble the race of man.

                              The Bridgeless Gulf

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JULY 5, 1863, BY THE REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so
   that they which would pass from here to you cannot; neither can they
   pass to us, that would come from there."

   Luke 16:26.

   FOR the last few months I have been led to blow the silver trumpet,
   sounding forth the love and mercy of our God in Christ. Many times in
   your hearing I have preached a full Christ for empty sinners, and have
   set forth the freeness and graciousness of the Divine proclamation
   which in the Gospel is made to the chief of sinners. I have not,
   concerning that point, shunned to declare unto you the whole counsel of
   God. But I feel that I must now blow a blast upon the rough ram's
   horn--for sometimes our congregations need to be reminded of the Law
   and terrors of God--and of the judgment to come.

   Our experience is that the preaching of judgment is greatly blessed of
   God. We have remarked that a very large number of conversions have
   occurred under those sermons in which the declaration of God's wrath
   against all iniquity has been the most plain and solemn. A thunderstorm
   clears the air. There are pestilences which would gather beneath the
   wings of calm which can only be purged away by the lightning flash.
   When God sends His servant with heavy tidings, His message of alarm
   cleanses the spiritual atmosphere and kills the sloth, pride,
   indifference, and lethargy, which otherwise might fall upon the people.

   As the sharp needle prepares the way for the thread, so the piercing
   Law makes a way for the bright silver thread of Divine Grace. The
   lancet is quite as needful as the healing balm. The Law is our teacher
   to bring us to Christ--like the old Greek pedagogue who led the boy to
   school--so the Law leads us to Christ-who teaches and instructs us and
   makes us wise unto salvation. Those who preached the Law, as well as
   the Gospel, in the Puritan times, were the most fruitful soul winners.
   We find our blessed Lord and Master, whose heart was overflowing with
   compassion, and whose very Nature was love, often dwelling upon the
   wrath to come.

   And indeed, His utterances are more telling and terrible than the most
   burning threat from the lips of thundering Seers of old. God grant that
   this morning the effect which so anxiously desire may follow from that
   burden of the Lord which now weighs so heavily upon me. May the Master
   I gather out this day a seed unto Himself, who shall be saved from the
   wrath to come, and be to all eternity the reward of the Redeemer's
   travail. Lift up your hearts to God, you that know Him and have power
   with Him, and ask that now the Divine Spirit may work mightily, that
   hearts may be broken and sinners led to Jesus. "Beside all this,
   between us and you there is a great gulf fixed."

   Human ingenuity has done very much to bridge great gulfs. Scarcely has
   the world afforded a river so wide that its floods could not be leaped
   over. Or a torrent so furious that it could not be made to pass under
   the yoke. High above the foam of Columbia's glorious waterfall, man has
   hung aloft his slender, but substantial road of iron--and the shriek of
   the locomotive is heard above the roar of Niagara. This very week I saw
   the first chains which span the deep rift through which the Bristol
   Avon finds its way at Clifton--man has thrown his suspension bridge
   across the chasm, and men will soon travel where only that which has
   wings could a little while ago have found a way.

   There is, however, one gulf which no human skill or engineering ever
   shall be able to bridge. There is one chasm which no wing shall ever be
   able to cross. It is the gulf which divides the world of joy, in which
   the righteous triumph, from that land of sorrow in which the wicked
   feel the smart of Jehovah's sword. Whatever other arguments there may
   be why the righteous should have no communion with the wicked in a
   future state, beside all these other things, any one of which is enough
   and sufficient of itself, there is a great gulf fixed, so that there
   can be no passage from the one world to the other.

   I. In trying solemnly to speak upon this matter, I shall commence with
   this--THERE IS NO PASSAGE FROM HEAVEN TO HELL. "They which would pass
   from here to you, cannot." Glorified saints cannot visit the prison of
   lost sinners. Long enough were the righteous mingled with the
   wicked--sufficient was the evil time in which the wheat was choked with
   the tares. Quite long enough was the period in which the chaff laid
   upon the same floor, side by side with the wheat. Patience had its
   perfect work. They did both grow together until the time of the
   harvest. It is not necessary, now that harvest has come, that they
   should lie together any longer.

   It were inconsistent with the perfect joy and the beatific state of the
   righteous, with its perfect calm and purity, that sin should be
   admitted into their midst, or that they should be permitted to find
   companionships in the abodes of evil. It were not glorious to the Lord
   Jesus Christ that they should cease from beholding His beauties and
   adoring His Person, in order to succor His enemies, and comfort His
   desperate foes. Shall the courtiers of Heaven become traitors to their
   King, that they may relieve His implacable adversaries? Shall the
   princes of the blood imperial, who wear eternal coronets, lay aside
   their robes of honor to become menial servants to the damned in
   Hell--who would not, when Christ was preached to them--bow the knee and
   kiss the Son? This must not, and cannot be. Besides, the decree of God,
   like a great mountain of brass, has forever shut the righteous in with
   holiness, with happiness, with God. And they cannot, if they would,
   must not, cross the great gulf which divides them from the world of the
   wicked.

   It follows that the most earnest and diligent preacher must, then,
   renounce all hope of converting sinners. God has raised up some
   Apostolic spirits whose presence in a nation is like the rising of the
   sun. Darkness flies before them and the light of salvation streams from
   them to tens of thousands. When they lift up their hands to preach, God
   gives them power to shake the gates of Hell. And when they bend the
   knee to pray, they unlock the gates of Heaven. Men like Baxter, with
   bursting hearts of love, or Joseph Alleine with glowing tongue, or
   Whitfield with seraph's fire, or Wesley with cherub's zeal--these are
   the men who bless their age--and are most truly great.

   These men can go to the borders of the earth if they will. Their
   commission is co-extensive with the human race-- "Go you into all the
   world and preach the Gospel to every creature." "Lo, I am with you
   always, even unto the ends of the world." These men are never so happy
   as when they are preaching. Woe unto them if they preach not the
   Gospel, and when they preach it, and God helps them, they are like
   Elihu, refreshed by the effort! They were born to preach the Gospel,
   and to win sinners to Christ. They are never content except they are
   fulfilling their high commission.

   But they must cease from their labors soon, for in Heaven they are not
   needed--and from Hell they are excluded. O Sinner, even my voice,
   feeble though it is, may win you to Jesus now. But if you die
   impenitent, it can never woo you again to a Savior. Now is my time to
   preach to you and set open Mercy's door before you, but then I can
   never warn you, nor invite you. Then I can never again depict the
   agonies of my Lord and Master and endeavor to attract you by the story
   of His love, His dying, bleeding love. No, it will be all over then.
   "They rest from their labors. And their works do follow them." They
   must bring their sheaves with them, for they cannot return into another
   field to sow--nor journey into other broad acres to reap.

   Burning as their hearts will still be with Divine love, they will have
   to exercise it in another way. Their passionate longings for God's
   Glory will find other channels in which to flow. They will bow their
   heads and adore Him day and night. But they can no longer serve Him in
   Gospel ministry. The ambassador rolls up his commission, for God has
   run up the black flag of damnation and hangs out no more signals of
   peace. Poor Sinner, gladly would I win you now, for it is now or never
   with you and me.

   The efforts of the most importunate visitor, the most earnest friend,
   must cease with death. Some of you have friends who can get nearer to
   your hearts than I can. You can afford, sometimes, to forget my poor
   words and go your way to sin again. But you have a sister, and when she
   pleads with you, you do feel it. You have one loving friend, and when
   he speaks to you, you cannot be deaf. Your conscience has often been
   impressed by him and sometimes through him the strivings of the Spirit
   have been very mighty with your soul. I love, my Brothers and Sisters,
   to see you earnest for the souls of others. God may give you some souls
   whom He will never give to me. And so long as they are saved, though I
   have a holy covetousness and earnestly desire to bring many to Christ,
   yet I will as unashamedly rejoice in their salvation by your
   instrumentality as if it had been accomplished by my own.

   Go and labor with all your might. Tell what Christ has done for you.
   With pleading, loving accents, beseech them to be reconciled to God.
   But oh, remember, you can only do that in this life, for when the gates
   are shut, you are shut in for your reward, and all the world is shut
   out from your efforts. O my Hearer, do you hear this? Not only will
   there be no public congregations, no Sabbaths, no houses of prayer, but
   there shall be no private messengers, no earnest Christians who shall
   privately seek your soul's good! What do you say to this? Does not this
   give an awful value to those tender words of importunate love? Turn at
   the gentle rebuke, for otherwise you shall be suddenly destroyed, and
   that without remedy.

   Those who are nearest and dearest must be divided from you, if you
   perish in your sins! A mother can put her arms about her child's neck
   and pray for it here. She may affectionately exhort her son to seek
   peace with God now. She may earnestly and incessantly follow him with
   her holy entreaties--but she can never come to him from the realms of
   Glory if once he is lost. "They which would pass from us to you
   cannot." Do you hear it, young Man? Those glistening eyes of a mother's
   love shall never weep again for you. That touching voice which
   sometimes awoke the echoes of your heart shall never plead again. O
   ungodly Woman, you shall never see your godly child.

   Father, is it that daughter you are thinking of who loved and feared
   God in childhood, and was taken from you? Did she say to you when she
   was dying, "Follow me to Heaven, my Father"? You have heard her voice
   for the last time. That child will never see her father again unless he
   turns from his evil ways. Methinks if she could be in Heaven what she
   was on earth, she would fling her arms about your neck and seek to draw
   you to the glorious Throne of the Most High. But oh, it cannot be! A
   just God condemns the impenitent sinner, and just men assent to the
   Divine sentence.

   See then, O you ungodly ones that are present today! You often think
   our company a great nuisance, and perhaps while I am preaching, my
   alarming words annoy you. Ah, we shall not annoy you long. Does your
   mother tease you when she bids you seek the Lord? She will not tease
   you long! When I bring home the judgment to come, is the subject
   obnoxious to you? I shall not ask your patience long. We shall be
   separated. If you go your way, and follow after sin and wrath, there
   will come a dividing time. And O let me say to you--you would give
   worlds if you had them! You would give them if they were solid
   diamonds, to hear again the voice which now fatigues you--and to listen
   once more to those plaintive invitations which vex you, and spoil your
   mirth!

   Ah, how would you bless God if He would let you come back again and
   have once more those Sabbaths which were so dull and dreary, and permit
   you to go up once more to the House of God which now, perhaps, is like
   a prison to your vain and frivolous spirits. O Sirs, I say you may well
   have patience with us for a little time, and bear with our
   importunities, for we shall not plague you much longer. We beseech you
   to come to Jesus. We would pluck you by your garments and beseech you
   to flee from the wrath to come. Forgive us for being thus in earnest,
   for even if we should fail with you, you will soon escape the
   importunities of our love. A few short months of mortal life and then
   you will be far away from all religious discourses and all spiritual
   talk of things to come. You will be in your own company, but I warn
   you--this will yield you no contentment.

   Dear Friends, how earnest this ought to make the people of God to work
   while it is called today. If this is our only time for doing good, let
   us do good while we can. I hear people sometimes say, "Mr. So-and-So
   does too much. He works too hard." Oh, we none of us do half enough! Do
   not talk about working too hard for Jesus Christ--the thing is
   impossible. Are souls perishing, and shall I sleep? My idle, lazy
   Flesh, shall you keep me still while men are dying and Hell is filling?
   Brothers and Sisters, let us be lukewarm no longer. If God makes us
   lights in the world, let us spend ourselves as a candle does, which
   consumes itself by shining.

   As the poor work girl, who has but one candle, works with desperate
   pace because that will soon be burned out, so let us be instant in
   season and out of season--watching, praying, laboring for the souls of
   men. We are not earnest enough about immortal souls. If we had but a
   view of the shortness of life, the fleeting character of time, and the
   terrors of eternal wrath. If we could but see lost souls and understand
   their unutterable woe, we should shake ourselves from the dust and go
   forth to work while it is called today.

   II. As we cannot go from Heaven to Hell, so the text assures us,
   "NEITHER CAN THEY PASS TO US THAT WOULD COME FROM THERE." The lost
   spirits in Hell are shut in forever. I see the angel standing at that
   iron door. I hear the awful key as it grates among the tremendous
   wards, and when that gate is closed, he hurls the key into the abyss of
   oblivion! The captives are fast imprisoned, bound in fetters which will
   never break, in chains which never rust. The sinner cannot come to
   Heaven for a multitude of reasons.

   Among the best, these: First, his own character forbids it. As a man
   lives and dies, so will he be throughout eternity. The drunkard here
   will have all a drunkard's thirst there without the means of gratifying
   it. The swearer here will become a yet more ripe and proficient
   blasphemer. Death does not change but fixes character. It petrifies it.
   "He that is holy let him be holy still. He that is filthy let him be
   filthy still." The lost man remains a sinner, and a growing sinner, and
   continues to rebel against God. Would you have such a man in Heaven?
   Shall the thief prowl through the streets of the New Jerusalem? Shall
   the atmosphere of Paradise be polluted by an oath? Shall the songs of
   angels be disturbed by the ribaldry of licentious conversation?

   It cannot be! Heaven were no Heaven if the sinner could be permitted to
   enter it. "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
   God," and as there is no hope of the finally lost ever being born
   again, the kingdom of God they cannot see. Sinner, if you are not fit
   for Heaven now, have you any right to hope you ever will be? If you die
   without God and without hope, where must your portion be? Without a God
   can you dwell in Heaven--God's own dominions? Without hope, can you
   enter where hope is consummated in full fruition? Never! The enemies of
   God shall never be permitted to beard Him to His Face and vent their
   blasphemies in His own palace. They must be driven from His Presence
   and driven from that Presence forever.

   Moreover, not only does the man's character shut him out, but also the
   sinner's doom. What was it? "These shall go away into everlasting
   punishment." If it is everlasting, how can they enter Heaven? What does
   the Savior say, "Where their worm dies not, and their fire is not
   quenched." If there is any truth in that metaphor, the lost are lost
   forever. The worm would die if they entered Heaven, and the fire were
   quenched if they obtained celestial seats. How does the Holy Spirit put
   it? Does He not describe the wrath to come as a bottomless pit? It were
   not such if they could get a handhold and afterwards climb upward to
   the starry thrones of angels.

   Brothers and Sisters, He that dooms men, He that has put it in the
   strong expression, "He that believes not shall be damned," will
   certainly and literally carry out His own words. And if it is so, it
   shall never be possible for them to break their prison of fire, and
   enter the land ofjoy and peace. Moreover, Sinner, you cannot go out of
   the prison because God's Character and God's Word are against you.
   Shall God ever cease to be just? If He is just, He must never cease
   from punishing you when you are finally condemned. "Holy, Holy, Holy,
   Lord God of Sabaoth," is the never ceasing cry of cherubim--and as long
   as He is, "Holy, Holy, Holy," you can never be acceptable to Him. Shall
   God ever cease to be true?

   And remember, as long as He is true to His own threats, He must and
   will send His arrows through you and make His fierce wrath to consume
   you. Then there stands His decree, "He that believes not shall be
   damned." This is the great gulf, that fixed chasm by which the
   impenitent sinner is fast as firmest destiny, bound, like Prometheus,
   to the rock forever, never to be loosed in time or in eternity. It must
   not--it shall not be--if God is God--if His decree is not a falsehood
   and a vanity, you must not come out of the place of your torment.

   There is more. Remember, Sinner, there never was but one bridge between
   fallen man and a holy God. That bridge you reject. The Person of the
   Mediator, His substitution, His righteousness, His painful death--these
   make the only road from sin to righteousness, from wrath to acceptance.
   But these you reject. If you should ever be lost you will have finally
   rejected Christ. And inasmuch as you are not, this morning, saved, O my
   poor fellow Creature, you are now rejecting Christ. You are as good as
   saying, "Christ died, but not for me. Christ shed His blood to save
   men, but I will not be saved in His way. Let Him die. I count His death
   a trifle, and His blood a vanity. I had sooner perish than be saved by

   Him."

   This is what you in effect are saying. I know the words make you
   shudder. You would not venture to utter them, but that is your feeling.
   You will not have this Man to reign over you. You will not bow the
   knee, and kiss the Son. You will still be an adversary to God, and
   sooner be destroyed than be saved through the Atonement of Christ.
   Well, now, if you reject the only way, what wonder if having rejected
   that, there remains no hope? Besides, remember there is no other
   sacrifice for sin. Scripture expressly tells us that there remains no
   more sacrifice for sin. Do you think that Jesus will come a second time
   to die? Shall those Divine hands be stretched again to the wood?

   You reject Him now. If He died again, you would reject Him. Shall the
   head again be pierced with thorns? Shall the side again be rent with
   the spear? Why, Sinner, if you refuse to have Him now, you would refuse
   Him could He die a sec- ond time. But that cannot be. He has offered an
   Atonement once and for all, and now He forever sits down at the right
   hand of the Majesty on High. No second Atonement--no second redemption
   shall ever be offered for the sins of men.

   Besides, remember, there is no Holy Spirit in the pit. The blessed
   Spirit is here today, and often has He striven with some of you. Do you
   remember when you trembled like Felix? Do you not remember the time
   when, like Agrippa, you were almost persuaded? But still all this was
   put away--conscience was hushed. The Spirit of God was quenched. Well,
   that Spirit can strive with you again, and if He comes forth in His
   Irresistible strength, if your heart is like a flint, He can break it.
   And if like iron, He can melt it. But once in the pit, and the Holy
   Spirit never comes there. That blessed dove shuns the place of wrath.
   And over souls given up to destruction, never will His life-giving
   wings be known to brood.

   If so, then you cannot be born again and cannot enter Heaven. You
   cannot be sanctified. And unsanctified spirits cannot have a portion in
   the skies. So then it is clear enough you cannot possibly pass from
   Hell to Heaven. Ah, this will be a judgment upon you, a solemn judgment
   upon you for many things. You do not like the House of God. You shall
   be shut out of it. You do not love Sunday. You are shut out from the
   eternal Sunday. The voice of sacred song had no charm in it for you.
   You shall not join it. The face of God you never loved. You shall never
   see it. The name of Jesus Christ was never melodious in your ears. You
   shall never hear it.

   Jesus Christ was preached to you, but you rejected him--His blood you
   trod beneath your feet. The way to Heaven was freely set open before
   you, but you would not come to Him that you might have life. There is a
   road from earth to Heaven--Sinner, though you have gone into the depths
   of sin, if you have been the most infamous and most outrageous of
   offenders, there is still a road for you to Heaven. The harlot, the
   thief, the profane, the drunkard may yet find mercy through the Divine
   Grace of Jesus, but--

   "There are no acts of pardon passed In that cold grave to which we
   haste. Only darkness, death and long despair Reign in eternal silence
   there."

   God bless the solemn remarks we make and He shall have the glory.

   III. But now, once again to change the subject for a few minutes, I
   have to notice in the third place, that while no persons can pass that
   bridgeless chasm, so NO THINGS CAN. Nothing can come from Hell to
   Heaven. Rejoice, you saints in light, triumph in your God for this--no
   temptation of Satan can ever vex you when once you are landed on the
   golden strand. You are beyond bowshot of the archenemy. He may howl and
   bite his iron bands, but his howling cannot terrify and his biting
   cannot disturb.

   No longer shall you be vexed with the filthy conversation of the
   ungodly. Lot shall never hear another foul word. You shall not have to
   say, "Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of
   Kedar."--

   "No light discourse shall reach your heart, Nor trifles vex your ear."

   You shall be shut out from everything that belongs to Hell. And
   remember, you shall be in Heaven. You will be so secure, that the wrath
   of God which makes Hell, shall never light on you. Your Savior carried
   it for you. Not a drop of it shall fall upon you. No present pains
   shall be in Heaven, they are for the lost. No pains of body, no
   distractions of mind. You shall have no sin--sin cannot pass from them
   to you. You shall be perfect--like your Lord, without spot or wrinkle,
   or any such thing--

   "Your inward foes shall all be slain,
   Nor Satan vex your peace again." You shall have no fears for the
   future. You shall know that your bliss is eternal. This shall always be
   the honey of your honeycomb--that it lasts forever. Millions of years
   you shall gaze into the face of your Beloved, throughout endless ages
   you shall bask in the sunlight of His smile.
   This is joy, I say, to the Christian! If he will but think it over it
   will reconcile him to the hardest strokes of temporary tribulation, and
   make him rejoice in the hardest toil of this mortal struggle. Courage,
   Brothers and Sisters, it is but a day or two of wrestling and then the
   immortal crown--an hour or two of fighting and then the everlasting
   rest! Me-thinks I see today the angels leaning from the battlements of
   the celestial palace, and as they mark you, like armed men cutting your
   way to the gates thereof, they cry to you----
   "Come in, come in,
   Eternal glory you shall win."

   Will you sheathe your swords? Will you stop the conflict? No! Press on
   and let your true Jerusalem blades cut through soul and spirit, and
   divide joint and marrow till you reach the summit and the eternal Glory
   shall be yours!

   IV. Again, we change the strain for a fourth point and this a terrible
   one. As nothing can come from Hell to Heaven, so nothing heavenly can
   ever come to Hell. There are rivers of life at God's right hand--those
   streams can never leap in blessed waterfalls to the lost. No, Lazarus
   is not permitted to dip the tip of his finger in water to administer
   the cooling drop to the fire-tormented tongue. Not a drop of heavenly
   water can ever cross that chasm.

   See then, Sinner, Heaven is rest, perfect rest--but there is no rest in
   Hell. It is labor in the fire, and no ease, no peace, no sleep, no
   calm, no quiet--everlasting storm--eternal hurricane--unceasing tempest
   in the worst disease. There are some respites--spasms of agony--but
   then no pauses of repose. There is no pause in Hell's torments. The
   dreadful music of the eternal lamentation has not so much as a single
   stop in it. It is on, on, on, with crash of battle, and dust, and
   blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.

   Heaven, too, is a place of joy. There, happy fingers sweep celestial
   chords. There, joyous spirits sing Hosannas day without night. But
   there is no joy in Hell. For music there is the groan. For joy there is
   the pang. For sweet fellowship there is the binding up in bundles. For
   everything that is blissful there is everything that is dolorous. No, I
   could not exaggerate, that were impossible. I cannot come up to the
   doleful facts. Therefore I leave them. Nothing of the joy of Heaven can
   ever come to Hell. Heaven is the place of sweet communion with God--

   "There they behold His face, And never, never sin. There from the
   rivers of His Grace, Drink endless pleasures in."

   There is no communion with God in Hell. There are prayers, but they are
   unheard. There are tears, but they are unaccepted. There are cries for
   pity, but they are all an abomination unto the Lord. God wills not the
   death of any. He had rather that he should turn unto Him and live, but
   if that Divine Grace is refused--

   "The Lord, in vengeance dressed,
   Shall lift His hand and swear,
   You that despised My promised rest
   Shall have no portion there."

   Tell me what Heaven is, if you will, and I must say of any description
   that you give of its joys, that there is none of them in Tophet, for
   Heaven's blessings cannot cross from the celestial regions to the
   infernal prison. No, it is sorrow without relief, misery without
   hope--and here is the pang of it--it is death without end. There is
   only one thing that I know of in which Heaven is like Hell--it is
   eternal. "The wrath to come, the wrath to come, the wrath to come,"
   forever and forever spending itself and yet never being spent.

   And now, would to God, I could speak with you as my heart desires. For
   this is my only opportunity, since, as I have already said, I can do
   this no more if I am saved and if you are lost. Spare me, then, two or
   three minutes while I close this poor discourse of mine by trying to
   reason with those of you who are unconverted. I have had little to say
   to God's people this morning. I may comfort them in the evening, but
   this morning I have to deal with you who fear not God. Many of you now
   present are unconverted. I will never flatter you by preaching to you
   as though you were all Christians.

   The Lord my God knows there is many a heart here that never was broken.
   There is many a spirit here that never trembled before the majesty of
   infinite justice, and never kissed the outstretched scepter of a
   crucified Redeemer. You know this, some of you. You know you are in the
   gall of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity. I do not mean you,
   alone, who live in open sin. But I mean you who are amiable, excellent,
   admirable in your carriage and deportment--but yet the love of God is
   not in you. There is no fault to be found with your outward character,
   perhaps, but you have not been born again. You have never passed from
   death unto life.

   And remember, Sirs, there is the same Hell for the most excellent as
   for the most abominable, unless you fly to Christ--"For other
   foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
   And if you believe not in Him, you shall die in your sins, "for there
   is none other name under Heaven given among men, whereby we must be
   saved." Come, then, let me plead with you, and I will ask you a
   question--do you believe all this? Do you believe that there is a

   Hell? Do you believe that there is a Heaven to be lost? If you profess
   that you do not so believe, I have done with you. God bring you to a
   better mind.

   But what did you come here for? Why do you profess to be a Christian if
   you reject the Christian's inspired Book? Become an infidel and be
   honest. For my part, modern infidelity never gives me any alarm. I had
   as soon see you outwardly infidels, as to hear you pretend to be
   Christians and yet disbelieve what this Book teaches. I like honesty,
   and it seems to me that when a man honestly says, "I shall not make a
   profession of believing what I do not believe," that there is at least
   one virtue in him. And we may hope that others may find soil to grow
   in.

   But you that profess to be religious and attend your Church or your
   Chapel, and yet do not believe the Revelation of God, what can I say to
   you, but that your damnation will be most just. I think I hear many of
   you say, "Believe it, Sir, oh, we never doubted it! We learned it in
   our earliest childhood, we have heard it always, and we never ventured
   to doubt." Ah, well then, I ask you--are you in your sober senses to
   believe that there is a Hell and not seek to escape from it? Do you
   believe there is a wrath to come, and that it may fall upon you in the
   next minute, for you may be dead, and never leave this House of
   Prayer--and yet do you sit easy in your pews? Or, are you mad? Has sin
   so besotted you with its foul intoxication, that you cannot think? For
   if you can think, and there is an angry God who will punish with the
   awful force of His Omnipotence, how is it that you can be at ease in
   Zion?

   Let me ask you another question--if these things are so, have you used
   your senses in giving a preference to the pleasures of this life beyond
   the joys of Heaven--in following the pleasures of today, when you know
   they will be followed with the miseries of eternity? Do not be
   mistaken, I do not mean to say that a Christian is without
   pleasures--we have the highest and purest pleasure that mortal or
   immortal can know. We have not the pleasures of sin, but we have
   higher, more delightful and deeper pleasures. But this is what I
   mean--will you spend yourselves in sinful pleasure? Will you occupy
   your time with lust, or drunkenness, or with the frivolities of
   fashionable life, and do you think that these are worth the expense
   that they will cause?

   "Oh," said one to me, who holds a high position in society, as I talked
   with him a long time after having preached earnestly the Gospel--he
   took me by the button and he said, "it does seem to me to be an awful
   thing, that I, knowing as I do what will be my lot if I live and die as
   I am, should still act as I do. When you are with me," he said, "and I
   listen to a solemn address, I think there shall come a change over me.
   I will serve God. But, O Sir, you do not know the temptations of my
   life! You do not know how it is when I get into the midst of pomp and
   vanities and perhaps mingle with men who ridicule all thoughts of
   religion, it all goes--and I am such a fool that I sell my soul--sell
   my soul for it."

   Oh, there are such fools here today--who sell their souls for a little
   sin--one or two whirls in the world's mad dance and then the devil is
   your partner and your mirth is over. I ask you to use your reason and
   judge whether it is worth your while to gain the whole world and lose
   your own soul?

   I shall put it to you in another way. How is it that you do not lay
   hold of Christ, since this is the only time when there is a probability
   that Christ can be laid hold of? I will tell you why it is. You do not
   love Christ. You love sin. Or else you are too proud to come to Christ.
   You think yourselves good enough, and you think that Christ is not for
   such as you are, but only for great sinners and the lowest of the low.
   O Sirs, is your pride such a fine thing that you will be damned in
   order to maintain its dignity? Throw your pride down, come as a sinner
   must come, and lay hold of Jesus Christ. Or if it is your sin which
   hinders, may God the Holy Spirit help you to pluck out the right eye,
   and cast off a right arm sooner than having two eyes and two arms to be
   cast into Hell fire.

   "But," says one, "how may I lay hold on Christ?" May the blessed Spirit
   enable you to do it. Here it is--trust Jesus Christ, and you shall be
   saved. Conscious that you deserve His wrath, trembling because of His
   terrible Law, look to Jesus. There hangs a bleeding Savior. Methinks
   these eyes can see Him bleeding there. God eternal, He by whom the
   Heaven of heavens were Made, and the earth and the fullness thereof,
   takes upon Himself the form of Man and hangs upon the tree of the
   curse--

   "See from His head, His hands, His feet,
   Sorrow and love flow mingled down!
   Did ever such love and sorrow meet,
   Or thorns compose so rich a crown?"

   There is life in a look at that Crucified One, there is life at this
   moment for you! Will you glance at Him with a tearful eye?

   "Jesus slaughtered, martyred, murdered for my sake, I do believe in
   You. Here at Your feet I throw myself, all guilty, polluted, foul. Let
   Your blood drop on me. Turn Your eyes upon me. Say to me, 'I have loved
   you with an everlasting love, therefore with the bands of My kindness
   have I drawn you.' Come and welcome, Sinner--come."

   I have but preached the Law to you out of love. God knows how these
   hard things, as I speak them, make my heart bleed blood. O that you
   would believe in Jesus! He is freely preached to you--accept Him. May
   the Spirit of God lead you now to accept Him. These are no hard terms,
   no stern conditions of a bloodthirsty tyrant. He does but say, "Bow the
   knee and kiss the Son. Come and welcome, Sinner--come."

   Young Man, will you be saved or not? You, Sinner yonder, with your gray
   head, approaching the approach of death, will you believe in Christ or
   not? It may be this is your last time--you shall never hear the Gospel
   faithfully and affectionately pressed home upon you again. Will you
   have Jesus to be yours? Spirit of God, lead that heart to say, "Yes,
   Lord, I will." And as the acceptance is heard on earth, may it be
   registered in Heaven--and may salvation come to that man's heart this
   day!

   The Lord bless you all, every one of you. And when He gathers His
   people together, may I and you, every one of us, by His Grace, be found
   at His right hand, to see His smiling face. Amen.

                            Believing With The Heart

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JULY 12, 1863, BY THE REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For with the heart man believes unto righteousness. And with the mouth
   confession is made unto salvation." Romans 10:10.

   EVERY star in Heaven yields its ray of light to cheer the mariner upon
   the watery waste. But there are leaders among that sparkling
   host--stars of the first magnitude--whose golden lamps are so
   dexterously hung, and trimmed with such excessive care that they offer
   way-marks to the wanderer by which he may be able to steer his vessel
   to the desired haven. So all the promises of Scripture are full of
   comfort. In their sphere, they glow and glisten with the warmth and
   light of love. But there are "bright particular stars," even among
   these--promises, conspicuous as Orion, brilliant as the Pleiades, fixed
   as Arcturus with his sons.

   Brethren, you know those soul-saving texts to which I refer, which are
   radiant with comfort, and have in them such a blessed combination of
   simple words, and comforting sentences that they guide multitudes of
   sinners to the port of peace in Jesus Christ. My text, I think, is one
   of these. At least, the doctrine which it teaches--that of salvation by
   faith--is the very polestar of the Gospel. And he who steers by it
   shall find the heavenly shore. Be not at all displeased that such a
   Truth of God should again be proclaimed in your hearing. The physician
   who is about to go abroad and knows that he shall not be able to
   procure more drugs, lays in a store of all the valued medicines in
   pharmacy--but he buys the largest stock of remedies for the more common
   diseases of the body.

   And so, my Brothers and Sisters, we are bound in our ministry to preach
   upon all sorts of subjects. We ought not to bring out things old and
   old, but things new and old. Yet the preacher must dwell most upon that
   doctrine which is the most required and is most likely to heal the
   sin-sick soul. We believe that for every one converted under another
   doctrine, there have been ten brought to Christ by the simple preaching
   of salvation by faith. Although every Truth in Scripture is like a mesh
   of the great Gospel net, the great Truth of justification by faith
   makes up so many meshes that it constitutes the major part of the net
   and holds within its influence great multitudes of fishes.

   God help us to cast this net today on the right side of the ship. While
   I let down the great dragnet, you take your share in the Gospel
   fishery, and pray that God may send the fishes into it. And may His
   name be praised this day both in Heaven and on earth. The text very
   simply divides itself into two parts. Faith and confession. The two are
   joined together, let no man put them asunder. "With the heart man
   believes unto righteousness. And with the mouth confession is made unto
   salvation."

   Three things on each of these topics. First, upon faith. We have here
   set before us, either in the text, or in the context, the Object of
   faith, the nature of faith, and its result.

   I. THE OBJECT OF FAITH is clearly mentioned in the context. The
   preceding verse runs thus--"That if you shall confess with your mouth
   the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised Him
   from the dead, you shall be saved." It is evident, then, that Jesus
   Christ, dead and risen, is the foundation of faith.

   The Object of faith is probably the most important subject of our
   contemplation. I believe there are many who think too much of their
   faith and too little of the object of it. For many a weary month they
   are questioning whether they have the right sort of faith--whereas they
   would do a great deal better if they looked to see whether their faith
   rested upon a right foundation. For after all, while faith is
   important, the foundation of that faith is all-important, and we must
   look most to that.

   Now, soul-saving faith rests, according to a thousand places in
   Scripture, upon Christ--upon Christ in all His Characters, works, and
   offices. Faith, first of all, rests upon Christ, as incarnate. What was
   sung by angels becomes the song of the poor depressed spirit. Jesus,
   the Son of God, was born in Bethlehem's manger--God was made flesh and
   dwelt among us. Faith believes this great mystery of godliness--God
   manifest in the flesh--believes that He, by whom the heavens were
   framed, and without whom was not anything made that was made, did for
   us men and for our salvation, come down from Heaven to tabernacle in
   the virgin's womb.

   Faith so believes this as to draw comfort from it. For, says Faith, "If
   God thus became Man that He might come into nearness with our nature,
   this deed of love attracts me, gives me confidence toward God, and bids
   me approach the Lord with boldness, inasmuch as God comes to me."--

   "Till God in human flesh I see,
   My thoughts no comfort find.
   The holy, just and sacred Three
   Are terrors to my mind.
   But if Immanuel's face appears,
   My hope, my joy, begins--
   His name forbids my slavish fear,
   His Grace removes my sins."

   Faith next sees Christ in His life. She perceives that He is perfect.
   In obedience, sanctified wholly to His work, and although, "tempted in
   all points like as we are, yet without sin." Faith delights to admire
   and adore Him in His complete obedience to the Law of God. And she
   perceives with rapture, that in every jot and tittle He has fulfilled
   it, magnified it, and made it honorable. Faith, with holy boldness,
   cries, "This righteousness shall be mine. Christ has kept the Law for
   me. Evidently He was under no necessity to do this of Himself. But
   being found in fashion as a Man for my salvation, He with the same end
   and object kept that Law."

   Faith looks to that righteousness of Christ and, like the Apostle, she
   learns to say, "Yes doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the
   excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have
   suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may
   win Christ and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which
   is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
   righteousness which is of God by faith." But, chiefly, Faith looks to
   Christ as offering up Himself upon the tree. She stands at the foot of
   the Cross, watching that mysterious, that matchless spectacle--God made
   flesh--bleeding, dying.

   The Son of God wasted with pangs, rent with agonies and throes
   unutterable--obedient, even unto death. She watches Him with the
   expectancy of hope and the emotion of gratitude, both of which bring
   the tears streaming down her cheeks. She hears the expiring Sin-Bearer
   cry with a loud voice, "It is finished!" She adds a glad Amen, "It is
   finished!" My soul believes that there is enough in those wounds to
   wash away my sins--enough to avert the thunders of an angry God--enough
   in that righteousness to cover me from head to foot, and win for me the
   smile of infinite justice. O blessed Jesus, You are the one pillar of
   our consolation! Faith builds her all on this chief cornerstone.

   But Beloved, Faith has never done with Jesus. Where He goes she follows
   hard after Him. Her eye tracks the body of the Savior to the tomb of
   Joseph of Arimathea. She beholds that Body, on the third day, instinct
   with life, rolling away the stone and bursting its cerements. "Jesus
   lives," says Faith--and inasmuch as Christ was put into the prison of
   the tomb as a hostage and bail for His people, Faith knows that He
   never could have come out again if God had not been completely
   satisfied with His substitutionary work--

   "If Jesus never had paid the debt, He never had been at freedom set."
   Faith, therefore, perceives that if Christ is risen, the soul is
   justified. God has accepted Christ on my behalf--His resurrection
   proves it. And I stand accepted in the Beloved, because Jesus Christ
   has risen.

   If you believe this, sincerely, in your heart--that God raised Him from
   the dead--you shall be saved. Borne aloft as on eagle's wings, Faith is
   not afraid to pursue her Redeemer up to His Father's Throne. Her
   illuminated eye beholds Him in His session at the right hand of God.
   She sees Him pleading as the great High Priest before the mighty
   Father's Throne. And expecting until His enemies are made His
   footstool, Faith builds upon His intercession and dominion, as well as
   upon His death and resurrection. He is able also to save them to the
   uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever lives to make
   intercession for them.

   Mark, my dear Brothers and Sisters, the whole foundation upon which
   Faith rests is Christ living in the flesh, Christ dying in that flesh,
   Christ rising from the dead, Christ pleading in Glory on behalf of
   sinners. Not so much as a hair's breadth of Faith's foundation is to be
   found out of Christ Jesus. Faith does not build on its own experience.
   It rests on no Graces, raptures, meltings, communings, fights, or
   prayings. Its chief cornerstone is Christ Jesus. Faith never builds on
   any knowledge which it has obtained by research--on no merit which it
   fancies it has procured by long and ardent service. It looks altogether
   beyond self, and out of self. Christ Jesus and Christ Jesus alone, is
   the Object of its confidence.

   Sinner, what do you say to this? There is nothing in you, but there
   needs be nothing. Can you trust Jesus? Jesus, the Son of God, becomes
   your Brother, bone of your bone and flesh of your flesh. Can you not
   trust His love? Jesus, the Son of God, dies on the Cross. Can you not
   trust that blood, that agony, that death? Look, Sinner! From head, and
   hands, and feet, the blood is streaming. It is a Divine Being who thus
   suffers! It is none other than God over all, blessed forever, who is
   nailed to that tree! Can you not believe that there is merit enough in
   agonies like these to stand in the place of your sufferings in Hell?

   Do you not believe that Justice gets an ampler recompense from the
   wounds of Christ than it ever could find in all your wounds, even if
   you had been beaten from the soles of your feet to the crown of your
   head, until you had been nothing but wounds and putrefying sores?
   Methinks you will reply, "I believe that upon Calvary, God received a
   greater glorification of His Law than in all the agonies of all the
   damned in Hell, though they suffer eternally the infinite anger of
   God." I ask you, Sinner, can you not believe that Christ's perfect
   righteousness is enough for you? Can you see a flaw in it? Is it not
   fair white linen? Is there a spot? Is it not made of such precious
   material, the Divine work of a Divine Savior, that nothing can match
   it?

   If you had it, Sinner, do you not think you would stand before God
   without so much as a spot or wrinkle? And I ask you, Sinner, do you not
   believe that if Jesus pleads for you, you will be saved? Can He stretch
   out His hands and say, "Father, save that sinner," and will God refuse
   to hear His prayer? If you give Him your cause to plead, do you think
   He will be an unsuccessful Advocate? Why, Man, with all the unbelief
   that is in your heart, I hope you will believe that if Jesus, who was
   the very heart of God, shall espouse your cause, He cannot plead in
   vain!

   I think I hear you answer, "Oh, yes, we believe all this. We believe
   that this is ground for the fullest confidence to saints, but may we
   rest upon it? Are we to understand that if we trust in Jesus Christ,
   because He was a Man, and because He lived, and died, and rose again,
   and pleads, we are saved?" Soul, this is just what I would have you
   understand. If you have no good thoughts or feelings. If up to now you
   have been the most damnable of rebels against God. If up to this moment
   your hard and impenitent heart has been at enmity against God and
   against Christ. Yet if now, this very day, you will believe Christ
   incarnate, Christ died, Christ risen, Christ pleading can save you--and
   if you will rest your soul upon that fact--you shall be saved.

   God, the infinitely loving Father, is willing to receive you just as
   you are. He asks nothing of you. O Prodigal, you may come back in your
   rags and filthiness, notwithstanding that you have spent your living
   with harlots. Notwithstanding that the swine have been your companions
   and you would gladly have filled your belly with their husks. You may
   come back without upbraiding, or so much as a word of anger, because
   your Father's only begotten Son has stood in your place. And in your
   place has suffered all that your many sins deserved.

   If you will now trust in Jesus, the Lord, who loved you with
   unspeakable love, you shall be this very day received into joy and
   peace with a Father's arms about your neck, accepted and beloved. With
   your rags stripped from off you, clothed in the best robe--with the
   ring upon your finger, and the shoes upon your feet, listening to music
   and danc-ing--because your soul, which was lost is found, your heart
   which was dead has been made alive. This, then, is the Object of
   faith--our one and only Savior, doing all, for all who trust Him.

   II. Next, we have in the text, the NATURE OF FAITH. This is obvious. We
   are told that, "with the heart man believes unto righteousness." This
   is not introduced by way of making a subtle distinction. Sometimes
   ministers make so many distinctions about faith that true seekers are
   much perplexed. I am very jealous of myself this morning, lest I should
   do the same. I have read sermons upon natural faith, and upon spiritual
   faith. And I have been persuaded that what the preacher called natural
   faith, was as much spiritual as that which he distinguished as the
   faith of God's elect.

   The less distinction we try to make here, I think, the better, when
   Jesus Christ has broadly put it, "He that believes and is baptized
   shall be saved." Where He makes few distinctions, but openly puts it,
   "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved," we ought
   not to be making and multiplying theological points of differences.
   Still, dear Brothers and Sisters, the text does say, "With the heart
   man believes." And this is somewhat strange, because we generally at-
   tribute the act of faith to the mind, to the understanding. The
   understanding believes certain facts, which appear to it to be worthy
   of credence. But our text puts saving faith upon the heart, and makes
   it to be a work of the affections rather than of the understanding.

   I take it this is done for this reason--first, in order merely to state
   that faith--saving faith--must be sincere. We must not merely say, "I
   see the thing is so," but we must heartily believe it. It must not be a
   notional faith which a man professes, because his mother was of the
   same persuasion, or because living in a Christian land he would be
   somewhat singular if he were to set up to be an infidel. Our faith must
   be a hearty, honest, sincere persuasion of the Truths of God which we
   profess to believe. If I say to myself, "Well, I have no doubt the
   Christian religion is true. I dare say it is"--but if I do not in my
   heart feel and know it to be true, then my faith will not save me.

   Doubtless, the word, "heart," is put in here to make a distinction
   between doctrinal faith and the faith which accepts Christ. Why, I have
   the misfortune to know scores who are well read in divinity. They can
   get on excellently in all the scholastic parts of theology. They are
   orthodox--yes, orthodox to the last turn of the scale--and they fight
   like lions and tigers for but one hair of the head of a creed. And yet,
   they will never be saved by their faith, because their belief is merely
   a belief of certain abstract propositions which never affected their
   nature. A faith, which, to speak honestly, they do not believe, after
   all.

   Those dogmas which they accept as truths have no relationship to them.
   Their unregenerate hearts cannot perceive the true bearing of those
   doctrines upon themselves, consequently they receive them as lies. If
   you put a truth out of its proper place, you make it either marvelously
   like a lie, or else really a lie. And if I hold certain doctrines
   merely as having respect to some particular persons, but not as having
   any reference to me--and if I hold them so that they do not in any
   degree influence my character and touch my heart--then I hold them
   falsely. I turn the Truth of God into a lie, and my faith can never
   save my soul. True religion is more than notion--something must be
   known and felt. And faith is something more than acceptance of a sound
   creed--it is believing with the heart.

   But now, I hope I shall not darken counsel by words without knowledge.
   Let me try, if I can, to explain what I think believing with the heart
   is. Beloved, you know very well that the first work of God, the Holy
   Spirit, in man, is not to teach him doctrines, but to make him feel a
   great hungering and thirsting--a great emptiness within himself. He is
   vexed with an uneasiness, a perpetual pining and longing and groaning
   after a something, he scarcely knows what. Now, that is his heart set
   in motion by the Spirit. His heart, like the needle, touched with the
   magnet, cannot rest, because it has not found its pole. It has been
   touched mysteriously. It does not know how or why.

   But this it knows--it has a restlessness in it--and trembles after a
   settled and abiding peace. It is the heart, you know, which is thus
   sorely troubled. Now, when the Lord Jesus Christ is set forth in our
   hearing as being a perfect and complete Savior, able at this very
   moment to pardon all sins, and to give a perfect righteousness--to give
   us this day a salvation which is complete--and which will be complete
   when time shall be no more, then the heart says, "Why, that is just
   what I have been wanting." Just as the flowers which have been shut up
   all night, as soon as ever the sun is up, open their cups as if they
   felt--"There! That is what we were wanting! Hail, glorious sun!"

   So the breaking, yearning, longing, thirsting heart, says, "Ah, that is
   what I need. You, O Christ, are all I want-- more than all in You I
   find." Then, that heart says, "Come to me, Jesus, come to me. Be mine,
   I would entertain You. If You would but come under my roof, I should
   have my poor humble heart made happy as the gates of Heaven." The heart
   stretches out its arms to Christ, and Christ comes into that heart. And
   the heart presses Him close to itself. That is believing with the
   heart. It is the heart's own conviction that Jesus Christ is just what
   it wants.

   Many of you have a true faith in Christ and yet you have never read
   "Paley's Evidences," nor "Butler's Analogy." It would not hurt you if
   you did. But you never did study such books, and perhaps you never
   will. You hardly know upon what ground the Bible is accepted as true,
   and therefore, cunning infidels give you a good shaking when they get
   hold of you upon that point. But there is one thing upon which you can
   never be shaken--you feel the Gospel must be true, because it just
   suits the wants of your heart. If any man should say to you when you
   are thirsty, "Water is not good," you would say, "Give me more of it. I
   have a thirst in here that makes me desire it."

   By an irresistible process stronger than logic, you can prove to
   yourself that water is good because it quenches your thirst. Just so
   with bread--when you are hungry, if you come to the table and a
   philosopher should say to you, "You do not understand the ground upon
   which bread nourishes the human frame. You do not know anything about
   the process of digestion, and the method of assimilation, and how the
   bones are nourished by the phosphorus, and by the lime, and by the
   silica contained in the flour!" You would say, "I do not know. I do not
   particularly care to know. But one thing I know, I am sure bread is
   good to eat if I am hungry and I will show you." And you seize the loaf
   and begin to cut and eat. So it is with the believing heart. The heart
   is hungry, therefore the heart feeds upon Jesus. The heart is thirsty,
   therefore the heart drinks the Living Water. And so the heart believes
   unto righteousness.

   Again, there is another explanation. Is it not, dear Friends, man's
   heart renewed by Divine Grace which is led to perceive the difficulty
   of reconciling the apparently discordant attributes of God? Do you not
   remember well that day when your heart said, "God is just. It is right
   He should be"? And your heart seemed as if it would kiss the hilt of
   the sharp sword Justice. You said, "Lord, though it is my own
   damnation, yet I would adore You, because You are holy, holy, holy."
   Your heart said, "Lord, I know You are merciful, for You have told me
   so. I see in the lovely works of Your hands, in the bountiful
   cornfields laden with the yellow grain, in this fair sunshine ripening
   all the fruits--I see proof that You are a good and gracious God.

   "But, Lord, I cannot understand how You can be gracious, and yet be
   just. For if You are just, You are sworn to punish. And if You are
   gracious, then you will forgive! How can You do both? How can you
   punish and yet forgive? How can You smite and yet receive with tokens
   of affection?" You came up to the sanctuary one day when your heart was
   just in that state--in a quandary. Your heart was like the city of
   Shushan, it was perplexed. But you heard the preacher show clearly that
   Christ became the Substitute for man and paid to the last drachma all
   that mighty debt which man owed to God. You saw the wounds of Jesus,
   and you understood how an angry God had all His justice satisfied in
   the agonies of His beloved Son.

   And your heart said, "There, that is the very answer I have been
   wanting. I perplexed myself, vexed myself. I had a jealousy for the
   justice of God--my conscience made me jealous for it. I had a longing
   toward the mercy of God, my heart made me long for it. Now, I see how
   righteousness and peace have kissed each other, how Justice and Mercy
   fall about each other's neck, and are reconciled forever." And your
   heart says, "This is the thing! Here is the master key which unlocks
   all the doors of doubt. The Divine finger which draws back the bolts."
   Oh, the joy and gladness with which your heart laid hold upon a
   crucified Redeemer, saying, "It is enough. I am satisfied, I am
   content. My trouble is removed." So you see it is not difficult to
   understand how the belief can be a belief of the heart.

   But I want you to notice yet further, that believing with the heart
   implies a love to the plan of salvation. I will suppose that one of
   you, today, troubled with thoughts of sin, shall go home and you shall
   reach your chamber and sit down and think over the great plan of
   salvation. You see God choosing His people from before the foundation
   of the world, and choosing them though He knew that they would be lost
   in the Fall of Adam. You see the Son entering upon a Covenant
   relationship towards them and engaging to be their Surety to redeem
   them from wrath. You see Jesus Christ in the fullness of time coming
   forth as that Surety and fulfilling all His engagements.

   You see the Spirit of God working to teach man his need, influencing
   him to accept the plan of salvation. You see the sinner washed and
   cleansed. You mark him kept and preserved, and sanctified and
   perfected--and at last brought home to Glory. While you are thinking
   over this work of the Lord, you say to yourself, "Well, I do not know
   that I have any interest in it. But what a blessed plan it is! How
   sublime! How condescending! How admirably suited to the wants of man!
   And how excellently adapted to bring out and glorify every attribute of
   God!" As you are thinking it over, there is a tear in your eye, and
   something whispers, "Why, such a plan as that must be true."

   Then, the sweet promise flashes across your mind, "Whosoever believes
   on Him shall not be ashamed." And your heart says, "Then, I will
   believe on Him. That plan is worthy of my credence. That system, so
   magnificent in its liberality, is worthy of my loving acceptance." You
   go down upon your knees and say, "Lord, by Your Grace I have seen the
   beauty of Your great work of Grace, and my soul is in love with it. I
   have no quarrel against it. I submit myself to it. Let me be a partaker
   in it. Jesus, let the virtue of Your precious blood stream on me. Let
   the power of the cleansing water, which flowed with the blood, come and
   kill the power of sin within me. 'Lord, I believe! Help You my
   unbelief!' " That is believing with the heart. It is believing because
   the heart is led to see that this must be true. And therefore, by a
   process of logic that is more subtle and more mighty in its magic
   influence than the logic of the brain, the soul, the whole mind, the
   whole powers of the man are compelled, blessedly compelled by the Grace
   of God, to yield obedience to it.

   What is true, dear Friends, of us when we commence our spiritual
   career, is true all our lives long. Soul-saving faith is always the
   belief of the heart, as well in the full grown Christian, as in the
   new-born babe. Let me appeal to some of you who have been years in
   Christ. What, my dear Brothers and Sisters, is your testimony today to
   the truth as it is in Jesus? Does your heart believe it? I think I see
   some gray-headed man rise up, and leaning upon his staff, he says, "In
   my young days I gave my heart to Christ, and I had a peace and joy such
   as I had never known before, though I had tried the pomp and vanities,
   the pleasures and allurements of sin. My heart can bear its witness to
   the peace and pleasantness which I found in religion's ways.

   "Since that time, this brow has been furrowed with many cares, and as
   you see, this head has become bleached with many winter's snows. But
   the Lord has been my heart's stay and confidence. I have rested on
   Christ and He has never failed me. When trouble has come in upon me, I
   have never been bowed down under it. By God's Grace, I have been able
   to sustain it. I have had bereavements." And he points to the many
   graves he has left behind him in the wilderness. "But I have been
   helped to bury wife and children, and faith has enabled me to say with
   bursting heart, 'the Lord gave and the Lord has taken away. Blessed be
   the name of the Lord.' I have had many conflicts, but I have always
   overcome through the blood of the Lamb.

   "I have been slandered, as all men must be, but I have taken that with
   all my other crosses upon my shoulders--and I have found it light when
   I have carried it by faith. I can say that such is the hallowed
   serenity and calm which the religion of Jesus gives to my heart at all
   times and all seasons, that I do believe it, not as a matter of head,
   but as a matter of heart. My heart is itself experimentally convicted
   that this cannot but be the religion of God, seeing that it works such
   wonders for me."

   Remember, dearly Beloved, this is the right way to believe in Jesus,
   because this is the way in which you can believe in Him when you come
   to die. You have heard of the renowned bishop, a true servant of our
   Lord and Master. On his dying bed, memory reeled. He had grown old and
   forgotten everything. His friends said to him, "Do you not know us?"
   There was a shake of the head. He had taken sweet counsel with them,
   walked to the House of God in their company, but he had forgotten them
   all. Next, the children clustered round the hoary father, and they
   begged him to remember them. But he shakes his head, he had forgotten
   them all.

   Last came his wife, and she thought, was it possible that she should be
   forgotten? Yes, he had forgotten her, and shook his head again. At
   last, one said in his ear, "Do you know the Lord Jesus Christ?" The
   response was instantaneous. That charming name, Lord, brought back
   consciousness from its innermost retreat to the more outward temple of
   the mind. "Know Him?" said he, "yes, He is all my salvation and all my
   desire." You see it was the heart that knew Jesus. And though the heart
   may know the wife and the child, yet never can the heart know the
   dearest earthly object as it knows Christ. The letters of earthly names
   may be larger than the name of Christ, but the name of Christ is cut
   deeper.

   All other names may be cut deep through many skins of the soul, if I
   may use so strange a metaphor, but that name is cut into the core,
   right into the core of the soul! He that believes with his heart, has
   Christ in him, not on him. Christ in him, the hope of Glory. My dear
   Hearers, you who have not believed in Jesus, I have tried not to puzzle
   you with refinements, but to talk in simple style. I do think it is a
   very blessed thing that the text says, "With the heart man believes,"
   because some of you might say, "I have not head enough to be a
   Christian." If you had not any head at all, if you had a loving heart
   you could believe in Jesus. You may say, "Why, I never had any very
   great natural parts." No great natural parts are wanted. You may say,
   "I never had any education," and by the way, I do like to see smock
   frocks here, I would to God that more would come--"I never had any
   education. I went to a national school and they taught me many things.
   But I do not remember them."

   Well, suppose you do not remember them. You have a heart, and some of
   you have bigger hearts than many who have let their brains swell while
   their hearts have shriveled. You can believe with your heart. Your
   heart can see that Christ is such a Christ as you want--that pardon and
   mercy are just what you require. And your heart can say, and may God
   the Holy Spirit make it say, "I accept Christ. I trust in Christ. I
   take Christ to be my All in All." This precious word, "With the heart
   man believes," sets the gate of Heaven wide open to those who are of
   the least capacity, who seem to be on the very verge of idiocy, if
   there should be such persons here. Even those who write themselves down
   as being the biggest fools that ever lived, such fools as these may
   still believe. "The wayfaring man, though a fool, shall not err
   therein."

   III. Now I must conclude, intending to take the second half of the text
   next Sunday morning, if God spares our lives. I take the most necessary
   first. You may go to Heaven without confessing--you cannot go to Heaven
   without believing. So we have the believing first, and the other can
   come next. I have to close by noticing THE RESULT of faith. "With the
   heart man believes UNTO RIGHTEOUSNESS."

   The text means that the man who believes in Christ is righteous--he is
   righteous at once, in a moment. He is righteous in the germ. When God
   makes up the account, He has two books. The one is the black book in
   which He writes down the name of the ungodly, the unrighteous. You may
   look all through that and though that man has been a thief, a
   whoremonger and adulterer. Though he has been the biggest sinner that
   ever defiled society and polluted God's air, you may look that book
   through, if that man has been led to believe with his heart--his name
   is not there among the unrighteous. You cannot find it there, it is not
   in that book.

   You must get the other. You look into the Book of Life, and there is
   the name of Noah, Daniel and Ezekiel, John the Baptist and so on. You
   say, "You do not expect to find that man's name there, do you?" I do.
   If that man believed in Jesus Christ with his heart, he has believed
   unto righteousness, and his name is there among the righteous men. For
   he is righteous, first of all, in the germ. God has put into him an
   unquenchable spark of righteousness. He has dropped into that man's
   heart a vitalizing force which never, by any possibility, can die. It
   has made him righteous in part, already, and which will go on until it
   has sanctified him, spirit, soul, and body--and made him completely
   righteous--in the real sense of the term righteous--righteous in the
   sense of holiness through the sanctification of the Spirit.

   But there is another sense. The moment the man believes in Jesus
   Christ, he is in the righteousness of Christ-- perfectly righteous. He
   has put upon him the Savior's garments. You heard Mr. Weaver say on
   this platform--I thought it was a good illustration--that one day he
   met with a very poor man who was in rags. This man, being a Christian,
   he wished to befriend him. He told him if he would go home with him, he
   would give him a suit of clothes. "So," said Richard, "I went upstairs
   and took off my second best, and put on my Sunday best, for I did not
   want to give him my best. I sent the man upstairs and told him he would
   find a suit which he could put on, it was my second best.

   "So after he had put on the clothes and left his rags behind, he came
   down and said, 'Well, Mr. Weaver, what do you think of me?' 'Well,' I
   said, 'I think you look very respectable.' 'Oh, yes, but, Mr. Weaver,
   it is not me. I am not respectable, it is your clothes that are
   respectable.' And so," added Mr. Weaver, "so is it with the Lord Jesus
   Christ. He meets us covered with the rags and filth of sin, and He
   tells us to go and put on not His second best, but the best robe of His
   perfect righteousness. And when we come down with that on, we say,
   'Lord, what do You think of me?' And He says, 'Why, you are all fair,
   My love. There is no spot in you.' We answer, 'No, it is not I, it is
   Your righteousness. I am comely because You are comely. I am beautiful
   because You are beautiful.' "

   So we may conclude by saying with Watts--

   "Strangely, my soul, are you arrayed By the great sa ved Three! In
   sweetest harmony of praise Let all your powers agree."

   All this is by believing--nothing but believing. After believing will
   come the confessing and the doing. But the saving-- the
   righteousness--rests in the believing and in nothing else--

   "Nothing, sinner, do,
   Nothing great or small;
   Jesus did it all,
   Long, long ago."

   Come to Him as He is! Take Him as your complete righteousness, and you
   will have believed with your heart unto righteousness. God add His own
   blessing, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

   [Next Sunday, Mr. SPURGEON hopes to take up the second sentence of the
   text.]

                           Confession With The Mouth

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JULY 19, 1863, BY THE REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "With the heart man believes unto righteousness. And with the mouth
   confession is made unto salvation." Romans 10:10.

   THIS morning, according to my promise, I discourse upon the second part
   of this verse--"With the mouth confession is made unto salvation." I
   feel a measure of regret that all my hearers of this morning were not
   present last Sunday, since you may wrongly imagine that I exaggerate
   the importance of outward confession. Whereas had you been present when
   we were considering the first sentence, you would have seen that I
   magnified the "believing with the heart." I declared it to be the
   all-important, the essential thing without which confession with the
   mouth would be a sin, a falsehood, and a grievous insult to the Most
   High. One circumstance greatly mitigates my fears--you may all read
   both sermons at your leisure, and so see for yourselves how earnestly I
   have labored to put the two duties in their proper place, not unduly
   exalting the less, nor depreciating the greater.

   "With the mouth confession is made unto salvation." There must be no
   confession with the mouth where there is not a believing with the
   heart. To profess a faith which you have not is to make yourself a
   deceptive trader who pretends to be carrying on a very large business,
   while he has no stock, no capital, and is only obtaining credit on
   false pretences, and so, is a thief. To make a profession, without
   having a possession, is to be a cloud without rain--a riverbed choked
   up with dry stones--utterly without water. It is to be a mere
   play-actor, strutting about for an hour with the name and garments of a
   king, to be exchanged, behind the scenes, for the garb of poverty and
   the character of shame.

   Without believing with the heart, confession is as a rotten tree, green
   on the outside, but inwardly, as John Bunyan pithily puts it, "only fit
   to be tinder for the devil's tinder box." Be you warned against fair
   pretensions where there is nothing to back them up. Above all things,
   avoid hypocrisy! Stand aside from all mere pretense. Profess not to be
   what you are not, lest in that day when God comes to search the secrets
   of all hearts you shall be condemned as reprobate silver and consumed
   like dross.

   True faith, wherever it exists, produces works. And, among the best
   works, a bold, constant, consistent confession of Christ. That man has
   no faith at all who is not led to confess with his mouth unto
   salvation, in the sense intended in the text. Faith without works is a
   dead root, sending forth no bud and yielding no fruit. It is a well
   yielding no water, but filled with deadly vapor. It is a tree twice
   dead, plucked up by the roots--like some of those forest monsters which
   block up the navigation of the Mississippi and form dangerous
   snags--upon which many a goodly vessel has been wrecked.

   Faith without works is one of the most damnable things out of Hell.
   Flee from it, for remember if you profess to have a faith in Christ,
   and your conduct is not holy, you bring disgrace upon the Church of
   Christ! You crucify the Lord of Glory afresh. You turn the Truth of God
   into a lie. And you do, as far as lies in your power, make God the
   panderer to your lusts. As you are to flee from profession without
   faith, so equally flee from a faith which does not bring forth a good
   profession which may be manifested before many witnesses.

   I believe that the confession mentioned in the text embraces the whole
   of Christian life. I do not think it means the mere saying, "I am a
   disciple of Christ," or submission to the God-ordained rite of Baptism.
   The Apostle includes, under the term, confession with the mouth, the
   whole life of the Christian--which is, in fact, the working out of that
   which God has worked in. It is the confession, both by act, deed and
   word, of that Divine Grace which God, by His Holy Spirit, has put into
   the soul. We say, in a common proverb, that, "One swallow does not make
   a summer." So the merely confessing Christ once with the mouth does not
   make the confession here intended. One tree is not a forest, and one
   avowal of Christ is not the confession of Christ unto salvation. There
   is something more intended than one act, however distinct, or however
   excellent it may be considered in itself.

   I shall endeavor this morning, if God shall help me, to illustrate the
   meaning of confessing with the mouth unto salvation. And then I shall
   occupy a few minutes in enforcing this confession--urging those who
   love the Lord and have believed with their heart, to see to it that
   they confess with their mouths.

   I. TO CONFESS CHRIST WITH THE MOUTH, I have said, embraces the whole
   lifework of the Christian. I think you will see this before I have
   done. Different cases demand of men different forms of confession. Some
   may have to confess the Lord in one way--some in another. Every
   Christian is called upon to confess Him with his mouth according to
   that way which his own state, abilities, and position in Providence may
   demand at his hands.

   1. First, then, one of the simplest and earliest forms of confessing
   Christ with the mouth is to be found in uniting in acts of public
   worship. Early--as soon as the two distinct parties of the seed of the
   woman and of the serpent were discernible, we read, "Then began men to
   call upon the name of the Lord." Those who feared not God went away to
   their various occupations--while the righteous--on the seventh day,
   gathered themselves together for prayer and praise and sacrifice.
   Anyone joining the ranks of the men who called upon the name of the
   Lord would at once be discovered, by that act, to be a servant of the
   Most High.

   Throughout the whole stream of history we find the righteous identified
   by assembling themselves together, unitedly, to send up their prayers
   and thanksgivings to the Most High. Public worship became an acceptable
   form of confession when the seed of the serpent was able to persecute
   in the times when Jeroboam set up the calves at Bethel. When any
   Israelite wended his weary way to Jerusalem under fear of being
   persecuted by his king, then the act of standing with the multitude
   that kept holyday around the courts of the temple, was at once a
   distinct confession of his allegiance to Jehovah and his abhorrence of
   all idols.

   In the Apostolic times those who believed were constant in the
   Apostle's doctrine, in breaking of bread, and in prayer. Where two or
   three were met together and especially where the greater numbers
   gathered to listen to the preaching of the Word, or for the purpose of
   breaking bread, the admission of any person to that assembly became a
   confession of his faith in the Lord Jesus, in whose name they were
   assembled.

   In the early Christian days you may see a picture something like this,
   if I know how to paint it--there is a low arch--it is foul and dark,
   like the opening of a sewer. Over it grows the briar, and from its base
   springs up the nettle and the deadly nightshade. Yonder comes a maiden,
   and creeping low, she stoops beneath the arch. In the thick darkness
   she gropes her way for several yards. No one has noticed her entrance.
   Did you observe how she looked around, lest any sentinel might perceive
   her? She hears a voice in the distant passages. That voice guides her.
   She emerges into a vault. It is one of the catacombs beneath the city
   of Rome.

   A torch renders darkness visible. No sooner does she approach the
   assembly than some watchful Brother observes her. He asks for the
   password. It is one of Caesar's household, a noble maiden who has heard
   the Gospel from her Jewish slave who waited upon her, and she has come
   to join in those secret rites which are performed by Believers in dens
   and caves of the earth. Her being there proves her a Christian. She
   would not have been there to worship God among those hunted ones, whom
   the upper earth and the pure air might not receive, if she had not
   loved the Lord.

   She would not, thus, have degraded herself, to mingle with these
   pariahs of society--those only fit to be like beasts of prey for the
   bloodhounds of Nero-- if she had not loved the Lord. Her coming there
   to join that simple hymn to one Christus, to bow her knee solemnly in
   that silent prayer to Jehovah and to His adorable Son--she had not been
   in that assembly--if she had not loved the Lord.

   Very much so was it in later times. If a man went to hear Luther, you
   might have hope of him that he was a Christian. And especially in
   England, when the Lollard preached to the handful in some remote
   farmhouse, with a watcher outside, lest the monks should come. You
   might have been pretty clear that those who worshipped thus, when death
   was the penalty, were true disciples of the Lord. Again, in the days of
   the glorious Covenant, when Cargill and Campbell opened the Bible and
   read by the lightning's flash, while the dragoons of Claverhouse were
   scenting out their prey, you might be sure, whether it was yonder
   shepherd with his dog, or yonder heritor leaning upon his gun, or
   yonder ladies sitting on the grass and listening with tearful eye to
   the fiery words of the Covenanting leader--you might be sure that they
   were for the Lord of hosts, and for His Covenant, and for the Truth as
   it is in Jesus, or else they had not met there among the saints of the
   living God at peril of their lives.

   Today it is so to a very few. There are some who, perhaps, have come
   into this house this morning whose husband's last words were, "If you
   go there, you will never enter my house again." Or, perhaps, it was the
   brother's word, as he cursed his sister for a love of the Truth of God.
   Or the father's deep, damning curse upon his child for venturing to
   believe in Christ. Your being here today is a distinct confession with
   your mouth of the Lord Jesus. But it is not so with most of you. It is
   not so with nine hundred and ninety-nine out of a thousand. Many come
   because it is the custom and more, I hope, because being Christians it
   is their delight always to come.

   They do not recognize any distinct profession of religion in the mere
   act of being here. For we mingle together, saint and sinner, godly and
   ungodly. And if this were the only profession of religion that we have
   made, it would not fulfill the intention of my text. In persecuting
   times it would--in the dark, black, bloody days it would. But not
   today, for now it is little or no confession to most of us to sit
   comfortably in our seats and listen to the preacher, and then walk down
   the stone steps and go our way.

   2. The confession of Christ which is here intended is still better to
   be carried out by a dutiful attention to those two ordinances which are
   intended by Christ to be the distinctive badge of Believers. Under the
   old Mosaic dispensation, ordinances were only for Israelites.
   Circumcision and the Passover were not for Philistines, nor for
   Egyptians--but for the seed of Abraham, and for the seed of Abraham and
   proselytes alone. It is even so under the Christian dispensation. We
   have no ordinances for aliens--we have no ordinances for strangers and
   foreigners. They are both intended for the commonwealth of Israel.

   You will remember how very carefully the ancient Believers kept up
   these ordinances. You will find that the Ethiopian eunuch traveled all
   the way from the realm of Candace in order that he might be present at
   the temple worship-- because that was the distinctive worship of the
   Jew, and of the proselyte to the Jewish faith. He would not be away.
   You remember how carefully and anxiously the heads of the Jewish
   householders saw to it that they, and all their children were present
   at the celebration of the Passover. Not one of them would neglect that
   which was distinctive of themselves as a separated people.

   Now Baptism is the mark of distinction between the Church and the
   world. It very beautifully sets forth the death of the baptized person
   to the world. Professedly, he is no longer of the world. He is buried
   to it, and he rises again to a new life. No symbol could be more
   significant! In the immersion of Believers there seems to me to be a
   wondrous setting forth of the burial of the Believer to all the world
   in the burial of Christ Jesus. It is the crossing of the Rubicon. If
   Caesar crossed the Rubicon, there would never be peace between him and
   the senate again. He draws his sword and he throws away his scabbard.
   Such is the act of Baptism to the Believer. It is the crossing of the
   Rubicon--it is as much as to say, "I cannot come back again to you. I
   am dead to you. And to prove I am, I am absolutely buried to you. I
   have nothing more to do with the world. I am Christ's and Christ's
   forever."

   Then, the Lord's Supper--how beautifully that ordinance sets forth the
   distinction of the Believer from the world in his life, and that by
   which his life is nourished. He eats the flesh of Christ, and drinks
   His blood. I marvel at some of you who love my Lord that you should
   keep away from His Table. It is His dying will--"This do you in
   remembrance of Me." It is so kind of Him to institute such an ordinance
   at all. To let us, who were as the dogs, sit at the children's table
   and eat bread such as angels never knew! I understand not, my dear
   Brother, my dear Sister, what sort of love yours can be if you hear
   Jesus say, "If you love Me, keep My commandments," and yet you neglect
   His ordinances.

   You will say they are non-essential. And I will reply to you, most
   true, they are non-essential for your salvation, but they are not
   non-essential for your comfort. Nor are they non-essential for your
   obedience. It is for a child to do what his parent bids him. If, my
   loving Friend, my dear Redeemer had bid me do something hurtful to
   myself, I would do it out of love to Him! How much more, then, when He
   says to me, "This do in remembrance of Me."

   Both these ordinances bring a cross with them to some degree,
   especially the first. I was noting, when reading yesterday, the life of
   good Andrew Fuller. After he had been baptized, some of the young men
   in the village were custom to mock him, asking him how he liked being
   dipped--and such like questions which are common enough nowadays. I
   could but notice that the scoff of a hundred years ago is still the
   scoff of today. But, Brothers and Sisters, you are not afraid, I trust,
   to be pointed at as a baptized Believer? You believe that these are His
   commands. I charge you, therefore, before God, and the elect angels
   before whom you shall be judged at the last great day--if you, with
   your hearts have believed, with your mouths make the confession which
   these ordinances imply--and God shall surely give you a sweet reward
   therein.

   3. In order to confess Christ with the mouth aright, there should be an
   association with the Lord's people. It was so in the olden times. Moses
   is an Israelite, but he may, if he wills, live in the court of Pharaoh,
   in the midst of luxury and ease. What is his choice? He goes forth to
   his Brothers and Sisters and he looks upon their burdens. He espouses
   their cause, counting the reproaches of Christ greater riches than all
   the treasures of Egypt. Moses, the reputed son of Pharaoh's daughter,
   associates with the poor despised slaves who make bricks for the king!

   What a very touching picture we have of following the people of God, in
   the history of Ruth. One is charmed to hear that godly woman saying to
   her mother-in-law, "Where you go, I will go. And where you lodge, I
   will lodge: your people shall be my people and your God my God." There
   was a confession of the God of Israel, when Ruth clave unto Naomi, with
   all her heart. Now, we find in the early times of the Christian Church,
   that as soon as a man became a Christian, he went to his own company.
   He associated with the saints. When you asked, "Where are the
   Believers?" they were found together.

   You may find other creatures wandering separately on the mountains, but
   sheep love to be in flocks. Paul was not content with being baptized,
   but after his Baptism he proceeded to join himself unto the Church. And
   we find that wherever there were people of God, they were always formed
   into a Church--whether it was at Philippi, or at Ephesus, or Pergamos,
   or Thyatira--or Rome itself, Paul everywhere formed Churches. And as he
   went from place to place, it was upon the Church that he looked as the
   pillar and ground of the Truth of God.

   I very greatly delight in the preaching in the theatres. You know how
   heartily I rejoice in the preaching of Christ anywhere. But there is a
   lack in all this labor. The corn is sown, but there is nobody to see to
   it afterwards, nobody to gather it in. The way in which all this ought
   to be carried on is not by our Associations, but by the Church. The
   Church of God is the true mother of converts. It is from her womb that
   they must be born, and at her breast they must suck, and on her knees
   must they be pampered. Those who go about and speak lightly of Church
   fellowship, and would have all Christians maintain themselves in
   separateness from the Churches, do mischief and are unwittingly the
   agents of evil. For the Church is, under God, a great blessing to the
   world. And union with the Church is intended to be a method of
   confession which is not to be neglected.

   Suppose for a moment, Brothers and Sisters, instead of the compact body
   of Believers of this one Church, we were broken into individual
   Christians and had no association with one another. I do not hesitate
   to say that some of the warmest-hearted among you would grow cold, for
   your associating with one another promotes your zeal and kindles your
   enthusiasm. The little ones among us would be subjected to I know not
   what of dangerous heresy and of false doctrine. Even the strongest
   Brother or Sister here would feel it to be a most solemn bereavement if
   they had to lose association with the Brothers and Sisters in Christ
   who now comfort and strengthen them.

   4. To some, confession with the mouth will involve the taking up of the
   cross in the family. I know of no form in which this confession is more
   delightful to God, and at the same time more arduous to men--to take up
   the cross in the family. It may be you are the first one converted in
   it, and you frequent the House of God while the rest take their
   pleasure on God's Day. You pray--the moment you kneel down in that
   chamber there is a ringing laugh within the walls. You talk of Christ
   and things Divine, and father and mother open their eyes and brothers
   and sisters all have some jest and jeer for you.

   You ask me, what are you to do? Persevere! Stand fast! Be steadfast!
   For now it is that you are to make confession with your mouth unto
   salvation. I will not believe that your faith can save you unless you
   do now unhesitatingly, at all costs, though it were at the risk of
   losing father's love and mother's care, at once say, "I cannot help
   it--I am sorry to give you any vexation, but I cannot love father or
   mother more than Christ, least I should not be worthy of Him." You must
   be willing to give up all that is near and dear to you, whoever it may
   be--though loved as your own self and precious as your own life--you
   must give all up if these stand in the way of your following Christ
   Jesus the Lord.

   "Ah, well," says one, "this is hard!" Yes, but remember for whom you do
   it! It is your Redeemer--who left His Father's court and became
   flesh--that He might be one with you. It is He who stretched His hands
   on the Cross and gave His side to the spear. Surely, all you can give
   up is but a trifle compared with what He gave up for you. Do it
   cheer-fully--do it at once!

   Young Man, be not frightened and alarmed at the family trials you have
   to endure! Ask God to make you like one of the ironclad vessels, so
   that though they shoot their fiercest bolts, and hurl them with the
   most tremendous force, yet still they will only fly off from you, not
   hurting you because you are ironclad with invincible courage and
   determined faith. The kingdom of Heaven is to you like the old city
   which had been long besieged, and there was no hope of relieving the
   inhabitants of the town unless some ship should enter the harbor. But
   there was a great chain stretched across the harbor!

   You remember how the captain, when the wind was fair and the tide was
   high, dashed against the boom, broke it and sailed into port. You must
   break the chain which threatens to keep you out of Heaven. Pray to God
   to give you much Divine Grace--that shall be like the flood tide. Much
   of the Holy Spirit--that shall be like a fair wind. And if you dash
   against the chain, it will break before your courage and determination.
   Family trials are hard to bear. A living cross is often more severe to
   carry than a dead one, but you must do it, for, "with the mouth
   confession is made unto salvation."

   5. This confession will be very acceptable if it is made in the time of
   temptation. Young Joseph has his garment seized by his wanton
   mistress--his answer is, "How can I do this great wickedness and sin
   against God?" The woman might have answered, "God? What do I know of
   Him? I know Isis. I understand the golden calf, but I know nothing of
   Jehovah--who is He?" Here was a bold, distinct confession of Joseph's
   allegiance to Jehovah as a reason why he could not sin. The case of
   Nehemiah is equally to the point. When they invite him to a secret
   conference in the temple, he says, "Can such a man as I flee?" He avows
   his confidence in his God as a reason why he cannot for a moment act
   dishonorably.

   Now Christian, here it is that you are to make confession with the
   mouth. Some dirty trick in business, which have become so common that
   nobody thinks any harm of it, comes in your way. Now, play the man and
   say, "I would rather starve than do it. I cannot, and I will not live
   by robbery, even though it should be half legalized by society." Now is
   your opportunity, young Man. When the Sunday morning comes round and
   you are pulled by the sleeve by a dozen to go with them to waste its
   holy hours, you can say, "No," and give the reason, "I cannot do it. I
   am a Christian."

   Or, it may be you have come up from the country and your friend--ah,
   your friend proposes to take you to a den of infamy, just to show you
   life. Tell him he does not understand how to cater to your appetite,
   for you are a Christian. For some ends I would prefer the declaration
   of one's faith in Jesus in the time of temptation to any other form of
   confession, since there surely can be no hypocrisy in it. Take care,
   Brothers and Sisters, that you never fail to acknowledge your Lord in
   the time of temptation.

   "Ah," says one, "I know I never shall." Do not talk too positively.
   Peter denied his Lord before a silly maid--mind you do not fall in like
   manner. It is easy to say, "I am a good sailor," when you are on shore.
   You walk the quarter-deck all right enough when the ship is in dock.
   You do not know what the storm is, how the ship rocks and the waves
   wash her decks. You had better hold your boasting till you have been to
   sea. Boast not yourself of anything you will do, but rather say, "Hold
   You me up and I shall be safe."

   6. Confession with the mouth should be carried out with double
   earnestness whenever we are called into trial for Christ's sake--when
   the avowing of Christ will bring loss upon us, or when the denial of
   His name may secure us temporary prosperity. You know in the olden
   time, how the three holy children refused to bow to the image which
   Nebuchadnezzar had set up. They could die, but they could not deny
   their God. They could burn, but they could not turn. And so, into the
   furnace they were cast, because they could not cast away their trust in
   God.

   Look at Daniel, yonder, with his open window, seven times a day
   worshipping towards Jerusalem, as he had done aforetime. It is bravely
   done. It was a bold answer of Peter and John, when the Scribes and
   Pharisees bade them speak no more in that name, "Whether it is right to
   obey God rather than man, you judge." I have noticed that whenever
   persecution rages, and men are likely to lose anything for Christ, that
   the most timid persons who are sincere, generally come out at that
   time. There is Joseph of Arimathea. You do not hear of him while Jesus
   lives.

   But when Jesus Christ's body is on the Cross, who shall go into the
   lion's den? Who shall see Pilate? Joseph of Ari-mathea begs the body of
   Jesus. He finds the sepulcher. And who shall help to wrap Him in
   spices? Why, Nicodemus, that came to Jesus Christ by night--another
   coward. They both advance and are cowardly no longer when it comes to
   the pinch. The stag takes to its heels and flies before the hounds, but
   when it comes to bay, fights with the bravery of despera- tion. So
   those who are timid, trembling Christians in ordinary times--when it
   comes to the point, come out--and are as bold as the most heroic of
   Believers.

   I would give nothing for your religion if it does not come out in
   persecution. Some of you would hide your heads if it came to
   persecution, burning, and death. Erasmus used to say he was not made of
   the right stuff to be a martyr. So, I believe, the Papists picture
   Erasmus as hanging somewhere between Heaven and Hell. And the
   Protestants need not quarrel with the portrait. He had some sort of
   knowledge of the Truth of God, but he had not the courage to openly
   acknowledge it. And he stood shivering while his friend Luther went
   straight forward and smote the triple crown upon the Pope's brow.

   Never let us be like Erasmus. "If the Lord is God, follow Him: but if
   Baal, then follow him." If the world and sin are worth living for, live
   for them with all your heart and soul and strength--but if God is God,
   do not stand questioning and halting between two opinions. But
   decidedly, boldly, positively, say, "I am on the Lord's side." There is
   no time like the time of loss and trial for the making of this
   confession.

   7. I believe, my Brothers and Sisters, that a Christian can hardly
   carry out this confession with his mouth, unless he goes a little out
   of his way at times to bear testimony. "Who is on the Lord's side? Let
   him come unto me," said Moses, when he came down from the mountain and
   broke the golden calf. "And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves
   together unto him. And he said unto them, Thus says the Lord God of
   Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from
   gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother, and
   every man his companion, and every man his neighbor."

   Every now and then we shall not be able to confess Christ unless we do
   something which shall seem harsh and strange--but which must be done
   for God and for the Truth's sake. Surely, God's Elijahs cannot be
   silent! While thousands of Baal's priests are kindling their fires, and
   calling to Baal, they must stand forth. "Are not you servants of Baal,
   and I the servant of the living God?" We shall find it needful to
   intrude upon the dainties of etiquette and trample under our feet the
   formalities which dignified society would set up. And like the Prophet
   who came to Bethel, we shall have to cry against altars at which others
   pay their vows.

   I have admired--and here I take up my cross with a good Brother--I have
   greatly admired a testimony lately borne in the assembly of the Free
   Kirk of Scotland, by my Brother, Candlish, against the inscription that
   has been placed upon the memorial erected in memory of the excellent
   Prince Albert. I have admired him for his boldness in stating what he
   thought and felt. I believe instead of a howl of indignation, he should
   have received a gift of honor. Little cares he whether he is praised or
   censured, but justice ought to be done to his courage and fidelity. He
   has pointed out the popish character of the inscription, of which I
   will venture to say that the Prince himself would abhor, could his
   peaceful spirit visit the memorial.

   If I remember rightly, Mr. Baptist Noel told us that the Prince
   exclaimed on his dying bed--

   "Nothing in my hand I bring, Simply to Your Cross I cling."

   He died a Christian, humbly clinging to the Cross of Jesus. Why is his
   monument to be dishonored by an inscription fitted for a popish saint,
   but not for one who loved the Lord Jesus Christ? There is no disloyalty
   in our expressing our opinion frankly--nor do we intend to intrude upon
   the liberty of others. A large license should be given to affection,
   and sorrow should have its own choice of words. But it is a mistake, if
   not a sin, to obtrude a papist eulogy where a Christian epitaph had
   been far more in keeping.

   I take up my cross with Candlish. And I were not true to God if I did
   not, for I believe that he who confesses Christ sometimes against the
   popular run and the popular current, is the only man who can expect to
   receive a reward from his Master for having acted faithfully in all
   things. Sometimes you will have to do this, but not always--perhaps not
   often. Go not out of your way to testify, but when the burden of the
   Lord is upon you, testify--and let none make you afraid.

   8. Again, to confess Christ with the mouth is not possible unless we
   are willing to use our position as a method of confession. Joshua is
   the head of a household. He uses that position--"As for me and my
   house, we will serve the Lord." I will not believe in your faith if you
   do not see to it that in your household God is recognized. Let the
   family altar be reared. Let the sacrifice smoke upon it. If it cannot
   be twice, let it be once in the day. But see to it that you pay your
   vows unto the Most High in that position, or else you have not made a
   confession unto salvation.

   Or it may be you have influence where you can help Christ's Church.
   Mind that you do it. Esther is the queen of Ahasuerus. If she refuses
   to declare herself a Jewess--if she does not make the quarrel of Israel
   against Haman, her own quarrel--then she shall be safe. She has come to
   the kingdom for such a time as this. Some of you are large employers,
   or you may happen to be members of Parliament, or you are in spheres
   where you have power very much to influence the minds of other men. See
   that you do it for God. For all that influence is so much money given
   to you to put out to interest for your Lord and Master. And if you bury
   it in a napkin, or only use it for yourself, in the last great day he
   will say to you, "You wicked and slothful servant, you shall be cast
   away to the tormentors."

   9. Once more. There are some men who never will confess the Lord Jesus
   with their mouths as they ought to do unless they become preachers.
   David said he had preached the Word before the great congregation. And
   he makes it his boast that he had not shunned to declare it before
   kings. Now there are some of you who have ability to speak, but you
   never do. All the whole length of London streets await you as a pulpit.
   The whole population of London is ready to be your audience. Why do you
   not begin to speak? You can talk on politics. The other evening, at the
   literary institution, I understand you read a capital paper upon some
   astronomical subject.

   If you love the Lord Jesus, are you going to give all your attention to
   these inferior themes? No, at least sometimes give it to Him who bought
   you with His blood. "You are not your own, for you are bought with a
   price." Mind, then, that your speech be as much Christ's as any other
   thing which you possess. Speak for your Lord and Master. You tell me
   you are nervous. Never mind your nervousness. Try once. If you break
   down half a dozen times, try again. You shall find your talents
   increase. It is wonderful how those breakdowns do more good than our
   keeping on. Just deliver your soul of what is in it. Get your heart red
   hot, and then like some volcano that is heaving in its inner heart, let
   the hot lava of your speech run streaming down.

   You need not care for the graces of oratory, nor for the refinements of
   eloquence, but speak what you know. Show them your Savior's wounds--bid
   His sorrow speak to them--and it shall be marvelous how your stammering
   tongue shall be all the better an instrument because it does stammer!
   For God "has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things
   which are mighty. And base things of the world, and things which are
   despised, has God chosen, yes, and things which are not, to bring to
   nothing things that are."

   You see, Brothers and Sisters, this confession of Christ with the mouth
   is a lifework. The Christian man is to be something like a physician.
   You know we call a physician a professional man. Well, how does he
   profess? There is a large brass plate on his door, and a big bell, and
   everybody knows what the brass plate and the bell mean. That is part of
   his profession. What else? How does he profess to be a physician? He
   goes into company and his dress is like anybody else's. You do not see
   a box of lancets hanging at his side. You do not observe that he is
   dressed in any peculiar costume. He is a physician and he is always a
   physician, but his profession is carried on by his practice.

   This is how a Christian's profession is to be carried on--by his
   practice. The man is a physician, professionally, because he really
   does heal people and write prescriptions, and attend to their wants. I
   am to be a Christian in my actions, my deeds, my thoughts, my words.
   Therefore, if anybody wants a Christian, I should be known by my words
   and my acts.

   When we used to go to school we would draw houses, and horses, and
   trees on our slates, and we remember how we used to write "house" under
   the house, and "horse" under the horse, for some persons might have
   thought the horse was a house. So there are some people who need to
   wear a label round their necks to show that they are Christians at all,
   or else we might mistake them for sinners, their actions are so alike.

   Avoid that. Let your profession be manifest by your practice. Be so
   clearly a piece of Divine painting that the moment a man puts his eye
   upon you, he says, "Yes, that is the work of God. That is a Christian,
   the noble work of God."

   II. I have only one or two minutes to give a few words of exhortation.
   Dear Friends, see that you confess Christ with your mouth. Do not make
   excuses, for NO EXCUSE YOU CAN MAKE WILL BE VALID. You will lose your
   business, you say! Lose it and gain your soul. You will be
   unfashionable! What is it to be fashionable? You will be despised by
   those who love you! Do you love husband or wife more than Christ? If
   so, you are not worthy of Him. But you are so timid! Mind you are not
   so timid as to be lost at last, for the fearful and unbelieving shall
   have their portion in the lake that burns--not those who fear and
   sometimes doubt their interest in Christ--but those who are afraid to
   confess Christ before men.

   You know that in the silence of the sick or dying hour, no excuse,
   however specious it may appear today, will answer your conscience. And
   if it will not answer your conscience, depend upon it, it will not
   satisfy God. In the next place, remember how dishonorable it is in you
   to say you believe with the heart and yet not to make confession. You
   are like a rat behind the paneling, coming out just now and then when
   nobody is looking, and then running behind again.

   "What a degrading metaphor," you say. I meant to degrade you by it, so
   as to drive you out of your cowardice. What? Is Christ to be treated
   like this, as if the name of Christ were a thing to be avowed in
   skulking holes and corners? No, in the face of the sun let it be said,
   "I love Jesus, who gave Himself for me." It is not a thing to be said
   alone, nor to be hidden from the ears of men. He died in the face of
   the sun, with mockers round about Him. And with mockers round about us
   let us declare our faith in Jesus Christ, the Lord!

   How honorable, on the other hand, will the confession be to you. If I
   had to join an army and I found on the muster roll a list of
   ragamuffins and the scrapings of the street, I do not think I should
   like to be a soldier. But if, on the other hand, I found my colonel a
   great conqueror, and that I had for compeers and comrades men who had
   some glorious names upon their banners, I should feel honored by being
   allowed to be a drummer boy in such a regiment. So when I read the list
   and find Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, Daniel, Isaiah--Jesus
   Christ Himself--the Apostles, Luther, Calvin and men whose names have
   become household words in every Christian family, I count it an honor
   if my name shall be found written with theirs, as the most humble and
   feeblest soldier in the whole army.

   It is an honorable thing. Therefore, cast in your lot with us and be
   prepared to be despised as a follower of the Lord Jesus Christ. I urge
   this upon you, because it will make you useful. What is the good of a
   secret Christian? He is a candle under a bushel. He is a light shut up
   in a dark lantern. Let your light shine. What is the good of a secret
   Christian? He is salt without savor. And what is he fit for but to be
   trampled under foot of men? Come, let the savor of your salt be felt
   throughout the world. Grace is sufficient. That is another argument for
   you. You think you will have fresh responsibilities and dangers if you
   make a confession. Grace is sufficient.

   If Divine Grace puts you upon a pinnacle of the temple, depend upon it,
   Divine Grace will keep you there. If you get off the pinnacle and come
   down on the hard ground, you will be unsafe there. But if God puts you
   on the pinnacle, let all the devils in Hell come to push you down, you
   shall stand fast. Be not disobedient and choose your own way--take
   God's way and you are safe in it.

   Lastly, the reward is splendid. "He that confesses Me before men, him
   will I confess before My Father which is in Heaven." There was a Prince
   of right royal blood who once upon a time left his Father's palace and
   journeyed into a distant part of the king's dominions where he was
   little known and cared for. He was a true Prince, and he had about his
   face those princely marks--that strange divinity which does hedge a
   king, that might have made the onlooker know that he was right royal.
   But when he came into the place, the people said, "This is the heir to
   the throne. Let us insult him, let us hoot him!"

   Others said he was no heir at all. And they agreed to set him in the
   pillory. As he stood there, every man did pelt him with all kinds of
   filth and used all manner of hard words towards him. And they said,
   "Who dares acknowledge him for a Prince? Who dares stand by him?" There
   stood up one from the crowd and said, "I dare!" They set him up in the
   pillory side by side with the Prince. And when they threw their filth
   on the Prince, it fell on him. And when they spoke hard words of the
   Prince they spoke hard words of him. He stood there, smiling and
   received it all.

   Now and then a tear stole down his cheek. But that was for them, that
   they should thus ill-treat their sovereign. Years went by. The king
   came into those dominions and subdued them. And there came a day of
   triumph over the conquered city--streamers hung from every window and
   the streets were strewn with roses. There came the king's troops
   dressed in burnished armor of gold, with plumes upon their glittering
   helmets. The music rang right sweetly, for all the trumpets of glory
   sounded. It was from Heaven they had come!

   The Prince rode through the streets in his glorious chariot. And when
   he came to the gates of the city, there were the traitors all bound in
   chains. They stood before him trembling. He singled out from among the
   crowd one man, only, who stood free and unfettered, and he said to the
   traitors, "Know you this man? He stood with me in that day when you
   treated me with scorn and indignation. He shall stand with me in the
   day of my glory. Come up here!" said he. And amidst the sounding of
   trumpets and the voice of acclamation, the poor, despised and rejected
   citizen of that rebellious city rode through the streets in triumph,
   side by side with his King, who clothed him in purple and set a crown
   of pure gold upon his head.

   There is the parable! By the Grace of God, live it out! Amen.

                            The Power Of Aaron'S Rod

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JULY 26, 1863, BY THE REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods." Exodus 7:12.

   WE shall not attempt to discuss the question as to whether these
   magicians actually did turn their rods into serpents or not. It is
   probable that they, by dexterous sleight of hand, substituted living
   serpents for dry rods and so deceived the eyes of Pharaoh. On the other
   hand, it is possible that God was pleased to permit the devil to aid
   their enchantments, and so the old serpent produced a brood. But into
   that question, I say, I shall not enter. It is of no importance which
   opinion we may hold. Curious questions must this morning give way to
   important Truths of God.
   I call your attention to the fact that Aaron's rod proved its
   Heaven-given superiority and silenced all the boastings of Jannes and
   Jambres by readily swallowing up all their rods. This incident is an
   instructive emblem of the sure victory of the Divine handiwork over all
   the opposition of men. Whenever a Divine thing is cast into the heart,
   or thrown upon the earth, it swallows up everything else. And though
   the devil may fashion a counterfeit and produce swarms of opponents, as
   sure as ever God is in the work, it will swallow up all its foes.
   "Aaron's rod swallowed up all their rods."

   Without any preface, let me ask you, first of all, to observe this
   fact. When we have duly considered it, let us, in the second place,
   draw an inference from it. And then, in closing, let me endeavor to
   show some reasons why it is right that it should be so.

   I. Let us turn aside to see this great sight--the Divine triumphant
   over the diabolical--the spiritual subduing the natural--AARON'S ROD
   SWALLOWING ALL ITS RIVALS.

   1. Let us take the case of the awakened sinner. That man was, a few
   days ago, as worldly, as carnal, as impassive as he well could be. If
   anyone should propose to make that man heavenly-minded, to lead him to
   set his affection upon things above, and not on things on the earth,
   the common observer would say, "Impossible! The man has no thought
   above what he shall eat, and what he shall drink, and how he shall be
   clothed--his heart is buried in a grave of cares. He rises early. He
   sits up late. He eats the bread of carefulness. He is glued and
   cemented to the world--as in old Roman walls, the cement has become so
   strong that the stone is no longer a separate piece, but has become a
   part of the wall itself--so this man is cemented to the world. He
   cannot be separated from it. You must break him in pieces with the
   hammer of death. You cannot separate him in any other way from the
   cares of life.

   Ah, but Aaron's rod shall swallow up this rod. The man listens to the
   Word. The Truth of God comes with power into his soul. The Holy Spirit
   has entered him. And the next day, though he goes to his business, he
   finds no true contentment in it, for he pants after the living God.
   Though still he will buy and sell and gain, yet there is a craving
   within--an awful hunger--a thirst unquenchable--which above the din and
   clamor of the world's traffic, will be heard crying, "Seek you first
   the kingdom of God and His righteousness." Now his spirit pleads its
   needs, and outstrips the body in the contest for his warmest love. He
   spurns the trifles of a day--he seeks the jewels of eternity. The
   groveling swine which wallowed in worldliness is transformed into an
   eagle. The man who lived for this shadowing earth has now an eye for
   the upper spheres and a wing to mount into celestial heights. Divine
   Grace has won the day and the worldling seeks the world to come.

   It may be that the man is immersed in pleasure. He is at this theater
   and at that. In all gay society he bears the palm. You shall find him
   at every horserace and fighting ring--ah, and worse still, you may
   track him to dens of licentiousness and learn that he is diving deeper
   than others in the turbid streams of vice. What power can make this gay
   sinner become a saint? As well ask over a moldering grave, "Can these
   dry bones live?"--how shall he find joy in the praise of God, or
   interest in waiting upon the worship of the Most High?

   "Absurd!" cries Unbelief, while Worldliness shouts, "Ridiculous!" The
   man is too far gone for regeneration! He is married to pleasure and he
   wears the ring upon his finger! Yes, but Aaron's rod can swallow up
   this rod. For we have seen such a man loathe the very joys he loved
   till there was no charm in the music of sin--no mirth in the society of
   folly. He fled away to hide himself. He sought seclusion that he might
   weep alone. Where are now the sweetness of your bowls and the melody of
   your viols? Where now the charms of the earth's harlotry? Where now the
   giddy delights of chambering and wantonness? They are gone, for Aaron's
   rod has swallowed up these rods of the magicians, and the mad sinner is
   sitting yonder--a penitent at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his
   right mind.

   His companions follow him. With many weighty reasons, as they seem to
   think, they invite his return. They plead with him not to make a fool
   of himself by joining those melancholy fanatics. They point out the
   faults of many professors. They remark that hypocrisies are common.
   They describe the inconsistencies of good men. And they say, "What?
   Will you throw away the joviality of youth, the bloom and flush of
   life, to be united with a miserable band of enthusiasts and deceivers
   like these?" Then they insinuate cunning doubts. They thrust into the
   man's way certain strange things, of which he had never heard before,
   which startle him like thunder, and almost drive him from his purpose.
   If God's Grace is in him, the world's best magicians may throw down all
   their rods--and every rod may be as cunning and as poisonous as a
   serpent--but Aaron's rod will swallow up their rods.

   The sweet attractions of the Cross will woo and win the man's heart.
   The blessed arguments, fetched from the bleeding wounds of Jesus, will
   answer all the blandishments of Madam Wanton and the reason of her
   sister, Madam Bubble. Everything shall be set aside when true religion
   comes in. The man shall have a longing so intense that he cannot stop
   it, nor can he stop himself from obedience to it--a longing after
   pardon by blood and salvation by Divine Grace.

   Oh, have you not seen the trembling penitent, when under conviction of
   sin, apparently oblivious to everything else? How changed the man! The
   furrows of that brow prophesy a harvest of hope. Tears, those jewels of
   repentance, bedeck his eyes. He is dressed in the sackcloth and ashes
   which are the court robes of those blessed mourners who shall be
   comforted. For a season even righteous joys yield him no solace. The
   comforts of his household, and the enjoyments of the fireside fail to
   reach his case. There is no balm in Gilead for him--Heaven alone can
   supply him a fit physician. His cry has become, "These can never
   satisfy! Give me Christ, or else I die."

   You have marked the stag when it is let down for a royal hunt. Away it
   flies. The dogs are behind it. It flies over flowery meads but it does
   not pause to smell the fragrance of the dale. It dashes along the wood
   but it waits not for shelter beneath yon shady oak! It scatters the
   sparkling waters of the brook, but it scarce has time to bathe its
   limbs. Onward, up the hill, the scenery is grand. But those wild eyes,
   starting from its head, is solaced by no sight of beauty. The birds are
   singing sweetly in yonder thicket, but those startled ears are not
   comforted. The bay of the dog is all the noble victim hears. The wrath
   of the hunter is all it dreads.

   On--on--on it flies, panting for life. Such is the soul hunted by the
   dogs of conscience. Such is the awakened spirit, when the wrath of God
   is let loose upon it. No comforts can charm it. No joys can delight it.
   It flies on--on--on-- resting never until it finds a shelter and
   deliverance in the clefts of the Rock of Ages. It is in vain that Satan
   tries to attract it from the one master thought. The Divine life must
   and will have its course. As some lofty mountain casts its shadow all
   along the valley, so a sense of condemnation throws its dark influence
   over the whole life. Then follows a longing for mercy, which, like a
   swollen torrent, bears all before it.

   To use another illustration--the man has found the pearl of great price
   and for joy thereof he parts with all to buy it. No matter how dear the
   old ancestral homestead, it must be sold. The favorite horse. The
   faithful dog--all must go. He will sell his dearest joys, and his most
   prized luxuries of sin, that he may buy this priceless, peerless pearl.
   Aaron's rod swallows up all other rods, and serpents, too.

   2. Beloved, the same fact, with equal distinctness, is to be observed
   in the individual when he becomes a Believer in Jesus Christ--his faith
   destroys all other confidences. Once that man could trust in his
   self-righteousness. He was rich and increased in goods and had need of
   nothing. He was honest. Who could say that he ever fraudulently failed
   in business, or robbed a creditor? For integrity he boasted that none
   could say he lacked the highest. He was, moreover, kind and
   charitable--amiable in his deportment and tender in heart towards the
   poor. He trusted that if any man went to Heaven by his merits, he
   should.

   But where is that rod now? Lo, Aaron's rod has swallowed it up. For now
   that man can say with the Apostle Paul, "But what things were gain to
   me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yes doubtless and count all things
   but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord:
   for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but
   dung, that I may win Christ. And be found in Him, not having my own
   righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith
   of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith."

   The man once could rely upon ceremonies. Was he not sprinkled in
   infancy in the customary manner? Was he not confirmed afterwards by
   Episcopal hands? Did he not receive the blessed sacrament of the Lord's
   Supper? What more was wanted? He was regular at his Church, or punctual
   at his Chapel. He paid the contribution expected of him, and perhaps a
   little more. He had family prayers and went through a private form at
   his bedside. What more did he want? But Aaron's rod swallows this up,
   too. For all our righteousnesses are but as filthy rags.

   This is the cry of the man now--"God forbid that I should glory, save
   in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ." My Hearers, you are no
   Christians unless your faith in Christ has devoured every other
   confidence--unless you can say--

   "On Christ, the solid Rock I stand! All other ground is sinking sand."
   It is not to trust Christ, and to trust self. To rely on Jesus
   somewhat, and then upon our prayers, and our works to some degree.
   Jesus ONLY must be your watchword. Christ will never have a partner. He
   trod the winepress alone, and He will save you alone. He stretched His
   hands on the Cross and none but He could bear the burden of sin--nor
   will He divide the work of salvation, lest at the last He should have
   to divide the crown. The rod of the one only High Priest must swallow
   up all other rods.

   My dear Friends, what multitudes of foes has our faith had to meet
   with! But how it has swallowed them all up! There were our old sins.
   The devil threw them down before us and they turned to serpents. What
   hosts of them! What multitudes! How they hiss in the air! How they
   intertwine their many coils. How horrible are their deadly fangs, the
   gaping jaws, their forked tongues! Ah, but the Cross of Jesus, like the
   rod of Amram's son, destroys them all. Faith in Christ makes short work
   of all our sins, for it is written, "The blood of Jesus Christ His Son
   cleans us from all sin."

   Then the devil stirs up another generation of vipers and shows us our
   inbred corruptions, our neglect of duty, our slackness in prayer, our
   unbelief, our backslidings, our wanderings of heart. And sometimes you
   and I get so tormented by these reptiles that we grow alarmed and are
   half inclined to flee. Do not run, Brother, but throw down Aaron's rod
   and it will swallow up all these serpents, even though they were
   poisonous as the cobra, fierce as the rattlesnake, or huge as the
   python. You shall overcome through the blood of the Lamb. "Jesus is
   able to save to the uttermost them that come unto God by Him."

   The battle is the Lord's, and He will deliver them into your hands. The
   old enemy will throw down another host of serpents in the form of
   worldly trials, diabolical suggestions, temptations to blasphemy, ill
   thoughts of God, hard thoughts of His Providence, rash thoughts of His
   promises, and such like till you will be almost distracted. You will
   wonder how you can meet such a host as this. Remember to stand fast and
   throw down Aaron's rod--your simple trust and faith in Jesus
   Christ--and it must, and shall, swallow up all these rods. There is not
   one doubt which the craft of Hell can insinuate--there is not one
   difficulty which the infernal wisdom of Diabolus can suggest--but
   simple faith in Christ can disarm, tread under foot, and utterly
   destroy.

   On a certain railroad there is a viaduct. The arches are of
   considerable height. Wooden centers, of course, were used for the
   building of these arches and they remain there till this day because
   there is some suspicion that if the wooden centers were knocked out,
   the brick arches might not be strong enough and might come tumbling
   down. Now, there are some professors whose faith is of that kind--it is
   supported by wooden centers of human persuasion, reasoning, or
   ex-citement--which they cannot afford to lose. But the Christian man
   can say that if by Providence all the earthly props of his confidence
   should fail. If feelings, graces, and excitements were all gone--still
   the Cross, alone, is an all-sufficient dependence--and faith could bear
   the most terrible strain which earth or Hell could put upon it.

   I would to God we were more and more possessed of that faith which
   leans on God, and God, alone. For remember, the faith which is
   supported by anything except the Word and promise of God is no faith at
   all. It is a bastard faith which has the Cross for a buttress, but
   finds its foundation elsewhere. The Cross must be the foundation,
   cornerstone, and but- tress, too. None but Jesus! None but Jesus! We
   need to have a faith which can endure every form of trial and as long
   as life lasts.

   One day last week, when I was preaching, it began to rain. A gentleman
   asked why the largest Chapel in the neighborhood could not be used for
   the occasion? The reply was, "Why, the galleries are not safe." I
   thought, "what was the good of galleries into which they were afraid to
   let the people?" Pull them down and get fresh ones! So there are some
   people who have a faith like that good-for-nothing gallery. It is not
   safe. It will not sustain a crowd of afflictions and temptations,
   difficulties, and troubles. It would all come down with a crash in the
   day of trial, and great would be the fall of it.

   Brethren, if you have such a faith as I have described, pray God to
   take it away. It is worthless and dangerous. For remember, in the hour
   of death, if it cannot stand the tramp of the eternal feet, it will
   give way--and your everlasting ruin will be the result. Have a faith
   which is built upon God, which will bear whatever comes. But mind you,
   mix not with it wood, hay, stubble of your own gathering. Let Aaron's
   rod swallow up all other rods. Let your faith in Christ overturn every
   refuge of lies.

   3. The same fact is very manifest after faith in all who truly love the
   Savior. It will be found, I am sure, that every true lover of Jesus has
   an all-consuming love--coals of juniper--which have a most vehement
   flame. They who love Christ aright, love no one in comparison with Him.
   The husband is dear. The father is cherished. The children are
   precious. But after all, Jesus Christ is better than all kin. We can
   look upon all and say, "Yes, it were a bitter pang to lose you, but we
   would sooner lose you all ten times over than once lose our Savior."

   For, oh, if we lose Him, we have lost all, even if all else remained.
   But if all is gone and we still keep our Savior, we have all in Him.
   The Christian, as he loves nothing in comparison, so he loves nothing
   in contradiction to Christ. Whatever comes between him and his Savior,
   the true lover of Jesus abhors and rejects in a moment. He holds no
   deliberation or debate about the matter. He counts that vile, which,
   precious in itself, becomes evil through interposing between him and
   his Lord--

   "The dearest idol I have known, Whatever that idol be"-- though it is a
   golden idol--though it be myself--whatever that idol is--

   "Help me to tear it from its throne, And worship only You."

   The Christian's love to Christ is of such a kind that he would forego
   honor and think it honor to be dishonored for Christ. Persecution's
   flame cannot, by any means, consume bands of union which unite his soul
   and his Lord. Through fire and through water this love can march. For,
   "many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it." That
   is not true love to Jesus which governs only one part of the man out of
   twenty. It must be all the passions bound into one. This is the reason
   why our Apostle does not say, "Set your affections on things above."
   But, "Set your affection on things above." Tie up the affections in one
   bundle. There is not to be a host of them. They are to be made into
   one. Bind them into a bundle of camphire and then offer them to your
   Beloved Jesus.

   Oh, if I pretend to love Christ and have other lovers, too--He cares
   not for such a heart as mine--it must be an undivided heart. "Their
   heart is divided. Now shall they be found faulty," said Hosea. "Unite
   my heart to fear your name," cried the Psalmist, and let each of us
   pray so, too. "My Beloved is mine and I am His." Let that be without
   any sort of reserve. Let the giving up of ourselves to Christ, and the
   taking of Christ to ourselves be done heartily and earnestly, with all
   the powers of the soul.

   This love to Christ reminds me of the fire which fell of old upon
   Elijah's sacrifice--there stood the altar made of twelve rough stones.
   On it lay the bullock and the wood--and over all the Prophet had poured
   water, until it saturated the bullock, and stood in the trenches. But
   when the fire came down from Heaven, it devoured not only the wood, and
   the sacrifice, but the very stones of the altar--and licked up the
   water from the trenches. So when this heavenly fire of love comes down
   upon our hearts in very deed and truth, it not only burns the sacrifice
   and the wood--our own true intentions and our renewed heart--but the
   stones, the very flesh that seemed as dull and cold as a stone!

   Yes, and those old corruptions which seemed to quench the fire of
   Divine Grace like water--this love licks the whole up, and the whole
   man goes up to Heaven--a living sacrifice unto God. "My heart and my
   flesh," said the Psalmist, "cry out for the living God." I used to
   wonder however he made his flesh to do it, for the flesh lusts against
   the Spirit. But there are times when Aaron's rod does swallow up all
   other rods, and even the heart and the flesh cry out for the living
   God. Our love to Jesus should be like the love of David to Jonathan and
   of Jonathan to David. As Jonathan was ready to take off both his sword,
   and his bow, and his girdle, and give them to David, so should we make
   no reserve--our selfishness being swallowed up--giving to Jesus all
   that we are and all that we have evermore.

   I have heard of one good man who carried out to the letter this love to
   Christ. He was rich. He prospered much in business. A very sincere
   friend who might take great liberties called upon him and said, "My
   dear Brother, you are so prosperous that I am afraid lest your heart
   should depart from God." The other replied, "No, my Brother, I thank
   you for the warning, but I am not in that danger, for I enjoy God in
   everything." Years went on--riches took to themselves wings and fled
   away. The rich man was brought to the depths of poverty. He even knew
   what it was to want bread. The same friend came to see him and he said,
   "My dear Brother, you remember what I said to you in your prosperity?
   Now, I am afraid, lest in your adversity, you should grow unbelieving
   and so dishonor your Lord." But the other said, "Dear Brother, I thank
   you for your warning as I said before, but I am not in danger, for
   before I enjoyed God in everything, and now I enjoy everything in God."

   Oh, this is a sweet way of living, when our love to Christ is such that
   we find Christ in everything. We see the marks of His pierced hands on
   our daily bread. We see the blood mark upon the garments which we wear.
   It is good, too, when suffering and wanting times shall come, to find
   we are rich because we have Christ and can sing--

   "You, at all times, will I bless;
   Having You, I all possess;
   How can I bereaved be,
   Since I cannot part with You?"

   4. Brethren, you will notice this in the man who makes his delight in
   the Lord Jesus. He who makes his delight in Christ after a true sort
   will discover that this delight swallows up all other delights. There
   is none equal to this. The Christian man enjoys himself as others do.
   He is not denied the sweets of this life any more than another man. But
   to him all these things are brown bread. He has eaten manna from
   Heaven! His mouth has tasted angels' food! And he feels that the
   choicest mirth and delight his soul can know in all the bounties of
   God's rich Providences are mere ashes compared with what he finds in
   Christ. His delight in Christ is of such a kind that nothing can stop
   it.

   In disease he still rejoices in his God, who makes his bed in his
   sickness. When he comes to die, that last of foes cannot interrupt the
   music of his soul. "My soul shall make her boast in the Lord," he has
   said. And he carries out his vow. He has little to delight in besides.
   But he has more delights than those who have all the world. Though he
   were rich as Solomon, and had singing men, and singing women, and
   gardens, and houses and chariots and all manner of delights, he would
   not be so contented as he is with Christ, and with his Christ, alone.

   I speak experimentally--I who am but a babe in Christ, even I know that
   there is such joy to be found in Jesus. Such rapture, such
   ecstasy--what shall I say?--such Heaven to be found in His dear name
   and in communion with Him, that if I could have but five minutes of my
   Lord's company, I would sooner have it than a whole year of the society
   of princes rolling in wealth and exalted in fame. One glance of His
   eyes outshines the sun. The beauties of His face are fairer than all
   flowers. There is no such fragrance as in the breath of His mouth. "Let
   Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth: for Your love is better than
   wine."

   5. Yet more is it so in a man who is devoted to God's service. The
   service of God swallows up everything else when the man is truly God's
   servant. When a man gets fully possessed with an enthusiastic love for
   Jesus and there is no other love worth a moment's care, difficulties to
   him become only things to be surmounted. Dangers become honors,
   sacrifices pleasures, sufferings delights, weariness rest. Life he
   looks upon but as a loan and gives it back to Jesus Christ with
   interest. Look in the olden times how the martyrs despised death.
   Aaron's rod swallowed up the terrors of fire, and stake, and rack, and
   dungeon.

   Poverty, nakedness, peril, sword--the love of Christ made short work of
   these. In later days, in the Reformer's times, to meet the score of the
   multitude and the wrath of princes, was a thing of every day. They
   laughed at all sufferings for the love of Jesus. Today some of our
   missionary Brothers and Sisters prove the same fact. Williams staining
   Ero-manga with his blood. Knibb spending a weary life in the midst of
   his swarthy Brothers and Sisters. Moffat at this hour cut off from
   contact with those whom he holds dear, pressing on in the work of
   saving the Bechuana and the Bushman.

   These men and men like them of whom the world is not worthy prove that
   the love of Jesus will swallow up everything else.

   I hope there are some in this Church in whom the service of Christ has
   become the main object of their lives. If you stand up and preach in
   the streets, and you are mocked at, Aaron's rod will swallow up all the
   ribaldry of scoffers. You can bear all that, and rejoice in it! If you
   go home and find persecutors there, you can patiently endure their
   cruel mockery. Aaron's rod will swallow up that rod very speedily.
   Perhaps you have to lose customers by closing your shop on Sunday.
   Perhaps friends forsake you because of your godly walk. Perhaps
   adversaries gather round you and say spiteful things of you because
   Jesus is yours. Aaron's rod will swallow up those rods.

   I would to God there were more Christians, however, in whom all their
   business cares and their worldly pursuits were subjugated and
   subservient to their devotion to their Master. For he is not a
   Christian of any standing who lives for anything but to extend the name
   of Christ and to spread His kingdom among the sons of men.

   Brethren, we are waiting for the time in which my text shall have a
   more splendid significance than I can give it just now. In every
   neighborhood wherever Christ's Truth is preached, like Aaron's rod it
   swallows up all the serpents of sin. Go to the dark alleys in London,
   take Jesus Christ there and Aaron's rod shall swallow up the rods of
   ignorance, vice, and ungodliness. Go to popish countries--spread the
   Bible--let the name of Jesus Christ be proclaimed and there is no lie
   of the Pope which the Cross cannot overcome. Go to the heathen land,
   where Juggernaut sits in bloody contentment on his throne. Or go to the
   islands of the South Seas, or to Africa's wondrous plains! Wherever you
   go, cast down Aaron's rod, and whatever the form of superstition or
   error, it shall swallow all up.

   Wait yet a little while, when from eastern coast to western, one song
   shall be heard, the Hallelujah to the Lord-- when Jesus' name shall be
   exalted, and every knee shall bow--and every tongue shall confess that
   He is Lord. Then admiring angels looking from the battlements of
   Heaven, or flying down and mingling with the sons of earth, shall
   rejoice to see that Jannes and Jambres, who withstood Moses, were not
   more totally defeated than the foes of Christ shall be when Aaron's rod
   shall swallow up their rods and the chorus shall be heard, "Hallelujah,
   Hallelujah, the Lord God Omnipotent reigns!"

   II. WE NOW DRAW AN INFERENCE. If it is so, that wherever true
   religion--the finger of God--comes into a man it becomes a consuming
   passion till the zeal of God's house eats the man up--then there are
   many persons who profess religion who cannot have found the right
   thing. I will picture you one or two of them. There are some who sit
   and listen to the Gospel and who somewhat delight in its doctrines.
   They feel an attachment to the Truth and find some degree of comfort in
   it. But the one thing they think of is how they shall scrape together
   money--how they shall, by some means or other, fill their bank account.

   As for God's House, though it has many claims, it is looked upon as a
   nuisance when it once entrenches upon their pocket. They give--well,
   what per cent do they give of their incomes? So small is the fraction
   that we will not waste our time in calculating it. I dare say they give
   as much as their religion is worth. We have heard of one who said that
   his religion did not cost him above a quarter of a dollar a year. And
   somebody said he thought it was very dear at that price. I dare say
   most people are pretty good judges of what their religion is worth and
   their payment for its support may be taken as a fair estimate.

   Those who are mean, miserly and miserable in the cause of Christ--whose
   only expenditure is upon self--and whose main object is gain, what can
   we say of them? Why, that they look upon religion as some great farmers
   do upon their little off-hand farms. They think it is well to have a
   little religion. They can turn to it for amusement sometimes, just to
   ease them a little of their cares. Besides, it may be very well, after
   having had all in this world, to try to get something in the next. They
   are not honest people. Serving the devil all their lives, the devil has
   a sort of deferred interest in them and will no doubt see to his
   claims. But, instead of doing justice, they want to cheat him at the
   last. No doubt, in the end, they will have their due. There are many of
   these in our Churches with whom we can find no fault in other respects.
   They are moral and decent in all ways. They can pray very nicely in
   Prayer Meetings, yet they never dream of consecrating their secular
   employments unto God. Aaron's rod, in their case, has never swallowed
   up their rods.

   I heard of a minister, who, having need to have a Chapel built, told
   the collector to call upon a certain person. The collector said, "Oh,
   he will not give anything. He never gives anything." "Well," said the
   minister, "if he gives as he prays, I should think he would give all he
   has!" So the collector called. "Well," the gentleman replied, "really,
   he had so many calls." You know all the fibs which are customary on
   such occasions. He would give nothing. So the collector said, "Sir, our
   minister said if you were to give as you pray, he thought you would
   give a large amount." Well, that touched his conscience. "Our minister
   said, he thought when you prayed, you would give yourself away."

   There are many who say that who are a long way from meaning to carry it
   practically out. But give me the man who, with all worldly discretion,
   feels that it is as much his business to get money for God, as it is
   mine to preach for God. He sells his calicoes, his slabs of meat, his
   earthenware, or his groceries, for Christ, as truly as I come upon this
   platform to speak for Christ. He sanctifies his ordinary calling to the
   cause of Christ and makes himself the Lord's servant in everything,
   saying, "Here, Lord, I give myself to You. It is all that I can do."

   I am afraid the inference I am to draw from what I have already said,
   is that those who love the world have a religion they had better get
   rid of. There are other persons who profess to be Christians, but who
   spend all the week round without ever brushing against their religion.
   They expect it to call upon them as the postman does, at regular hours.
   It may wake them up on Sunday morning, but it must mind it does not
   intrude upon the Monday. What are the books they read? Those yellow
   volumes of one shilling or two shilling trash which abound at the
   railway bookstalls?

   What is their talk about? Well, anything you like, except what it
   should be. What do they do during the week? Oh, they do twenty things.
   But what do they attempt for Christ? Do for Christ, Sir? With what
   surprise they look at you, when you ask them that question! What did
   they do all the week? Well, let us see--beginning with Monday and going
   on to Saturday-- hear it all--and what is its sum total? As far as the
   Church or the world is concerned, these people might just as well have
   been in bed and asleep all the time--they do nothing whatever. They
   have a name to fire and practically they are dead.

   If a young man joins a rifle corps, there he is. He stands in the rank.
   He learns his practice and drills. He tries to get a prize by hitting
   the target. But when a man joins the Christian Church, where is he? I
   do not know where he is. You may find his name seven hundred and
   something in the attendance book. He is there, but what is he? You find
   him at Chapel on Sunday, but where is he, and what is he doing for the
   cause of Christ during the week? The smallest scrap of paper would be
   too large to record his deeds of faith. He thinks he adorns his
   profession. But what kind of adornment is it, or who ever sees that
   adornment? I cannot tell. I believe that the man who does not make his
   religion his first and last thought, who does not subject all his
   actions, his eating and drinking, too, to the cause of Christ, has not
   the work of God in his soul. "Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or
   whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."

   The man who has not consecrated the lap stone--who has not dedicated
   the counter to God--who has not made the desk and the pen holiness unto
   the Lord has yet to learn what the Christian religion is. It is not a
   uniform to be worn one day and cast away the next. It ought to be a
   part of the woof and warp of your being. It ought to run in your blood,
   penetrate the marrow of your bones, work in the arms, gaze from the
   eyes and speak from the tongue. O to be baptized, saturated, immersed
   in the Spirit of God and so, wherever we go to say to men who put our
   Lord at the bottom of the scale, "For us to live is Christ"! Only such,
   I say, will ever be able to add, "For me to die is gain."

   I hope this may come home to some of you. And if it does, may it
   produce from this day forth a more thorough love to Jesus--a more
   practical way of showing a more entire devotedness to that great cause
   which is either an awful imposition, or else deserves to have our whole
   heart, our whole spirit, soul and body devoted to it.

   III. Now, I will close, by trying to GIVE SOME REASONS WHY I PUT THE
   SERVICE OF GOD SO PROMINENT, AND THINK THAT AARON'S ROD OUGHT TO
   SWALLOW UP ALL OTHER RODS.

   What does the great Gospel revelation disclose to us? Does it not show
   us an awful danger and only one way of escape from it? Yonder is the
   place where the wrath of God burns without abatement, where souls
   suffer pangs indescribable. "To-phet is ordained of old. Yes, for the
   king it is prepared. He has made it deep and large: the pile there is
   fire and much wood. The breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone,
   does kindle it." Horrors, past imagination are revealed to us by the
   words of Jesus when He speaks of the worm that dies not, and of the
   fire that never shall be quenched.

   If we could once, but for an instant, have an idea of the wrath to
   come. If but for a moment the scathing lightning of God could flash
   before our vision--if we could taste, but for an instant, the
   bitterness of that cup of trembling, the dregs of which the wicked
   earth must drink--I am sure we should feel that the religion which
   teaches us how to escape from it must be worthy of a man's most solemn
   consideration! And we should give to it all the strength of our mind.
   To escape from Hell--O Sirs--if you do but manage this, though you die
   in an attic, you will have done well! Oh, if you have but escaped from
   the wrath to come, you will have been wise. Though you have lived as
   paupers here, wiser far than he who has piled--like the tower of
   Babel--wealth on wealth, only to find his way to despair at last.

   Does not our religion also reveal to us the joyous reward of another
   world? It opens to us yonder pearly gates and bids us gaze on angels
   and glorified spirits. It tells us of celestial glories, of
   immortality, the crown of life which fades not away. It brings to our
   ear the melody ofheavenly harps and bids our eyes look upon the
   splendors of the Son of God upon the Throne. Heaven--if there is a
   Heaven, and we, by calling ourselves Christians, accept it as Truth.
   Should it not, then, be our first and last thought, the Alpha and Omega
   of man's existence, to seek and find it--so that we may not be shut out
   like the foolish virgins, but may enter with the wise into the marriage
   supper? By Hell and by Heaven, therefore, I do entreat you, let Aaron's
   rod swallow up all other rods. And let love and faith in Jesus be the
   master passion of your soul.

   Moreover, do we not learn in our holy faith of a love unexampled? Where
   was love such as that which brought the Prince of Glory down to the
   gates of death and made Him pass the portals amid shame and scoffing?
   Oh, matchless love which draws the Prince of Life down to the shades of
   death! That takes the crown from His lofty brow, removes His purple
   robe from His shoulders, loosens His glittering garment and strips His
   fingers of their golden rings. That wraps Him in clay, clothes Him in
   rags, houses Him nowhere, gives Him no place to lay His head! That
   makes Him eat the bread of penury and drink the water of affliction.

   Shall such a love as this have half our hearts? Shall it have a cold
   love in return? Shall Jesus sit at the bottom of the table? Shall we
   stow Him away in some back chamber of the heart? Shall we treat Him to
   cold meats, to dogs' meat? God forbid! Let us make Him King of kings
   within our hearts, as He is today King of kings in the highest heavens.
   If Christ is anything, He must be everything. If He deserve not to be
   everything, He deserves to be less than nothing.

   But, my Brothers and Sisters, does not the Grace of God create in us a
   new and noble nature? And if new and noble, should it not predominate?
   He is accursed who lets his body rule his mind, who lets his eating and
   drinking chain the immortal spirit. And he is equally accursed who
   shall let his mind rule his new-born spirit. No, let that nature which
   feeds on Christ, which breathes Christ, and which ascends to Christ--as
   flame ascends up to the central source of fire--the sun--let that
   nature always have its full liberty. Let it be ruling in us! Though the
   Law in our members strives against it, yet let it rule and reign--like
   the rod of Aaron--let it swallow up all other rods.

   And since, dear Brothers and Sisters, since God has been pleased to
   ennoble us by giving us the high dignity of being His children, shall
   we make our being a son of man a greater thing than being a son of God?
   Shall men, as they look at me, say of me first, "He is a tradesman"? O
   let me live so that the first thing they may say shall be--"He is a
   Christian"!

   I heard of one, speaking of a certain earnest man's religion, as riding
   his horse. I knew that the person who so spoke of him knew nothing
   about it. For this is a steed which you may ride all day and all night
   long. It is a very Pegasus which will bear you up to Heaven and carry
   you aloft up to the starry spheres. Never dismount, Christian--having
   been once set upon Christ's own beast--continue to ride till He brings
   you safely home. Whatever others may be with their religion, let yours
   be of a sort which you cannot lay aside. You must hold it, you must
   speak about it.

   The Brahmins and the Hindus practice caste. A Hindu one day asked our
   missionaries whether they had caste in England. The missionary replied,
   No, all men might eat and drink together. The Brahmin said this was
   very disorderly and even immoral. But the missionary said, "Well, but
   upon your great feast day--for instance, the great feast of
   Juggernaut--the Sudra eats with the Brahmin." "Oh," says he, "that is
   because we are in the presence of our god." "So," said the missionary,
   "that is the reason why we have no caste in England, because we are
   always in the presence of our God."

   I would that we thought of this. And being always in the presence of
   our God, let us live every day as the idolater does some days. As the
   Romanist does now and then. Talk of holy days! Why, every day ought to
   be to you a holy day. Speak of keeping the Sunday holy! Every day
   should be kept holy. Only the Sunday is a day of rest unto us more than
   the others. Write upon the bells of the horses, "HOLINESS UNTO THE
   LORD," and let the pots in your own house be like the bowls before the
   altar.

   I shall not say any more upon this subject. Only pray that the Lord may
   give to this Church a larger number of consecrated men and women--and
   ask of you, for I make a point of it--to remember that this must always
   be a labor of love if it is to be acceptable. No man ever does anything
   for the Lord acceptably which he would rather not do--no man ever gives
   to the Lord acceptably that which he would rather withhold. The service
   of Christ is perfect freedom--to serve Him day and night is to enjoy
   perpetual liberty.

   Only try it, dear Brothers and Sisters! You that are low in Divine
   Grace and weak in your faith, doubting and unbelieving, do more for
   Christ! Make your consecration more perfect. and your light shall come
   forth as brightness and the glory of your soul as a lamp that burns.
   May the Lord now add His blessing. Amen.

                          Mealtime In The Corn Fields

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, AUGUST 2, 1863, BY THE REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come you here and eat of the bread
   and dip your morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and
   he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left."

   Ruth 2:14.

   IF we lived in the country it would not be necessary for me to remind
   you that the time of harvest has again happily come upon us. I saw, one
   day last week, a fine sample of the new wheat, part of a considerable
   quantity which had just been sold. And in many places I have observed
   the fields yielding their sheaves to the reapers' sickle. Let us loudly
   lift our praises to God for the abundance which loads the land. An
   unusually heavy crop has been given in many quarters and scarcely
   anywhere is there any deficiency.

   While there is so much of distress abroad--while the great factories of
   our country are standing still--we should be grateful that God is
   pleased to alleviate the sufferings of the poor by an unusually
   bountiful harvest. And we must not forget to pray that during the next
   few weeks the Lord would be pleased to give suitable weather so that
   the corn may be safely gathered into the garner. That there may be
   abundance of bread and no complaining in our streets. I always feel it
   necessary, just at this season, to give these hints, because God's
   natural remembrances cannot reach us--we hear not the lark teaching us
   how to praise, nor do the green fields of grass, and the yellow ears of
   corn preach to us of the Lord's bounty.

   Little is there to be learned from these long corridors of dreary cells
   which we call streets and houses. I see dull brown or dirty-white
   bricks everywhere--enough to make one earthly--however much we may pant
   for heavenly things. We see neither the green blade nor the full corn
   in the ear, and we are so apt to forget that we all depend upon the
   labor of the field. Let us unite with the peasant and his master in
   blessing and praising the God of Providence, who first covered the
   fields with grass for the cattle and now with herbs for the food of
   man.

   This morning we are going to the corn fields, as we did last year, not
   however, so much to glean, as to rest with the reapers and the
   gleaners, when under some wide-spreading oak they sit down to take
   refreshment. We hope there will be found some timid gleaner here who
   will accept our invitation to come and eat with us, and who will find
   confidence enough to dip their morsel in the vinegar. May they have
   courage to feast to the full on their own account, and then to carry
   home a portion to their needy friends at home.

   I. Our first point this morning is this--THAT GOD'S REAPERS HAVE THEIR
   MEALTIMES. Those who work for God will find Him a good Master. He cares
   for oxen, and has commanded His Israel, "You shall not muzzle the ox
   when he treads out the corn." Much more does He care for His servants
   who serve Him. "He has given meat unto them that fear Him: He will ever
   be mindful of His Covenant." The reapers in Jesus' fields shall not
   only receive a blessed reward at the last, but they shall have
   plenteous comforts by the way.

   He is pleased to pay His servants twice--first in the labor itself--and
   a second time in the labor's sweet results. He gives them such joy and
   consolation in the service of their Master that it is a sweet employ,
   and they cry, "We delight to do Your will, O Lord." As Heaven is made
   up of serving God day and night, so to true workers, their constantly
   serving God on earth brings with it a rich foretaste of Heaven.

   God has ordained certain mealtimes for His reapers. And He has
   appointed that one of these shall be when they come together to listen
   to the Word preached. If God is with our ministers, they act as the
   disciples did of old. They received the barley loaves and fishes from
   Christ, and handed them to the people as He multiplied them. We, of
   ourselves, cannot feed one soul, much less thousands. But when the Lord
   is with us, we can keep as good a table as Solomon himself, with all
   his fine flour, fat, roebucks, and small deer.

   When the Lord blesses the provisions of His House, no matter how many
   thousands there may be, all His poor shall be filled with bread. I
   hope, Beloved, you know what it is to sit under the shadow of the Word
   with great delight and find the fruit sweet unto your taste. Where the
   Doctrines of Grace are boldly and plainly delivered to you in
   connection with the other Truths of Revelation. Where Jesus Christ upon
   His Cross is always lifted up. Where the work of the Spirit is not
   forgotten. Where the glorious purpose of the Father is never
   despised--there is sure to be food for the children of

   God.

   We have learned not to feed upon oratorical flourishes or philosophical
   fineries. We leave these fine things, these twelfth-cake ornaments, to
   be eaten by those little children who can find delight in such
   unhealthy dainties--we prefer to hear the Truth of God, even when
   roughly spoken--to the fine garnishing of eloquence without the Truth.
   We care little about how the table is served, or of what ware the
   dishes are made--so long as the Covenant bread and water, and the
   promised oil and wine are given to us. Certain grumblers among the
   Lord's reapers do not feed under the preached Word because they do not
   intend to feed. They come to the House of Bread on purpose to find
   fault, and therefore they go away empty.

   My verdict is, "It serves them right." Little care I to please such
   hearers. I would as soon feed bears and jackals, as attempt to supply
   the wants of grumbling professors. How much mischief is done by
   observations made upon the preacher! How often do we censure where our
   God approves. We have heard of a high doctrinal deacon who said to a
   young minister who was supplying the pulpit on probation, "I should
   have enjoyed your sermon very much, Sir, if it had not been for that
   last appeal to the sinner. I do not think that dead sinners should be
   exhorted to believe in Jesus."

   When that deacon reached home he found his own daughter in tears. She
   became converted to God and united with the Church of which that young
   man ultimately became the minister. How was she converted, do you
   think? By that address at the close of the sermon, which her father did
   not like. Take heed of railing at that by which the Holy Spirit saves
   souls! There may be much in the sermon which may not suit you, or me,
   but then we are not the only persons to be considered. There is a wide
   variety of characters and all our hearers must have "their portion of
   meat in due season."

   Is it not a selfishness very unlike the spirit of a Christian which
   would make me find fault with the provisions, because I cannot eat them
   all? There should be the unadulterated milk for the babe in Grace, as
   well as the strong substantial meat for the full grown Believer.
   Beloved, I know that murmurers may call our manna, "light bread," yet
   our gracious God does, "in this mountain make unto all people a feast
   of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of
   marrow, of wines on the lees well refined."

   Often, too, our gracious Lord appoints us mealtimes in our private
   readings and meditations. Here it is that His "paths drop fatness."
   Nothing can be more fattening to the soul of the Believer than feeding
   upon the Word and digesting it by frequent meditations. No wonder that
   some grow so little, when they meditate so little. Cattle must chew the
   cud. It is not what they crop with their teeth, but that which is
   masticated and afterwards digested by rumination that nourishes them.
   We must take the Truth of God and roll it over and over again in the
   inward parts of our spirit, and so we shall extract Divine nourishment
   from it.

   Have you not, my Brothers and Sisters, frequently found a Benjamin's
   mess prepared for you in a choice promise of your God? Is not
   meditation the land of Goshen to you? If men once said, "There is corn
   in Egypt," may they not always say that the finest of the wheat is to
   be found in secret prayer? Private devotion is a land which flows with
   milk and honey--a Paradise yielding all manner of fruits--a banqueting
   house of choice wines. Ahasuerus might make a great feast, but all his
   hundred and twenty provinces could not furnish such dainties as the
   closet offers to the spiritual mind! Where can we feed and lie down in
   green pastures in so sweet a sense as we do in our musings on the Word?

   Meditation distils the quintessence from the Scriptures and gladdens
   our mouth with a sweetness which exceeds the virgin honey dropping from
   the honeycomb. Your retired seasons and occasions of prayer should be
   to you regal entertainments, or at least refreshing seasons, in which,
   like the reapers at noonday, you sit with Boaz and eat of your Master's
   generous provisions. "The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain"--you who have
   read that excellent book will remember-- was custom to say, "that when
   he was lonely and when his wallet was empty, his Bible was to him meat
   and drink and company, too." He is not the only man who has found a
   fullness in the Word when there is want without.

   During the battle of Waterloo a godly soldier, mortally wounded, was
   carried by his comrade into the rear, and being placed with his back
   propped up against a tree, he besought his friend to open his knapsack
   and take out the Bible which he had carried in it. "Read to me," he
   said, "one verse, before I close my eyes in death." His comrade read
   him that verse--"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not
   as the world gives, give I unto you." And there, fresh from the
   whistling of the bullets, the roll of the drum, and the tempest of
   human conflict, that believing spirit enjoyed such holy calm that
   before he fell asleep in the arms of Jesus, he said, "Yes, I have a
   peace with God which passes all understanding, which keeps my heart and
   mind through Jesus Christ." Saints most surely have their mealtimes
   when they are alone in meditation.

   Let us not forget that there is one specially ordained mealtime which
   ought to occur oftener, but which, even monthly, is very refreshing to
   us. I mean the Supper of the Lord. There you have literally, as well as
   spiritually, a meal. The table is richly spread. It has upon it both
   meat and drink. There is the bread and the wine, and looking at what
   these symbolize, we have before us a table richer than that which kings
   could furnish. There we have the flesh and the blood of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, of which if a man eats, he shall never hunger and never thirst,
   for that bread shall be unto him everlasting life.

   Oh, the sweet seasons we have known at the Lord's Supper! If some of
   you really did understand the enjoyment of feeding upon Christ in that
   ordinance, you would chide yourselves for not having united with the
   Church in fellowship! In keeping the Master's commandments there is a
   "great reward," and consequently, in neglecting them there is a great
   loss of reward. Christ is not so tied to the Sacramental table as to be
   always found of those who partake there, but still it is in the way
   that we may expect the Lord to meet with us. "If you love Me, keep My
   commandments"--it is a sentence of touching power. "And His
   commandments are not grievous," is the confession of all obedient sons.

   Sitting at this table, our soul has mounted up from the emblem to the
   reality. We have eaten bread in the kingdom of God and have leaned our
   head upon Jesus' bosom. "He brought me to the banqueting house and His
   banner over me was love." On these occasions we may compare ourselves
   to poor Mephibosheth, who though lame and despicable in his own esteem,
   yet was made to sit at King David's table. Or we may liken ourselves to
   the little ewe lamb in the parable which did eat of its Master's bread
   and drink from his cup and slept in his bosom. The prodigal, who once
   fed upon husks, sits down to eat the bread of children. We, who were
   worthy to be esteemed as dogs, are here permitted to take the place of
   adopted sons and daughters.

   Besides these regular mealtimes, there are others which God gives us,
   at seasons when perhaps we little expect them. You have been walking
   the street and suddenly you have felt a holy flowing out of your soul
   toward God. Or, in the middle of business your heart has been melted
   with love and made to leap for joy even as the brooks which have been
   bound with winter's ice leap to feel the touch of spring. You have been
   groaning, dull and earth-bound. But the sweet love of Jesus has
   embraced you when you scarcely thought of it, and your spirit, all free
   and all on fire, has rejoiced to dance before the Lord with tambourines
   and high-sounding cymbals, like Miriam of old.

   I have had times occasionally in preaching when I would gladly have
   kept on far beyond the appointed hour, for my happy soul was like a
   vessel wanting vent. Seasons, too, you have had on your sick-beds when
   you would have been content to be sick always, if you could have your
   bed so well made and your head so softly pillowed--

   "These are the joys He lets us know
   In fields and viilages below--
   Gives us a relish of His love,
   But keeps His noble feast above."

   Our blessed Redeemer sometimes comes to us in the morning and wakes us
   up with such sweet thoughts upon our soul, we know not how they came.
   And when the dew is visiting the flowers in the cool eventide,
   sometimes a few drops of Heaven's dew falls upon us, too. And as we
   have gone to our beds, our meditation of Him has been sweet. And in the
   night watches, when we tossed to and fro and could not sleep, He has
   been pleased to become our song in the night--

   "He is the spring of all my joys,
   The life of my delights;
   The glory of my brightest days,
   And comfort of my nights."

   God's reapers find it hard work to reap. But they find a blessed solace
   when they sit down and eat of their Master's rich provisions. Then,
   with renewed strength they go with sharpened sickles to reap again in
   the noontide heat.

   Let me observe that while these mealtimes come, even though we know not
   exactly when, there are certain seasons when we may expect them. The
   Eastern reapers generally sit down under the shelter of a tree, or a
   booth, to take refreshment during the heat of the day. And I am certain
   that when trouble, affliction, persecution and bereavement become the
   most painful to us, it is then that the Lord hands out to us the
   sweetest comforts. As we said last Thursday night, some promises are
   written in sympathetic ink and can only have their meaning brought out
   by holding them before the fire of affliction.

   Some verses of Scripture must be held to the fire till they are
   scorched before the glorious meaning will stand forth, in clear
   letters, before our eyes. We must work till the hot sun forces the
   sweat from our face. We must bear the burden and heat of the day before
   we can expect to be invited to those choice meals which the Lord
   prepares for those who are diligent in His work. When your day of
   trouble is the hottest, then the love of Jesus shall be sweetest. When
   your night of trial is the darkest, then will His candle shine most
   brightly about you. When your head aches most severely. When your heart
   palpitates most terribly. When heart and flesh fail you--then He will
   be the strength of your life and your portion forever.

   Again, these mealtimes frequently occur before a trial. Elijah must be
   entertained beneath a juniper tree, for he is to go a forty days'
   journey in the strength of that meat. You may suspect some danger near
   when your delights are overflowing. If you see a ship taking in great
   quantities of provision, it is bound for a distant port. And when God
   gives you extraordinary seasons of communion with Jesus, you may look
   for long leagues of tempestuous sea. Sweet cordials prepare us for
   stern conflicts. Times of refreshing also occur after trouble or
   arduous service. Christ was tempted by the devil, and afterwards angels
   came and ministered unto Him.

   Jacob wrestled with God and then afterwards, at Mahanaim, hosts of
   angels met him. Abraham wars with the kings and returns from their
   slaughter. Then is it that Melchisedek refreshes him with bread and
   wine. After conflict, content. After battle, banquet. When you have
   waited on your Lord, then you shall sit down and your Master will gird
   Himself and wait upon you. Yes, let the worldling say what he will
   about the hardness of religion, we do not find it so. We do confess
   that reaping is no child's play--that toiling for Christ has its
   difficulties and its troubles. But still the bread which we eat is very
   sweet and the wine which we drink is crushed from celestial clusters--

   "I would not change my blessed estate For all the world calls good or
   great And while my faith can keep her hold, I envy not the sinner's
   gold."

   II. Follow me while we turn to a second point. TO THESE MEALS THE
   GLEANER IS AFFECTIONATELY INVITED. That is to say, the poor trembling
   stranger who has not strength enough to reap--who has no right to be in
   the field, except the right of charity. The poor trembling sinner,
   conscious of his own demerit and feeling but little hope and little
   joy. To the meals of the strong-handed, fully-assured reaper, the
   gleaner is invited. The gleaner is invited, in the text, to come. "At
   mealtime, come you here." We have known some who felt ashamed to come
   to the House of God. But we trust you will, none of you, be kept away
   from the place of feasting by any shame on account of your dress, or
   your personal character, or your poverty--no, nor even on account of
   your physical infirmities. "At mealtime come you here."

   I have heard of a deaf woman who could never hear a sound, and yet she
   was always in the House of God. And when asked why, her reply was,
   "Because a friend found her the text and then God was pleased to give
   her many a sweet thought upon the text while she sat in his House.
   Besides," she said, "she felt that as a Believer, she ought to honor
   God by her presence in His courts, and recognize her union with His
   people. And, better still, she always liked to be in the best of
   company. And as the Presence of God was there, and the holy angels and
   the saints of the Most High--whether she could hear or not--she would
   go."

   There is a Brother whose face I seldom miss from this House. He, I
   believe, has never in his life heard a sound, and cannot make an
   articulate utterance Yet he is a joyful Believer and loves the place
   where God's honor dwells. Well, now, I think if such persons find
   pleasure in coming, we who can hear, though we feel our
   unworthiness--though we are conscious that we are not fit to
   come--should be desirous to be laid in the House of God, as the sick
   were at the pool of Be-thesda, hoping that the waters may be stirred,
   and that we may step in and be healed. Trembling Soul, never let the
   temptations of the devil keep you from God's House. "At mealtime come
   you here."

   Moreover, she was bid not only to come, but to eat. Now, whatever there
   is sweet and comfortable in the Word of God, you that are of a broken
   and contrite spirit, are invited to partake of it. "Jesus Christ came
   into the world to save sinners"--sinners such as you are. "In due time
   Christ died for the ungodly"--for such ungodly ones as you feel
   yourselves to be. You are desiring, this morning, to be Christ's. Well,
   you may be Christ's. You are saying in your heart, "O that I could eat
   the children's bread!" You may eat it. You say, "I have no right." But
   He gives you the invitation! Come without any other right than the
   right of His invitation. I know you will say how unworthy you are--

   "Let not conscience make you linger, Nor of fitness fondly dream."

   But since Christ bids you, "come," take Him at His word. And if there
   is a promise, believe it. If there is rich consolation, drink it. If
   there is an encouraging word, accept it and let the sweetness of it be
   yours. Note further, that she was not only invited to eat the bread,
   but to dip her morsel in the vinegar. We must not look upon this as
   being some sour stuff. No doubt there are crabbed souls in the Church
   who always dip their morsel in the sourest imaginable vinegar, and with
   a grim liberality invite others to share a little comfortable misery
   with them. But the vinegar in my text is altogether another thing.

   This was either a compound of various sweets extracted from fruits, or
   else it was that weak kind of wine mingled with water which is still
   commonly used in the harvest fields of Italy and the warmer parts of
   the world--a drink not exceedingly strong, but excellently cooling and
   good enough to impart a relish to the reapers' food. It was, to use the
   only word which will give the meaning, a sauce which the Orientals used
   with their bread. As we use butter, or as they on other occasions used
   oil, so in the harvest field, believing it to have cooling properties,
   they used what is here called vinegar.

   Beloved, the Lord's reapers have sauce with their bread. They have
   sweet consolations. They have not merely doctrines, but the holy
   unction which is the essence of doctrines. They have not merely the
   Truths of God, but a hallowed and ravishing delight accompanies the
   Truths. Take, for instance, the doctrine of election, which is like the
   bread. There is a sauce to dip that in. When I can say, "He loved me
   before the foundations of the world," the personal application, the
   personal enjoyment of my interest in the Truth of God becomes a sauce
   into which I dip my morsel.

   And you, poor Gleaner, are invited to dip your morsel in it, too. I
   used to hear people sing that hymn of Toplady's, which begins--

   "A debtor to mercy alone, Of Covenant mercy I sing; Nor fear with Your
   righteousness on, My person and offerings to bring."

   And rises to its climax--

   "Yes, I to the end shall endure, As sure as the earnest is given; More
   happy, but not more secure, The glorified spirits in Heaven." And I
   used to think I could never sing that hymn. It was the sauce, you know.
   I might manage to eat some of the plain bread, but I could not dip it
   in that sauce. It was too high doctrine, too sweet, too consoling. But
   I thank God I have since ventured to dip my morsel in it and now I
   hardly like my bread without it.

   I would have every trembling sinner be prepared to take the comfortable
   parts of God's Word, even those called "HIGH." I hope, Brothers and
   Sisters, you will never grow as some Christians do--who like all sauce
   and no bread. There are some high-flying Brothers and Sisters who must
   have nothing but the vinegar. And very sour it turns upon their
   stomachs, too. I hope you will love the bread. A little of the vinegar,
   a little of the spice, and much savor. But let us keep to the bread as
   well. Let us love all revealed Truth of God. And if there is a
   trembling gleaner here, let me invite and persuade her to come here, to
   eat the bread and to dip her morsel in the sauce.

   Now I think I see her and she is half prepared to come. She is very
   hungry, and she has brought nothing with her this morning. But she
   begins to say, "I have no right to come, for I am not a reaper. I do
   nothing for Christ. I did not even come here this morning to honor Him.
   I came here, as gleaners go into a corn field, from a selfish motive,
   to pick up what

   I could for myself. And all the religion that I have lies in this--the
   hope that I may be saved. I do not glorify God. I do no good to other
   people. I am only a selfish gleaner. I am not a reaper."

   Ah, but you are invited to come. Make no questions about it. Boaz bids
   you. Take his invitation and enter at once. But, you say, "I am such a
   poor gleaner. Though it is all for myself, yet it is little I get at
   it. I get a few thoughts while the sermon is being preached, but I lose
   them before I reach home." I know you do, poor weak-handed Woman. But
   still, Jesus invites you. Come! Take the sweet promise as He presents
   it to you, and let no bashfulness of yours send you home hungry. "But,"
   you say, "I am a stranger. You do not know my sins, my sinfulness, and
   the waywardness of my heart."

   But Jesus does. And Jesus still invites you! He knows you are but a
   Moabitess, a stranger from the commonwealth of Israel. But He bids you!
   Is not that enough? "Eat the bread and dip your morsel in the vinegar."
   "But," you say, "I owe so much to Him already. It is so good of Him to
   spare my forfeited life and so tender of Him to let me hear the Gospel
   preached at all. I cannot have the presumption to be an intruder and
   sit with the reapers." Oh, but He bids you. There is more presumption
   in your doubting than there could be in your believing. HE bids you!
   Will you refuse Boaz? Shall Jesus' lips give the invitation, and will
   you say no?

   Come, now, come. Remember that the little which Ruth could eat did not
   make Boaz any the poorer. And all that you want will make Christ none
   the less glorious, or full of Grace. What? Are your necessities large?
   Yes? But His supplies are larger! Do you require great mercy? He is a
   great Savior. I tell you that His mercy is no more to be exhausted than
   the sea is to be drained. Or than the sun is to be rendered dim by the
   excess of the light which he pours forth today. Come! There is enough
   for you, and Boaz will not be hurt by what you get.

   Moreover, let me tell you a secret--Jesus loves you. Therefore it is
   that He would have you feed at His table. If you are now a longing,
   trembling sinner, willing to be saved, but conscious that you deserve
   it not, Jesus loves you, Sinner, and He will take more delight in
   seeing you eat than you will take in the eating! Let the sweet love He
   feels in His soul toward you draw you to Him. And what is more--but
   this is a great secret and must only be whispered in your ear--He
   intends to be married to you. And when you are married to Him, why, the
   fields will be yours! For, of course, if you are the spouse, you are
   joint-proprietor with Him.

   Is it not so? Does not the wife share with the husband? All those
   promises which are, "yes, and Amen in Christ" shall be yours--no, they
   all are yours NOW, for, "the man is next of kin unto you," and before
   long He will spread His skirt over you and take you unto Himself
   forever, espousing you in faithfulness and truth and righteousness.
   Will you not eat of your own? "Oh, but," says one, "how can it be? I am
   a stranger." Yes, a stranger--but Jesus Christ loves the stranger. "A
   publican, a sinner." But He is "the Friend of publicans and sinners."
   "An outcast." But He "gathers together the outcasts of Israel." "A
   stray sheep." But the Shepherd "leaves the ninety and nine" to seek it.
   "A lost piece of money." But He "sweeps the house" to find you. "A
   prodigal son." But He sets the bells a ringing when He knows that you
   will return. Come, Ruth! Come, trembling Gleaner! Jesus invites
   you--accept the invitation. "At mealtime come you here and eat of the
   bread and dip your morsel in the vinegar."

   III. Now, thirdly--and here is a very sweet point in the narrative.
   BOAZ REACHED HER THE PARCHED CORN. "She did come and eat." Where did
   she sit? You notice she "sat beside the reapers." She did not feel that
   she was one of them--she "sat beside" them. Just as some of you do, who
   do not come down in the evening to the Lord's Supper, but sit in the
   gallery. You are sitting "beside the reapers." You are sitting this
   morning as if you were not one of us-- had no right to be among the
   people of God--still you will sit beside us.

   If there is a good thing to be had and you cannot get it, you will get
   as near as you can to those who do. You think there is some comfort
   even in looking on at the gracious feast. "She sat beside the reapers."
   And while she was sitting there, what happened? Did she stretch forth
   her hand and get the food herself? No, it is written, "HE reached her
   the parched corn." Ah, that is it. I give the invitation, Brothers and
   Sisters, today--give it earnestly, affectionately, sincerely. But I
   know very well that while I give it, no trembling heart will accept it
   unless the King Himself comes near and feasts His saints today.

   He must reach the parched corn. He must give you to drink of "the juice
   of the spiced wine of His pomegranate." How does He do this? By His
   gracious Spirit. He first of all inspires your faith. You are afraid to
   think it can be true, that such a sinner as you is accepted in the
   Beloved. He breathes upon you, and your faint hope becomes an
   expectancy--and that expectation buds and blossoms into an
   appropriating faith, which says, "Yes, my Beloved is mine, and His
   desire is toward me." Having done this, the Savior does more. He sheds
   abroad the love of God in your heart. The love of Christ is like sweet
   perfume in a box.

   Now, He who put the perfume in the box is the only Person that knows
   how to take the lid off. He, with His own skillful hands, takes the lid
   from the box. Then it is, "shed abroad," like "ointment poured forth."
   You know it may be there, and yet not be shed abroad. As you walk in
   the woods there may be a hare or a partridge there, and yet you may
   never see them. But when you startle them, and they fly or run before
   you, then you perceive them. And there may be the love of God in your
   heart, not in exercise, but still there. And at last you may have the
   privilege of seeing it--seeing your love mount with wings to Heaven,
   and your faith running without weariness. Christ must shed abroad that
   love--His Spirit must put your Graces into exercise.

   But Jesus does more than this. He reaches the parched corn with His own
   hands when He gives us close communion with Him. Do not think that this
   is a dream! I tell you there is such a thing as talking with Christ
   today. As certainly as I can talk with my dearest friend, or find
   solace in the company of my beloved wife, so surely may I speak with
   Jesus, and find intense delight in the company of Immanuel. It is not a
   fiction! We do not worship a far-off Savior. He is a God near at hand.
   We do not adore Him as One who is gone away to Heaven, and who never
   can be approached. But He is near us, in our mouth, and in our heart.
   And we do, today, walk with Him as the elect did of old--and commune
   with Him as His Apostles did on earth--not after the flesh, it is true,
   but spiritual men value spiritual communion--better than any carnal
   fellowship.

   Yet once more let me add the Lord Jesus is pleased to reach the parched
   corn, in the best sense, when the Spirit gives us the infallible
   witness within, that we are "born of God." A man may know that he is a
   Christian infallibly. Philip de Morny, who lived in the time of Prince
   Henry of Navarre, was accustomed to say that the Holy Spirit had made
   his own salvation to him as clear a point as ever a problem proved to a
   demonstration in Euclid could be. You know with what mathematical
   precision the scholar of Euclid solves a problem or proves a
   proposition! And just the same, with as absolute a precision, as
   certainly as twice two are four, we may, "know that we have passed from
   death unto life." The sun in the heavens is not more clear to the eye
   than his own salvation to an assured Believer--such a man would as soon
   doubt his own existence, as suspect his interest in eternal life!

   Now let the prayer be breathed by poor Ruth, who is trembling yonder.
   Lord, reach me the parched corn! "Draw me, we will run after You."
   Lord, send Your love into my heart--

   "Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove, With all Your quickening powers,
   Come, shed abroad a Savior's love, And that shall kindle ours." There
   is no getting at Christ, except by Christ revealing Himself to us.

   IV. And now the last point. After Boaz had reached the parched corn, we
   are told that, "SHE DID EAT, AND WAS SUFFICED, AND LEFT." So shall it
   be with every Ruth. Sooner or later every penitent shall become a
   Believer. There may be a space of deep conviction and a period of much
   hesitation. But, by God's Grace, there shall come a season when the
   soul decides for the Lord. If I perish, I perish. I will go as I am to
   Jesus. I will not play the fool any longer with my buts and ifs. Since
   He bids me believe that He died for me, I will believe it, and will
   trust His Cross for my salvation. And oh, whenever you shall be
   privileged to do this, you shall be "satisfied." "She did eat and was
   satisfied."

   Your head shall be satisfied with the precious Truth which Christ
   reveals. Your heart shall be content with Jesus, as the altogether
   lovely Object of affection. Your hope shall be satisfied, for whom have
   you in Heaven but Christ? Your desires shall be satiated, for what can
   even the hunger of your desire wish for more than "to know Christ and
   to be found in Him"? You shall find Jesus fills your conscience till it
   is at perfect peace. He shall fill your judgment till you know the
   certainty of His teachings. He shall fill your memory with
   recollections of what He did, and fill your imagination with the
   prospects of what He is yet to do. You shall be "satisfied." Still,
   still it shall be true, that you shall leave something. "She was
   satisfied and she left."

   Some of us have had deep draughts. We have thought that we could take
   in all of Christ. But when we have done our best, we have had to leave
   a vast remainder. We have sat down with a ravenous appetite at the
   table of the Lord's love and said, "Now, nothing but the infinite can
   ever satisfy me. I am such a great sinner that I must have infinite
   merit to wash my sin away." But we have had our sin removed and found
   that there was merit to spare. We have had our hunger relieved and
   found that there was a redundancy for others who were in a similar
   case.

   There are certain sweet things in the Word of God which you and I have
   not enjoyed yet, and which we cannot enjoy yet. We are obliged to leave
   them for a while. "I have yet many things to say unto you, but you
   cannot hear them now." There is a knowledge to which we have not
   attained--a place of fellowship nearer yet to Christ. There are heights
   of communion which as yet our feet have not climbed--virgin snows upon
   the mountain untrod by the foot of man. There is yet a beyond, and
   there will be a forever.

   But please notice--it is not in the text, but it is recorded a verse or
   two further on, what she did with her leavings. It is a very bad habit,
   I believe, at feasts, to carry anything home with you. But she did, for
   that which was left she took home. And when she reached Naomi and
   showed her the quantity of wheat in her apron, after she had asked,
   "Where have you gleaned today?" and had received the answer, she gave
   to Naomi a portion of that which she had reserved after she was
   sufficed. So it shall be even with you, poor Tremblers, who think you
   have no right to any for yourselves. You shall be able to eat and be
   quite satisfied--and what is more--you shall have a morsel to carry to
   others in a like condition.

   I am always pleased to find the young Believer beginning to pocket
   something for other people. When you hear a sermon, you think, "Well,
   poor mother cannot get out today, I will tell her something about it.
   There now, that point will just suit her. I will take that, even if I
   forget everything else. I will tell her that by the bedside. There is
   my brother William, who will not come with me to Chapel. I wish he
   would. But now, there was something which struck me in the sermon and
   when I get close to him, I will tell him that. Then I will ask, 'Will
   you not come this evening?' I will tell him those portions which
   interested me. Perhaps they will interest him."

   There are your children in the Sunday school class. You say, "That
   illustration will do for them." I think sometimes, when I see you
   putting down my metaphors on little scraps of paper, that you may
   remember to tell somebody else. I would gladly give more where they are
   so well used. I would let fall an extra handful on purpose, that there
   may be enough for you and for your friends. There is an abominable
   spirit of self among some professors, prompting them to eat their
   morsels alone. They get the honey. It is a forest full of honey, like
   Jonathan's woods. And yet they are afraid-- afraid lest they should eat
   it all up--so they try to maintain a monopoly.

   I know some congregations which seem, to me, to be sort of spiritual
   protectionists. They are afraid Heaven will be too full, that there
   will not be room enough for them. When an invitation is given to a
   sinner, they do not like it--it is too open, too general. And when
   there is a melting heart and a tearful eye for the conversion of other
   people, they feel quite out of their element. They never know what it
   is to take home that which is left and give to others. Cultivate an
   unselfish spirit. Seek to love as you have been loved. Remember that
   "the Law and the Prophets" lie in this--to "love the Lord your God with
   all your heart and your neighbor as yourself."

   How can you love your neighbor as yourself if you do not love his soul?
   You have loved your own soul--through Divine Grace you have been led to
   lay hold on Jesus. Love your neighbor's soul, and never be satisfied
   till you see him in the enjoyment of those things which are the charm
   of your life and the joy of your spirit. I do not know how to give my
   invitation in a more comfortable way. But as we are sitting down to
   feed at His Table in the evening of this day, I pray the Master to
   reach a large handful of parched corn to some trembling sinner, and
   enable him to eat and be satisfied.

                               From Death To Life

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY EVENING, JULY 26, 1863, BY THE REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   The Lord kills and makes alive: He brings down to the grave, and brings
   up."

   1 Samuel 2:6.

   THIS sentence occurs in the very remarkable song of Hannah, who was
   equally illustrious as a poetess and prevalent as a suppliant. She
   sings an experimental song, for her deep sorrow had been a living death
   to her, and her joyful exaltation was a triumphant resurrection. Her
   hymn is a golden bracelet set with the jewels of sparkling contrasts.
   And this verse, with its vivid opposition between life and death,
   restoration and the grave, bears in it diamonds of the finest quality.
   Like the ewes in the Canticles, this verse bears twins.

   There is the double blessing of Othniel's wife in this text--it has
   both the upper and the nether springs as its inheritance. It has its
   own plain and natural meaning, which lies upon its surface like dust of
   gold. It has, moreover a spiritual meaning, which needs to be dug for
   like silver in the mine.

   I. In reference to ITS FIRST AND MOST MANIFEST MEANING, "The Lord
   brings down to the grave and brings up." Here the agency of God, in
   life and death, is clearly revealed to us. How well it is to discern
   the Lord's hand in everything. Our Puritan forefathers were custom to
   speak of God as restraining the bottles of Heaven, or sending a
   gracious rain; as sending forth the wind, or hiding it in His
   storehouse. But we have grown so wise that we begin to understand how
   the rain is formed, and we talk about the winds as if we had been into
   the chambers from which they come howling forth and had discovered all
   the secrets of the universe.

   We ascribe events to second causes, to the laws of nature, and I know
   not what. I think it were far better if we would go back to the good
   old way of talking and speaking of the Lord as being in everything.
   While we do not deny the laws of nature, nor decry the discoveries of
   science, we will suffer none of these to be hung up as a veil before
   our present God. O foolish wisdom, which widens the distance between me
   and my heavenly Father! O sweet simplicity of love, which sees the God
   of love in every place, at every hour! I need no telescope to see my
   God--behold, O sons of men, He is here--and my heart joyfully perceives
   Him.

   God is in life and death, in sickness and in health. This, surely, will
   soften the pains of sickness and gild the joys of recovery. If you look
   upon sickness and restoration as merely the products of natural causes,
   you will not feel humbled when you are stretched upon the bed, nor
   grateful when you walk out again, and breathe the fresh air. But if you
   see God's finger in touching your bones and your flesh, you will be
   humbled under the chastisement. And if you discern His hand in
   restoring your youth, like the eagle's, you will be able, like David,
   to say, "Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not all His benefits."

   Let others forget God if they will, that is the attribute of the
   wicked. But let His saints remember Him and let them speak well of His
   name and have it in their mouths all the day long--

   "It is God who lifts our comforts high, Or sinks them in the grave."

   This most precious fact should produce several gracious results in our
   hearts.

   First of all, it should awaken gratitude. What a mercy it is that we
   are here this evening! You would think it more a mercy, perhaps, if
   certain of yonder seats had been left unoccupied because those who sat
   there but a few days ago have gone the way of all flesh. If those pews
   could tell you where their former owners now are, you would praise the
   preserving hand of God far more heartily. Why, I looked just now with
   solemn gaze upon a spot where was custom to sit one who has heard me
   preach for years, but God has lately called him to His bar.

   And I turn my head and look upon another spot--just there--where used
   to sit another friend, but this last week, while journeying in Wales
   for his health, he ran down a slope on one of the beautiful mountains a
   little more rapidly than he should have done. The fence at the bottom
   gave way and he was precipitated into an eternal world. Even in our
   recreations, what dangers dog our heels!

   You sometimes smile at old-fashioned people who thank God for
   "journeying mercies," and "journeying protections," but, indeed, such
   petitions are as fitting as ever they were. I always like to offer to
   my God thanksgivings for mercies known and mercies unknown. Christ had
   unknown sufferings and we enjoy, as the result, unknown mercies. When
   we know that--

   "Dangers stand thick through all the ground,
   To push us to the tomb,
   And fierce diseases wait around, To hurry mortals home," our
   preservation from these dangers should make us bless our God, "who
   redeems our life from destruction." Glory be to that solitary arm which
   shields us from a vast array of foes!
   While it causes gratitude, dear Friends, it should compel consideration
   and lead us to pray that sickness and health may be sanctified to us.
   "The Lord brings down to the grave," and it is His rule never to do
   anything without a purpose. "He does not afflict willingly nor grieve
   the children of men for nothing." There is always a "needs be," if "we
   are in heaviness through manifold temptations." Is it not the part of
   wisdom to say, with Job, "Show me why you contend with me?" Should not
   the sick chamber be a place where we should seek God?
   Indeed, where is there a place in which we should not seek Him?
   Brethren, we ought to ask the sanctified use of everything. Are we not
   to ask a blessing at the table upon our every meal? What is there,
   then, upon which we do not need the blessing of God? But especially do
   we need it upon our trials. Ask a blessing, my Brothers and Sisters,
   upon your troubles. Say grace over a table which is not so well loaded
   as it used to be. Say grace over broken bones and aching heads, over
   pains and pangs and partings, for there you want Divine Grace more than
   anywhere else, with the exception, it is true, of your prosperity--and
   there, likely enough, you need a double portion of His Spirit.
   If we have been lifted up from the couch of languishing and suffering,
   then let us quietly expect the comfortable fruits of righteousness
   which are afterwards to be brought forth in those who are exercised
   with trials. Let us pray God that the pruning may make us bring forth
   more fruit. That the filing may make us shine the more brightly. That
   the furnace may consume our dross, and the deep rivers drown our
   follies. If the rod shall scourge our sloth to death, and the staff
   shall strengthen our faith, both rod and staff shall be seen to be in
   the Lord's hands and shall therefore comfort us.
   I think you will all agree with me, too, that the Lord's bringing us
   low and raising us up again, should cause great searching of heart.
   Suppose I had died when last I was sick--was I then prepared to die?
   Woman, you remember when you last were stretched upon that sickbed and
   even the physician had given you up for hopeless? God spared you. But
   if He had not, where now would your soul be? Let your conscience answer
   that question and it may be that it will make you tremblingly say, "I
   should have been like unto them that go down into the pit."

   If it had been your lot, my Hearers, some of you to have perished as
   this friend of ours has done during the past week,

   1 dare not have said of you, "Lord, we thank You that it has pleased
   You to take this, our Brother, to Yourself." I could not have uttered a
   sentence of hope concerning you. I should have forged a lie had I
   comforted your friends by holding out a fraction of hope concerning
   your soul's salvation, for alas, are there not some of you who are
   Gospel-hardened, and grow worse rather than better?

   While we are preaching to you, and pleading with you, and weeping for
   you to turn to Christ; and while we are trying to lift up Jesus upon
   His Cross in the hope that the Spirit may thereby attract you, you are
   getting to look upon the Gospel as an old, old tale, and upon the
   preacher himself as one whom you have heard so often, that really he is
   growing quite tedious and dull. Ah, there are some of you whom I could
   stir once, as a thunderclap, or a flash of lightning would have
   startled you, but you can almost sleep under my voice now. God knows I
   am willing enough to confess my own lack of zeal and earnestness.

   But still, my Hearers, it is not thatwhich keeps some of you from
   coming to Christ. It is because you keep putting off the day of
   repentance by perpetual procrastination. You live in a continual
   suicide, always destroying your own soul. Meanwhile, that which does
   not melt you, hardens you, and so you grow worse and worse, ripening
   like tares for the fire. My dear Friends, let the judgments of God lead
   you to try your hearts and to see what your state before God may be.
   "Beware lest He take you away with His stroke: then a great ransom
   cannot deliver you."

   To those of us who are Believers in Christ, restoration from sickness,
   and the privilege of again coming up to God's House after an absence
   from it through illness, should suggest renewed activity. Hurry up!
   Hurry up! For behind you are the flying wheels of the chariot of Death,
   and the axles are growing red hot with speed. Fly, Man, if you would
   accomplish your lifework, for you have not a moment to spare! I think I
   see my work before me--the wheat ripe unto the harvest--"broad acres
   and wide fields"--multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision!

   "Arise," says the Master, "reap for me!" I have reaped until my arm
   aches and my head swims. I wipe the hot sweat from my weary brow and
   would gladly rest awhile, but He says, "Reap! Reap! Reap! Reap while
   the morning's dew is falling! Reap while the hot sun scorches the
   ripening corn! Reap while the sun is setting! Reap until he has quite
   gone down. Then you shall rest from your labors. But until then your
   work shall not be done!" Am I to reap alone?

   My Brothers and Sisters, there are many new, bright sickles--here is
   one for each of you. Up and to the fields, my fellow reapers! Men and
   women, up from your lethargy! Woe unto you that are at ease in Zion,
   who lie upon beds of down and forget that men are making their beds in
   Hell! Get up and begin to be troubled for the sorrows of God's people,
   for the deaths of sinners, for the destruction of this great city. If
   ever Jonah's soul was stirred within him as he thought of Nineveh, much
   more ought yours and mine to be stirred with the burden of this great
   London.

   There is no time to waste. Men are dying! Hell is filling! How dare you
   loiter! Again I sound the alarm. Work, O you saints of the Lord, with
   all your might! Work with both your hands, by night and by day! Sow
   beside all waters! In the morning sow your seed and in the evening
   withhold not your hand. Let, then, the nearness of death and the
   shortness of life be to us as double spurs to stimulate our jaded
   spirits to fresh action.

   What need I say more? You who are scholars in the college of affliction
   are more fit to instruct me than I am to teach you. I shall but add
   this one thought--surely, if it is the Lord who brings down to the
   grave--and He may do it at any day, we ought to be very watchful. Are
   we not, many of us, like the virgins of the parable? We have fallen
   asleep. We have our lamps with us, but are not they almost out? It is
   the dead hour of night and all things are quiet. I think I hear a cry
   which ought to startle every sleeper--"Behold, the Bridegroom comes! Go
   out to meet Him!"

   Can you sleep after that? Do I not see you startled? You rub your
   drowsy eyes. You look at your lamps and you find the oil gone. You seek
   to trim them and the cry fills you with alarm and confusion, "Behold,
   the Bridegroom comes! Go out to meet Him!" But some of you have no oil,
   and now you try to borrow it where it is not to be had. Alas for you,
   for you will be shut out, and shut out forever! Others of you have oil
   in your vessels, but you need hastily to trim your lamps or else the
   Bridegroom will come and find you sleeping.

   The Lord grant that as He may come today, as you, sitting there in your
   seat, may die. As I, standing here, may cease to breathe before the
   next word shall come from my lips, we may all be ready--

   "That awful, that tremendous day, Is coming, who shall tell? For as a
   thief Unheard, unseen, it steals with silent pace Through night's dark
   gloom. Perhaps as here I stand, And rudely talk of these tremendous
   themes, Soon shall the tongue be checked, and dumb the mouth That lisps
   the faltering strain. O Power supreme, You Guardian of my life,
   Preserve me from a dread surprise in death. From ways where I might
   weep to find a grave, Keep You Your servant by Your mighty Grace. O may
   Your heavenly summons never disturb, Nor come unwelcome, to my waiting
   heart But find me rapt in meditation high, Hymning my great Creator! Or
   in prayer, Bringing the blessing down upon the crowd; In earnest work
   for Jesus, lifting up His Cross and glory of His saving name." Be
   watchful, Brothers and Sisters, for the Lord brings down to the grave,
   and from that grave He brings us not up again to work, though He will
   bring us up to the reward and to the rest which remain for the people
   of God. I shall now leave the text as it stands naturally. And briefly,
   but O may the Spirit of God help me to do it earnestly, try to speak of
   it in a spiritual sense.

   II. OUR TEXT SEEMS TO INDICATE A STATE OF HEART THROUGH WHICH THOSE
   PASS WHO ARE BROUGHT TO GOD. There always is, in every case, though not
   to the same degree, a stripping time before there is a clothing time.
   There must be an emptying before there is a filling. There is the
   digging out of the foundations before the building up of the house.
   There is a time in which this verse is fulfilled--"The Lord kills and
   makes alive: He brings down to the grave and brings up."

   Let me describe now, for the comfort of those who are passing through
   the same, what that state of heart is in which the Lord brings down to
   the grave. I shall speak now experimentally, for if there breathes one
   soul on earth that can speak experimentally here, I am that man.

   The sinner is led, first of all, to hear his own sentence pronounced.
   He was getting careless and thoughtless before, but now he is brought
   to think Thinking, he perceives his sins. Perceiving his sins, he fears
   an angry God looking down from Heaven, no, with His sword drawn,
   reaching down from Heaven, to smite him on account of his iniquities.
   Well do I remember when I stood speechless at God's bar. Not a word had
   I to answer Him with for one sin of a thousand.

   When I read, "Cursed is everyone that continues not in all things which
   are written in the Book of the Law, to do them," I knew that that curse
   was upon me, for I had not continued in anything, much less in all
   things'written in the Book of the Law. It seemed to me as though I saw
   the Judge open the book. Not to read my indictment--for that had
   already been published--but to proclaim the sentence. The trial had
   been gone through. I myself had made confession of my crimes, and now
   the Judge put on the black cap and commanded me to be taken to the
   place from which I was to suffer eternal wrath.

   When that sentence was to be executed He did not tell me, but it
   appeared to me as if it must come the next moment. And if it did come,
   I knew I could not blame the justice of God, for I deserved it well. Is
   that your position? Oh, where are you tonight, poor condemned Sinner?
   Perhaps I cannot see you, for the crowd is great, nor can you see me,
   for you are in a corner, but yet you are bowing your head and saying,
   "Ah, that is just my case. I am cursed and I deserve it. God is angry
   with the sinner every day, I am a sinner and deserve that anger."--

   "There is a dreadful Hell
   And everlasting pains,
   Where sinners must with devils dwell,
   In darkness, fire, and chains."

   "That is my lot," you are saying. And you are wringing your hands while
   you are speechless as to any self-justification and are only able to
   say, "It is most just. I deserve it well"?

   Further than this--the convicted sinner is often made to feel not only
   the sentence and the justice of it, but the very horror of death itself
   You may have read in the narrative of the old American war of the
   execution of deserters. They were brought out one bright morning, while
   yet the dew was on the grass and were bid to kneel down, each man in
   his coffin. And then a file of soldiers stepped forth. The word was
   given and each man fell down in his coffin in which he was to be
   buried. Such things as the punishment of deserters are common in every
   war, but what must be the horror of the man who stands there, knowing
   that the bullet is waiting to reach his heart?

   In the old wars, they used to have a black heart sown on the man's
   breast and all the soldiers were to take aim and fire at that. Why the
   man must suffer a thousand deaths while he stood waiting for the word
   of command! I have stood there, spiritually. And there are hundreds
   here who have thus faced their eternal doom. They have felt the horrors
   of death get hold upon them and the pangs of Hell encompass them--and
   they have found trouble and sorrow. O Sinners, if you know yourselves,
   you will soon feel this, for do you not know that if you are without
   Christ, you are standing in that position now?

   The great guns of the Law, charged to the muzzle, are all pointed at
   you. They do but wait the fatal moment when the uplifted finger of
   Justice shall bid them be discharged. And where will you be then? Lost
   beyond hope! Ruined beyond remedy! Beware, Sinner, beware of this.
   "Well," says one, "that is the horror which I felt tonight. I felt as I
   came along that it was a wonder the earth did not open and swallow me
   up. And though I am now in God's House, I feel as if such a wretch as I
   am ought not to be in the company of the faithful. I wonder that I am
   still alive. I am ready to cry out with the hymn writer--

   "Tell it, unto sinners tell; I am, I am out of Hell."

   Ah, dear Friends, this is another part of the experience through which
   many are called to go before the Lord who brings them down to the grave
   and vouchsafes to bring them up again.

   Then there is yet a further death which the convicted sinner is made to
   feel and that is the death of inability. While we are unregenerate, we
   think that we can do everything. Nothing is so easy, we imagine then,
   as believing. It is mere child's play to pray to God, only a trifle to
   turn to God, and get a new heart. Yes, but when man begins to work in
   real earnest, he finds it a very different thing. He feels like one in
   a swoon. There lies a woman who has fainted. You tell her it is but to
   put up her finger, to open her eyes, to move her limbs, to walk into
   the fresh air, to drink a draught of water, and to recover. Yes, but
   she cannot do any of these things!

   In one sense she can. The faculties are there, but they are all in a
   dormant state and so utterly powerless that all the woman is conscious
   of is her inability. Such is the state of the sinner when under a sense
   of guilt. He feels that deadly swoon of death into which Adam threw all
   his children. Now he moans most wretchedly, in words like those of good
   old John Newton--

   "I would, but cannot sing, I would, but cannot pray. For Satan meets me
   when I try, And frightens my soul away. I would, but can't repent,
   Though I endeavor often. This stony heart can never relent Till Jesus
   makes it soft. I would, but cannot love, Though wooed by love Divine.
   No arguments have power to move A soul so base as mine.

   could I but believe! Then all would easy be;

   1 would, but cannot--Lord, relieve, My help must come from You!"

   He feels himself brought into a perfect state of death, as if a stupor
   had gone through every nerve and frozen every muscle rigidly in its
   place. Even the lifting of his little finger to help himself appears to
   be beyond his power. I am glad, dear Friend, you are brought here, for
   I know the Lord never does empty a soul thoroughly of all
   creature-strength without very soon showing what the Creator can do! If
   He has brought you down to this grim sepulcher of corruption, dishonor,
   weakness, and self-despair, He will shortly bring you up again. It is
   when you are strong that I am afraid of you. But when you are weak,
   then my hopes are high.

   The climax of your disease is just the dawn of my hopes. Your direst
   poverty is the time when I expect to see you enriched--for when you are
   completely emptied and have nothing, then Jesus Christ will be your
   strength and your salvation. Trust Him to be your All in All now that
   you are nothing at all. There must, at least in some degree, be a sense
   of thus being brought down to the grave before there will be a bringing
   up again.

   No doubt, the man now sees death written upon all his hopes. There was
   a door through which I had hoped to enter eternal life. I had spent
   much time in painting it, and making it comely to look upon. It seemed
   to me to have a golden knocker, a marble threshold, and posts and
   lintels of mahogany--and I thought it was the door of life for me. But
   now what do I see? I see a great black Cross on it, and over it there
   is written, "Lord, have mercy upon us." This door is the door to Heaven
   by my own good works, which I thought full sure would always be open to
   me.

   But lo, I see that all my best works are bad and, "Lord, have mercy
   upon us," is the highest thing my works can produce for me! Still I
   must cry, even over them, "God have mercy upon my good works. Forgive
   me for my best deeds, for I need to be forgiven even for these." The
   death of legal hope is the salvation of the soul. I like to see legal
   hope swung up like a traitor. There let him hang to rot before the sun,
   more cursed than any other that was ever hanged on a tree. O, Soul,
   have done with him, for while you are so fond of him, while you treat
   him with the best you have, and set him at the head of your table, you
   are ruined. But when you slay him and drive him from you, then it is
   that your joy and your hope begin. No more, then, concerning this
   death--"The Lord brings down."

   But now a word or two of comfort for any of you who are brought down to
   this spiritual grave. There are many precious promises for such.
   "Awake, you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give
   you light." "Though you have lain among the pots, yet shall you be as
   the wings of a dove covered with silver and her feathers with yellow
   gold." Remember the experience of Jonah--"For You had cast me into the
   deep, in the midst of the seas. And the floods compassed me about: all
   Your billows and Your waves passed over me. Then I said, I am cast out
   of Your sight. Yet I will look again toward Your holy temple...I went
   down to the bottoms of the mountains. The earth with her bars was about
   me forever: yet have You brought up my life from corruption, O Lord my
   God."

   Let the hope of Jeremiah be your consolation--"But though He cause
   grief, yet will He have compassion according to the multitude of His
   mercies. For He does not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of
   merit." You that are brought very low, you feel that you are wounded
   tonight. Do you not know how many promises there are to the wounded
   ones? "He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds." Was
   not Jesus Christ sent on purpose for this--"to bind up the
   broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of
   the prison to them that are bound?" The name of our God is
   "Jehovah-Rophi: the Lord that heals you."

   His own words are, "I will restore health unto you and I will heal you
   of your wounds." "I have seen his ways and will heal him: I will lead
   him, also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners." You are
   tonight like the dead. Do you not remember that passage in Ezekiel,
   fraught with rich mercy to you, where the Lord speaks concerning
   Israel, that they said their bones were dry, their hope was lost, and
   they were cut off from their parts? But, nevertheless, He would raise
   them up and they should live in His sight? "Therefore prophesy and say
   unto them, Thus says the Lord God, Behold, O My people, I will open
   your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you
   into the land of Israel.

   "And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves,
   O My people, and brought you up out of your graves, and shall put My
   Spirit in you and you shall live and I shall place you in your own
   land: then shall you know that I, the Lord, have spoken it and
   performed it, says the Lord." Remember how Hosea, speaking of the dead
   who were slain as you are, says, "The third day He will raise us up and
   we shall live in His sight"? And that passage we read just now--"I kill
   and I make alive"--do you not see the comfort of it?

   That "and" is a diamond rivet, joining the two sentences together. You
   cannot separate the, "I kill," from the, "I make alive," for where God
   kills by His Spirit, He always quickens by the same. He does not in
   this life kill our legal hopes and our carnal security without
   by-and-by making us alive. You will tell me that the Lord has withdrawn
   from you. But, oh, what a multitude of promises there are for you! "For
   a small moment have I forsaken you. But with great mercies will I
   gather you." "If any walk in darkness and see no light, let him trust
   in the name of the Lord." So that though you have lost the comfortable
   hope of His love, you are still to trust in Him.

   "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him," said Job. And so do you,
   though you are slain, still trust--for there is still ground for
   trust--no sinner was ever brought too low for God to bring him up
   again. Others have been as low as you are now. Remember Heman the
   Ezrahite, whose mournful notes we read just now in the eighty-eighth
   Psalm. What words are these--"You have laid me in the lowest pit, in
   darkness, in the deeps. Your wrath lies hard upon me and You have
   afflicted me with all Your waves...I am afflicted and ready to die from
   my youth up: while I suffer Your terrors I am distracted. Your fierce
   wrath goes over me. Your terrors have cut me off"?

   Yet this man of God received comforts, after all, from the God of his
   salvation. You yourself are not brought so low as you would be if you
   had a still clearer view of your sins. Remember, God's mercy is so
   great that you may sooner drain the sea of its water, or deprive the
   sun of his light, or make space too narrow--than diminish the great
   mercy of God. So that though brought to the very last pinch, and dead
   like the free among the slain that go down into the pit, you may still
   find mercy in the Lord our God.

   Let me beg you never to be satisfied until you get a Savior. Do not be
   content with any comfort short of faith in Christ. Do recollect, dear
   Friends, that you must not be satisfied because you have good desires,
   or because you experience holy feelings. When friends say to you, "God
   has begun the good work in you, and you may be content, for He will
   carry it on"--remember, you can never be sure that God has begun the
   good work till you have believed in Christ. Believe in Jesus Christ!
   That is, as far as you are concerned, the first clear proof that God
   has begun a saving work in you.

   And it is for you, though dead and ruined, though swooning and
   fainting, and unable to do anything as of yourself, to swoon into the
   arms of the Savior. It is for you to faint, as many a child has done,
   into its father's arms--to die in the bosom of the Savior and lie
   buried in His grave. Oh, this is a happy, happy way of being
   nothing--that Christ may be All in All. And now I close, for time fails
   us, by just noticing, that where God has thus killed and brought down,
   we may rest assured He will certainly bring up again.

   Beloved Friends, the Lord does not send His Holy Spirit to bring
   sinners to a sense of their need whom He does not intend to save, for
   that were a waste of His Divine energy. He leaves reprobates, for the
   most part, to their natural hardness and impassive hearts. But those
   whom He deigns to make sensible of guilt, those whom He deigns to
   condemn in their consciences, and to write the sentence of death in
   their members--these He intends, sooner or later, to bring up again
   from their despondency. Why, it stands to reason that He will! "Ah,"
   said one good old Divine once to a fainting sinner, "You cost Christ
   too much for Him to let you perish! He bought you too dearly to let you
   be a castaway forever."

   Remember, since you are His--and we have a comfortable hope that you
   are because you sigh and cry and have a blessed hunger and thirst after
   Him--since you are His, I say, you are very precious in His sight and
   He will not, therefore, suffer you to be lost. "Oh," says one, "can I
   be a child of God after all, and yet be brought so low as I have been?"
   Some months ago, there were two women who kept a shop and they put all
   their money, some hundred pounds, in sover- eigns, under the fireplace
   at night, in a bag, to save it from thieves. The cleaning girl cleared
   away the ashes, and of course, cleared away the sovereigns, too, and
   they were swept into the dust heap.

   Well, this gold might have said to itself, "Now I am going to the dust
   heap! How worthless I am, because I am put here among the lowest
   dregs--here is a piece of old rag--and here a rotten mass of filth. I
   cannot be a gold sovereign or else I should not be cast here." Ah, but
   you see, when they came to rake the heap they raked the golden coins
   out again! The sovereigns were, by-and-by discovered. They might be in
   the ashes, but they were not to lie there forever.

   So you may be brought to feel yourselves the lowest, the worst, and the
   most useless of all creatures--but if the Lord has set His love upon
   you, you are gold in His esteem--none the less because of the ashes and
   the dunghill upon which you may be cast. And He will yet bring you up
   again. Remember, there may be a work of Divine Grace in your heart and
   yet you may not know it. There are many pebbles in the bottom of a
   river which you cannot see, but they are there. There may be some
   degree of faith and hope and love, and yet your soul may be so much
   disturbed that you cannot as yet perceive it. Or the Lord may be really
   bringing you up from the grave and yet the muddiness of your thoughts
   and the darkness of your soul's eyes may prevent your perceiving what
   the Lord is doing for you.

   Still, I repeat it, He willbring you up again. O let your faith seize
   hold on this comforting assurance. If it is not done yet, it will be in
   due time. "Well, how will it come?" says one, "how will the Lord give
   me comfort?" My dear Friend, I do not know the manner of it. It may
   come suddenly--before this service is over you may feel all the joy
   that a Believer can know. It may be that the Lord will reveal Himself
   to you as you are walking home, or tonight while you are in prayer
   before you go to your rest. Possibly it will come gradually--first the
   blade, then the ear--and then the full corn in the car.

   There are some to whom the light of life comes as the light of the
   rising sun--first a glimmering twilight. Then the ruddy hues upon the
   clouds. Then a flood of light and afterwards the sun has fully risen.
   It may be so with you. But there is one thing I know--when your hope
   does come, when God quickens you from your grave--it will be just at
   that moment when you are led to look away from your own feelings, your
   own doings, and your own willings, and to look to Christ alone.

   I heard the other day a trembling woman--I hope she will yet be
   rejoicing in the Lord--I heard her saying she was afraid she never
   should be saved. I told her I was afraid so, too, for she would not
   believe in Christ, but was always raising questions and doubts. Well,
   she said, she did not know whether the Lord had begun a good work in
   her. I told her I did not know that either, and that I did not enquire
   about it. I knew what the Gospel said and that was, "Believe on the
   Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved." But she said, perhaps it was
   not God's time. Ah, I said, "Today is the accepted time; today is the
   day of salvation."

   Ah, she said, but she could not believe. I asked her why she could not
   believe. Could she not believe what Christ said? Was He a liar? Could
   she dare to say that she could not believe her God? Well, she did not
   exactly mean that, but then there were her sins. But, I said, "The
   blood of Jesus Christ cleans us from all sin." Well, she said, she
   hoped she should have the strivings of the Spirit and that one day she
   should get right. My sister, said I, I charge you before God, your
   business is to come to Christ and to come to Christ now. But if you
   stop anywhere short of that, in any sort of feelings or experience,
   then you will never get to your journey's end.

   A believing sinner's business is with Jesus and not with the Spirit's
   operations. The Spirit works salvation in him, but he is nowhere bid to
   look to the Spirit for salvation. No man can come to the Father but by
   Christ. And no man can come to an acknowledgment of the Spirit's
   operations but by a sight of Christ. I grant you that the Spirit brings
   us to the Cross, but we do not know when we come that the Spirit is at
   work with us. By a mysterious force we come to Jesus and then
   afterwards we look back and say, "Why, it must have been the Spirit of
   God that drew me to Christ." You are not, however, to begin with
   that--you are to begin by looking at the Cross.

   Although I have been talking to you about how God wills to bring us
   down, I have not set up these feelings as a standard of experience, or
   as being the grounds of our salvation. A sense of need is a sign of our
   salvation, for no soul ever will come to live through the life of
   Christ unless he has first been slain by the great sword of the Law. No
   sinner ever comes empty-handed to Jesus till he has been knocked down
   and robbed of all the worthless trash which he prizes as jewels. But
   still, I say for all this, the thing which saves the soul is for that
   dead, helpless, swooning, feeble, lost, ruined soul, to look to Him who
   hangs on yonder Cross--where the Just suffers for the unjust, that He
   may bring us to God.

   This is how the Lord brings us up again. I know there will be some who
   will say they have not felt all I have described to any great degree or
   extent. Remember, again, I do not set this up as a standard to keep you
   from Christ. I have been preaching thus in order to catch you who do
   not come because you have terrors--not to frighten those who come with-
   out them. There are two sorts of you we have to deal with. Some of you
   say you cannot believe in Christ because you have such terrible
   convictions. You wish you had not felt them. And another class of you
   say if you had these horrible terrors, you could believe in Christ.
   There is no pleasing either of you.

   Now, remember, you that have the convictions, the Lord who brings you
   low will bring you up again. And you that have not the convictions, you
   still have this preached to you--"Jesus Christ came into the world to
   save sinners, of whom I am chief." Come to Jesus just as you are, you
   shall have such conviction as the Lord sees fit for you. You shall,
   indeed, be led in the same way as others. Though, being blind, you will
   not know at the time that it is the same way. You will be killed and
   you will be made alive. You will be emptied and you will be filled. You
   will be made nothing and Jesus shall be your All in All.

   O that my Master would bless these few rambling remarks to some of you.
   I do not like drawing the bow at a venture. I cannot stand that
   metaphor. I love to draw the bow at a certainty, to smite some of you
   and I would to God that the Lord would do that now. The Lord greatly
   blesses that class over which our dear sister, Mrs. Bartlett,
   presides--but there are still some in it who are unconverted. O that
   the Lord might bring some of them in tonight! You young women who take
   an interest in the things of God--may the Lord now decide you. I want
   to speak personally and affectionately to you now, because you may be
   in the grave before another Sunday.

   As I look around me here, I miss some of my congregation, and in such a
   large congregation as this, there are at least two who depart every
   week. I suppose, according to the natural order of things, two of you
   must die each week. And when I think of this solemn fact, I ask--where
   are the two? Where are the two who are to be the victims of death this
   week? "Perhaps they are at home, sick," you say. Ah, well, perhaps,
   also, they are here in good, strong health. Prepare to meet your God,
   young men, for you are not too young to die! And you in the Sunday
   school. I am so pleased to hear of the boys being converted and of the
   girls being brought in.

   But, O children, some of you may soon make a little hillock in the
   cemetery with your young bodies! May the Lord make you young Samuels.
   Remember, it was Samuel's mother who penned this text--may you be led
   to feel your need of Jesus and then to find Him for the salvation of
   your soul. You who are diligent in business, but are not fervent in
   spirit, you will be busy buying and selling all the week, but oh, do
   not sell your souls! "Buy the Truth and sell it not." You, gray heads,
   yonder, what a multitude of old men we always have in this assembly and
   I am glad to see the fathers here, though I often wonder how aged
   Christians can be fed by such a child as I am.

   But still, those gray hairs only make a fool's cap for you if you have
   grown old in sin as well as old in years. God help you, that you may
   yet be made babes in Grace though you are on the very verge of the
   grave.

   God add His blessing, but we will not separate till we have sung this
   one verse--and I beg none to sing it but those who deeply can feel it--

   "Just as I am, without one plea, But that Your blood was shed for me,
   And that You bid me come to You, O Lamb of God, I come, I come!"

                    The Saint'S Horror At The Sinner'S Hell

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, AUGUST 16, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Gather not my soul with sinners." Psalm 269

   WE must all be gathered in due course. When time shall have ripened the
   fruit, it must hang no longer upon the tree, but be gathered into the
   basket. When the summer's sun has perfectly matured the corn, the
   sickle must be brought forth and the harvest must be reaped. To
   everything there is a season and an end. There shall be a gathering
   time for every one of us. It may come tomorrow. It may be deferred
   another handful of years. It may come to us by the long process of
   consumption or decline. It may advance with more rapid footsteps, and
   we may in a moment be gathered to our people.
   Sooner or later, to use the expressive words of Job, the Almighty shall
   set His heart upon each of us and gather unto Himself our spirit and
   our breath. That gathering rests with God! The prayer of the Psalmist
   implies it and many Scriptures affirm it. As Young sings in his Night
   Thoughts--
   "An angel's arm can't hurl me to the grave." Accidents are but God's
   arrangements. Diseases are His decrees--fevers His servants, and
   plagues His messengers. Our mortality is immortal, till the Eternal
   wills its death. "Return, you children of men" can be spoken by none
   but our heavenly Father, and when He gives the word, return we must
   without delay.
   I do not know, my Brothers and Sisters, seeing that our death is
   certain, and remains entirely in the hands of our gracious God, that
   there is any prayer which we need to offer concerning it, except,
   "Father, into Your hands I commit my spirit." And this brief sentence,
   "Gather not my soul with sinners." Scarcely can I commend those who
   plead to be delivered from sudden death, for sudden death is sudden
   Glory! Hardly can I advise you to request a hasty departure. For flesh
   and blood shrink from speedy dissolution. Pray not for long life, nor
   for an early grave--cheerfully leave all these matters to the choice of
   infinite Wisdom, and concentrate all your desires upon the one desire
   of the text.
   Filled with a holy horror of the Hell of sinners, let us make most sure
   of our calling to the Heaven of the blessed. Let the fear of being cast
   forth with the withered branches increase our fruitfulness, and let our
   horror of the sinner's character and doom lead us to cleave more
   closely to the Savior of souls.
   We will divide our discourse thus--first, the gathering, and here let
   us behold a vision. Next, the prayer, and here let us note an example.
   Thirdly, a fear, and here let us observe a holy anxiety. And then
   fourthly, an answer yielding a consolation.
   I. First, THE GATHERING. Let the man who has his eyes open behold the
   gathering of sinners, and in the sanctuary of the Lord let him
   understand their end. There have been many partial gatherings of the
   ungodly, all ending in sudden ruin and overthrow. Turn your eyes here.
   Two hundred and fifty men have impudently taken censers into their
   hands and have dishonored the Lord's chosen servants, Moses and Aaron.
   Mark well their proud reviling of the Lord's Anointed. In the
   gainsaying of Korah they all have a part. The people hasten from their
   tabernacles and they stand alone. It is but for a moment. Look! The
   earth cleaves asunder. They go down alive into the pit and the earth
   closes her mouth upon them. My soul trembles and hides her face for
   fear--and my fainting heart groans out her desire--"Gather not my soul
   with sinners"!
   Look yonder, my Brothers and Sisters, to the city of palm trees
   surrounded by its strong munitions. All the inhabitants are gathered
   together within it. From the top of the walls they mock the feeble band
   of silent Israelites, who for six days have marched round and round
   their city. The seventh day has come and the rams' horns give the
   signal of destruction. The Lord comes forth from His rest, and at the
   terror of His rebuke the walls of Jericho fall flat to the ground. Now
   where are your boastings, O congregation of the wicked? The sword of
   Israel is bathed in your blood, O accursed sons of
   Canaan. As we hear the shriek of the slaughtered and mark the smoke of
   the city ascending up to Heaven like the flames of Sodom of old, we
   reverently bow the knee unto Jehovah and cry, "Gather not my soul with
   sinners."

   Leaping over centuries--with weeping we behold the Holy City, beautiful
   for situation--once the joy of the whole earth, but now forsaken of her
   God--and beleaguered by her foes. All the Jewish people have come
   together from the four winds of Heaven--as the flesh is cast into the
   caldron and the fire burns fiercely, so are they gathered together for
   judgment. Well might their rejected Messiah weep over the devoted city
   as He remembered how often He would have gathered her children together
   as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings and they would not. Now
   are they gathered in another manner--and the wings of vultures flutter
   over them, hastening for the prey.

   See yonder the Roman armies and the mounds which they have cast up! Woe
   unto you, O city of Zion--for the spoilers know no pity. They spare
   neither young nor old. "Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that
   never bare, and the paps which never gave suck." For the day of the
   Lord's vengeance is come and the words of Moses are fulfilled, when he
   said--"The Lord shall bring a nation against you from afar, from the
   end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flies. A nation whose tongue
   you shall not understand. A nation of fierce countenance, which shall
   not regard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young.

   "And you shall eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons
   and of your daughters, which the Lord your God has given you, in the
   siege and in the desperate straits, wherewith your enemies shall
   distress you." Hark! The clarion summons the warrior to arms. The
   veterans of Vespasian and Titus dash to the assault. Where are you now,
   O city polluted with the murder of Prophets, and stained with the blood
   of the Prophets' Lord? Your walls protect not your sons, they keep not
   the temple of your glory. Look! A soldier's ruthless hand hurls the red
   firebrand into the sacred precincts of the Temple, and its smoke
   darkens the sky!

   Can you walk those smoldering ruins and behold the heaps of ashes
   mingled with burning flesh--the crimson streams of gore--and the deep
   pools of clotted blood? Can you linger there where desolation holds her
   reign supreme and refuse to see the justice of the God of Israel, or
   fail to breathe the humble prayer of the Psalmist, "Gather not my soul
   with sinners"? Wherever the enemies of God are gathered, there we have,
   before long, confusion and tears and death in whatever place sinners
   may hold their counsels. When the Judge of all the earth comes out
   against them, we soon see an Aceldama--a field of blood.

   But, forgetting all these inferior gatherings, illustrious in horror
   though they are, my eyes behold a greater gathering which is proceeding
   every day to its completion. Every day the heavens and the earth hear
   the voice of God, saying, "Gather you, gather you My foes together,
   that I may utterly destroy them." "Therefore wait you upon Me, says the
   Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is
   to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms to pour upon
   them My indignation, even all My fierce anger: for all the earth shall
   be devoured with the fire of My jealousy."

   As the huntsman, when he goes forth to the battle, encompasses the
   beasts of the forest with an ever narrowing ring of hunters--that he
   may exterminate them all in one great slaughter--so the God of Justice
   has made a ring in His Providence round about the sinful sons of men.
   Within that circle of Divine power are imprisoned monarchs and
   peasants, peers and paupers. That ring encompasses all nations, polite
   or barbarous, civilized or rude. No impenitent sinner can break through
   the lines. As well might a worm escape from within a circle of flame.
   Every hour the lines grow narrower, and the multitudes of the Lord's
   enemies are driven into the center where His darts are flying, where
   His sharp arrows shall pierce them.

   I hear the baying of the dogs of Death today, hounding the unbelieving
   to their doom. I see the heaps of slain, and mark the terrible arrows
   as they fly with unerring aim. Multitudes of sinners are scattered from
   the equator to the poles, but not one of them is able to escape the
   Avenger's hand. High and haughty princes, boasting their imperial pomp,
   fall like antlered stags, smitten with the shafts of the Almighty.
   Their valiant warriors, like wild boars of the forest, perish upon the
   point of His glittering spear.

   The vision of the Apocalypse is no mere dream. He whose name is THE
   WORD OF GOD, shall tread the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of
   Almighty God. And meanwhile, the angel standing in the sun cries with a
   loud voice to all the fowls which fly in the midst of Heaven, "Come and
   gather yourselves together into the supper of the great God: that you
   may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of
   mighty men: and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them: and
   the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great."

   At the remembrance of all this, we may well exclaim with Habakkuk,
   "When I heard, my belly trembled. My lips quivered at the voice:
   rottenness entered into my bones and I trembled in myself, that I might
   rest in the day of trouble: when He comes up unto the people, He will
   cut them in pieces with His troops." O God of all Grace, I pray You, by
   the atoning sacrifice of Jesus in which I trust, "Gather not my soul
   with sinners." Let that Providence which gathers Your people from among
   men, lay hold on me. Let Your angels who keep watch and ward about Your
   people, keep me from the snare of the fowler and from the destruction
   which wastes at noonday.

   But the scene changes--we see no longer the assembling of the
   multitudes in the great valley of the shadow of death--we track them
   further till we find ourselves on the threshold of the abode of
   spirits. You have seen the prisoners in their cells, waiting for their
   trial at the next assize. The strong hand of Law has laid them in
   durance, where they await the summons to appear before the judge. I
   pray you note the company and before the trumpet announces the judge,
   see what a strange gathering the prison contains. Do you mark them?
   There is the murderer, with blood-red hands. There is he who smote his
   fellow to his wounding. Yonder lies the wretch who perjured himself
   before God.

   And here the man who pilfered his neighbor's goods. However they
   differed from one another before, they are on a level in rank in this
   house of detention--and they all await one common jail delivery. It is
   no pleasant sight to visit these cells before the assize comes on.
   Crime, although as yet not condemned, is no comfortable vision. But
   what of earthly prisons? My heart sees a sight far more terrible--

   "Look down, my soul, on Hell's domains, That world of agony and pains!
   What crowds are now associated there, Of widely different character.
   What wretched ghosts are met below, Some once so great, so little no w;
   So gay, so sad, so rich, so poor; Now scorned by those they scorned
   before."

   Multitudes are gathered together in the state where souls abide until
   their final doom is pronounced, both on their bodies and on their
   souls. It is a place of misery where not a drop of water cools their
   parched tongue. A state of doubt and terror and suspense--a place from
   which consolation is banished, where the "wrath to come" perpetually
   afflicts them. There in captivity abide the formalist, the hypocrite,
   the profane, the licentious, the abandoned, those who despised God and
   hated Christ and turned away from the glory of His Cross. There they
   are gathered, tens of thousands of them, at this day, waiting till the
   great assize shall sit. O God, "gather not my soul with sinners," but
   let me be gathered with those whose spirits wait beneath the altar for
   their redemption, to wit, the resurrection of their bodies. Gather me
   with those who cry day and night until God avenges His own elect.
   Gather me with the multitude of spirits who wait the coming of the Son
   of God from Heaven, that their bliss may be complete.

   But now, my eyes, prophetic in the light of Scripture, see another
   gathering. The trumpet has sounded, the prison doors are loosed and the
   gates of death give way. They come, bodies and souls--souls from the
   place of waiting in the pit of Hell. And bodies from their graves, from
   ocean and from earth--from all the four winds of Heaven, bodies and
   souls come together and there they stand--an exceeding great army. This
   time it is not in the valley of suspense. But "multitudes, multitudes
   in the valley of decision'" "And the Lord shall utter His voice before
   His army. For His camp is very great: for He is strong that executes
   His word: for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible: and who
   can abide it?"

   "Assemble yourselves and come, all you heathen, and gather yourselves
   together round about: there cause Your mighty ones to come down, O
   Lord. Let the heathen be wakened and come up to the valley of
   Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.
   Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down. For the
   press is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great." "And
   I saw a great white throne and Him that sat on it, from whose face the
   earth and the Heaven fled away. And there was found no place for them.
   And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God. And the books
   were opened: and another book was opened, which is the Book of Life.
   And the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the
   books, according to their works.

   "And the sea gave up the dead which were in it. And death and Hell
   delivered up the dead which were in them. And they were judged, every
   man according to their works. And whoever was not found written in the
   Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire." Oh, well may you and I
   pray that we may have a part in the first resurrection--upon such the
   sec- ond death has no power. Grant us, O Lord, that we may not be with
   the wicked, the rest of the dead, who rise not until after a thousand
   years are finished. But give us a portion among those whose iniquities
   are blotted out, who have not received the mark of the beast in their
   foreheads, who therefore live and reign with Christ a thousand years
   (Rev. 20:4).

   May we be gathered with the harvest of the Lord, when He that sits on
   the cloud shall reap it with His golden sickle. But this gathering of
   which my text speaks is not the harvest of the righteous. It is the
   vintage of the wicked. When "the angel which had power over fire" shall
   cry, "Thrust in Your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine
   of the earth: for her grapes are fully ripe." How dreadful that great
   winepress of Divine Wrath which shall be trod without the city, and how
   terrible that flow of blood, like a mighty stream of wine, so deep that
   it ran even unto the horses' bridles by the space of a thousand and six
   hundred furlongs. "Gather not my soul with sinners," O God, in that
   terrible day.

   I need not stop to paint--for colors equal to its terrors I have
   none--that dreadful place where the last gathering shall be held. That
   great synagogue of Satan, the place appointed for unbelievers and
   prepared for the devil and his angels. Where "sullen moans and hollow
   groans and shrieks of tortured ghosts" shall be their only music. Where
   weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth shall be their perpetual
   occupation. Where joy is a stranger and hope unknown. Where death
   itself would be a friend. No, I will not attempt to describe what our
   Savior veiled in words like these, "These shall go away into
   everlasting punishment." "Where their worm dies not, and their fire is
   not quenched." "Outer darkness, where shall be wailing and gnashing of
   teeth." We drop the curtain, hoping that you have seen enough to make
   you pray, "Gather not my soul with sinners."

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, when we recollect that that last gathering
   will be a perfect one. That there will be no sinner left with the
   saints--that, on the other hand, no saint will remain with sinners.
   When we recollect that it will be a final one--no redistribution will
   ever be made and that it will entail an everlasting separation--a great
   gulf being fixed, which none can cross, it remains for us to be
   solemnly anxious to be found on the right hand and to put up, with
   vehemence, this prayer--"O Lord, gather not my soul with sinners."

   II. Having thus shown the vision of the gathering, let me, with deep
   solemnity, conduct your minds for a little time to THE PRAYER ITSELF. I
   am sure we are all agreed about it, everyone of us. Balaam, if he is
   here this morning, differs not from me. The worst and most abandoned
   wretch on earth agrees with David in this. Sinners do not wish to be
   gathered with sinners. Balaam's prayer is, "Let me die the death of the
   righteous, and let my last end be like his," which only differs in
   words from David's petition, "Gather not my soul with sinners."

   But then the reasons of the one prayer are very different in different
   persons. We would all like to be saved from Hell, but then there is a
   difference in the reasons why we would so be delivered. The same prayer
   may be uttered by different lips. In the one it may be heard and
   accepted as spiritual prayer, and in the other it may be but the
   natural excitement produced by a selfish desire to avoid misery. I know
   why you would not wish to be gathered with sinners--those of you who
   are ungodly and impenitent--you dread the fire, the flames which never
   end. You dread the wrath, the suffering. You dread the horrors of that
   world to come.

   Not so with the Christian. These he dreads as all men must, but he has
   a higher and a better reason for not wishing to be gathered with
   sinners. I tell you, Sirs, if sinners could be gathered into Heaven
   with their present character, the Christian's prayer would be what it
   now is--"Gather not my soul with sinners." If sin entailed happiness.
   If rebellion against God could give bliss, even then the Christian
   would scorn the happiness and avoid the bliss which sin affords. His
   objection is not so much to Hell, as to sinners themselves. His desire
   is to avoid the contamination and distraction of their company.

   Many of you will say, "Now I dislike the company of sinners." Indeed,
   most moral people dislike the society of a certain class of sinners. I
   suppose there is scarcely one here today who would wish to be found in
   the den of the burglar, where the conversation is concerning plunder
   and violence. You would not probably feel very easy in the haunt of the
   harlot, where licentious tongues utter flippantly lascivious words. You
   shun the house of the strange woman. The pothouse is not a favorite
   resort for you. You would not feel very much at ease at the bar of the
   gin palace. You would say of each of these--"This is no joy to me."

   Even those of you who are not renewed by Christ despise vice when she
   walks abroad naked. I fear you cannot say as much when she puts on her
   silver slippers, and wraps about her shoulders her scarlet mantle. Sin
   in rags is not popular. Vice in sores and squalor tempts no one in the
   grosser shapes. Men hate the very fiend whom they love when it is
   refined and delicate in its form. I want to know whether you can say,
   "Gather not my soul with sinners," when you see the ungodly in their
   high days and holidays? Do you not envy the fraudulent merchant
   counting his gold--his purse heavy with his gains, while he himself by
   his craft is beyond all challenge by the Law?

   Do you not envy the giddy revelers spending the night in the merry
   dance, laughing, making merry with wine and smiling with thoughts of
   lust? Yonder voluptuary, entering the abode where virtue never finds a
   place, and indulging in pleasures unworthy to be named in this hallowed
   house--does he ever excite your envy? I ask you, when you see the
   pleasures, the bright side, the honors, the emoluments, the gains, the
   merriments of sin, do you then say, "Gather not my soul with sinners"?
   There is a class of sinners that some would wish to be gathered
   with--those easy souls who go on so swimmingly. They never have any
   trouble. Conscience never pricks them. Business never goes wrong with
   them. They have no bands in their life, no bonds in their death.

   They are not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued like
   other men. They are like the green bay tree which spreads on every side
   until its boughs cover whole acres with their shade. These are the men
   who prosper in the world, they increase in riches. Can we say, when we
   look at these, when we gaze upon the bright side of the wicked, "Gather
   not my soul with sinners"? Remember, if we cannot do so without
   reservation, we really cannot pray the prayer at all. We ought to alter
   it and put it, "Gather not my soul with openly reprobate sinners." And
   then mark you, as there is only one place for all sorts of sinners,
   moral or immoral, apparently holy or profane, your prayer cannot be
   heard, for if you are gathered with sinners at all--with the best of
   sinners--you must be gathered with the worst of sinners, too.

   I know, children of God, you can offer the prayer as it stands and say,
   "In all their glory and their pomp. In all their wealth, their peace
   and their comfort, my soul abhors them, and I earnestly beseech You, O
   Lord, by the blood of Jesus, 'Gather not my soul with sinners.' "

   Brethren, why does the Christian pray this prayer? He prays it, first
   of all, because as far as his acquaintance goes with sinners, even now
   he does not wish for their company. The company of sinners in this
   world to the saint is a cause of uneasiness. We cannot be with them and
   feel ourselves perfectly at home. "My soul is among lions, even among
   them that are set on fire of Hell." "Rid me from strange children." We
   are vexed with their conversation, even as Lot was with the language of
   the men of Sodom. We lay an embargo upon them--they cannot act as they
   would in our society--and they lay a restraint upon us. We cannot act
   as we would when we are with them.

   We feel an hindrance in our holy duties through dwelling in the tents
   of Kedar. When we would talk of God, we cannot in the midst of company
   to whom the very name of Jesus is a theme for jest. How can we well
   engage in family devotions when more than half the family are given up
   to the world? How can we sing the Lord's song in a strange land? You
   who sojourn in Mesech, you know how great a grief it is, what a damper
   it is to your spirituality, what a serious hindrance it is to your
   growth in Divine Grace. Besides, the company tempts Believers to sin.
   Who can keep his garment pure when he travels with sinful companions?
   If I am condemned to walk continually in the midst of thorns and
   briars, it is strange if I do not mar my garments. Often our nearest
   friends get a hold upon our hearts and then, being enemies to God, they
   lead us to do things which we otherwise would never have dreamed of
   doing.

   The company of the sinner is to the Christian a matter of real loss in
   another respect, for when God comes to punish a nation, the Christian
   has to suffer with the sinners of that nation. National judgments fall
   as well upon the holy as upon the profane, and therefore, through being
   mingled with the ungodly of this world, the Christian is a sufferer by
   famine, war, or pestilence. Well may he, from the little taste he has
   known of their company, cry, "Gather not my soul with sinners."

   Why, Brothers and Sisters, I will put you for a moment to the test--you
   shall be in the commercial room of an inn--you are on a journey and you
   sit down to attend to your own business, or to await the train. Now, if
   two or three fast men come into the room and they begin venting their
   filth and blasphemy, how do you feel? You do not wish to hear. You wish
   you were deaf. One of them cannot speak without larding his
   conversation with an oath. There is another, perhaps a man elevated
   above the situation which his education fits him to occupy, who, in his
   conversation utters the most abominable and atrocious language and the
   others laugh at him.

   Before many minutes you will steal out of the room, for you cannot
   endure it. What must it be to be shut in with such persons forever? On
   board a steamboat, it may be, you fall into the middle of a little knot
   who are talking on some infidel subject in a manner far from palatable
   to you. Have you not wished yourself on shore, and have you not walked
   to the other end of the boat to be out of their way? I know you have
   felt that kind of thing. Your blood has chilled. Horror has taken hold
   upon you because of the wicked who keep not God's Law. If such has been
   your experience, you can well understand the reason of the Psalmist's
   prayer, for much of such torment you could not bear.

   Moreover, I do not know any class of sinners whose company a Christian
   would desire. I should not like to live with the most precise of
   hypocrites. What ugly company to keep! You cannot trust them
   anywhere--always hollow--always ready to deceive and to betray you. I
   would not choose to live with formalists, self-righteous people,
   because whenever they begin to talk about themselves and their own good
   deeds, they do, as it were, throw dirt upon the righteousness of
   Christ, which is our boast--and that is ill company for a Christian.
   The Believer triumphs in the free Grace of God, the power of the Holy
   Spirit, and the efficacy of the blood of Jesus.

   But the self-righteous man speaks only of his Church attendance or his
   going to Chapel, his fasting, his almsgivings and the like. We cannot
   agree with the person who relies on his self-trust. We could almost as
   well associate with the profane as we could with the self-righteous. As
   for blasphemers, we could not endure them a moment. Would you not as
   soon be shut up in a tiger's den as with a cursing, swearing, thievish
   profligate? Who can endure the company of either a Voltaire or a
   Manning? Find out the miserly, the mean, the sneaking, the
   grasping--who likes to be with them?

   Who wants to be with the angry, the petulant who never try to check the
   unholy passion--one is always glad to be away from such folks. You are
   afraid lest you should be held responsible for their mad actions, and
   therefore if you must be with them, you are always ill at ease. With no
   sort of sinners can the child of God be a fellow. Lambs and wolves,
   doves and hawks, devils and angels are not fit companions. And so
   through what little trial the righteous have had, they have learned
   that there is no sort of sinners that they would like to be shut up
   with forever.

   But then, we have other reasons. We know that when impenitent sinners
   are gathered at the last, their characters will be the same. They were
   filthy here, they will be filthy still. Here on earth their sin was in
   the bud--in Hell it will be fullblown. If they were bad here, they will
   be worse there. Here they were restrained by Providence, by company, by
   custom--there, there will be no restraints. Hell will be a world of
   sinners at large, a land of outlaws, a place where every man shall
   follow out his own heart's most horrible inclinations. Who would wish
   to be with them?

   Then again, the place where they will be gathered alarms us--the pit of
   Hell, the abode of misery and wrath for-ever--who would be gathered
   there? Then, their occupation. They spend their time in cursing God--in
   inventing and venting fresh blasphemies. They go from bad to
   worse--climbing down the awful ladder of detestable depravity. Who
   would wish to be with them? Remember too, their sufferings. The pain of
   body and of soul they know, when God has cast both body and soul into
   Hell. Who would wish to be with them? Remember, too, that they are
   banished forever from God and God is our sun, therefore they are in
   darkness. God is our life, therefore they are worse than dead. God is
   our joy, therefore they are wretched to the extreme.

   Why, this would be Hell, if there were no other Hell to a Christian--to
   be banished from his God. Moreover, they are denied the joys of
   Christ's society. No Savior's love for them, no blissful communion at
   His right hand, no living fountains of water to which the Lamb shall
   lead them. O my God, when I think of what the sinner is, and where he
   is, and how he must be there forever, shut out from You, my soul may
   well pray with anguish that prayer, "Gather not my soul with
   sinners."--

   "You lovely chief of all my joys, You sovereign of my heart! How could
   I bear to hear Your voice Pronounce the sound 'Depart'? Oh wretched
   state of deep despair, To see my God remove, And fix my doleful station
   where I must not taste His love. Jesus, I throw my arms around, And
   hang upon Your breast; Without a gracious smile from You My spirit
   cannot rest."

   III. But I am afraid I weary you and therefore, dear Friends, let me
   take you very briefly to the third point. There is in our text A FEAR,
   as if a whisper awakened the Psalmist's ear to trembling, "Perhaps,
   after all, you may be gathered with the wicked."

   Now, that fear, although marred by unbelief, springs, in the main, from
   holy anxiety. Do you not think that some of us may well be the subjects
   of it? This holy anxiety may well arise if we recollect our past sins.
   Before we were converted we lived as others lived. The lusts of the
   flesh were ours. We indulged our members. We permitted sin to reign in
   our mortal bodies without restraint. And there will be times to the
   pardoned man, even though he has faith in Christ, when he will begin to
   think--"What if, after all, those sins should be remembered and I
   should be left out of the catalogue of the saved?"

   Then again he recollects his present backwardness. And as the little
   apple on the tree, so sour and unripe, when it sees the crabs gathered,
   is half afraid it may be gathered with them, so is he. With so little
   Grace, so little love, he is afraid he shall be gathered with the
   ungodly. He recollects his own unfruitfulness and as he sees the
   woodman going round the orchard, knocking off first this rotten bough,
   and then cutting off that other decayed branch, he thinks there is so
   little fruit on him that perhaps he may be cut off, too. And so, what
   with his past sins, his present backsliding and unfruitful-ness, he is
   half afraid he may yet have to suffer the doom of the wicked.

   And then, looking forward to the future, he recollects his own weakness
   and the many temptations that beset him. And he fears that he may fall,
   after all, and become a prey to the enemy. With all these things before
   him, I wonder not that the poor plant, set yonder in the garden, is
   half afraid that it may be pulled up with the weeds and burned on
   yonder blazing fire in the corner of the garden. "Gather not my soul
   with sinners."

   What man is there among you who has not need, sometimes, to tremble for
   himself? If any of you can say you are always confident, it is more
   than I can say. I would to God I could always know myself saved and
   accepted in Christ, but there are times when a sense of sin within,
   present evil, and prevailing corruptions make the preacher feel that he
   is in jeopardy and compel him to pray, as he does sometimes now, in
   fear and trembling, "O God, gather not my soul with sinners."

   IV. And here comes in, to conclude, THE ANSWER TO THIS PRAYER, which is
   a word of consolation. Brothers and Sisters, if you have prayed this
   prayer, and if your character is rightly described in the Psalm before
   us, be not afraid that you ever shall be gathered with sinners. Have
   you the two things that David had--the outward walking in integrity and
   the inward trusting in the Lord? Do you endeavor to make your outward
   conduct and conversation conformable to the example of Christ? Would
   you scorn to be dishonest toward men, or to be undevout toward God? At
   the same time, are you resting upon Jesus Christ's sacrifice, and can
   you compass the altar of God with humble hope? If so, then rest assured
   with the wicked you never shall be gathered, for there are one or two
   things which render that calamity impossible.

   The first is this, that the rule of the gathering is like to like.
   "Gather you together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn
   them"--all the tares together--"but gather the wheat into My barn." It
   is not, "Make a mixture of them. Throw them together in a heap--put the
   corn and the tares in My garner." Oh, no--"Tares in bundles. Wheat in
   sheaves." If then, you are like God's people, you shall be with God's
   people. If you have their life within, their character without. If you
   rest on their Savior. If you love their God. If you have a longing
   towards their holiness, you shall be gathered with them--like to like.

   There is another rule--those who have been our proper comrades here are
   to be our companions hereafter. God will be pleased to send us where we
   wish to go in this life. That is to say, if in this life I have loved
   the haunt of the sinner. If I have made the theater my sanctuary. If I
   have made the drinking house my abode of pleasure and have found my
   solace with the gambler, and my comfort with the debauched. If I have
   lived merely for business and for this world, and never for the next,
   then I shall go with my companions. I shall be sent where I used to
   go--being let go, I shall go to my own company among the lost.

   But on the other hand, if I have loved God's House. If I can say with
   the Psalmist, "I have loved the habitation of Your House and the place
   where Your honor dwells." If the excellent of the earth have been my
   companions, and the chosen of God have been my Brothers and Sisters, I
   shall not be separated from them. I shall have the same company in
   Heaven that I have had on earth. If I have walked with God here, I
   shall reign with God there. If I have suffered with

   Christ here, I shall reign with Christ hereafter. That is another thing
   which prevents your being gathered with the wicked.

   Again, you cannot be gathered with the wicked, for you are too dearly
   bought. Christ bought you with His blood and He will not cast you into
   the fire. It is a doctrine we never can hold, that Christ redeemed with
   His precious blood any that are damned in Hell. We cannot conceive it
   possible that Christ should have stood their Sponsor in suffering and
   yet they should be punished, too. That He should pay the debt and then
   they should have to pay it also.

   And again, you are loved too much. God the Eternal Father has loved you
   long and well, and proved that to you by His great gift and by His
   daily consideration and care of you. And it is not, therefore, possible
   that He should permit you, the darling of His heart, the child of His
   desire, a member of the mystical body of His only Beloved Son, to
   perish forever in Tophet.

   Again that new nature within you will not let you be gathered with
   sinners. What does your new nature do--what must it do? It must love
   God. What? Love God and be in Hell? Your new nature must pray. What?
   Pray in the pit? Your new nature must praise the God that created it.
   What? Sing songs to the Divine Being amidst the howling of the damned?
   Impossible! If you have a new heart and a right spirit. If your soul
   clings with both its hands to the Cross of Christ. If you love Jesus
   and long to be like He is, you may have this fear, but it is a
   groundless one--for you shall never be gathered with sinners! Your feet
   shall stand in the congregation of the righteous in the day when the
   wicked are cast away forever.

   I had hoped, this morning, so to have handled my text that perhaps God
   might bless it to the sinner--and who can tell it may be so? Sinner, if
   it is a dreadful thing to be gathered with you, what a frightful thing
   your gathering must be! My dear careless and thoughtless Hearer, this
   morning I have no burning words with which to awake you. I have no
   earnest tones with which to startle you. But still, from my soul I do
   entreat you consider that if it is a subject of horror to us to dwell
   with you forever, it must be an awful thing to be a sinner. And will
   you be a sinner any longer? Will you abide where you now are?

   Alas, you cannot save yourself. You are hopelessly ruined--you have
   lost all power as well as all virtue. You are as a dead thing, as a
   potter's vessel that is broken to shivers with a rod of iron. But there
   is one who can save you, even Jesus. And His saving voice to you this
   morning is, "Believe in Me and you shall be saved." To believe in Him
   is to believe that He can save you, and therefore to trust Him. Do you
   not believe that of Him who is God? Can you not believe that of Him
   whose ways are not as your ways, whose Grace is boundless, and whose
   love is free! Will you now believe that Christ can save you and that He
   will save you?--and will you now trust yourself to Him to save you?

   Say in your heart, "Here, Lord, I give my soul up to You to save it. I
   believe You will and You can. Your nature and Your name are love, and I
   trust Your name. I believe in Your goodness. I repose in You." Sinner,
   you are saved! God has saved you. No soul ever so believed in Christ
   and yet was left unpardoned. Go your way. Be of good cheer, "Your sins
   which are many, are all forgiven you." Rejoice in Him evermore, for you
   shall never be gathered with sinners. May God give His blessing to you
   now, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

                                Am I Sought Out?

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, AUGUST 23, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "You shall be called, Sought Out." Isaiah 62:12.

   THE first meaning of our text is very clear. Here is a prophecy,
   because Jerusalem, having been despoiled of her beauty by her enemies,
   was for a long time forsaken and worthy to be called, "A city which no
   man seeks after," so, in a brighter day, her glory shall return, she
   shall be an attraction to all lands and the joy of the whole earth.
   Multitudes of willing pilgrims shall seek her out that they may behold
   her beauty. She shall be a city greatly set by and greatly sought out
   by those who love the hallowed spots where the mighty deeds of the Lord
   were worked and the arm of Jehovah made bare.
   The text, doubtless, has a similar reference to the Church of God.
   During many centuries the Church of Christ was hidden--a thing obscure,
   despised, unknown, abhorred. She concealed herself in the
   catacombs--her followers were the poorest and most illiterate of
   men--proscribed by cruel laws and hunted by ferocious foes. Although
   the royal bride of Christ, and destined to be the ruler of nations, she
   made no figure in the world's eyes. She was but a little stone cut out
   of the mountain without hands. But the day is already come in which
   multitudes seek the Church of Christ. Behold, they fly as a cloud and
   as doves to their windows! They ask the way to Zion with their faces in
   that direction.
   As time rolls on and the millennial kingdom of Christ comes nearer and
   nearer, the Church of God shall be more and more sought out. From the
   ancient east and the far-off west they shall come, multitudes beyond
   all count, saying, "Tell us where is the city of the Lord, the people
   of His love?" Though this, doubtless, is the primary meaning, I
   nevertheless believe that we may, without violence to the text, use it
   in another manner in a fuller and more spiritual sense. The Church of
   God may well be called "Sought Out." And the like title may truthfully
   be applied to every single member of that dearly-loved and
   dearly-purchased family. All the children of God may take for their
   name and distinction, the words, "Sought Out."

   Without indulging in a longer preface, let us at once proceed to map
   out the plan of our present meditation. We intend to talk a little
   while upon the natural condition implied, and then upon the surpassing
   grace revealed. Our third point will be the distinguishing title
   justified, and finally, the special duty suggested.

   I. First, THE NATURAL CONDITION IMPLIED IN THE TITLE, "SOUGHT OUT." If
   the Church of God, my Brothers and Sisters, has been "sought out," then
   it is clear enough that originally it was lost--lost like that woman's
   piece of silver which she valued so much that she lit her candle and
   swept her house and searched diligently until she found it. The
   tremendous fact of man's utter ruin is the underlying cause of the
   necessity for Divine Grace to seek out its object. If the Fall had not
   been so complete in its ruin, there had been no need to seek us, for we
   should have sought the Lord. This, however, is the gloomy truth--that
   we are altogether become abominable and all flesh has perverted its
   way.

   Of this fact there can be no doubt, for you and I, who have been saved
   by Grace, know right well that we were lost-- hopelessly and forever
   lost--had not Jesus sought us out. Many of the chosen seed are suffered
   to indulge in sin until they are lost even to the presence of virtue
   and morality--lost to the hopes of the most earnest friends and the
   most affectionate entreaties of anxious relatives. Lost we all were in
   our federal head, by imputation of his sin--lost effectually by
   infusion of his corrupt nature. Lost, afterwards, by our practice.
   Lost, manifestly, by an accumulation of evil habits and the growing
   force of depraved appetites.

   We have, by nature, departed far from God and, like the prodigal, have
   gone into a far country. We are comparable to that poor wretch who was
   possessed with a legion of devils, whom fetters could not bind, nor
   chains restrain. He who said that by nature man is half brute and half
   devil, was not far from the truth. O my Brothers and Sisters, shall we
   ever know in this life how lost we were by nature? Until we can
   comprehend what "the wrath of God" means, by gazing stead- fastly into
   the pit of Hell--until we can understand the purity of God amid the
   perfection of Heaven--and so can measure the awful distance between our
   depraved condition and the perfect holiness of Jehovah, we shall not
   know how lost we were.

   But we know enough to make us shudder. Oh, when we saw, or thought we
   saw, the desperate evil of sin, then we cried out, "Lost! Lost! Lost!"
   with greater bitterness than he who sorrows for his only son, even for
   his first-born. Oh, the horrors of that terribly truthful discovery
   which showed us ourselves. We felt in our conscience that we were lost
   to everything which could commend us to God or could attract His
   regard. We knew that in ourselves there were no means of restoration to
   purity and happiness. We were utterly and entirely lost and, as I said
   before, some of us lost with a vengeance--for our outward life had
   become a foul development of the filthy fountains within.

   Aliens, enemies, rebels, traitors--what shall we say More? No name is
   too vile for us. Had we been left to lie among the broken potsherds as
   worthless refuse, or had we been swept away with every unclean and
   loathsome thing, this had been our just desert. God could not have been
   too severe, even if the lowest pit of Hell had been our portion. And
   then, my Brothers and Sisters, we were so lost that we did not seek the
   Lord. Natural men have superficial and passing thoughts of seeking God,
   but they have no true hunger and thirst after Him. Now and then a pang
   of conscience, a sickly wish after something better crosses the
   unrenewed mind.

   But as the smoke out of the chimney is blown away by the wind, so these
   hasty emotions are gone and forgotten. As the dew which trembles at
   early morn upon the hedgerow evaporates in the heat of the sun, so the
   best desires which un-regenerate men can know are soon melted away when
   once the sun of the world's temptation rises upon us. My Brothers and
   Sisters, we who know the Lord know that we had no serious effectual
   thoughts of seeking after God until He sought after us. We were
   wandering sheep, well skilled in straying, but without the will to
   return. When the Spirit of God came upon us, He found nothing in our
   hearts ready to work with Him, but everything running in the opposite
   direction. Every imagination of the thought of our heart was only evil,
   and that continually. Those who repent and seek the Lord before His
   Grace draws them to Himself must be of a different race from us, for we
   were far off and loved the distance too well to dream of returning.

   To descend still lower, my Brothers and Sisters--as we had no thought
   of coming to God--so we never should have willed to return. Left to
   ourselves, like the lost sheep, we should have wandered farther and
   farther, feeding upon yonder mountain of vanity, or skipping in the
   green valleys of sin. But back to God, to Christ, to Heaven, we never
   could or should have come. As well might water labor to ascend like
   fire, as for fallen humanity to long after God. Wolves and tigers do
   not without miracle renounce their feasts of blood, nor will man refuse
   his natural food of sin. If there is any true desire in the human heart
   towards God and His Christ, it must have been implanted there by a
   Divine power.

   God Himself in His bounty must have placed it there, for from the soil
   of nature it never could have come--at least so we have found it in our
   own case, for to this day, though we are saved, we find that the
   natural motions of our heart are all from God--none of them to God. And
   though we are His children exalted above measure by His great Grace,
   yet still the evil heart of unbelief departs from the living God and
   never does it come toward Him. O carnal Mind, you desperately evil
   thing, you are not reconciled to God, nor indeed can you be!

   God, You Giver of every good and perfect gift, had You left us until
   our nature had spontaneously desired renewal, and our hearts had panted
   after Your salvation, You would have left us forever! For we would have
   chosen the downward path and the lusts of the world we would have
   sought! The text, I think, implies all this, for God never works
   unnecessary wonders, and if we could have come to Him, or would have
   come to Him without His seeking us, doubtless He would have left us to
   that free will of which some boast so much. Brethren, we were lost,
   lost without a wish to return and without a possibility of ever having
   such a wish.

   1 must go further--our lost estate is strewn yet more clearly in the
   fact that, so far from seeking God, we did not desire Him to seek us.
   Till He first inspired the wish to be found, we resisted His seeking.
   So far from asking Him to visit us with His salvation, when He did
   come, we took up arms against our gracious Friend. Well do I remember
   those early strivings of the Spirit with my youthful heart which I
   choked one after the other with a resolute determination. Well can I
   recollect those strong wrestlings, when it seemed as if the Spirit of
   God would separate me from my sins and I must lay hold on Christ and
   yet, determined still to abide in sin and self-righteousness, I stood
   out against the Lord and would not have "that Man" to reign over me.

   Ah, how long did Jesus stand and knock at our door, so long that He
   might well cry as He does in the Canticles, "My head is wet with dew
   and My locks with the drops of the night." We would not let Him
   in--instead of rising to open, we sought to fasten every bolt and to
   send every bar home. We turned the horrible key of our self-will in the
   wards of the lock, with a, "depart from us, we desire not the knowledge
   of Your ways." Ah, my Brothers and Sisters, if He sought us out, it was
   not because we had a will towards Him, or because we were importunate
   in prayer. Our will was His great opponent. We were desperately set on
   mischief, and if we had not been sought out by Sovereign Grace, saved
   we never would have been--

   "'Twas Your love, O God, that knew us, Earth's foundations long before.
   That same lo ve to Jesus drew us, By its sweet constraining power, And
   will keep us Safely, now and evermore."

   To complete the story of this, our natural condition, I must add that
   our being sought out, considering our condition, was one of the
   greatest wonders ever known or heard of. I have heard this expressed in
   words occasionally. When a man has come to join the Church, he has said
   to me, "If anyone had told me six months ago that I should make a
   profession of being a follower of Christ, I would have knocked him
   down. If anyone had said to me ,'You will repent of your sins and seek
   and find a Savior,' I should have laughed him to scorn. 'I am no such
   fool,' I would have said, as to become one of your canting hypocritical
   Methodists--such a thing can never be.' " And yet the thing did occur.

   And that soul which was once like the demoniac, full of devils, comes
   to sit clothed and in its right mind at the feet of the Savior,
   rejoicing in His power to save. In everyone of us, if we have not put
   it into just such words, the Divine Grace which sought us has been
   quite as illustrious. What reason can you find why God should love you?
   How can you show any reason why He should follow you in all your
   wanderings? Why was it that He should track your devious footsteps and
   never leave you until the predestinated moment came? How was it that
   then He grappled with you and overcame-- and made you willingly bow
   your neck to His joyous yoke? You can tell no reason. You can only clap
   your hands in admiration, and lift up your heart in wonder--and bless
   and praise the Lord that your name is, "Sought Out."--

   "'Twas all of Your grace we were brought to obey While thousands were
   suffered to go The road which by nature we chose as our way, Which
   leads to the region of woe."

   Thus much concerning our natural condition. You who know it, and have
   felt it, need not my words to teach you. It is well for you to look
   often to the hole of the pit where you were drawn and the rock where
   you were hewn. A sight of your first state will humble you and fill
   your heart with praise to the God of Grace who has made you to differ.

   II. Secondly, we have in the text SURPASSING GRACE REVEALED. This grace
   lies in several particulars. First, that they were sought out at all.
   It is very wonderful Grace on the part of God that He should plan a way
   of salvation, that He should prepare a great marriage supper and issue
   the invitation to all men to come and feast. The Gospel which says to
   men, "Whosoever will, let him come and take of the water of life
   freely," is a most gracious Gospel. But there is something more
   gracious than this generous summons.

   One would have supposed that after the invitation had been freely
   given, and the preparation for the feast had been generously made, that
   the Lord would leave men to come or not as they willed. It is Divine
   Grace enough, surely, for God to provide meat for the hungry. Let them
   come and eat, and if they will not, let them starve. To prepare
   ointment for the wounded, is not that enough? If the sick will not
   accept the medicine, then let them perish for their ingratitude in
   rejecting the healing gift. Ah, but God's ways are not as our ways.
   Your bounty and mine would never dream of going any further. We never
   force our charity on unwilling recipients.

   We do not follow after diseased men and beg and plead with them to be
   made whole. Not we. We think our bounty large enough if we give to him
   that asks of us--but to seek after pensioners--this we never did and
   probably never shall do. But hear, O earth! And be astonished you
   heavens! After the general proclamation of the Gospel has been made and
   man has rejected it. After Christ has been offered to men and they have
   refused Him, God's love does not stop there, but, determined to glorify
   His love, He then comes to seek out those who will not seek Him!

   "If," says He, "you will not turn at My rebuke. If My invitation is
   trod under foot--I will do more than this--I will come out in the
   splendor of My Grace and the magnificence of My power, and I will deal
   with that will of yours and overcome it. I will touch that stubborn
   nature of yours and make you yield. 'A new heart also will I give you
   and a new spirit will I put within you.' 'You shall call Me, my Father.
   And shall not turn away from Me.' " It is a marvel of marvels, that
   sinful man fleeing from his Maker, rejecting his Creator's invitation,
   refusing to be blessed with the blessedness of God, is nevertheless
   with unparalleled perseverance and unexampled love sought out and made
   captive by Almighty love!

   But this Grace appears even more conspicuous if you consider the
   persons sought out. That any should be sought out is matchless
   Grace--but that we should be sought--is Grace beyond degree. My
   Brother, my Sister, I do not know what may have been your particular
   condition, but this I do know--you will feel that there was ten times
   more reason that you should have been left out than that you should
   have been included in the purpose of Grace. Often have I thought that I
   was the odd man. If in the muster roll of eternal life there must be
   one left out, I should myself have made the selection of my own person
   as the one most worthy to have been disregarded. Why me, Lord? Why
   me?--

   "Why was I made to hear Your voice, And enter where there's room; While
   thousands make a wretched choice, And rather starve than come?"

   Does not the same thought arise in your mind? Is not your soul stirred
   with a holy and grateful wonder that you should have been sought out?
   And when, my Brothers and Sisters, I think of some in this place--some
   who once were in the harlots' company--but who were sought out. Some of
   you who once were plunged in drunkenness, how shall I sufficiently
   praise the Lord for you? Many of you on the Sunday never listened to
   the preached Word, but sought your own pleasure and followed your own
   business--but you were sought out! Many a tongue that sung the hymn
   just now once cursed and blasphemed God. Glory be to the Divine Grace
   which sought you out!

   Yes, though such were some of us, "we are washed, we are sanctified, we
   are cleansed." And is not this a marvel that such as we are should have
   been sought out? If He had sought kings and princes we might have found
   a reason, but to seek us poor, obscure working men, illiterate, without
   ability--this is Sovereign Grace indeed! That He should seek the good,
   the moral, the excellent, we should not marvel at. But to seek us, the
   depraved, the wicked, the abandoned--how shall we glorify His name?
   Tell it in Hell and let devils howl! Publish it in Heaven and let
   angels sing! Chant it, you blood-washed ones before the Eternal Throne!
   He has chosen the base things of this world and the things that are
   not-- To bring to nothing the things that are! This is a wonder of
   wonders, that we, even we, should bear the name of "Sought Out"!

   Nor must I fail to bring to your recollection that the surpassing Grace
   of God is seen very clearly in that we were sought OUT. The word "out,"
   conveys a mass of meaning. We were not only sought, but sought out. Men
   go and seek for a thing which is lost upon the floor of the house, but
   in such a case there is only seeking, not seeking out. The loss is more
   perplexing and the search more persevering when a thing is sought out.
   We were mingled with the mire. We were as when some precious piece of
   gold falls into the sewer and men have to gather out and carefully
   inspect a heap of abominable filth. They turn it over and over and over
   and continue to stir and rake and search among the heap until the thing
   is found.

   Or, to use another figure, we were lost in a labyrinth. We wandered
   here and there and when ministering mercy came after us, it did not
   find us at the first coming. It had to go to the right hand and to the
   left and search here and there and everywhere, to seek us out. We were
   so desperately lost and had got into such a strange position that it
   did not seem possible that ever Grace could come to us. And yet we were
   sought out! No gloom could hide us, no filthiness could conceal us--we
   were found! Glory be to Divine Grace, God the Holy Spirit found us! The
   lives of some of God's people, if they could be written, would make you
   marvel. The romance of Divine Grace is infinitely more interesting than
   the romance of imagination.

   We have known persons who have run into the arms of Christ while they
   were intending to run down to Hell. Some who no more dreamed of being
   saved than of being made princes--who strolled into the House of God
   from curiosity-- and the ministers finger, or the glance of his eyes
   arrested them, and they felt the power of life Divine. Some who were
   rushing to the river to take away their own lives, but some text spoke
   to their conscience and arrested their guilty feet.

   Strange and marvelous are the ways which God has used to find His own.
   He would shake a whole nation with His strong right hand to find His
   own elect.

   He would shake all nations and bring the whole world to unparalleled
   confusion before He would suffer one of the blood-bought pearls of His
   crown to be lost among the ruins of the Fall. He must and will seek
   them out, as the shepherd seeks out his sheep in the cloudy and dark
   day--bringing some of them down from the steep summit--others from the
   caverns among the crags. Some from the river's brink, others from the
   flood itself--all must be brought into one place, where they shall form
   one fold, under one Shepherd.

   One second will suffice to hint, dear Brothers and Sisters, that the
   Grace of God is illustrious in the Divine agent by whom we are sought
   out. The text, taken in its connection, tells us that we were sought
   out divinely. Saved souls are sought out by God Himself and Omnipotence
   is strained, Omniscience is fully exercised--every attribute of God is
   put to its sternest labor to seek out lost souls! The most tremendous
   effort of Divine strength we know to be the regeneration of man. To
   bring Christ from the dead made God's name to be right honorable for
   mighty power--but to raise His people from their graves is equally a
   work of stupendous power and Grace.

   Do you ever wonder, Christian, who it was that came to seek you? It was
   not the minister. He might have sought you year after year and never
   have found you. Your tearful mother, with her many prayers, would have
   missed you. Your anxious father, with his yearning heart of compassion,
   would never have discovered you. Those providences, which like great
   nets were seeking to entangle you, would all have been broken by your
   strong rushes after evil. Who was it sought you out? None other than
   Himself. The Great Shepherd could not trust His under-shepherds. He
   must Himself come, and oh, if it had not been for those eyes of
   Omniscience, He never would have seen you--He never would have read
   your history and known your case.

   If it had not been for those arms of Omnipotence, He never could have
   grasped you. He never could have thrown you on His shoulders and
   brought you home rejoicing. You were divinely sought. There is as much
   the impress of the finger of God upon a sought-out soul, as there is
   upon a newly-created world. You may see God's finger in the green mead
   studded with yellow flowers, in the flowing rills and towering mounts,
   and in the bright lamps of Heaven at eventide--but you shall see the
   whole hand of God most clearly when a new-born soul is led to seek
   after the Lord's salvation. You shall be called "the people sought
   out." And this shall be the wonder of it--that you were sought out in a
   Divine fashion--

   "Love strong as death, no, stronger,
   Love mightier than the grave.
   Broad as earth and longer
   Than ocean's widest wave--
   This is the love that sought us,
   This is the love that bought us,
   This is the love that brought us,
   To most glad day from saddest night,
   From deepest shame to glory bright,
   From depths of death to life's fair height."

   Then, dear Brothers and Sisters, to close this part, remember that the
   glory of it is that we were sought out effectually. We are a people not
   sought out and then missed at the last. Almightiness and wisdom
   combined will make no failures. I may seek some of you in vain, as,
   alas, I have done. I may preach and preach again, as I do today and
   yet, perhaps, you will all miss the net. But when my Master comes out
   to fish for souls the net will soon be full--there is no failure in His
   case. All of us, dear Brothers and Sisters, who have been brought into
   union with Christ, know that we were brought because it was effectual
   Grace that came to us.

   There is a Grace which may be resisted, there are common strivings of
   the Spirit, against which a man may contend successfully. But when the
   Spirit puts out the fullness of His Divine energy, with the intention
   to work a sure work, it can never be frustrated. In each of our cases
   there has been a Divine intention, Omnipotent, to constrain us to be
   saved. That intention has been followed up by a Divine action, which it
   was impossible for us to have effectually resisted. Which, in fact, we
   did not, and could not resist, because it charmed us into a complete
   subjection. We yielded at once to its sway. This has taken place in
   every single heart and this is the glory of the name "sought out"--that
   we were not half sought out, we were not feebly and unsuccessfully
   sought--but we were effectually and completely sought out. That is the
   reason why we are today heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.

   III. Let us notice, in the third place, THE DISTINGUISHING TITLE
   JUSITIFIED. We are a people sought out.

   How were we sought out? Let us justify the name.

   Brethren, we are sought out, first of all, in the eternal purposes and
   the work of Christ. The coming of the Lord Jesus Christ from Heaven was
   the commencement, the first overt act of seeking our souls. All that
   bloody pilgrimage of His, when hands and feet were bleeding. All that
   dreadful suffering of His upon the Cross, was a seeking out of His
   people. Like some great pearl diver, the Lord Jesus Christ stood upon
   the glorious cliff's of Heaven and plunged deep into the floods of
   sorrow and sin that He might seek out the lost pearls. Virtually, our
   Lord did save all His people then and there. "He came to seek and to
   save that which was lost," and He did save, by His death, all His
   elect.

   Though not actually, they were virtually every one of them saved in
   that very hour when He bowed His head and said, "It is finished." At
   that moment they were in His hands, they were united to His Person in
   the Divine decree. At that moment they stood in Him--

   "Not as they stood in Adam's Fall, When sin and sorrow covered all; But
   as they'll stand another day, Fairer than sun's meridian ray." "He has
   saved us" first, "and called us" afterwards, "with a holy calling."
   This seeking out, as far as we know it, began with gracious words of
   mercy. In the case of some, these were heard very early. A godly mother
   told us the Truths of God with weeping, a holy father set us a good
   example. We were sought out by that little Bible we were taught to read
   and that hymnbook which was put into our hands.

   We were sought out when we were taken to the House of God. The minister
   preached the Gospel freely to all. He described our character and
   affectionately bid us come to Jesus. We were sought out while the
   preacher called the Sabbath-breaker, while he called the hard-hearted,
   the hypocrite, the formalist, the abandoned, the profane. While he
   called each of these, according to our case we felt that he was calling
   us. And we thought the eyes of Jesus were looking on us and His voice
   was bidding us repent and live. Sometimes we were specially sought out
   under the ministry when the preacher was led to describe our case,
   painting it in glowing colors. We thought somebody had told him. He
   seemed to know us so well, to have read us through and through and we
   went home to our chamber, moved, at least for a season, with a desire
   after God--for we had been sought out.

   Nor did the Lord leave us only to the kind invitations of the ministry.
   Afflictions sought us out. The fever hunted us to the Cross. When the
   cholera came, it carried a great whip in its hand to flog us to the
   Savior. We had serious losses, a decaying business--all which should
   have weaned us from the world. Our friends sickened--from their graves
   we heard the voice of invitation, "Come unto Christ and live." We were
   disappointed in some of our fondest hopes, and our heart, torn for the
   time, yearned after a higher life and a deeper satisfaction. Affliction
   after affliction and tribulation after tribulation were the means which
   God used for seeking us out.

   And then came visitations, mysterious visitations. It was in the night
   season when all was still. We sat up in our bed and solemn thoughts
   passed through us. The preacher's words which we had heard years ago
   came back fresh as when we heard them for the first time. Old texts of
   Scripture, the recollection of a mother's tears--all these came upon
   us. Or it was in the midst of business and we did not know how it was,
   but suddenly a deep calm came over us. We felt as if an unseen hand was
   drawing us to pray. We resisted the Divine impulse, but we knew that it
   had been there. It came again and again, and often as we walked the
   streets we seemed attended by another soul than our own. It appeared to
   us, as if at times we were two men in one--and that new and better man
   wrestled with us like the angel with Jacob.

   And at last Divine Grace overcame us and brought us to repentance and
   humble faith. But after all, dear Friends, these visitations, these
   providences, the preaching and so on, would all have been nothing, if
   it had not been for the appointed time when the Holy Spirit came and
   sought us out. Can I ever forget that moment when the preacher's finger
   pointed to me and he said, "Young man, believe in Jesus Christ, believe
   in Jesus Christ now." It was not his voice, alone, that spoke to me,
   but the voice from the mysterious Throne said, "Believe now." And
   believe I did. I found no will to refuse.

   The thing I could not do before, the thing I did not understand till
   that moment, I both understood and did. I did believe in Jesus and the
   burden rolled from off my bowed shoulders, and the spirit was
   emancipated and free. O may that time come to you who have never yet
   been sought out! May the Spirit of God so touch you that you cannot
   resist Him-- so effectually move you, that you must yield subjection to
   the Cross of Christ. In your cases as well as mine, Beloved in the Lord
   Jesus, you will be led to see that it was the effectual power of God
   the Holy Spirit that really did bring you to Christ. So that the title
   is fully justified--"Sought Out."

   There may be some persons who come to Christ of themselves, I do not
   believe there are, and I am not one of them. There may be some who keep
   to Christ by the power of their free will--I believe there is a whole
   denomination who profess to do so--but I can only say their experience
   is the very reverse of what I have felt. I believe that those of whom
   we read in Christian biographies and in Scripture owed their salvation
   to free, rich, and Sovereign Grace. The religion of these persons who
   come to Christ of their own free will is of modern invention, and I
   would not give a snap of the finger for the grace that springs from
   self, or another snap of my finger for the conversion which is the
   result of free will.

   May the Lord give us to be born from above and if we have not a
   religion which is not worked in us by the Spirit of God, the sooner we
   get rid of it the better! Then, perhaps, we shall go to Him who can
   give us the true bread of Heaven, that we may not be found empty at the
   last.

   IV. Now I have dispatched these three matters and I come to the
   practical part of the subject and may I have your earnest attention?
   There is A SPECIAL DUTY INCUMBENT UPON THOSE WHO WEAR THE TITLE,
   "SOUGHT OUT."

   My Brothers and Sisters, if it is really so that you are such debtors
   to Divine seeking, ought you not to spend your whole lifetime in
   seeking others out? If you owe everything to Divine Grace and nothing
   to self, are you not under solemn obligation to be the Lord's forever
   and ought you not--not by proxy, but personally and individually,
   everyone of you--to seek out the rest of the Lord's people, that they,
   like you, may bear the title of a people sought out? I am earnest in
   the desire of inducing every member of this Church and of every other
   Church to be winners of souls.

   The preaching of the Gospel is God's grand instrument of mercy. That is
   His great magnet. Those of you who can use this holy weapon, do. You
   that have ability and have talents, devote yourselves to God's cause.
   Give yourselves up to His ministry. I would to God there were more of
   those who are successful in professions, men who either in medicine or
   law have attained eminence, would consecrate their talents to the
   ministry. They need not fear that in giving themselves to God He will
   not take care of them. And as to honor, if it is found anywhere, it is
   the sure heritage of the faithful ambassador of Christ.

   If you have been sought out, my Brother, I do not blush to recommend
   you to give up the most lucrative employment to seek out others. If you
   have the power to stir other's hearts, if God has given you the tongue
   of the eloquent, consecrate it neither to parliament nor to the bar.
   Devote it to the plucking of brands from the burning--become a herald
   of the Cross and let the whole world, as far as possible, hear from you
   the tidings of salvation!

   The preaching of the Gospel is not the only means. It is a way of
   seeking out most commonly used. But there are other methods which I
   will recommend to you this morning. We are not to preach merely to
   those who come to listen. We must carry the Gospel to where men do not
   desire it. We should consider it our business to be generously
   impertinent--thrusting the Gospel into men's way--whether they will
   hear or whether they will not. Let us hunt for souls, first of all, by
   visitation. There are thousands in London who never will be converted
   by the preaching of the Gospel, for they never attend places of
   worship. Some of them do not know what sort of thing a religious
   service is. We may shudder when we say it--it is believed there are
   thousands in London who do not even know the name of Christ--living in
   what we call a Christian land--and yet they have not heard the name of
   Jesus!

   Thank God things are better than they were. But things are still bad
   enough. Brethren, you must go and see these things and mend them. To
   the lodging houses, young men, you must carry the Gospel, and to those
   thickly-peopled habitations, where every room contains a family and not
   one room a Christian. I believe there is very much good to be done by
   house-to-house visitation. Not by City Missionaries and Bible-women
   only--may God speed those noble bodies of laborers--but by all of you!
   By you that have position in society among your neighbors--make
   yourselves free and go and talk to them of Christ in the little houses
   that are near to you. As far as your time allows, be a visitor.

   And if there is one dark part of the town known to you as the haunt of
   sinners, make it a point to use this agency of visitation from
   house-to-house. Let the lost sheep of Israel's house be sought out.
   Some will need special means, before ever they can be found and brought
   in. How does one's heart rejoice over the reformatories and the
   midnight meetings-- over the attempts to bring that class of souls to
   Christ. I have often heard it said that few of the converts from those
   meetings hold on and prove sincere. It is a great falsehood--a very
   considerable portion are reformed and mere reformations are of little
   use--but where regeneration is worked and these girls are pointed to a
   Savior, you will never find one of them go back.

   Has not God been pleased to give us in this Church scores of instances
   where those who were decoys for Satan are now the leaders of others to
   the Cross of Christ and like Mary, love much because they have much
   forgiven? Seek them out. If there is any other class that is neglected,
   seek it out. If you happen to know any of the more degraded part of the
   population who are only sought for by the policeman and never hear a
   word of good advice--except from the stipendiary magistrate--do seek
   them out. If Christ sought you out, the inference is strong that you
   ought to seek out others! And if special means are needed, let special
   means be applied.

   You must be very kind. To broken hearts you must speak very gently.
   Their distance from God is a distance of fear. The gulf that separates
   them is despair. There are some such in this house, perhaps. Seek them
   out and if you find them very desponding, writing bitter things against
   themselves, let love be shown them. Try if you can, to get the cords of
   affection around them and so draw them to Christ. Do not turn from them
   and say, "They are such miserable objects, so unbelieving. I will not
   look after them." But the more you find they need a tender heart and a
   weeping eye to bring them to the Savior, the more carefully follow them
   till you bring them to Him.

   You will find some who will want a world of perseverance. Perhaps your
   child has been for thirty years unconverted. Your prayers have been
   unheard till now and the devil tempts you to give it up. Never do so.
   If you had to be sought so long--and some of you needed to be sought
   for fifty years before you were found--never give up a fellow creature.
   Follow your child in all his ingratitude, pursue his footsteps with
   your loving kindness and never leave him until you have brought him, at
   last, to find joy where you found it--in the wounds of Jesus.

   Let me beg you, where all other means fail, to seek men by your
   prayers. As long as a man has one other man to pray for him there is a
   hope of his salvation. If you, in your daily supplications, make
   mention of men--if you select special cases--if you bear their names
   before the Lord, you shall have the joy of seeing them turned from
   darkness to light. And they with you shall be a people "sought out." If
   a word of mine shall stir up but one of you to seek the Lord's hidden
   ones, my soul shall rejoice. And if every one of you shall register a
   vow in this House of Prayer--"I will seek out some family today and
   continue my work tomorrow. And the next day I will be seeking out
   others. I will not wait till they come to me to be taught, but go and
   seek them and compel them to come in that the house may be filled, that
   the Church of God may have its full complement of Christ's chosen."

   If you will do this, my soul shall be well content. If you have never
   been sought, then you will not seek others. If you have never tasted
   that the Lord is gracious, I shall not marvel that you neglect this
   work. But oh, by the Hell from which you are delivered, by the Heaven
   to which you are going, by the blood which redeemed you from death and
   Hell, by that gracious Spirit which quickened you and still keeps you
   alive, by every glorious promise which stimulates you in your onward
   career, I pray you spend yourselves and be spent in seeking souls!

   Look at this great mass of habitation, this wilderness of human
   dwellings--if we do not work with all our might we can never hope to
   see the knowledge of the Lord covering this great world of London--let
   alone the greater world outside! O let us be up and doing and let it be
   told in every house, in every alley, that Christians care for souls. If
   you are the people sought out, go and seek others. Tell them that,
   "Whosoever believes on the Lord Jesus Christ shall be saved."

                                  No Illusion

   A SERMON DELIVERED BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN
   TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And did not know that what was done by the angel was real, but thought
   he was seeing a vision." Acts 12:9.

   FANCY, not fact! A dream! A delusion! That would be the world's
   estimate of the most blessed Christian experience. "Fanaticism" is the
   name by which they call it. But call it by whatever name you please,
   the Divine Grace that interposes and rescues a sinner from the Law's
   threats, from Satan's tyranny, from the malice of men, and the fears of
   one's own heart is matter of abundant joy. Then let it be witnessed by
   a life of undeviating principle and devoted service of God-- sneer who
   may--suspect it who will--it is a noble triumph.

   Such triumphs of Grace we have among us, and there are many who can
   witness to the fact. Still, dear Friends, not infrequently does it
   happen that you, whose salvation is our joy, of whom we speak with the
   utmost assurance, are yourselves in straits, exercised with fights
   without and fears within. And you are unable to satisfy your own
   consciences that the work is Divine. Observe now that Peter was brought
   out of prison by a great miracle, and yet it seemed to him as a vision
   or a dream. I need not recapitulate the circumstances. I have just read
   them in your hearing. This much I propose.

   First, let me endeavor to draw out some reflections from the narrative.
   And then, secondly, I shall take up the text itself and try to show you
   that there is no illusion, whatever you may think, in the mighty
   operations of the Lord.

   To begin--the first remark we think we are justified in making is this,
   that if ever our enemies can get hold of us, they will be quite sure to
   hold us as fast as they can. When Herod had been able to apprehend
   Peter, he was not content with ordinary means of keeping him in
   custody. He has Peter put into the strongest prison in Jerusalem. To
   make assurance doubly sure, he is chained not to one soldier, but to
   two. He was too great a prize to be readily lost. He anticipated as
   much satisfaction for himself from the applause of the people, for
   putting so eminent a servant of Christ as James to death, that he could
   not afford to lose an opportunity of getting further prey.

   So he seizes upon him who was accounted a pillar in the Church with
   singular avidity. Mark you, Brothers and Sisters, if by any fault of
   our own we ever fall into the hands of our enemies, we need expect no
   mercy from them. And if without fault we are delivered for a little
   season into their hands, we have good reason to cry aloud to God, for
   whoever may be spared, the Christian never is. Men will forgive a
   thousand faults in others, but they will magnify the most trivial
   offense in the true follower of Jesus. Nor do I very much regret this.
   Let it be so and let it be a caution to us to walk very carefully
   before God in the land of the living.

   You young members of the Church, who are often engaged in your worldly
   calling, where a great number of persons are watching for your falling,
   let this be a special reason to walk very humbly before God. If you
   walk carelessly, remember the lynx-eyed world will soon see it and
   then, with its hundred tongues, it will soon spread the story. You may
   say-- "Tell it not in Gath; publish it not in the streets of Askelon,
   lest the daughters of Philistia rejoice." But they will tell it. With
   many an addition of their own they will repeat the story. You shall
   hear them say--"Aha! Aha! So would we have it! All these Christians are
   inconsistent, they are all mere professors, they are hypocrites to a
   man, every one of them."

   Thus will much damage be done to our good cause and much insult offered
   to the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Cross of Christ is in itself
   an offense to the world. Let us take heed that we do not add any
   offense of our own. It is "to the Jew a stumbling block." Let us mind
   that we put no stumbling blocks where there are enough already. "To the
   Greek it is foolishness." Let us not add our folly to give point to the
   scorn with which the worldly deride the Gospel. Oh, how jealous should
   we be of ourselves, for we serve a jealous God! How rigid should we be
   with our consciences, for we serve One whose name is "Holy, Holy,
   Holy!"

   Yes, in the presence of adversaries who will misrepresent our best
   deeds and twist our best endeavors into something selfish--impugning
   our motives where they cannot censure our actions--how circumspect
   should we be! We pilgrims travel as suspected persons through the
   world. Not only are we under surveillance, but there are more spies
   than we reckon. The espionage is everywhere--at home and abroad. If we
   fall into their hands we may sooner expect generosity from a wolf, or
   mercy from a fiend, than to find anything like patience with our
   infirmities from the men of the world, or anything like the hiding of
   our iniquities from the men who spice their infidelity towards God with
   scandals against His people.

   The world is too much like the accursed Canaan who pointed to his
   father's nakedness. We can only expect of our own Brothers and Sisters,
   the conduct of Shem and Japheth, who shall go backward to cast the
   mantle over us. Better far that we should so act and so live as to not
   ever need this mantle of charity, but be able to say, with all
   humility, yet with holy courage--"Lord, You know that in this thing I
   have not sinned, but have walked uprightly in Your ways." That is the
   first lesson which I feel bound to inculcate. "For what glory is it, if
   when you are buffeted for your faults, you shall take it patiently?"

   The second lesson is this. When a case is put into God's hands, He will
   certainly manage it well and He will interfere in sufficient time to
   bring His servants out of their distress. Peter's case was put into
   God's hands. The company that met at the house of Mary, the mother of
   Mark, were appealing to the great Advocate. If any man is in prison,
   "we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." With
   their humble prayers and tears they were pleading for their Brother,
   whose valuable life they could ill afford to spare, for the infant
   Church needed the Apostles, at least for a season.

   I think I hear them pleading one after the other--"Lord, remember
   Peter! You know how we love him. Our desires go up for him. James is
   dead. Alas, we took up his body and mourned him! Let not Peter be
   slain! Oh, take not You the prop from under us! Remove not the pillar
   from the wall, nor the stone from its place." The Lord has heard their
   cries. Peter's cause is in His hands. He will interfere in due time.
   The assurance that prayer is heard is the earnest that prayer will be
   answered. The petition is accepted, though no answer has yet been
   received. Well, we can leave it there.

   But look, Brothers and Sisters, Peter has been lying in prison the
   whole week. The feast of unleavened bread is over, it is the last
   night, the last night! The evening has crept on. No, the dark hours
   have set in. It is midnight. The sun will soon be rising--in a few more
   hours--and then where is Peter? Lord, if You do not interfere, where is
   Peter? If You come not now to help him, his blood shall make the
   populace of Jerusalem glad while they gloat and delight in his
   slaughter! But just at that last and dark hour of the night, God's
   opportunity overtook man's extremity.

   A light shone in the dungeon. Peter was awakened. God never is before
   His time. Nor is He ever too late. He comes just when He is needed. But
   look, there is Peter asleep! Peter is asleep, doing nothing, doing
   nothing! Well, and the best thing for him, too, for the case was put
   into God's hands. I ask you, dear Friends, suppose Peter had been
   awake, what could he do? Had he been fretting and troubling himself,
   what good could he have done? Finding, therefore, that nothing remained
   for him, he just throws himself upon the mercy of God, shuts his eyes
   as peaceably as though he were to wake tomorrow to a wedding feast and
   not to his own execution.

   Sleep on, blessed Peter! Well might Herod envy you that peace which his
   kingly robe could never give him. You sleep, though your hands are
   chained, for your spirit is free. And it may be that in your dreams you
   are rejoicing "with a joy unspeakable and full of glory." When the case
   is taken into God's hands and you and I feel that we can do nothing for
   ourselves, we may take sleep in perfect quietude, for so He gives His
   Beloved sleep. While we sleep, His watchful eyes do keep their
   ceaseless guard. Jesus might seem on one occasion to be asleep, but you
   know where He slept--it was in the back part of the ship. Why there?
   Methinks He slept with His hand on the tiller, so that the moment He
   awoke, He might steer the vessel--

   "Though winds and waves assault your keel,
   He does preserve it, He does steer--
   Even when the boat seems most to reel.
   Storms are the triumphs of His art,
   Sure He may close His eyes, but not His heart."

   God never sleeps. He is ever on the watch for His people. "Well, but,"
   says one, "surely the Lord should have interfered before this time, for
   Peter is not only asleep, but he is bound--bound to two soldiers! How
   can he escape?" Ah, that word "How?"--that word "How?" What a deal of
   mischief it has done to faith! Don't you know that true faith has no
   such word in all her vocabulary? Faith never says "How?" God has said
   "It shall be," faith believes it will be. As to how it shall be, that
   is God's business, not mine. It is Unbelief that says "How? I do not
   see it. How? How? How can it be?" Hush, Unbelief! The fetters shall
   drop off, gates shall open of their own accord. The case is in God's
   hands, Man! If it were in man's hands it would fail, for cursed is he
   that trusts in man and makes flesh his arm.

   The strongest sinew in an arm of flesh must crack. There must be
   impossibilities to humanity, but to Deity impossibilities are nothing.
   Be quiet, for the case is with Him. It may be the last moment. The
   Apostle may be asleep and he may be bound, but Peter must come out. For
   God has heard the prayer and Peter shall be free. Yet a third remark,
   we think, lies like a precious stone upon the very surface of this
   narrative. It is this--that when God shall come to deliver His people,
   all the circumstances which seem to go against their deliverance shall
   only tend to set forth the more His glory. What contempt He puts upon
   chains, prisons, cords, iron gates, wards--inner and outer wards--look
   how He breaks their bonds asunder and casts their cords from Peter!

   I know of nothing that seems to illustrate more God's splendid triumph
   over man's cunning than the resurrection of Christ. "His disciples will
   steal Him away while men sleep." "Well," says Pilate, "you have a
   watch, go and make it as sure as you can." He trusted to men, who were
   sure to do the thing well--the men that hated Him. They keep the watch,
   they roll the great stone, they seal it, they go home to their beds.
   Ah, men of the Sanhedrim, proud priests! You have done the work, go to
   your rest and say "This deceiver shall never shake the earth again, nor
   call us dumb dogs that cannot bark, nor tell us that we are blind
   leaders of the blind. He is buried and the seal is on Him."--

   "Vain the watch, the stone, the seal, Christ has broke the gates of
   Hell."

   Look! He rises! And as the angel sits down upon the stone, he seems, in
   quiet sarcasm, to say to the priests, to earth, to Hell, "Roll it back
   again if you can, and seal it once more, for He is risen and has
   overcome the wiles of men." So, Christian, rest assured that everything
   that looks black to your gaze now, shall only make it the brighter when
   God delivers you. Every dark and bending line shall surely meet in the
   center of His love, and but express more to your mind His power, His
   wisdom, His faithfulness, His Truth.

   Furthermore, the whole story seems to teach us that no difficulty can
   ever occur which God cannot meet when He makes bare His arm. The chains
   are gone, the warders are passed, but there is that iron gate. Oh, that
   iron gate! I think there are some of you tonight that are troubled
   about it. God has been helping you. You have had faith up till now, but
   you have got to the iron gate. Oh, if you could but pass that--it leads
   into the city--all would be well. But that iron gate! Some of you get
   dreading the iron gate a month before you get to it. You get to
   fretting and troubling yourself for three months, perhaps, about the
   iron gate. You do for months as those holy women did for hours, who
   went out at break of day to the sepulcher, and as they went along they
   said, "Who shall roll away the stone?"

   There was no stone to roll away! And when you go to this place, you
   will find that there is no iron gate there, or if there should be, it
   will open of its own accord. Oh, how often have we had to wonder at our
   own folly and we have said, "Well, I will never do that again. I will
   never more borrow misery. Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. I
   will never go out to get a loan of sorrow for tomorrow." But alas, we
   have done it the very next day.

   Wait, wait, O Christian, on the Lord! Leave all anxiety about the iron
   Gates to Him! Since the day when you did believe in Him and put your
   soul into His hands by prayer, it has been God's cause, not your cause.
   It has been God's work to deliver you and not your work--

   "The gates of brass before Him burst, The iron fetters yield."

   There is yet this one further remark. See, Beloved, see clearly, see
   indisputably--the omnipotence of prayer. If all those disciples had
   sworn an oath that they would get Peter free, they could not have
   accomplished it. What could they do? Herod has an army. The prison is
   strong. The guards are not to be bribed. The last night is come. What
   can they do? There was only one weapon they could use and that was
   hanging at their girdles--the weapon of all-prayer.

   They told Jesus about it. When every other gate was shut, there was the
   gate to Heaven open--so they sent messages up to Him who is able to
   loose the prisoners, and to their own surprise Peter is loosed. Have
   not we, in this Church, often felt the power of prayer? I sometimes
   fear, Beloved, we are lagging here now--lagging in prayer. I may be
   permitted to say there are some of you I do not see so often at Prayer
   Meetings as I would wish. It is a busy time of the year, I know, and
   therefore I make plenty of excuses for you. But when it was not so busy
   I did not see you!

   And then there are some who grow dull in their recollections of fact.
   At Park Street have not we had seasons when our hearts were hot within
   us, when we could not speak because we thought, "Surely God is in this
   place"? It seemed an awful place to us. We were prevailing with God, we
   were drawing down the blessings and those blessings continued up till
   now as the result of earnest supplication. What simple prayers they
   were! Strangers that came in found much fault, but the Lord did not.
   There were often things said that were not very grammatical. But what
   mattered it if the heart was in the thing?

   We stormed Heaven's gates and down came legions of mercies to us. We
   want more prayer, more prayer! I am always glad to hear that your
   special Prayer Meetings and your social assemblies for supplication are
   well attended and that there is a desire among the members to have such
   Prayer Meetings often. I am sure the elders of the Church will join
   with me in advocating and encouraging them. We will lend the rooms
   connected with this Tabernacle, convicted that more we meet together
   and more we supplicate the Throne of Grace, the blessings will come
   down.

   There are a few Brothers and Sisters who have met every morning for
   these last four years, or five years it may be. They meet now every
   morning, wet or dry, winter or summer, every morning in the Chapel at
   Park Street, always praying for our prosperity. Their numbers are few
   to what they used to be. We have not got the fire now that we once had,
   I fear. May the Lord put the embers together and fan them with His
   breath and make them blaze again! And then our ministry shall be sent
   down from Heaven with the Holy Spirit and the multitudes shall hear the
   voice of God speaking in their hearts.

   Brethren, pray for us, pray for your children, your households--take
   everything to God in prayer, no matter how hard, how intricate, how
   difficult. If there is a knot you cannot untie, cut it with prayer. God
   knows how to deliver you when you cannot deliver yourself. Be much in
   supplication, for this will make you mighty, make you prevalent with
   men when you have prevailed with the Maker of men. Such are the
   reflections that occur to us from the narrative.

   II. But now I turn more closely to my text itself. When Peter came out
   of prison, his deliverance was so marvelous that he did not know
   whether it was true or whether it was a vision. Like the Psalm which
   says, "When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like
   them that dream." Thus when a sinner is saved, pardoned, justified, he
   is utterly astonished and thinks it cannot be true, because it is so
   good. The astonishment lies in this--"It cannot be true," says he,
   "that I am saved. I! I! I! If it had been all the people in the world,
   I could have believed it, but can it be that I am delivered? How is it
   that He should have mercy upon me? I, that was so lately in fetters?
   That a week ago could blaspheme? That a day or two ago could have
   talked all the idlest jests and could have lived upon the foulest of
   earth's pleasures? That I, I should be saved--delivered from sin,
   though so filthy--set free, though so fast bound?"

   I must try to interpret this peculiar reflection--this dream-like
   feeling. The reality of God's mercy is only apprehended by faith. And
   because faith has to do with things not seen, you are apt to throw
   suspicions on its evidence. You see no tangible instrumentality equal
   to the mighty task. Our ruin was, in some sense, effected by degrees.
   We can trace the course of evil. The soul of man is like a temple in
   ruins. The temple built for God has become an abode for unclean
   spirits. God suddenly deserted it, but it gradually fell into its
   present dilapidation and uncleanness.

   The eyes that were once as lamps which flashed with light and love,
   have become contracted and their habit now is to love darkness rather
   than light. The tongue that was once a fountain that did send forth
   sweet water, pure and refreshing, has become as a noxious spring whose
   bitter streams savor of enmity to God and envy of the Brothers and
   Sisters. The heart that was once as the holy place of all our frame,
   where the beauty of holiness reposed in heavenly calm, has now become
   the place of idols and the abode of secret abominations. The very
   breath that sent up its sacred incense in rich perfume, acceptable to
   God, has grown corrupt and breathes out its baneful poison and its foul
   impurities.

   Will God in very deed dwell with man upon the earth? Will He take up
   His abode with us? Shall the change be worked in the twinkling of an
   eye? Does it suffice that the Word sown in weakness, springs up with
   power of the Holy Spirit? Man fallen may baffle us, but man redeemed is
   a mystery we cannot fathom. It seems ever to mere mortal sense as a
   vision, the dream of poets, or the work of imagination. But, Beloved,
   why marvel? The angel of the Covenant has descended from Heaven to
   earth and you knew not it was he till he loosed your bonds, broke up
   your path, or rather opened every door with the keys that hang at his
   girdle and gave you knowledge of salvation by the remission of your
   sins.

   Then you thought it was a vision, because you had not known redemption
   except that your own soul was redeemed. You had not understood
   salvation except that you were yourself redeemed. And that matchless
   secret of the new birth penetrated your understanding in the same hour
   that it was worked upon your own heart. Thus it is commonly with us,
   Brothers and Sisters. We see, as a main fact, the downward course by
   which we corrupted our ways when we were dead in sin. But the hour we
   first believed, that blessed season when we were translated out of the
   kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son seems like a
   vision to us.

   Another reason why it appears so visionary to us is because no
   forethought or intention of our own helped and availed. How this is
   true with some of you in one way. Never were your purposes less
   inclined to seek the Lord than they were when He found you. Your plans
   were broken off before you were aware of it. You were asleep when the
   angel entered your cell. And you were dreaming of other things than
   those that were in store for you. Perhaps you dreamed that the bolts
   were not heavy, the bars were not thick, the locks were not fast, and
   you might get up and let yourself out whenever you liked.

   It was only when you were delivered that you saw how fast you had been
   held. The rescued soul, alone, can know how "Satan binds our captive
   minds fast in his slavish chains." And in yet another way some of us
   have proved the same. We had our schemes to get loose and many a bitter
   day we had tried and toiled in vain, till at length we had fallen
   asleep in blank despair, dreaming of nothing but our fearful doom. When
   the deliverance came in such an unheard of manner, we could scarcely
   persuade ourselves it could be true. And so it is, Brothers and
   Sisters, we never believe anything to be so real as what we see with
   our own eyes, and work with our own hands.

   And I suppose it is just the natural idea which flesh and blood is
   prone to take of the things of God. They seem more like a vision than
   the work of a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. And still, I
   scarcely think I have probed the matter to the bottom yet. The
   simplicity of God's method of Divine Grace has not ceased to be a
   marvel. The Jews seek after a sign. And there is something of the
   Jewish nature about us all. At least I find a host of exercised souls
   who are asking for signs. Well, and the Greeks, who are rather a
   refined class of unbelievers--they seek after wisdom. They want some
   extraordinary endowment. And this craving has not died out among us.

   For the first, I hear one say, "I am afraid, Sir, that my experience is
   only a dream. I want a sign to give me assurance." Let me tell you that
   simple faith gives clearer evidence than any fancy that could possess
   your mind. Are you still bound with the chains of your sins? Are you
   still shut up in the stronghold of unbelief? Have you never seen the
   key in the Savior's hand that opened the door to set you free? "Oh,
   yes," you say, "but I am afraid it was only a vision, for I am but a
   poor, helpless creature after all." And what else could you be? You are
   never so safe as when you are emptied of all confidence in self. Paul
   could boast of extraordinary revelations, but the Lord sent him a thorn
   in the flesh, lest he should be puffed up by them.

   Then, again, there are those who show more anxiety after gifts than
   after graces. And to them all the mercy they have received seems but a
   vision because they are not raised up above common mortals. After this
   extraordinary release of Peter, you do not find any display. The
   Apostle was but a poor, trembling Believer. He would not have Mary or
   the damsel Rhoda talk too loudly, or express their gladness too
   cheerfully--he beckoned them with his hand to hold their peace. He just
   declared how the Lord had brought him out, and then he departed and
   went into another place.

   Brethren, I would have you make your boast in the Lord and speak of
   what He has done for your souls. But I would warn you not to vaunt your
   experience, or attempt to magnify yourselves as if we, any of us, had
   herein matter for glory. The very manner of God's delivering Grace is
   to hide pride from our eyes. And the reality is none the less palpable,
   because the angel did all for us to show his strength and then withdrew
   from us that we should feel our own weakness.

   Once again--the suddenness of this deliverance will surprise you. "So
   Suddenly, too!" It seems like a vision. We have often known persons
   suddenly renewed in heart that would not believe it. They knew it was
   so, but still, in thinking it over, it did seem as though it could not
   possibly be true that they were saved. They had to rub their eyes again
   to see whether they were not asleep and dreaming. It was much too good
   to be true and happened all so quickly. The greatness of the mercy has
   made them stagger. That God should just forgive them and let them into
   Heaven would have been marvelous, but that He should make them His
   children, His sons, heirs of God, joint heirs with Christ--this
   surpassed all belief!

   Their fears had got such hold of them that they were ready to die. But
   little prepared to be saved. Their convictions had been terrible, but
   now the joy is so excessive they cannot think but that it must be all
   presumption, all a dream. Many and many have there been who have come
   to the pastor and said, "Oh I had such joys! I did believe in Christ, I
   know I did. I cast myself wholly on Him and I felt such a change. I
   became so different a person from what I had ever been before, but now
   I come to look back upon it, I cannot think it was true, it must have
   been a vision, it cannot possibly be a matter of fact."

   Now, dear Friends, lest you should give way to this apprehension too
   much, let me remind you that inasmuch as this is a great thing, it is
   all the better evidence that it comes from God. So great a river may
   well have a rapid tide. So glaring a sun may well shine with uncommon
   splendor. The great God does not do little acts of Divine Grace. His
   works are all great, sought out by all them that fear Him. Inasmuch as
   you confess that you are a great sinner and therefore this is a
   surprising thing, let me remind you that this is the ordinary way in
   which God works to give great mercies to great sinners. He does not
   give His favors to men who think they deserve them.

   He searches the heart with a glance and He abhors the proud. But to
   those who are made to feel that there is no good thing in them and rest
   on His Grace because they have nothing else on which to depend, the
   mercy comes and the prisoners are loosed. Dear Friends, do you not
   remember that the Gospel that we preach is a very great Gospel? Is it
   not called in Scripture, "The great salvation"? Now when you find your
   salvation to be great, do not shrink back and say, "Oh, it cannot be
   genuine because it is great." It would not be the genuine Gospel if it
   were little. If it were not a surprising wonderful thing, if it were
   not superlatively astonishing, it would not be the Gospel.

   "For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are My ways your ways,
   says the Lord. As high as the heavens are above the earth, so are My
   thoughts above your thoughts and My ways above your ways." Besides,
   remember, my Brothers and Sisters, that Jesus died in pangs unutterable
   on the Cross. Did He die there to buy farthing mercies, to purchase
   little favors for little sinners? The blood of bulls and goats might
   achieve some little, but the blood of Him who was the only begotten of
   the Father cannot have been shed for trifles. Therefore consider that
   this must have been true, because it is so great, so strange, so
   surpassing all your thoughts. God help you to say with the Apostle
   Peter, "Now I know that God has sent His angel."

   Thus shall you know for sure that the Lord has sent His angel and has
   delivered you out of the hands of your enemies and from all the
   expectation of your doubts and fears. I will tell you how to prove the
   reality of it. If you should fear that your feelings have been all a
   dream, come with me, hand in hand, and let us go and prove the
   authenticity of our faith at the Cross. You and I, a pair of sinners,
   full of sin, covered with the leprosy of it from head to foot--let us
   go and stand at Calvary's Cross. There He hangs! His hands and feet are
   pierced. The blood distils.

   Jesus! O my Lord! For whom do You die? "For sinners," He says. Here are
   two, most gracious Master! Remember us when You come into Your kingdom!
   I think I hear Him say, "You shall be with Me in Paradise," for never
   souls breathed that prayer in humble faith and were unheard. Jesus, we
   look to Your wounds and they are clefts in the rock into which we fly
   like doves, or if we may not compare ourselves thereunto, we will fly
   as ravens and we will hide till the tempest is over. Your blood we
   trust to redeem us, Your merit to clothe us from head to foot, Your
   plea to preserve us, Your strong arm to keep us, Your love to give us
   life now, and in eternity!

   And now, before I close, let me tell you that the picture may be
   inverted. If there are those to whom reality seems to be a dream, what
   multitudes there are, on the other hand, to whom mere dreams appear to
   be real and true. Ah, such dreaming is the saddest thing I know. And
   about the hardest task it is that I ever tried--to awake such
   slumberers from their delusions. Hear me, you that seek out your own
   inventions, yet submit not yourselves to the righteousness of God! Do
   you believe in God? Yes? Then the god you believe in is not the God who
   created Heaven and earth, but the god of your own imagination.

   Do you profess Christ? The Christ you profess is not the Son of the
   Father, but the child of your own fancy. And do I hear you talk of your
   experience? Alas, then, it is not the witness of the Holy Spirit, but
   the incoherent ramblings of a delirious brain. O you poor deluded
   souls. Who put your thoughts for God's counsels, your devices for His
   decrees, and your efforts for His interposition. You "shall be as a
   dream of a night vision. It shall even be as when an hungry man dreams
   and, behold, he eats. But he awakes and his soul is empty. Or as when a
   thirsty man dreams and, behold, he drinks. But he awakes and, behold,
   he is faint and his soul has appetite."

   Christians you call yourselves today, but Christ shall say to you
   another day, "I never knew you." Ah and it is true, for you never knew
   Him. Do you dream of peace? Without pardon it is a dream. Do you dream
   of Heaven? Without holiness it is a dream. Do you dream of joy at God's
   right hand? But you are not His people. You have never renounced the
   world, overcome the Wicked One, confessed the faith, or followed the
   Master in the regeneration, which is the earnest of a blessed
   resurrection. Oh, my Hearers, consider the words, I beseech you--"As a
   dream when one awakes, so, O Lord, when You awake, You shall despise
   their image."

   Here are many, I dare say, who do not understand what I have been
   talking about. God give them understanding. Sinner, you must either be
   in Christ, or perish. Remember, Sinners, tonight there is one of two
   things for you--either to be shut up in the prison of Hell, or else to
   be delivered from the prison of sin. Your destiny hangs here--salvation
   or damnation--life or death. Dare you die, Sinner, dare you die? Dare
   you die with your sins about you, like millstones strapped about your
   neck--dare you die? No! But when the time comes for you to die, you
   will say, "Now I cannot live, I must not live and I dare not die."

   Would you like to be able to die peacefully, Sinner, and to rise
   joyfully and to reign forever hereafter? Trust Christ with your soul
   and He will save you. He, the Son of God, begotten of the Father. The
   man of Nazareth, conceived of the Holy Spirit, and born of the Virgin
   Mary. He, God over all, blessed forever, and yet your Brother, born to
   bear your sins! He says, "Trust Me and I will save you." O may His
   electing love move the hand of His effectual Grace to incline you now
   to trust in Him! And that done, you are saved and out of this House you
   may go a lawfully delivered captive, though perhaps you will scarcely
   know what it is and know not whether it is true that is done unto you.

   But it is true for all that. He that believes on Him is not condemned
   and he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not
   believed on the Son of God. O that I might speak in God's name to some
   of you who perhaps may never hear my voice again! I will meet you, as
   the spirit said to Brutus, on the plains I will meet you another day,
   each one of you. And if you live and die without trusting in that Lord
   whose open wounds I have tried to set before your eyes, whose bleeding
   heart, streaming with His life blood, I have tried to set all warm
   before you--if you die without Him, on your own heads be your
   destruction!

   You have heard the Gospel--O that you would turn at its rebuke! Trust
   Christ! The feeblest touch of the hem of His garment--a look to
   Him--and you are made whole! As Moses lifted up the serpent in the
   wilderness, so may he lift up the Cross on high. O lift it up, my
   Brothers and Sisters, you that know Christ! Christian men and women,
   lift up that Cross in your families. It is mine to lift up here and to
   cry with the Hebrew Prophet, "Look, look and live!" Sin-bitten, covered
   with the wounds of sin--LOOK!--It is all He asks.

   "Look and live," is written on the clouds of Heaven, legible only by
   the light they give. And there, too, stand the soul-quickening
   words--"Believe and live." Leave your doings for Christ's doings--not
   your tears but Christ's tears, not your blood but His blood, not your
   groans but His groans, not your penance but His agonies. Come and rest
   in Him! Join with me in saying, from your heart--

   "My faith does lay her hand
   On that dear head of Yours,
   While like a penitent I stand,
   And here confess my sin.
   My soul looks back to see
   The burden You did bear
   When hanging on the accursed Tree,
   And hopes her guilt was there.
   Believing, we rejoice
   To see the curse removed,
   We bless the Lamb with cheerful voice,
   And sing His bleeding love."

   The Lord bless you, the God of Heaven and earth bless you, from this
   time forth and forever. Amen.

                                 The Red Heifer

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, AUGUST 30TH, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "This is the ordinance of the la w, which the Lord has commanded,
   saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring you a red
   heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish and upon which never came
   yoke: and you shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring
   her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face."

   Numbers 19:2,3.

   THE true heading of all the books of Moses is to be found in the words
   of Jesus, "Moses wrote of Me." Take the Lord Jesus Christ with you as a
   key, and however difficult the riddles of Leviticus or Numbers may at
   first sight appear, there is not one enigma in the whole collection
   which will not speedily open and yield instruction. To the Israelites
   themselves, these rites and ceremonies must have been rather an
   exercise of faith, than a means of instruction. "I cannot perfectly
   understand why this heifer is slain, or why yonder lamb is offered,"
   said the pious Israelite, "but though I cannot understand, I believe
   there is virtue in it all and I reverently do, even to the smallest
   particular, that which God, through His servant Moses, has commanded me
   to do."

   To us, the types are not a dark mystery to perplex our faith, but an
   open vision to delight our eyes. Having believed in Christ Jesus,
   having received Him as the Father's Sent One and being reconciled unto
   God by His death, we look back to the ceremonies of the old Law as the
   patterns of heavenly things. We endeavor to discover some new light in
   which the Savior's beauties may be set and to behold Him from some
   different point of view, so that we may love Him the better and may
   trust Him more. Now, the particular point to which the red heifer
   referred, concerning Christ and His work, is just this--the provision
   which is made in Christ Jesus for the daily sins and failings of
   Believers.

   In order to bring out our point clearly, we shall remark, first, that
   even true Israelites are in daily danger of defilement. Secondly, that
   there is a provision made in the Covenant of Grace for the removal of
   the daily defilement of sin. And thirdly, that the red heifer most
   beautifully sets forth Christ as being the constant purification of His
   people, that they, having their consciences purged from dead works, may
   have power to worship acceptably the living and true God.

   I. It is undoubtedly true, that even THE TRUE ISRAELITE, THE TRUE
   BELIEVER IN CHRIST, IS THE SUBJECT OF DAILY DEFILEMENT. My Brothers and
   Sisters, we who have believed in Christ are free from sin before the
   Divine judgment seat. The moment that we believe in Christ, our sin is
   no longer ours. It was laid upon Christ and cannot be in two places at
   one time. And therefore are we perfectly clean from sin before the eyes
   of a holy God. This is justification, full, complete, everlasting. But
   we are all aware, that in the matter of sanctification, we are not, as
   yet, delivered from evil.

   Sin dwells, though it reigns not in our mortal bodies. And since there
   is sin within, there is the capability of the defilement of sin
   without. Who has lived for a single day in this base world without
   discovering that in all his actions he commits sin? Who does not
   realize that in everything to which he puts his hand, he receives, as
   well as imparts, some degree of defilement? How is it, my Brothers and
   Sisters, that this is the case? The answer is easy, and it is to be
   found in the chapter before us.

   Some of our defilement arises from the fact that we do actually come
   into contact with sin, here imaged in the corruption of death. Read the
   eleventh verse--"He that touches the dead body of any man shall be
   unclean seven days." We actually touch that dead thing and sin, by
   overt acts of transgression. The best man living still pollutes himself
   with evil. We have met with a few vain and ignorant persons who have
   boasted that they were perfect, but we never believed in their
   perfection, except so far as to concede that they were perfect in
   self-conceit, in boastful arrogance, and infamous impudence.

   "If any man says he has no sin, he deceives himself, and the truth is
   not in him." The best of men are men at the best and while they are
   men, they will sin. We find the Apostle Paul crying out because of
   corruption and even using such strong language as this--"O wretched man
   that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" We are in
   close connection with sin, because sin is in ourselves. It has dyed us
   through and through, staining the very warp and woof of our nature.
   Until we lay aside these bodies and are admitted to the Church of the
   First-Born above, we shall never cease very close and intimate
   connection with sin.

   Therefore, my Brothers and Sisters, we need to be constantly cleansed,
   because we are always defiling ourselves. In fact, we are always
   defiled because we are always touching the body of this death.
   Moreover, we get defilement, not only from our own actual sins, but
   from companionship with other sinners. You will read farther on in this
   chapter, "When a man dies in a tent: all that come into the tent and
   all that is in the tent, shall be unclean." The mere being with sinners
   defiles us. Christ could walk with publicans and sinners and yet incur
   no danger. The great Physician could walk the leper house of this world
   untainted by contagion, but this is not possible with us.

   Even if the most honest and laudable motives shall lead us into the
   company of the ungodly, though our only aim may be to bring them to
   Jesus, yet their unhallowed conversation will not only vex, but defile.
   It is not possible to look upon another man's sin, even to look upon it
   with abhorrence, without receiving some degree of contamination,
   because the thought of evil is sin. Our hatred of evil always lacks in
   intensity--we do not detest it as we ought--and a failure here is a sin
   of omission which pollutes. You may say you can go into evil company
   and get no defilement--my Brothers and Sisters--I doubt it.

   It may be absolutely necessary for you in your calling, and more
   especially in your desire to bless others, to mingle with the ungodly,
   but you might as well attempt to carry fire in your bosom and not be
   burnt, or handle pitch and not be blackened, as to dwell in the tents
   of Kedar without receiving uncleanness. This dusty world must leave
   some mark upon our white garments--let us travel as carefully as we
   may. "I am black because the sun has looked upon me," must ever be the
   confession of the bride of Christ. This world is full of the
   spiritually dead, and since we live, we must be often rendered unclean
   among the sinful. And therefore we need a daily cleansing to fit us for
   daily fellowship with a holy God.

   Reflect, dear Brothers and Sisters, again, that one reason why we are
   so constantly defiled, is our want of watchfulness. You will observe
   that everything in the tent of a dead man was defiled except vessels
   that were covered over. Any vessel which was left open was at once
   unclean. You and I ought to cover up our hearts from the contamination
   of sin. It were well for us if we kept our heart with all diligence,
   since out of it are the issues of life. Good Mr. Dyer says, "The
   Christian should lock up his heart in the morning and give God the key,
   lest any evil should come in. And then when He unlocks it at night, a
   sweet perfume of prayer will rise at eventide."

   But alas, we forget to lock up our hearts. We do not keep our Graces
   covered up. I believe that a man might go into the most sinful places
   under Heaven without receiving defilement if he exercised a sufficient
   degree of watchfulness. But it is because we do not watch that the
   poisoned arrows wound us. I noticed the other day an allegory of a
   candle in a lantern, with the motto, "One weak point is too much." An
   enemy outside the lantern tried to blow out the candle. He blew all
   around, but it was well-secured, until, at last, he found a single
   crack and then through it he sent the destroying breath and soon the
   flame of the candle was extinguished.

   This is what the devil does with us. We may be guarded in nine points
   out of ten, but our strength is to be measured, mark you, by the
   strength of the weakest point. The devil will find out, sooner or
   later, some crack through which he will attack us to our soul's evil.
   Watch, my Brothers and Sisters, watch carefully. It is because you and
   I fail here that we acquire this daily defilement and need daily to be
   purified.

   A yet more striking thought is suggested by this chapter--sin is so
   desperately evil that the very slightest sin defiles us. He who touched
   a bone was unclean. It was not necessary to put your hand upon the
   clay-cold corpse to be defiled. The accidentally touching with the foot
   a bone carelessly thrown up by the grave digger. Even the touching it
   by the plowman as he turned up his furrow--even this was sufficient to
   make him unclean. Sin is such an immeasurably vile and pestilent a
   thing, that the slightest iniquity makes the Christian foul--a thought,
   an imagination, the glancing of an eye. We may have shut out all the
   world from our closet, and yet find we have not shut out sin.

   We may make a covenant with our eyes and with our hands and with our
   feet and with our lips, but still our wanton hearts will go after evil.
   We have heard of some perfumes of which it is said that the thousandth
   part of a grain would leave a scent for ages in the place where it had
   been. And certainly it is so with sin--about its merest bone there is
   an eternal pest--one sin of thought would be enough to destroy forever
   all communion with God. Therefore, Brothers and Sisters, we are defiled
   and need to be daily cleansed.

   I must not fail to remind you, also, that sin, even when it is not
   seen, defiles, for you will observe in the chapter that a man was
   defiled who touched a grave. The bones might be buried deep down so
   that he could not discern them. And over those bones the grass might
   have grown in green hillocks, decked with a few sweet flowers and yet,
   if the Israelite did but touch that grave with his foot, or with his
   hand, he was defiled. Oh, how many graves there are of sin--things that
   are fair to look upon, externally admirable but internally abominable!

   Such-and-such a custom is tolerated, no, it has become fast fixed in
   society and who shall find fault with it? Yet, many of our customs are
   but the graves of sin and many of our actions, which we think so
   admirable, have loathsome rottenness within. Too much, even of our
   sanctuary services, is comparable to a whitewashed sepulcher. Those
   sweet hymns, the unanimous and hearty shout of praise, the earnest
   prayer, the reverent deportment--all those, I say, may be but the
   whitewashed sepulcher. For our thoughts may be going abroad after all
   sorts of mischief, and so our very sanctuary services may be but the
   green sods which conceal the loathsomeness of sin.

   O dear Friends, this is enough to startle us! We sin enough to our own
   knowledge, but how much of sin we commit of which we are not aware who
   shall possibly tell? Sins unknown! I have often reminded you of the
   expression in the Greek liturgy, "Your unknown sufferings." It is such
   a blessing that there are unknown sufferings for these unknown sins. We
   are ignorant of the heights and depths of Jesus' love. Thank God that
   there is a vast atonement whose vast efficacy we must leave in
   ignorance, just as there are sins of ignorance utterly undiscoverable
   by us.

   Only one more thought here. I would have you notice, dear Friends, that
   the Jew was not only in danger of defilement in his tent and when he
   walked the roads, but he was in danger in the open fields. For you will
   observe that it says that if he touched a body that had been slain in
   the open fields, or a bone, he should be unclean. For all he knew,
   there might have been a battle there. Perhaps he thought, "Well, this
   is out of the way of men. I see no footprints, no tracks here," and he
   walks carelessly across the green fields. But, though he knows it not,
   there lies in his way the corpse of old who had been killed by
   misadventure, or murdered by his fellow in strife. He stumbles upon the
   body and lo, he is unclean!

   You may go where you will, but you cannot escape from sin. If you take
   the wings of the morning and fly unto the uttermost parts of the sea,
   sin is there. If you make your bed in Hell, it is there it reigns. If
   you seek the cover of midnight, is not midnight the very noon and
   carnival of evil? If you enter the Church of God, you shall find it
   there--high and low, rich and poor, polite and uncivilized--you shall
   search all ranks and positions of men, but sin is everywhere. And until
   we mount with eagles' wings to dwell before the Eternal Throne, we
   shall have to complain that we are daily in danger of defilement.

   II. This brings us now to change the subject, by observing THAT A
   PURIFICATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED. A constant expiation is prepared. As
   Hart puts it--

   "If guilt removed, return and remain,
   Its power may be proved again and again."

   The ransomed Church of God needs daily to be washed in the Fountain and
   the mercy is that the precious blood shall never lose its power, but
   its constant efficacy shall abide till they are, everyone of them,
   "Saved to sin no more." Beloved, there is a propitiation provided for
   daily defilement, for first of all, if it were not so, how melancholy
   were your case and mine!

   Suppose we were Israelites, true Believers, and then to have sinned, as
   we certainly should do? Then, Beloved, at once we should be cut off
   from all privileges. The unclean person had no right to go up to the
   house of the Lord. He had no participation in its solemn worship. For
   him there was no glory of sacred praise and no prevalence of earnest
   prayer. You and I would have no right to Christ, no adoption, no
   justification, no sanctification--for the unclean person has no right
   to any of these. And as we should have no privileges, so we could have
   no communion with God.

   God cannot immediately commune except with perfectly holy beings. He
   does now commune with the imperfect-- but then it is through a perfect
   Savior--and He cannot commune directly with you and me while sin abides
   in us. He has to look upon us as purified through Christ Jesus and
   being, therefore, wholly clean--or else it were not possible for Him to
   walk with us, and to manifest Himself to us. The ultimate result in the
   Israelites' case would have been death. You observe that he who did not
   purify himself was cut off from Israel. First, cut off by
   excommunication, so as no longer to be a sharer in the citizenship of
   Israel.

   And then probably cut off, either by the executioner, or else by the
   sudden judgment of God through plague, or fiery serpent, or some other
   terrible means. And certainly if you and I, though Believers, could
   live for a season without being purified, carrying about with us the
   daily defilement of sin--before long it must end in spiritual death and
   in utter destruction. But thanks be unto God, He has provided against
   these terrible consequences.

   But think again, Beloved, the Lord must provide a daily cleansing for
   our daily defilement, for if not, where were His wisdom, where His
   love? He has provided for everything else. There is not a lack a saint
   can know, but God has furnished a supply. Out of the riches of His
   glory in Christ Jesus, our necessities are all supplied. But if this,
   this glaring, this soul-destroying need had not been provided for, how
   could we call Him our Father and trust in Him? How could we know Him to
   be the only wise God, our Savior? A failure would have occurred in a
   most important point. Beloved, the love, the wisdom, the complete
   wisdom of God demands that there should be such a purification
   supplied.

   The work of our Lord Jesus Christ assures us of this. What is there
   opened for the house of David, for sin and for un-cleanness? A cistern?
   A cistern that might be emptied, a water pot, such as that which stood
   at Cana's marriage feast and might be drained? No, there is a fountain
   open for sin and for uncleanness. We wash, the fountain flows. We wash
   again, the fountain still flows. From the great depths of the Deity of
   Christ, the eternal merit of His passion comes everlastingly welling
   up. Wash! Wash! It is inexhaustible, for it is fountain-fullness. Is it
   not said in Scripture, "If any man sins, we have an Advocate"? Why is
   Christ an Advocate today? Only because we need an Advocate every day.

   Does He not constantly intercede yonder before the Eternal Throne? Why
   does He do that? Because we need daily intercession. And it is because
   we are constantly sinning that He is constantly an Advocate--constantly
   an Intercessor. He Himself has beautifully set forth this in the case
   of Peter--after Supper the Lord took a towel and girded Himself and
   then, taking His basin and His water, He went to Peter and Peter said,
   "You shall never wash my feet." But Jesus told him, "If I wash you not,
   you have no part in Me." He had been washed once. Peter was free from
   sin in the high sense of justification, but he needs the washing
   ofpurification. When Peter said, "Lord, wash not my feet only, but also
   my head and my hands," then Jesus replied, "He that is washed"--that
   is, he who is pardoned--"needs not, save to wash his feet, for he is
   clean every whit."

   The feet need constant washing. The daily defilement of our daily walk
   through an ungodly world brings upon us the daily necessity of being
   cleaned from fresh sin, and that the mighty Master supplies to us.
   Methinks I see Him at this very day still girded with that towed, still
   with that basin and flowing water, going round to all His saints,
   coming round to us, Brothers and Sisters, and saying, "I have washed
   your feet, I, your Master and your Lord. And you are clean every whit."
   There is a provision then. The work of Jesus Christ just meets the
   case.

   Moreover, Beloved, the work of the Holy Spirit also meets the case, for
   what is His business but constantly to take of the things of Christ and
   reveal them unto us--constantly to quicken, to enlighten and to
   comfort? Why all this, but because we are constantly in need,
   perpetually being defiled, and therefore needing perpetually to have
   the purification applied? Best of all, facts show that there is a
   purification for present guilt. The saints of old fell into sin, but
   they did not remain there. David cries, "Purge me with hyssop and I
   shall be clean: wash me and I shall be whiter than snow." Peter denies
   his Master, but he does not always remain a blaspheming, ungrateful
   coward.

   No, he comes back again to his Lord and Master and makes the avowal,
   "You know all things. You know that I love You." You and I, I hope, can
   give a better proof, still, that we have tried it ourselves. We
   remember that dear hour when first we came to Christ. Oh, it was no
   fiction, no dream. We were weighed down with a thousand sins, but one
   look at Jesus took them all away. And since that time we have often
   been cast down. There may be some of you who escape from doubts and
   fears. If you do, I greatly envy you, but I think that most of us get,
   at times, in such a position that we cry with David, "My soul lies
   cleaving unto the dust." You feel as if you dare not come into the
   Lord's Presence. You cannot hope that He will hear your prayer.

   You cannot grasp the promises, they seem too good for such as you. You
   cannot look up to Christ to call Him Brother. "Abba, Father," falters
   on your tongue. But, have you not known what it is to look to your
   Redeemer again just as you did at first? And then your love and joy
   have come back to you again once more, as if it had been a new con-
   version. And you have gone on your way rejoicing--you that only
   yesterday were hanging your harps upon the willows and refusing to sing
   to the praise of your Lord!

   My dear Friends, if this were not a great Truth of God, some of us
   would die in despair. I am sure if I might not still come to Jesus as a
   sinner and still rest in Him, expecting to be cleansed from all
   defilement, I do not know that there would be anything in the Bible
   which could yield comfort to me. I must have a remedy as broad as the
   disease. I must have a supply as deep, as wide, as constant as my
   needs, and, thanks be unto God, here is just such a supply! The foulest
   sins Jesus takes away and when our hearts have backslidden from God He
   does bring us back. Why, some of us have appeared in our own
   consciences to have gone into the very belly of Hell, and yet the Lord
   has brought us up again to the gates of Heaven.

   Ah, it does not take many minutes to work this change. Sometimes I have
   felt all God's waves and billows rolling over me till I was ready to
   despair under a sense of my own unworthiness. And yet the next moment I
   have been able to read my title clear to mansions in the skies. And
   believing on Christ, I have had full fellowship with Him! This is the
   power of purification--thus is it that the application of the precious
   blood of sprinkling always works, when faith, through the Holy Spirit,
   brings it to the conscience. May you and I know this by our daily
   constant experience of it-- that there is a daily purification for
   daily defilement.

   III. But now, Beloved, I bring you to the chapter itself. THE RED
   HEIFER SETS FORTH, IN A MOST ADMIRABLE MANNER, THE DAILY PURIFICATION
   FOR DAILY SIN. It was a heifer--an unusual thing for a sacrifice to be
   a female. And we scarcely know why it should be in this case, unless
   indeed, to make the substitution more evident. This red heifer stood
   for all the house of Israel--for the whole Church of God. And the
   Church is always looked upon and considered in Scripture as being the
   spouse--the bride--always feminine.

   Perhaps, to make the substitution obvious and complete, to show that
   this heifer stood in the place of the whole seed of Israel, it was
   chosen rather than the customary bullock. It was a red heifer. Some
   think because of its rarity, for it was very difficult to find one that
   was red without a single spot--for if there were one white or black
   hair it was always rejected--it must be wholly and entirely red. Some
   think that this was to signify how unique and unrivalled is the Person
   of Christ. How extraordinary--the only One of His Father--the only
   Redeemer of souls. Of such matchless virtue and of such glorious
   pedigree, that no angel can match with Him, neither any of the sons of
   men, for a moment, be compared with Him.

   Probably, however, the red was chosen only from its bringing to the
   mind of the Israelites the idea of blood, which was always associated
   with atonement and putting away of sin. Surely, my Brothers and
   Sisters, when we think of Christ, we always associate Him with the
   streaming gore, when we are under a sense of sin. At other times we
   think of Him as white and ruddy, as Perfection itself. But there is no
   point about Jesus which the trembling conscience loves to rest upon so
   much as that red crimson blood of His.

   We have heard complaints sometimes made of our theology, that there is
   too much blood in it. "The blood is the life thereof." If there were no
   blood in our preaching, there were no life in it, no joy, no true
   power. It is just because we love to extol that precious blood, that
   God is pleased to honor the Word and make it comfortable to saints and
   make it the Word of quickening to sinners. I am sure, dear Brothers and
   Sisters, sometimes when we have sung that verse--

   "His dying crimson, like a robe, Spreads over His body on the Tree," in
   the presence of that blood-red mantle, we have felt the next lines to
   be no imagination, but a sober fact--

   "Then am I dead to all the globe, And all the globe is dead to me."

   My Master, His face covered with bloody sweat, with ruby drops of blood
   around His head. My Lord with His back like a river of gore, where the
   accursed whips have beaten Him--His hands streaming with founts of
   crimson, and His feet flowing with rills of scarlet, and His side
   giving forth a rich waterfall of His heart's blood--He never seems so
   lovely as when thus I see him arrayed in "a vesture dipped in blood."
   "Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? This
   that is glorious in His apparel, traveling in the greatness of His
   strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. Why are You
   red in Your apparel and Your garments like He that treads in the wine
   vat?"

   This is the glorious Savior, mighty to save and never seen so mighty to
   save as when He is robed in crimson. Let it be the red heifer. It shall
   ever bring to the mind of the pious Believer the remembrance of Him who
   trod the winepress alone.

   It was a heifer without spot. This denotes the perfection of Christ's
   Character--"not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing." Born
   without any human defilement, conceived immaculately through the Holy
   Spirit. "That holy Thing which is conceived in you," said the angel to
   the Virgin. Without any natural defilement such as we receive, He felt
   not the taint of original sin.

   Then the heifer must be without blemish. Our Christ, as He had no spot
   of original sin, has no blemish of actual sin. "The prince of this
   world comes and has nothing in Me." He became like unto us in all
   points, but always with this exception--"yet without sin." Observe that
   this red heifer was one where there never came a yoke. Perhaps this
   sets forth how willingly Christ came to die for us. Not forced from
   Heaven, but freely delivering Himself for us all. "Lo, I come to do
   Your will. In the volume of the Book it is written of Me, I delight to
   do Your will, O God." Not dragged to His death. "I lay down My life of
   Myself. I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it up
   again. No man takes it from Me." The free Son of God wears no yoke,
   except that yoke which was easy to Him and that burden which was light,
   the yoke of love which constrained Him to lay down His life for His
   people.

   An interesting circumstance about this red heifer is that it was not
   provided by the priests. It was not provided out of the usual funds of
   the sanctuary, nor yet by the princes, nor by any one person. The
   children of Israel provided it. Why? Why, that as they came out of
   their tents in the desert, or their houses in Jerusalem and saw the
   priests leading the red heifer, every man and every woman and every
   child might say, "I have a share in that heifer. I have a share in that
   victim which is being lead out of the city to be consumed." Brethren, I
   wish--oh, I would to God I dare hope that every man and every woman
   here could say, "I have a share in Jesus Christ," for that is the
   meaning of this national provision, to let us see how Christ shed His
   blood for all His people. And they have all a part and all an interest
   in Him.

   If you believe in Him, though you are the weakest of all His children,
   you have as good a share as the strongest. He is as much your Christ as
   He is the Christ of an Apostle, or of a martyr who went to Heaven in a
   chariot of fire. I hope, Brothers and Sisters, that you see this and
   are assured that you have an interest in Him. As we noted what this
   victim was, there is yet to be observed what was done with it. Again,
   let me beg you to refer to your Bibles, to see what became of this red
   heifer.

   First, it was taken out of the camp. Herein it was a picture of Christ.
   That He might sanctify His people with His own blood, He suffered
   without the camp. Without the camp was the place of uncleanness. There
   the lepers dwelt. There every defiled person was put in quarantine.
   Jesus Christ must be numbered with the transgressors and must suffer
   upon Mount Calvary, outside the city gates, upon that General Tyburn of
   criminals, "the place of a skull." The people of God are to be a
   separate people from all the rest of the world. They are not to be
   numbered with the dwellers in this world's city. They are to be
   strangers and pilgrims and sojourners, as all their fathers were.
   Therefore, Christ, to set them an example of separation, suffers
   Himself without the camp.

   When taken without the camp, the red cow was slain. A dying Savior that
   takes away our sins. Brethren, we love Christ the Risen One, we bless
   Christ the living, pleading Intercessor, but after all, the
   purification to your conscience and to mine comes from the bleeding
   sacrifice. See Him slain before our eyes. Let us sing with Watts--

   "My soul looks back to see The burdens You did bear When hanging on the
   cursed Tree, And hopes her guilt was there." When the heifer was slain,
   Eleazar dipped his finger in the blood as it flowed gurgling forth. He
   dipped his finger in the warm blood and sprinkled it seven times before
   the door of the Tabernacle. Seven is the number of perfection--to show
   that there was a perfect offering made by the sprinkling of the blood.
   Even so, Jesus has perfectly presented His bloody sacrifice.

   Now mark, all this does not purify. I am not yet come to that point.
   Atonement precedes purification--Christ must die and offer Himself a
   victim, or else He cannot be the Purifier. All this is necessary, but
   the vital part of the purification comes presently. They then took the
   body of the slain heifer, which was an unclean thing and made everybody
   unclean who touched it, and laid it upon a pile prepared for its
   burning. They consumed it utterly--its skin, its flesh, its blood, even
   to its dung--not a single thing must be left. This sets forth the pangs
   of the Savior, His great and terrible agony upon the Cross. His real
   death, His real forsaking by God. It sets forth how God accounted Him
   unclean, how our Master was compelled to say, "My God, My God, why have
   You forsaken Me?"

   The heifer does not burn on the altar, it never smoked within the holy
   place as did the bullock which was God's offering. This was a foul and
   guilty thing. The man who killed it became foul. He that gathered the
   ashes was unclean, and even the priest himself had to wash his
   garments. This sets forth how Christ was numbered with the
   transgressors, how the iniquity of His people was laid upon Him, and
   how the Lord, "made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might
   be made the righteousness of God in Him." You will say, "A strange
   thing that those who touched the sacrifice should be made unclean."
   Yes, but types, like other emblems do not run upon all fours.

   Therefore you must look at it in the light intended--who was it that
   put Christ to death? Were they not unclean? Were not the Roman soldiers
   unclean? That ribald mob who shouted, "Crucify Him, crucify Him"--those
   eyes that gloated themselves with the agonies of His tortured body? And
   are not you and I, who helped to put Him to death--are not we ourselves
   unclean? No, I go farther. If I today gather the ashes and bring them
   before you--if I seek today to be as the man who sprinkled that
   purifying water, am I not unclean? Do I not feel that even when I am
   speaking best of my Master, I am sinning still, for I cannot speak of
   Him as I would?

   And, my Brothers and Sisters, what makes you feel so unclean as contact
   with Christ? Is it not true that the very same Christ who takes your
   sins away, first makes you feel your sins? "They shall look on Him whom
   they have pierced and they shall weep and mourn for their sins." The
   same Savior who takes tears away when we look to Him by faith, first
   brings those tears to our eyes when we look and see Him die. It was
   right, therefore, that He should first make those unclean who touched
   Him and then afterwards should make them clean through another touch of
   His purifying power.

   When the whole was fully burnt, or while burning, we find the priest
   threw in cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet. What was this? According to
   Maimonides, the cedar wood was taken in logs and bound round with
   hyssop and then afterwards the whole enveloped in scarlet. So what was
   seen by the people was the scarlet which was at once the emblem of sin
   and its punishment--"Though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as
   snow. Though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool."
   Everything you see still continues of the red color, to set forth
   atonement for sin.

   Inside this scarlet there is the hyssop of faith, which gives efficacy
   to the offering in each individual. And within this is the cedar wood
   that sent forth a sweet and fragrant smell, a perfect righteousness,
   giving acceptance to the whole. One delights to think of this--in
   connection with Christ--that, as there is a daily witness of our
   defilement, so there is a daily imputation of His perfect righteousness
   to us. So that we stand every day accepted in the Beloved by a daily
   imputation, by which not only is daily sin covered, but daily
   righteousness given to us. We are, therefore, every day as much
   accepted as we shall be in that last great day when He shall receive us
   to His glory everlasting.

   The essence of the matter lies in the last act, with the remains of the
   red cow. The cinders of the wood, the ashes of the bones and dung and
   flesh of the heifer, were all gathered together and carried away and
   laid by in a clean place. According to the Jews there was not another
   heifer killed for this purpose for a thousand years. They say, but then
   we have no reason to believe them, that there have never been but nine
   red heifers offered at all. One in the days of Moses, the next in
   Ezra's time, and the other seven afterwards, and that when Messiah
   comes He is to offer the tenth, by which they let out the secret that
   they do look upon the Messiah as coming in His own time to complete the
   type.

   Our own belief is that a red heifer was always found when ashes were
   wanted, and as there were hundreds and thousands of persons defiling
   themselves, the place where the ashes were kept was much frequented and
   much of the purifying matter required. The ashes were to be put in a
   vessel with running water and the water was sprinkled over the unclean
   person who touched a body or a bone. By this process the ashes would
   require to be renewed much oftener than once in a thousand years, in
   order that everyone might have his portion. Does not this storing up
   suggest that there is a store of merit in Christ Jesus? There was not
   only enough to make us free from sin by justification, but there is a
   store of merit laid up that daily defilement may be removed as often as
   it comes--

   "Here's pardon for transgressions past, It matters not how black their
   cast; And, O my soul, with wonder view, For sins to come here's pardon
   too."

   From all the sins I shall ever commit there is a purification laid by
   to cleanse me. The seven times sprinkled blood has put these sins away
   before the Judgment Seat of God and the ashes which are laid by shall
   put my sin away from my conscience, purging it from dead works.

   The ashes were to be put with running water. Running water is ever the
   sweet picture of the Holy Spirit--"He leads me beside still waters."
   The Holy Spirit must take of the things of Christ and reveal them unto
   us. Purification is made in Heaven by the finger of Christ--seven times
   He sprinkled His own blood--but on earth, in our conscience, it is made
   by the Holy Spirit. The Holly Spirit must make Christ precious and
   efficacious to us. What is Christ on the Cross? What is Christ in the
   grave? Nothing to any man till the Holy Spirit makes Him Christ in the
   heart. You will hear many complain that there is no beauty in Christ
   that they should desire Him--it is to them dull work to hear of Jesus.
   Ah, Beloved and well it may be--but when the running water comes, when
   the Spirit of God gives quickening and cleansing to the heart and makes
   us love things Divine, then there is nothing so precious, so
   inexpressibly desirable as the ashes of a slaughtered Savior.

   Observe that it was applied by hyssop. The hyssop was dipped in water,
   and then the unclean was sprinkled. Hyssop is always a type of faith.
   "Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean." Our faith, like a little
   sprig of hyssop, is dipped into the blood, or dipped into this
   cleansing water which flowed from the side of Jesus, and so the remedy
   is applied. Brothers and Sisters, believe in Jesus more fully than you
   have done and you will feel the power of His propitiation. He is God.
   He became Man. He suffered--those sufferings are able to take away sin.
   You need have no guilt on your conscience, but be clean, rejoicing in
   Him and accepted in the Beloved. May the Lord give us to know more
   fully the mysteries of this red heifer and the joy of pardoned sin.

   I will close by remarking that if there is any Believer here who has
   fallen into sin, if there is one who has lost the Presence of the
   Lord--if you have grown cold and dead, if you are conscious of having
   backslidden, if you have begun to doubt whether you are a child of God
   at all--here is in Christ just what you want. Ah, but you say, you have
   fallen so often, sinned so constantly. Yes, but here are ashes for
   every day, cleansing for every hour, for every moment. Look upon your
   Lord and Savior. God is intending to forgive you not once only, but to
   cleanse you every day. He has taught you to forgive your brother not
   seven times, but seventy times seven--and do you think He will not do
   what He tells you to do? Ah, He will forgive you a countless number of
   times, yes, every day.

   If you will seek daily cleansing in Christ, you shall have communion
   with Him. You shall stand in His presence and rejoice with joy
   unspeakable and full of glory. This is no privilege reserved for the
   few, for all of us have--every child of God has--an interest in this.
   Let us come, therefore, boldly and pray the Master now to apply again
   this purification of Christ, that we may again live near to God and
   delight ourselves in His society.

   And as for you that have never believed in Jesus, let me remind you
   that this is not for you. You need to be washed for the first time in
   the blood. O Soul! What a loathsome being you are out of Christ! Why,
   you are all over black from head to foot and black within as well as
   without. What you need first is washing in the blood. You shall have
   the washing of water, of which we speak, another day. The blood of
   Jesus can cleanse you from all sin. Trust to Him and He shall save you.
   Trust Him now. Come now. May the Spirit help you to come that you may
   be saved, both now and forever. Amen.

                        Chastisement--Now And Afterward

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 6, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Now no chastening for the present seems to bejoyous, but grievous:
   nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness
   unto them which are exercised thereby."

   Hebrews 12:11.

   LAST Sunday morning we tried to show you how the uncleanness of sin is
   removed. By the application of the blood of Christ the guilt of sin is
   cleansed--by the water which flowed with the blood from the side of
   Jesus defilement is taken away forever. Our work this morning is to
   consider the destruction of the power of sin. This is a work which
   rests in the hands of God the Holy Spirit and is not comprehended under
   the head ofjustification, but of sanctification. Beware, my Brothers
   and Sisters, lest you mix these two different things. It is in the
   sense of sanctification that the trials and afflictions of this life
   have the blessed influence of purging us from sin.

   It were a very great error to imagine that affliction ever cleans us
   from the guilt of sin. For if we could be afflicted with all the pangs
   of the lost spirits in Hell, and that forever, not a single spot of sin
   would be washed away by all our miseries and tears. Nor are we saved
   from the pollution of sin by our trials. Our conscience must be purged
   from dead works by the blood of Jesus alone. If the wedge of gold which
   Achan stole were accursed, you might have thrust it into the fire as
   many times as you would, but it would have been accursed still. There
   were fiery serpents which bit the children of Israel. Their way was
   long and their journey tedious, but yet I find that they needed the
   ashes of the red heifer, because that purification did for them what
   affliction could not do.

   No amount of affliction can avail, either to take away the guilt or the
   defilement of sin. It is in this sense that Kent sings--

   "With afflictions He may scourge us,
   Send a Cross for every day
   Blast our gourds but not to purge us
   From our sins as some would say--
   They were numbered
   On the Scapegoat's head of old."

   Yet, as we have said, if you separate between sanctification and
   justification and make a clear distinction between the indwelling power
   of sin and the guilt of it, then you may clearly perceive the place
   which affliction holds. When the Holy Spirit acts as Christ's
   representative and sits as a refiner, His furnace is affliction, the
   trials and troubles through which we have to pass are the glowing coals
   which separate the precious from the vile. They are, through Divine
   Grace, the means of restraining and destroying in us the tremendous
   power of indwelling sin until the day shall come when the blessed
   Spirit shall take away from us all corruption. And consequently, we
   shall need no more affliction.

   Coming at once to the text, we shall notice, first, the outward
   appearance of our trials, or SORE CHASTISEMENTS. Secondly, the result
   of our chastening, or BLESSED FRUITFULNESS. And, thirdly, the
   characters benefited by these exercises, or FAVORED SONS.

   I. First, we have very clearly in the text, SORE CHASTISEMENTS.

   1. Keeping literally to the words of the text, we observe that all
   which carnal reason can see of our present chastisement is but seeming.
   "No chastisement for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous." All
   that flesh and blood can discover of the quality of affliction is but
   its outward superficial appearance. We are not able by the eye of
   reason to discover what is the real virtue of sanctified tribulation.
   This discernment is the privilege of faith. Brethren, how very apt we
   are to be deceived by seemings! Why, to our senses, even natural things
   are too high for us. The world seems to stand still and yet we know,
   without any faith, that it is always moving.

   The sun seems to climb the heights of Heaven and then to descend and
   hide himself in the west, and yet we are sure that the sun is fixed in
   his sphere. When the sun is setting, he seems larger than when he shone
   in his zenith, but we are well aware, in this case, that the seeming is
   not the truth and that the sun is no broader at his setting than when
   he was shining in the highest Heaven. Now, if even in natural things
   the seeming is not the truth, and the appearance is very often false,
   we may rest quite sure that though affliction seems to be one thing, it
   really is not what it seems to be. Understand that all that you can
   know about trial, by mere carnal reason, is no more reliable than what
   you can discover by your feelings concerning the motion of the earth.

   Nor, dear Friends, are our seemings at all likely to be worth much when
   you recollect that our fear, when we are under trouble, always darkens
   what little reason we have! I remember one so nervous that when going
   up the Monument, he assured me that he felt it shake. It was his own
   shaking, not the shaking of the Monument. But he was fearful and timid
   at climbing to an unusual height. When you and I under trial get so
   afraid of this, and afraid of that, that we cannot trust the eyesight
   of the flesh, we may rest assured of this, that "things are not what
   they seem."

   Besides, we are very unbelieving and you know how unbelief is apt
   always to exaggerate the black and to diminish the bright. When Giant
   Despair had put his victims into the castle, he was accustomed to beat
   them with a crab tree club. Some of us have felt the weight of that
   club--sore are its blows. Lying in that dungeon, Christian began to
   think whether it were not better to destroy himself, though, poor silly
   man, all the while the key of promise was in his bosom and he needed
   not to have lain rotting in that dungeon for a single hour. We cannot,
   therefore, expect with such a mischief-making propensity within us as
   our inclination to unbelief, that we can fairly judge what affliction
   means.

   Added to this, over and above our unbelief, there is a vast amount of
   ignorance, and ignorance is always the mother of dismay and
   consternation. In the ignorant times in this country men were always
   trembling at their own superstitions. If some old hag--perhaps some
   good old woman--sat by the fireside, they dreamed she had an evil eye.
   They thought that she might scatter plague among the sheep, or mildew
   over the corn. Afraid they were of the timid hare which crossed their
   path, or of the raven croaking in the old oak tree. The air was full of
   omens and presages of ill. Even the insect that cried "tick" as it
   scratched the old decaying post, was a warning of death. And candles
   and coals and all sorts of things alarmed them.

   It is just the same spiritually with us. We are ignorant of what God
   means and so we say with Jacob, "All these things are against me," with
   about as much reason for saying so as our benighted ancestors had for
   being afraid of these omens and signs. We are profoundly ignorant, dear
   Brothers and Sisters, when we dream that we are most wise. And the best
   taught man among us, if he could compare the little that he does know
   with the tremendous mass which he does not know, would be surprised to
   find himself so great a fool. This mass of ignorance always becomes the
   fruitful parent of fears and doubts--and consequently our chastisements
   seem to be very sore to us.

   Besides, dear Friends, we are such selfish beings and so fond of ease.
   And we are so unwilling to be cut and wounded with even God's lances.
   We feel so afraid, even of our heavenly Father's hand, if it should
   give us a blow, that our chastisements always seem to be more horrible
   than they are. You know, when a man resolves that he will endure an
   amputation, because he foresees that future good will come of it, even
   though it is a painful operation, he lies like a hero with scarce a
   groan or a tear. But another, careful of his flesh and timid of
   himself, is frightened even at the sight of the knife and cries out
   when but the very slightest incision has been made, and scarcely any
   pain has been felt.

   So it is with many of us. We are so jealous of our own ease and
   pleasure, that the moment we even see the rod we are frightened and
   alarmed. And at the very first stroke of it, before it has made the
   flesh to tingle, we think it is utterly unbearable, and that God
   intends to destroy us. What, then, with the clouds of fear, the dust of
   unbelief, the smoke of ignorance and the mist of selfishness, it is
   little wonder that we do not perceive the truth and thus, "no
   chastisement seems to be joyous."

   2. The text shows us that carnal reason judges afflictions only "for
   the present." "No chastisement for the present seems to be joyous." It
   judges in the present light, which happens to be the very worst light
   in which to form a correct estimate. Suppose that I am under a great
   tribulation today--let it be a bodily affliction--the head is aching,
   the heart is palpitating, the mind is agitated and distracted. Am I in
   a fit state, then, to judge the quality of affliction, with a
   distracted and addled brain? With the scales of the judgment lifted
   from their proper place, how can I sit and form a just idea of the
   wisdom of God in His dispensations? At such times old sins come up and
   present passions become rebellious. How can I, when I have to contend
   with a thousand ancient sins and present temptations--how can I sit
   down properly and calmly judge what my affliction really is?

   I am compelled to judge of it only by a mere surface glimpse. Besides,
   Satan very seldom forgets to roar on such occasions. That old cowardly
   villain seldom meddles with God's people when they can skillfully
   handle the shield of faith. He knows that we are more than a match for
   him when we are resting simply upon our God. But if he can only see a
   distracted brain, and sin pressing heavily upon us, and a mind
   beclouded, then it is that he comes in a tremendous fury and hopes to
   make a full end of us. And if added to all this, what if God should
   hide His face from us, and we should be in the dark? It is hard judging
   Providences when it is dark--dark without and dark within--Hell howling
   and earth shaking.

   It is difficult to judge anything rightly while, perhaps, the wife is
   dying, the children weeping, property is flying, creditors are dunning,
   the mind vexed and enemies slandering. When we--

   "See every day new straits attend, And wonder where the scene shall
   end," is it a fit time to judge of God? Ought we not at such seasons,
   like Aaron, to hold our peace because the word we shall speak is sure
   to be unwise? Had we not better bid carnal reason hold its decision and
   wait for better times to come? "No chastisement for the present can
   seem joyous but grievous."

   3. This brings me to observe that since carnal reason only sees the
   seeming of the thing--and sees even that in the pale light of the
   present--therefore, Brothers and Sisters, affliction never seems to be
   joyous. If affliction seemed to be joyous, would it be a chastisement
   at all? I ask you, would it not be a most ridiculous thing if a father
   should so chasten a child that the child came down stairs laughing and
   smiling and rejoicing at the flogging? Joyous? Instead of being at all
   serviceable, would it not be utterly useless? What good could a
   chastisement have done if it were not felt? No smart? Then surely no
   benefit! It is the blueness of the wound, says Solomon, which makes the
   heart better.

   And so if the chastisement does not come home to the bone and flesh--if
   it does not distil the tear and extort the cry--what good end can it
   have served? It might even work the other way and be hurtful, for the
   child would surely think that the parent only played with it and that
   disobedience was a trifle--if those very gentle blows were enough, with
   one or two soft, chiding words, to express parental hatred of sin. If
   but the mockery of chastisement were given, the child would be hardened
   in sin, and even despise the authority which it ought to respect.

   My Brothers and Sisters, if God sent us trials such as we would wish
   for, they would be no trials! If they were chastisements that on the
   very surface seemed to be joyous, then they were not chastisements.
   They would still be the sweets, the harmful sweets which children like
   to eat until they turn their stomachs, and are overtaken with sickness.

   Let us here note that no affliction for the present seems to be joyous,
   in two or three respects. It never seems to be joyous in the object of
   it. You know the Lord always takes care when He does strike His people,
   to hit them in a tender place. When He comes forth to the work of
   image-breaking, He always dashes in pieces the most favorite image
   first. Look at David--how could the Lord have touched that man more to
   the quick than by touching him in his children? There is his daughter,
   Tamar, dishonored before his eyes. There is his son Ammon, who first
   commits incest, and afterward falls by another brother's hand.

   There is a darling left--he has grown now to be a fine and comely
   person, there is not such another in all Israel--his hair is his glory.
   He is a man of great wit. He is his father's jewel. As you hear David
   cry, "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would God I had died
   for you! O Absalom, my son, my son!" you see most manifestly that our
   chastening Father never sends afflictions which are joyous. He always
   strikes that object which is nearest to the heart, in order that the
   heart may smart.

   Nor is it, my Brothers and Sisters, joyous in the force of it. "Oh," we
   are apt to think, "if the trial had not been quite so severe, the
   temptation so strong--if the difficulty had not been so great--I could
   have sustained it. But the north wind has come down against me. The
   Lord has broken me in pieces with a terrible hurricane." My dear
   Friends, you must never expect to have the trial joyous in the force of
   it. God will put just so much bitters into the draught that they shall
   not tickle your appetite as some bitters do, but shall really fill you
   with loathing and real misery. He will do it efficiently and
   effectively in the force of it.

   Again, no chastisement ever seems to be joyous as to the time of it. We
   always think it comes at the wrong season. "I was not in safety,
   neither had I rest, neither was I quiet. Yet trouble came," says Job.
   And David has a complaint some- what of the same kind. "In my
   prosperity I said I shall never be moved. Lord, by Your favor You have
   made my mountain to stand strong: You did hide Your face and I was
   troubled." The time of our afflictions, if it were left to our
   choosing-- well, I suppose we should never have any at all--but if we
   must have them and had to choose the time, then they would be joyous
   and so would lose their very meaning.

   Certainly, Brothers and Sisters, they are very seldom joyous as to the
   instrument. Hear David. "It was not an enemy. Then I could have borne
   it." O yes, that is what we always think. "If it were not just that, I
   could have borne it. If I had been poor I could have borne that, but to
   be slandered I cannot endure. To have even lost my wife--ah, it would
   have been a dreadful blow! But I might have borne it--but to have lost
   that dear child--how can I ever rejoice again?"

   Have not you, sometimes, heard Brothers and Sisters speak so, when they
   did not know what they said, for God had sent them the very best
   affliction they could have? He turned over all the arrows in the quiver
   and there was not one which would suit to wound you with but just the
   one He used. And therefore that one He fitted to the string and sent it
   with just as much force as was required--but certainly no more. It all
   goes to prove this, that in no respect--neither in the object, nor the
   instrument, nor the time, nor the force of it--can an affliction ever
   seem to carnal reason to be joyous.

   4. No, more--dear Brothers and Sisters, the text assures us in the next
   place that every affliction seems to be grievous. Perhaps to the true
   Christian, who is much grown in Divine Grace, the most grievous part of
   the affliction is this. "Now," he says, "I cannot see the benefit of
   it. If I could I would rejoice. I do not see why this trouble was sent
   to me. Instead of doing good, it really seems to do harm." "Such a
   Brother has been taken away just in the midst of his usefulness," cries
   the bereaved friend. A wife says, "My dear husband was called away just
   when the children needed most his care." And we say, "Here am I, laid
   aside upon a bed of sickness just when the Church wants me, just when I
   proceeded most triumphantly in a career of usefulness."

   This is always grievous to the Christian because he cannot see, though
   indeed it ought not to be grievous on that account, since he should
   never expect to see--but should walk by faith and not by sight. You
   know, Brothers and Sisters, sometimes our afflictions come upon us like
   ferocious assailants. First of all they impede our running--we cannot
   serve God as much as we like while we are under affliction. We feel as
   if our usefulness has been greatly and grievously hindered by our
   bodily sickness or temporal cares. "I could have given my whole heart
   and both my hands to serve my God if it had not been for these
   distractions."

   No, the assailant not only hinders us, but sometimes he cries, "Stop!"
   and we are obliged to stop altogether. There is a pulling-up time--the
   man tosses on his bed when he would be toiling in the vineyard. A
   sister sometimes has to be weeping at home when she would be comforting
   others' hearts. We come to a dead standstill and we are apt to say, "Is
   this joyous to me to have my feet fast in the stocks?" Sometimes the
   assailant even knocks us down--trials come so heavily upon us, that we
   cannot stand. Faith reels, hope dies, murmuring and discontent trip up
   our heels and we say, "What? Is this joyous? Is there any good in this?
   Where can be the benefit of an affliction which through the infirmity
   of my flesh drives me to evil and develops the devil that is in me? Can
   there be any good in this?"

   No, sometimes it not only knocks us down, but wounds us. Ah, there are
   many Christians who in their afflictions have received serious wounds,
   for they have spoken against the Lord. Their impatience has prevailed,
   and much of their experience has turned out to be a mere figment. No,
   there are some Christians who are even killed by their affliction. I do
   not mean that the spiritual seed within them ever dies. God forbid! But
   I mean that the joy and apparent life of their religion seem as if they
   had expired, and for a moment they cannot think they are Christians at
   all. They are led to think that they were never bought with blood and
   never were in the Covenant, for the blows of affliction have utterly
   killed them.

   Ah, my Brothers and Sisters, it is hard to see that such a trial is
   right. Things are grievous, indeed, when it comes to this point--when
   not only the temporal--but even the spiritual gets marred. When the
   fine gold becomes dim and the glory departs. When the crown of beauty,
   once upon our head, is cast down in the mire and we ourselves become
   like a wild bull in a net, kicking against the Lord. We become as one
   having our soul, not as a weaned child, but one that is weaning,
   petulant and full of all manner of ill humor and bad temper. And yet
   this is often the experience of God's people, and therefore, to them it
   is that it will always seem grievous.

   5. But now let me add, and then I have done with the first head, that
   all this is only seeming. Do let me keep you to this, all this is only
   seeming. Faith triumphs in trial. When reason is sent into the
   background and has her feet made fast in the stocks, then Faith comes
   in and cries, "I will sing of mercy and ofjudgment. Unto You, O Lord,
   will I sing." Faith pulls the black mask from the face of trouble and
   discovers the angel beneath. Faith looks up at the cloud and says--

   "It is big with mercy and shall break In blessings on my head."

   There is a subject for song even in the smarts of the rod. For, first,
   the trial is not as heavy as it might have been. Next, the trouble is
   not so severe as it ought to have been, and certainly the affliction is
   not so terrible as the burden which others have to carry.

   Faith sees that in her worst sorrow there is nothing penal. There is
   not a drop of God's wrath in it. It is all sent in love. Faith sees
   love in the heart of an angry God. Faith says of her grief, "Why, this
   is a badge of honor, for it is the child that must have the rod," and
   she sings of the sweet result of her sorrows, because they work her to
   lasting good. No, more--Faith says, "These light afflictions which are
   but for a moment do work out for me a far more exceeding and eternal
   weight of glory." So Faith sits down on the black throne, out of which
   she has expelled reason and carnal sense and she begins, to the praise
   of Divine Wisdom, to lift up her voice in a joyous song. Well, Brothers
   and Sisters, that is the first point. I have been rather too long upon
   it, perhaps, but I could not help it.

   II. We have spoken of sore afflictions--well, now, next we have BLESSED
   FRUIT-BEARING. I want you to notice the word which goes before the
   fruit-bearing part of the text. "No chastisement for the present seems
   to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless." Now what does that mean? It
   gives me my first point under the second head, that this fruit-bearing
   is not natural--it is not the natural effect of affliction. You will
   see a man take a mass of metal. It appears to you very pure and very
   beautiful to look upon. It is alloyed. He puts it into his refining
   pot, he heats the coals, he begins to stir it. You will say to him,
   "Why, what are you doing? You are spoiling that precious metal. See how
   foul is the surface! What a scum floats up."

   The natural effect of the fire is to make the scum show itself. A hand,
   a skillful hand is needed, for the fire cannot do the refiner's
   work--he himself must skim the base metal off the top. Affliction only
   makes the sin rise to the surface, it makes the devil in us come up. It
   makes us, while we are boiling in affliction, worse than we were
   before. It is the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit and of our
   blessed Lord and Master, when He sees it on the top, to skim it off.
   The affliction does not do us any good in itself. The natural fruit of
   affliction is rebellion.

   If God chastens me, can I love Him for that? Not naturally. If He
   smites me, for that can I yield Him homage? No, naturally I rebel
   against Him and I say, "Who are You that You should smite me thus, and
   what have I done that I should be tormented by You?" To kiss the hand
   which smites is something more than natural, it is Divine Grace--and
   the Apostle seems to hint at this, when he says, "Nevertheless." Oh,
   dear Friends, no more could we be purged by affliction than could the
   sea be made pure by being stirred up with storm!

   I have looked sometimes at the waves when they seemed a delightfully
   pure blue and then, after a tremendous storm, the deep has been moved
   from the very bottom and its waves are thick and foul with sand and
   seaweed. Trials breed discontent, anger, envy, rebellion, enmity,
   murmuring and a thousand other ills. But God overrules and makes the
   very thing which would make Christians worse, to minister unto their
   growth in holiness and spirituality. It is not the natural fruit of
   affliction, but the supernatural use to which God turns it, in bringing
   good out of evil. Note that.

   And, then, observe, dear Friends, that this fruit is not instantaneous.
   "Nevertheless." What is the next word? "Afterward." Many Believers are
   deeply grieved because they do not at once feel that they have been
   profited by their afflictions. Well, you do not expect to see apples or
   plums on a tree which you have planted but a week. Only little children
   put their seeds into their flower garden and then expect to see them
   grow into plants in an hour. I would have you look for very speedy
   fruit, but not too speedy fruit--for sometimes the good of our troubles
   may not come to us for years afterward, when, perhaps, getting into a
   somewhat similar experience, we are helped to bear it by the
   remembrance of having endured the like ten or twenty years ago.

   It is "nevertheless afterward." The good of trouble is not generally
   while we are in trouble, but when we get out of trouble. Yet, on the
   other hand, it sometimes happens that God can give us the jewels even
   before we leave Egypt so that we can march out of the house of bondage
   with golden earrings hanging at our ears and covered with all manner of
   ornaments. For the most part however, "it is nevertheless afterward."

   Well now, you will note in the text a sort of gradation with regard to
   what affliction does afterward. It brings forth fruit. That is one
   step. That fruit is the fruit of righteousness. That righteous fruit is
   peaceable, this is best of all. First, affliction really does to the
   Christian, when the time comes, bring forth fruit. This is the object
   of Christ in sending it. In His sweet prayer for the elect He prayed
   that His people might bring forth fruit. He said, "Herein is My Father
   glorified, that you bring forth much fruit." He assured them that every
   branch of the true vine that brought forth fruit would be purged, that
   it might bring forth more fruit.

   So far as this world is concerned, God gets His glory out of us--not by
   our being Christians--but by our being fruitful Christians. And the end
   and object of Divine husbandry is to make our branches hang down with
   fruit. Blessed is that chastening which, being fruitful in us, makes us
   also fruitful. It brings forth the fruit of righteousness. Not natural,
   and therefore impure fruit, but fruit such as God Himself may
   accept--holiness, purity, patience, joy, faith, love, and every other
   Christian Grace. It does not make the Christian more righteous in the
   sense of justification, for he is completely so in Christ. But it makes
   him more apparently so in the eyes of onlookers, while he, through his
   experience, exhibits more of the Character of his Lord.

   Note again, that this righteous fruit is peaceable. None so happy as
   tried Christians, afterward. No calm more deep than that which precedes
   a storm. There is a lull in the atmosphere after the hurricane which is
   not known at other times. Who has not seen clear skies after rain? God
   gives sweet banquets to His children after the battle. It is after the
   rod that He gives the honeycomb. After climbing the Hill Difficulty we
   sit down in the arbor to rest. After passing the wilderness we come to
   the House Beautiful. After we have gone down the Valley of Humiliation,
   after we have fought with Apol-lyon, the Shining One appears to us and
   gives us the branch which heals us.

   It is always "afterward" with the Christian. He has his best things
   last, and he must be expecting, therefore, to have his worst things
   first. It is always "afterward." Still, when it does come, it is peace,
   sweet, deep peace. Oh, what a delightful sensation it is, after a long
   illness, once more to walk abroad--though perhaps you are still pale to
   look upon, and feeble in body--you walk out of doors and breathe the
   air again! You can feel your blood leap in your veins and every bone
   seems to sing out because of the mercy of God. Such is the peace which
   follows long and sharp afflictions. Our enemies are drowned in the Red
   Sea--then is the time to go forth with timbrel and dance. Our sorrows
   have left a silver line of holy light behind them and our spirit is as
   calm as a summer's eve.

   III. And now for the third point and that is, FAVORED SONS.
   "Nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness
   in them which are exercised thereby." I will venture to say this, that
   it does not yield peaceable fruit to everybody, no, it does not yield
   peaceable fruit to every "son" either. It is not every Christian who
   gets a blessing from affliction, at least not from every affliction
   that he has. I conceive that the last words are inserted by way of
   distinction and of real difference--"those that are exercised thereby."

   You know, Brothers and Sisters, there are some of the Lord's children
   who, when they get a trouble, are not exercised by it, because they run
   away from it. They imagine and employ rash means of avoiding it. They
   use subterfuges in order to escape from it. They are not exercised
   thereby. Their Father holds the rod over them and they run away from
   His hand. Perhaps they get a tingling smart as they run, far worse than
   if they had stopped. They may get a sorry cuff from His hand, but they
   are not exercised by it. There are others who, when under trouble, are
   callous and do not yield. They bear it as a stone would bear it. They
   learn the stoics' art.

   The Lord may give or take away, they are equally senseless. They look
   upon it as the work of blind fate, not as the fruit of that blessed
   predestination which is ruled by a Father's hand. And so they are like
   the bullock, which rather kicks against the pricks than yields to the
   driver. They get no benefit from tribulation. It never enters into
   them, they are not exercised by it. Now, you know what the word
   "exercised" means in the Greek gymnasium--the training master would
   challenge the youths to meet him in combat. He knew how to strike, to
   guard, to wrestle. Many severe blows the young combatants received from
   him, but this was a part of their education, preparing them at some
   future time to appear publicly in the games. He who shirked the trial
   and declined the encounter with the trainer received no good from him,
   even though he would probably be thoroughly well flogged for his
   cowardice.

   The youth whose athletic frame was prepared for future struggles was he
   who stepped forth boldly to be exercised by his master. If you see
   afflictions come and sit down impatiently and will not be exercised by
   your trials, then you do not get the peaceable fruit of righteousness.
   But if, like a man, you say, "Now is my time of trial, I will play the
   man and wake up my faith to meet the foe. By His Grace, I will take
   hold of God, stand with firm foot, and slip not. Let all my graces be
   aroused, for here is something to be exercised upon." It is then that a
   man's bones, sinew and muscles all grow stronger. We know that those
   who strive for the mastery, keep under their body, in order that they
   may come prepared in the day of contest. And so must the Christian use
   his afflictions. He must exercise himself by them to the keeping down
   of the flesh to the conquest of his evil desires--that he may be as
   strong as if his flesh were iron and his muscles hardened steel.

   You ask me, what in the Christian is exercised by affliction?
   Everything newborn in the Christian is exercised. The newborn seed is
   exercised by affliction and that filial spirit which springs from it.
   There is sonship in every Believer in Christ that is exercised. And the
   spirit of sonship and the graces of sonship all are tried. In fact,
   affliction, when it does us most good, exercises all the man. It sets
   every power to work, strains his patience, tests his faith, proves his
   love. It develops his fears, glorifies his hopes. And whatever other
   power there is in his spiritual manhood, it exercises all to the
   uttermost point, and it makes every part grow stronger and nearer to
   perfection. And so the peaceable fruits of righteousness are yielded to
   those "that are exercised thereby."

   Mark that distinction, because we are not all thus favored. We are all
   sons and daughters and shall all have to bear the trial, yet we may not
   all be exercised by it. Let us pray God to give us to be exercised by
   affliction when we do get it, that so we may possess the practical
   benefit of it.

   I have done when I have added three practical reflections. First, see
   the happy estate of a Christian. His worst things are good things, his
   smarts are his joys, his losses are his gains. Did you ever hear of a
   man who got his health by being sick? That is a Christian. He gets rich
   by his losses, he rises by his falls, he goes on by being pushed back,
   he lives by dying, he grows by being diminished and becomes full by
   being emptied. Well, if the bad things work him so much good, what must
   his best things do? If his dark nights are as bright as the world's
   days, what shall be his days? If even his starlight is more splendid
   than the sun, what must his sunlight be?

   If he can sing in dungeons, how sweetly will he sing in Heaven! If he
   can praise the Lord in the fire, how will he praise Him before the
   Eternal Throne! If even a thorn in the flesh only drives him to his
   God, Brothers and Sisters, where will the convoy of angels carry him?
   If evil is good to him, what will the overflowing goodness of God be to
   him in another world? Who would not be a Christian? Who would not know
   the transcendent riches of the Believer's heritage?

   Secondly, see where the Believer's hope mainly lies. It does not lie in
   the seeming. He may seem to be rich, or seem to be poor, seem to be
   sick, or seem to be in health--he looks upon all that as the seeming.
   He notices that the thing seen is the thing that seems, but the thing
   that is believed is the thing that is. He knows that what his eye
   catches is only the surface, what his finger touches is only the
   exterior. But what his heart believes, that is the depth, the
   substance, the reality. So, Brothers and Sisters, he finds all his joy
   in the "nevertheless afterward."

   Sometimes he is in great trouble, dark trouble--and the devil tempts
   him, but he spells that word over and repeats it--"Never-the-less, I am
   very poor, but I shall, never-the-less, obtain Heaven forever. I am
   very weak, but never-the-less, I shall be where the inhabitant is never
   sick. The devil has beaten me--I am on the ground and he has his foot
   on my neck, and says he will make an end of me--but I have,
   never-the-less, eternal security in Christ." Never-the-less, not a
   grain--not an atom the less, in fact--he throws the never-the-less into
   an ever-the-more. He believes he shall have ever-the-more of bliss and
   so, looking to the afterward, he rejoices in tribulation, for
   tribulation works patience and patience experience and experience hope.

   Why, the Christian often learns his best lessons about Heaven by
   contrast. If a man should give me a black book printed in the old black
   letters, and should say, "You want to know about happiness, that book
   is written about misery, learn from the opposite," I would thank him
   just as much for that as if the book were on happiness. So the Believer
   takes his daily trials and reads them the opposite way. Trial comes to
   him and says, "Your hope is dry." "My hope is not dry," says he, "while
   I have a trial I have a ground of hope." "Your God has forsaken you,"
   says Tribulation. "My God has not forsaken me," says he, "for He says
   in the world you shall have tribulation and I have it. I have a letter
   from God in a black envelope, but, as long as it came from Him I do not
   mind what kind of envelope it comes in. He has not forgotten me--has
   not given me up--He is still gracious to me."

   And so the Christian begins to think about Heaven, "For," he says,
   "this is the place of work, that is the place of rest. This is the
   place of sorrow, that is the place ofjoy. Here is defeat, there is
   triumph. Here is shame, there glory. Here it is being despised, there
   it is being honored. Here it is the hiding of my Father's face, there
   it is the glory of His Presence. Here it is absence in the body, there
   it is presence with the Lord. Here weeping and groaning and sighing,
   there the song of triumph. Here death--death to my friends and death to
   myself--there the happy union of immortal spirits in immortality." So
   he learns to sing not of the seeming, but of the "nevertheless
   afterward," with sweet hope, as his harp of many golden strings.

   Lastly, Brothers and Sisters, afterward is just the point where the
   unconverted feel the pinch. "Nevertheless afterward." I walk round your
   gardens--you are rich. How beautifully they are laid out! What rare
   flowers! What luxuries! And as I look at them all, if I remember that
   you will die. I say to myself, "Nevertheless afterward. This poor man
   who has a paradise on earth can have no Paradise in the world to come."
   Do I see you riding gaily along the street? You have abundance of
   wealth and honor, but you are without God and without Christ. Then I
   see close behind you a grim executioner, bearing this motto,
   "Nevertheless afterward."

   You wear a smiling face this morning, for though you have neither
   riches nor honor, still you are young, and have health and beauty and
   are looking out on the pleasures of this world. I want you to take a
   telescope in your hand and look a little further--"Nevertheless
   afterward"! You are thinking about this present life, and hoping you
   will prosper in it. And up to now you have not wanted any religion--you
   say you have been happy enough without Christ, and you dare say you
   will get on without Him. But I want you to remember, "Nevertheless
   afterward."

   When you come to die, when you stand before an angry God, when you rise
   amid the terrors of the Day of Judgment, when you have to meet the open
   book and the burning eyes of the great Judge, when you hear the
   sentence, "Come, you blessed," or "Depart, you cursed," you will think
   of "Nevertheless afterward." I wish you would bring these eternal
   things before your mind and reckon with your conscience concerning
   them. Soul, if your joy is in earth and your trust in self, you may
   spread yourself like a green bay tree--you may become as a bullock
   fattened for the slaughter--but nevertheless afterward, beware lest He
   tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver.

   Believe in Christ. Trust your soul with Him and then whatever is to
   come afterward, whatever "Nevertheless afterward" may come, you may
   always be sure of this--that there is for you an eternal and exceeding
   weight of glory. May my Master give you an interest in that
   "Nevertheless afterward," and then I shall not fret, nor will you,
   either, if you have to have an interest in the rod of the Covenant
   which is for the present, at least in seeming, not joyous but grievous.

                             The Cedars Of Lebanon

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 13, 1863, BY THE REV.
   C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The trees of the Lord are full of sap. The cedars of Lebanon, which He
   has planted." Psalm 104:16.

   IF Solomon were here this morning, who spoke of all trees, from the
   hyssop on the wall to the cedar that is in Lebanon, he would greatly
   instruct us in the natural history of the cedar and, at the same time,
   uttering allegories and proverbs of wisdom, he would give us apples of
   gold in baskets of silver. But since the Lord Jesus Christ has said,
   "Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world," we can
   dispense with the company of Solomon. For if Christ is present, behold,
   a greater than Solomon is here. Solomon probably would confine his
   remarks simply to the physical conformation and botany of the wonderful
   tree. But our Lord, I trust, will speak to our hearts this morning
   concerning those who are "planted in the courts of the Lord," and
   therefore flourish like cedars. May our communications this morn be
   blessed to us while we talk of those trees of the Lord, those plants of
   His own right hand planting which grow in the garden of the Lord.
   I shall have to say some things this morning which are not for
   beginners in the Gospel school. I shall have to handle some lofty
   matters which belong to the more advanced of the Lord's family. For
   Lebanon is a high hill and the ascent is very craggy. The pathway to
   the summit is not for the feet of babes--it is rather fit for those
   lion-like men, those men of experience--who, by reason of use, have had
   their feet made like hind's feet that they may stand on the high
   places. Follow me as I may be led of the Spirit to climb that arduous
   pathway. Let us stand this morning under the venerable shadow of those
   ancient cedars which, to this very day, are the Lord's witnesses and
   are as before, full of sap--the cedars of Lebanon, which the Lord has
   planted.
   There are three things I shall bring before your attention this
   morning, in the cedars of Lebanon. First of all, the absence of all
   human cultivation. Secondly, the presence of Divine care. And thirdly,
   the fullness of vital principle.
   You may not see all this at first, but remember that our translation is
   not exactly correct. You will observe that the word "sap," is inserted
   in italics--it is not there in the Hebrew. "The trees of the Lord are
   full," or rather, which gives the meaning clearly, "The trees of the
   Lord are satiated--are satisfied--the cedars of Lebanon, which He has
   planted."

   I. That rendering of the text gives me my first point. We see in yonder
   venerable trees, crowning the ridge of the Lebanese range, THE ABSENCE
   OF ALL HUMAN CULTIVATION.

   1. Note first, that these trees are peculiarly the Lord's trees,
   because they owe their planting entirely to Him. "The cedars of
   Lebanon, which He has planted." No diligent hands dug the soil, no
   careful farmer dropped in the fruitful cone. How those ancient giants
   of the grove came there, no tongue can tell. It must be left among the
   mysteries. Perhaps the waters of the tremendous deluge washed up the
   cones and laid them safely upon the ledge of rock at the top of the
   hill, and there they sprouted and grew. That would be but a guess. We
   must leave the early planting of those mighty trees among the secrets
   which belong unto God. Certain it is that they owe nothing to men, that
   there is not a tree of Lebanon of which we may not safely say, "This is
   one of the cedars which the Lord has planted."

   Beloved, it is quite true of every child of God. The Lord uses
   instrumentality, but the instrument has no real power except as God
   puts power into it. If we have been converted, we were not converted of
   ourselves, of the energy of our own free will. We are not self-planted,
   but God-planted. If we have been turned from nature's darkness to
   marvelous light, it was not through the oratory or eloquence of the
   minister. If so, our religion would be in vain. It was God whose fiat
   said, "Let the light be," and light was.

   It was He who said, "Let that dried branch be planted in My garden,"
   and planted we were--and grow we must-- and shall, while He supports
   us. The mysterious finger of the Divine Spirit dropped the living seed
   into a heart which He had Himself prepared for its reception. And there
   it sprang up and continued to grow from the tender shoot until it
   towered aloft as a goodly cedar of mighty girth. Every true heir of
   Heaven, like the cedar, owns the Great Farmer as His planter.

   2. As I look upon those noble trees, I note that they are not dependant
   upon man for their watering. Yonder trees in the plain are fertilized
   by little canals running at their roots, and therefore are they green.
   But these on the top of Lebanon, who shall find a stream for them? Who
   shall bring the rivers of water to their feet? How shall the gardener
   empty his bucket, that they may drink? No, there they stand on the
   lofty rock, not moistened by human irrigation. And yet your heavenly
   Father supplies them. The clouds, those wandering cisterns of the sky,
   arrested by their branches, hover round them and at last pour down in
   deluges the fructifying rain.

   Or the ledges of the rock retain the streamlets which trickle from
   Lebanon's snowy peaks and then the roots of the cedar drink up the
   nourishment which they require. But man has nothing to do with it.
   Man's cultivation withers in the plain below. When autumn comes, the
   fields are all dry and parched. Man only preserves to himself a little
   spot of green by perpetually using the processes of irrigation, but
   these cedars owe not a single drop to the power and energy of man.
   Well, now, so is it to the Christian who has learned to live by faith.
   He can say--

   "My trust is in the Lord alone,
   My rock and refuge in His Throne;
   In all my fears, in all my straits,
   My soul on His salvation waits."

   He is independent of man, even in temporal things, because he has
   learned to trust in his God. He believes the promise--"Your bread shall
   be given you and your water shall be sure." And the bread and the water
   are sure to him in spirituals. Though he uses the means, though he
   loves the pastor after God's own heart, though he loves the pastures
   where he feeds and is made to lie down. Yet still he sings, The Lord is
   my Shepherd, therefore I shall not want. He leads me beside the still
   waters, He makes me to lie down in green pastures." On no priest does
   he rely, on no persuasions of eloquent tongues does he depend. For his
   full and his continued maintenance he looks to the Lord his God and to
   Him alone. The dew of Heaven is his portion and the God of Heaven is
   his Fountain. Every Christian, thus, is a tree of the Lord, in His
   planting and in His watering.

   3. Furthermore, if your eyes look attentively at yonder cedars, you
   will see that no mortal might protects them. They are planted on a
   mountain ridge no less than six thousand feet above the level of the
   sea. The snow frequently lies upon their branches in enormous masses.
   They are in the most exposed position conceivable. When the cedars were
   as yet but young, the browsing goat might have destroyed them. As they
   grew up, the heavy falls of snow must have completely buried the young
   trees.

   Afterward they were subjected to many dangers. Up there the lightning
   is at home. There the callow tempests try their young wings. Lebanon's
   towering peaks must be a frequent mark for the thunderbolts of God and
   sometimes when the time has come, the voice of the Lord, that makes the
   hinds to calve, also rends the cedars of Lebanon and the hoary prince
   of the forest bows humbly at the touch of the scepter of his King.
   These trees owe nothing--for their preservation from storm, wind and
   tempest--to man. There is no hedge set about them. There are no means
   used to shore up the limbs as they begin to drop by weight--man does
   not even keep the goat from them. They are left there unprotected in
   the pitiless storm and terrible blast, and yet the veterans survive.
   The cedars of Lebanon have not all fallen even beneath the insatiable
   axe of man--still they stand--God's trees, kept and preserved by Him
   and by Him alone.

   It is precisely the same with the Christian. He is not a hot-house
   plant, sheltered from temptation. He does not live in a world of holy
   and hallowed influence, preserving him from sin. He stands in the most
   exposed position, on yonder bare rock, where winds of mysterious
   Satanic influence and dreadful earthquakes of his own doubts and fears
   daily try him. Where terrific thunderbolts from God's right hand, the
   thunderbolts of desertion and stern affliction all come against him. He
   has no shelter, no protection, except this--that the broad wings of the
   Eternal God always cover the cedars which he himself has planted.

   Oh, it is magnificent to think how the Christian bears up! Weak,
   feeble, less than nothing in himself, yet so mighty that all Hell
   cannot crush him and the united hosts of the world, the flesh and the
   devil, cannot prevail against him. Me-thinks I hear the cedars, as the
   trees of the woods clap their hands, shouting aloud--"In all these
   things we are more than conquerors," as they remember lightning and
   snow and storm. And so with the cedars of the Lord, when tribula- tion
   and trial and distress come upon them--"We are more than conquerors
   through Him that has loved us." Brethren, forget not that our refuge is
   in the Lord alone.

   4. Fourthly, as to their inspection--they also preserve a sublime
   indifference to human gaze. Perhaps for thousands of years they may not
   have been looked upon by human eyes at all. Moses desired to see "that
   goodly land and Lebanon." David often saw them and he sang of that
   handful of corn whose fruit shall shake like Lebanon. But I cannot find
   that the cedars have become a whit more green now that they are visited
   by pilgrims, nor, on the other hand, that they lose anything of their
   verdure because the evil eyes of man may have glanced upon them.

   Solomon spoke of one who was "excellent as the cedars." Sacred to God,
   they stand high up in lonely grandeur, indifferent to mortal judgment.
   When the virgin snows of Lebanon were untouched by man's polluted foot,
   and the Eternal walked in tempest, stepping from crag to crag. Or when
   in the cool eventide the Unseen One trod their hallowed aisles, these
   trees were God's trees and God's trees alone, stretching out their
   broad branches for Him to gaze upon. They were quite content if at high
   noon, or in the deep gloom of midnight, the Great Planter in solitary
   glory looked down upon them.

   It is just so with the Christian. He stands, like the cedars, in a
   conspicuous position, but he courts not observation. He is like a city
   set upon a hill, yet still consciously he walks before the Lord in the
   land of the living. He owes nothing to the smiles of men, and he cares
   as little for their frowns. I mean that true Believer who has so grown
   in faith that he no longer leans upon an arm of flesh, but understands
   how to stand upright. I mean that advanced Christian who has not one
   foot upon the sea and the other on the land, but has put both his feet
   on the Rock of Ages and lets earth reel if it will, and bids the storms
   come and the winds blow, unmoved, possessing a deep calm within,
   because he looks to God. This is his joy and his only joy, "You, God
   see me, my Father who is in Heaven knows my needs, He looks upon me and
   regards me."

   Out with the piety which depends upon the public eye! Away, away, away
   with the religion that needs to be watched and guarded lest it desert
   the standard. I am not to have religion like a dog collar, which I may
   slip off and on and feel glad to be rid of it. It must be part and
   parcel of my being. My religion must be a thing which lives in the
   notice of God, in my closet, and in my secret heart. Mine must be a
   religion which I bring into public because I cannot leave it behind. It
   must not be the Pharisees' paint and tinsel which he puts on in the
   public place and privately laughs at when he gets alone.

   Ah, my Brothers and Sisters, we want to be like the cedars, caring only
   for God, minding little whether we are praised or blamed by any of
   human shape. If you cannot feel it sufficient honor to be known of Him
   who sees in secret, you have need to begin to live aright.

   5. Nor have we finished here the glorious independence of the cedar. I
   would I had a tongue to tell it all out, it is a theme for poet or
   bard. We want a Coleridge or a Milton to sing the majesty of those
   grand old trees in their solitary glory. Note that their exultation is
   all for God and not for man. When the fig tree yields its figs, it may
   well say, "Thanks to the cultivator who has taken so much care of me."
   When the vine gives up her luscious clusters she has to thank the
   vinedresser who has used the pruning knife. When you walk your gardens,
   all your plants praise you as well as God, because of your care for
   them.

   But what say the cedars? Who has planted the cedars, or who has watered
   them? Who has pruned them--who has hedged them about and kept them in
   the day of storm? The Lord, even the Lord, alone, has been everything
   unto the cedars and, therefore, David very sweetly puts it in one of
   the last Psalms, "Praise you the Lord, fruitful trees and all cedars."
   The cedars have not a green leaf to magnify man with, nor a single cone
   with which to make him proud. The cedar's silent song is, "Let Jehovah,
   God of Israel, be praised and when we fall, let our split timbers build
   a temple to His praise, for unto Him and unto Him alone we grow."

   They fell, you know, many of them, beneath the axe of Hiram and floated
   on the sea to Joppa. And then again were carried to Jerusalem. But it
   was that they might make the holy place and build the pillars of the
   temple of God. So, Christians, is it with you. There is nothing in you
   that can magnify man. If you understand yourselves aright you give unto
   the Lord glory and strength, for your only thanks are due to Him. Your
   praise, your gratitude shall ascend to Him who chose you before ever
   the earth was. To Him who bought you with His precious blood. To Him
   who quickens and preserves you by His Spirit. And when you die, this is
   your hope and joy--that you shall be pillars in the temple of your

   God and go no more out forever. You are the Lord's trees from first to
   last. If you know yourselves aright, the Author and Finisher of your
   Faith is your Divine Redeemer.

   6. I do not know that there is a cedar upon Lebanon which is not also
   independent of man in its expectations. They never expect to be fenced
   about and hedged. They never reckon upon being preserved and watered by
   man. We have many schemes, but I have heard of none for preserving the
   cedars. Speculations are rife every day and one would scarcely be
   astonished by a projected railroad to the moon. But yet I have never
   heard of anyone who has attempted to purchase the cedars of Lebanon, to
   preserve them, or make them his private property.

   Arabs and Turks do their best to ruin the whole grove, but yet there
   they stand, expecting as little from man as they have ever received
   from him, giving him their shadow, yielding him their fragrance, but
   getting nothing and expecting nothing from him in return. That is your
   example, O Christian. You are to live expecting nothing from man and
   you shall never be disappointed. You are to live looking upon the Lord
   alone and there again disappointment shall never come. You are to
   understand that one of God's objects with you is to knock away every
   prop from you, to take away every buttress and to make you lean upon
   God alone.

   There is the round world, what bears it up? He hangs the world upon
   nothing. If you are what you should be you are just like that
   earth--you have no visible support--there is nothing upon which you can
   depend that the carnal eye can see. But yet as the earth moves not and
   falls not from her orbit, so you, by the power of faith, shall be
   maintained and kept just where you are. "The young lions do lack and
   suffer hunger, but they that wait on the Lord shall not want any good
   thing." It is a life's work to learn independence of the creature and
   almost another life's work to learn dependence upon the Creator.

   To wean us from the breasts of this world is a long and painful
   process. To get us clean rid of that walking by sight, which is the
   disease of man, and to bring us to walk by faith in the Spirit, which
   is the glory of a Christian--this is a work well worthy of a God--and
   blessed is the man who has this work to a great extent accomplished in
   himself. I do feel, Brothers and Sisters, more and more that my soul
   must wait only upon the Lord, and that my expectation must be from Him
   alone. You, too, must come here and learn that the Lord will provide,
   but it is only in the mountain of the Lord that this sweet Truth of God
   can be seen.

   II. Now for the next point. The cedars of Lebanon are a GLORIOUS
   DISPLAY OF DIVINE CARE.

   1. First, in the abundance of their supply. No river, as I have
   observed, rolls at their feet. No canals keep their leaf from
   withering--man uses no labor and employs no skill to irrigate the
   steeps of Lebanon--and yet do the cedars need anything? Look at them!
   Stand under their shadow and see if they want any good thing. The text
   tells us, that so far from wanting, they are saturated--"The trees of
   the Lord are full." Man's trees may sometimes be ready to perish for
   lack of moisture. They may be frostbitten and their shoots may be
   nipped-- but the trees of the Lord are full--there is never any want
   there. There is no want to them that fear Him.

   Dear Friends, those Believers who have learned most to live by faith
   possess the richest part of the land of promise. Other Believers live
   in the land of Egypt and are often making bricks without straw. But
   these dwell in the land which flows with milk and honey. They have
   passed the wilderness, and having believed, they have entered into
   rest. The lot of the truly full grown Believer who stays himself upon
   his God alone, is well set forth in the promise, "His soul shall dwell
   at ease and his seed shall inherit the earth."

   He has his troubles, but faith makes them light. He has his wants, but
   faith never permits him to call them wants, for they are always
   supplied before the necessity begins to pinch him. Other men may, with
   all their watching and wisdom, come to nothing. They may rise up early
   and sit up late and eat the bread of carefulness and yet be poor. But
   they who stay upon God in temporals and spirituals, if Heaven should
   shake, and if the pillars of the earth should be moved and the sea
   should be dried up, yet their place of defense shall be munitions of
   rocks. "Their bread shall be given them and their water shall be sure."

   See this on a large scale in the case of our dear brother Muller's
   institution at Bristol. We often see institutions sending out fresh
   begging appeals--there is some new claim upon their funds. The
   Lancashire distress has turned aside very much contributions from this
   object and that society. Of course it is so--these societies usually
   lean on man and rest upon an arm of flesh. But our Bristol Brother, by
   prayer and faith makes known his wants unto God and when does he lack
   any good thing? When needs he issue a begging appeal? Verily, I do
   believe that if all England were in famine, the orphan house at Bristol
   would have sufficient supplies. Whatever may happen, the Lord has
   promised to hear prayer, and He will honor faith--the cedars of Lebanon
   shall be full if all the trees of the plain be famished.

   I would to God we could exhibit still more and more of the same
   principle of faith in the conduct of our college. And in that case,
   too, I am persuaded that whatever may occur and whatever may happen, as
   that is God's work, it never can lack. My confidence in that matter is
   in my God. I am glad that so many of the Lord's people are made the
   instruments to supply the wants of the college, but still I look far
   higher. Sometimes when friends say, "Mention it to the people," I do
   not like to do it, lest I should lean too much on you. God's own work
   shall be carried on by God's own means. And I am sure He will send what
   it requires and in a way which shall be for the glory of His name. They
   are happy--I am a witness that they are--Brothers and Sisters, they are
   well supplied, who, like the cedars, exhibit Divine cultivation and
   independence of man.

   2. Again, note concerning these cedars that they are not only well
   supplied, but they are always green. Other trees refreshed with rivers,
   if they have the whole Nile at their roots, must drop their leaves once
   every year at the command of winter--and then they stretch out their
   bare limbs, as if they prayed for the return of spring. The oaks of
   Bashan languish, the fig tree casts her leaves, the ash and the elm are
   ashamed, but you, O cedar, you live in perpetual spring! The green
   lawns of your horizontal branches fail not even in the year of drought.

   The birds always sing in her branches, and the storks make their nests
   in due season among her boughs. Dear Brothers and Sisters, it is so
   with the man who lives upon Christ alone. He has not the changes of
   other men. He has his trials, but he sings through them. The reason why
   many of us sink so low in spirit and hang our harps on the willows, is
   only this--want of faith. But if--

   "Our faith is in the Lord alone, Our rock and refuge is His Throne," so
   that we can say with Habakkuk, "Though the fig tree shall not blossom,"
   and so on, "yet will I rejoice in the Lord." Let our faith be vigorous
   and unstaggering, let us be planted up there where God has put us--on
   the rocky side of Lebanon--in the midst of all kinds of difficulties
   and dangers, yet our leaf shall be always green and we shall not know
   when drought comes.

   3. Observe the grandeur and size of these trees. I have found upon
   reference to Mr. Thompson's work, "The Laud and the Book," that several
   of the trees measure forty-one feet in girth, so that they are real
   giants of the forest. Think of it and admire--never watered by man,
   never cared for by him--depending upon God and upon God alone--and yet
   they have grown to the height of one hundred feet and forty feet in
   girth! Ah, and what magnificent Christians those are who come to rest
   upon God alone. You think, perhaps, that they, having so little supply
   from second causes, would be feeble!

   But, dear Brothers and Sisters, it is often that supply from beneath
   which makes us feeble. I believe it is our riches which make us poor
   and our strength which makes us weak, for when I am weak then am I
   strong. When I am brought down to feel that all the creatures put
   together could not help me the turn of a penny, when I know that all my
   power and wisdom and strength is not worth so much as a rusty nail, if
   I put it altogether and strain it to the utmost, O then it is so
   blessed to get a grip of God--to strike one's root down to the heart of
   the Rock of Ages and to rest alone on Him!

   The best Christians, the most splendid specimens of Divine husbandry
   are those who are most delivered from confidence in the creature. You
   shall read all biographies and you shall find in proportion as men
   become little in self, and little in creature love and creature trust,
   they become great and mighty in their doings for the Lord.

   4. Note next, the fragrance of these venerable trees. Hosea speaks of
   the smell of Lebanon and we know that cedar wood was among the aromatic
   substances burned upon the altar of the sanctuary. Travelers tell us
   that when they stand under the cedars of Lebanon the smell is most
   delightful, the fragrant cedar wood perfumes all the air. Now few of
   men's trees do that. Some of them do. The citron and the orange and
   lemon load the air with sweets, but many others, cultivate them as we
   may, and nurture with the greatest care, never can or will perfume the
   air. How sweetly do God's trees sweeten all about them!

   If your piety comes from God and if you wait in spirit upon God and
   lean only upon Him, there will be about you such a sweet fragrance that
   you shall be acceptable unto God in Christ Jesus and acceptable to your
   Brothers and Sisters, and even an ungodly world shall perceive that
   there is in you the smell of a field that the Lord has blessed. No man
   will yield so delightful a perfume as the man who is much with Christ.
   The scented piece of clay declared that it owed its per- fume to
   sleeping with a rose--and if we have learned to rest upon the bosom of
   the Savior, if we have taught our soul to say, "My soul, wait only upon
   God, for my expectation is from Him"--our companionship and confidence
   in God will yield a sweet fragrance both to our words, to our actions,
   and to everything to which we set our hands.

   5. Attentively think upon the perpetuity of these cedars. Do you
   remember how carnal men said, concerning certain works of faith which
   we ourselves attempted, "Ah, well, it may be all very well, it will
   last for a time, it is a sort of spurt of enthusiasm. It will last for
   a time and then die out like the wick of a candle." Societies that are
   blessed with patrons, vice-presidents, secretaries, directors,
   subscribers and that use flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer and
   all kinds of music--those will get on. There is something to look at
   there. There is something tangible.

   But a scheme which lives only upon God! The business man says, "I do
   not see it. I look at the pounds, shillings and pence. I have not
   learned to look at things unseen, I cannot confide in these visionary
   ideas." Now, every year somebody has said, "Muller, of Bristol, will
   come to nothing, Mr. So-and-So has died, that old gentleman who used to
   give him two thousand pounds and three thousand pounds a year. Now he
   is dead, now it will come to an end and cannot keep on." After his
   death somebody else was going to die, and that somebody died, but the
   orphans were still fed and housed. Even at this moment, the men of
   sight are prophesying evil against that marvel of faith in the same way
   they might tremble for the cedars and talk thus.

   Now, here are these cedars of God upon the top of Lebanon, with nobody
   to take care of them, they will surely be destroyed. What? No society
   pledged to guarantee their preservation! Why, there will not be one of
   them left in three weeks. They will be cut down for the sake of their
   timber, or carried off piecemeal by tourists. Ah, but my dear Brothers
   and Sisters, there are some of those cedars that can be reckoned to be
   at the very least three thousand five hundred years old and some of
   them are doubtless older. And we cannot, of course, except by cutting
   them down, discover their precise age by counting the rings.

   But there they stand and have stood all those hundreds and thousands of
   years with no ranger of the forest to look after them--just God Himself
   to be the Farmer and Keeper of them all! Depend upon it, Christian, if
   you rest upon God, your simple faith is a principle which you may use,
   not only for ten or twenty years, but all your threescore years and
   ten! It serves you in your youth to be your joy--it shall serve you in
   your old age to be your staff. If you could outlive Methuselah, yet
   still you should find that God would keep the cedars full and preserve
   you among them safely even to the end.

   6. I conclude this head by noticing that these cedars are very
   venerable. A traveler declares that often as he has stayed beneath
   their shadow, he has never done so without feeling a solemn awe. Mr.
   Thompson has slept under their shade on one or two occasions, and as he
   has looked up and seen the stars and sometimes climbed up the cedars
   and marked how they spread out all their branches horizontally, making
   a series of green lawns one above another, he says he has never gazed
   upon them without feeling there was something holy in the spot.

   The mountain tribes treat them with superstitious reverence, calling
   them saints and giving to each a name. They command, for their
   antiquity and glory, the veneration of man. Scarcely could even the
   brute pass them, one would think, without looking up with something of
   respect. It is most evidently so with the Christian who lives wholly
   upon God. Your common sort of Christians who have very little faith and
   live by feelings--your ordinary sort of Christians who live half by
   faith and half by works--mere professors who have never entered into
   the secret place of the tabernacle of the Most High and think all I am
   talking about to be mere mysticism.

   These, I say, who do not understand the word "faith" to be so broad
   that it encompasses the whole of human life, so deep that it penetrates
   to the depths of the heart and yet so high that hope cannot desire
   anything greater than faith can give--these who have not learned faith
   fully, have no respect from among men--but those who can act upon the
   supernatural principle of depending upon God, sooner or later will get
   the respect even of the most careless. The day is coming when these
   cedars of God shall be honored in the eyes of the most ungodly--in that
   great day when the wicked shall rise to shame and everlasting contempt,
   then these cedars of God shall have their time of honor and the whole
   world shall know them to be plants of the Lord's right-hand planting.

   I leave this point. I would, dear Friends, that you and I knew more and
   more what it was to live upon the Lord alone. I believe it is the
   safest way of life and I am certain it is the happiest. Let the cedar's
   lot be my lot, let me have my God to be my sole stay and my support and
   I shall be rich to all the intents of bliss.

   III. Now for the third and last point. Taking the text as it stands and
   reading it, "The trees of the Lord are full of sap," which, although it
   is not in the original, is not, after all, a violence to it. It is not
   a literal translation, but still it is a free translation that does not
   violate the sense of the Hebrew. Taking our version, I get my third
   particular, FULLNESS OF LIVING PRINCIPLE.

   1. "The trees of the Lord are full of sap," of which, I shall notice
   first, that this is vitally necessary. Without sap, the cedar is no
   tree, it becomes a dead post and nothing more. Sap is needful to make
   it flourish and exist. Without the life of God in the heart, a man is
   no Christian. He may attend His Church twice every Sunday, or he may go
   to Chapel. He may read his Bible regularly and have family prayers in
   his house. He may subscribe his guineas to all sorts of societies. He
   may be very kind to the poor. He may be one whose outward life and
   conversation are quite beyond rebuke and yet, unless he has been born
   again and has been made a partaker of the mysterious Spirit of the
   living God, he is not one of the Lord's trees.

   Vitality is essential to a Christian. We call not dead ones, sons, and
   if you have not been quickened, you cannot be children of God. It is
   not likely that Christ is married to a dead corpse. And if you have not
   been quickened by Divine Grace, you are not His bride, nor even a
   member of His family. The body always ejects dead substances. With
   great pain and difficulty, a decayed bone is pushed out from the flesh,
   through an ulcer, perhaps--but out it must come. Even so, there are no
   dead members of Christ's body. Painfully would the body strive to eject
   such a member. There must be life-- a vital principle infused into us
   by God the Holy Spirit. The trees of the Lord are, without exception,
   full of sap.

   2. Next, essentially mysterious. I do not understand the sap--I suppose
   the botanist may. The sap is the blood of the tree and in the tree
   there is a circulation very much like the circulation of the blood
   through our veins and heart. But who understands the circulation of the
   blood--it is a great mystery--by what force it rises and by what power
   it descends again? Who shall tell how that river of life is guided? It
   is a Divine mystery. So is it with the Life within us--it is a greater
   mystery still. You may discover the sea and understand it, but never
   the Life of God in a Christian.

   This is God Himself in a Christian, God infused into the Christian's
   soul as a Divine principle. How shall I set this forth? Regeneration is
   the Holy Spirit coming into a man and becoming that man's Life. And the
   Life in a Believer afterward feeds upon the flesh and blood of
   Christ--like sustaining like--Divine Life being sustained by Divine
   food. Do you know anything about this mystery? "The wind blows where it
   lists and you hear the sound thereof, but cannot tell where it comes
   and where it goes: so is everyone that is born of the Spirit." Everyone
   who is a tree of the Lord must be full of this essential mystery--"The
   trees of the Lord are full of sap."

   3. Thirdly, it is radically secret. Note that. Who knows how the roots
   get their sap? They go searching through the soil with their little
   roots, looking after that food which is exactly suitable to the
   constitution of the tree. But how they transmute the mineral into the
   vegetable, how they suck out the various gasses, or draw out the
   particles they need, who can tell? Now our root is Christ, our life is
   hid in Him. This is the secret of the Lord. The root of the Christian
   is as secret as the life itself. Who can comprehend the mystery of the
   life within the Believer? The root of that life, that vital union with
   Christ, that reception of Divine Grace--of his very soul out of the
   wounds of the Savior--who shall explain this? Only this we must say,
   however Divine Grace flows there from Jesus, it must be there and it
   must come from Christ--for all the trees of the Lord are full of sap.

   4. Then, again, it is permanently active. In the Christian the Divine
   Life is always active--not in fruit-bearing, but in some operation
   within. The sap in the cedar never lies still. The sap in common trees
   is still in the winter, and if you cut a tree in the early spring, as I
   unfortunately did, then the sap comes streaming down in great white
   streams from the wound you have made, because the sap has begun to
   flow. The tree should be cut at some other period of the year--but the
   cedar always has its sap active. Perforate it when you may, a gum
   begins to exude at all times. So is it with the Christian.

   His Divine Graces, are not all of them in activity, but the Life is
   always in activity. My hand is not always moving, but my blood is. I am
   not always working for God, but my heart is always living upon God. The
   essential Life of the Christian never dies--never ceases from being in
   active operation. There is a seed in him which cannot sin, because it
   is born of God, but which must still go towards holiness, because it
   comes from God. I do not understand this permanent activity, but still,
   I know it is in everyone of you, if you are Christians, for "the trees
   of the Lord are full of sap."

   5. I shall almost have finished when I notice, in the next place, that
   it is externally operative. A traveler tells us that in the wood, the
   bark, and even the cones of the cedar there is an abundance of resin.
   They are saturated with it so that he says he can scarcely touch one of
   the cedars of Lebanon without having the turpentine or resin of them
   upon his hands. That is always the way with a truly healthy
   Christian--his Divine Grace is externally manifested. There is the
   inner Life within, it is active, and by-and-by, when it is in a right
   state, it saturates everything. You talk with the gracious man, he
   cannot help talking about Christ. You go into his house, you will soon
   see that a Christian lives there.

   You notice his actions and you will see he has been with Jesus. He is
   so full of sap that the sap must come out. He has so much of the Divine
   Life within, that the holy oil and Divine balsam must flow from him. I
   am afraid this cannot be said of all of us. It is because we get to be
   dependent upon man and not on God, and therefore have little of this
   sap. But if we are independent of man and live wholly upon God, we
   shall be so full of sap that every part of us will betray our piety.

   6. And then let me say lastly, that this sap is abundantly to be
   desired. Oh, when I think what glory a full grown Christian brings to
   God, what honor the faith of a Believer puts upon Jesus! When I think
   what a knowledge of God and Divine things an advanced Believer
   possesses, when I contemplate his joy and peace of mind--I could wish
   that everyone of you, (though it is well to be hyssops on God's
   wall)--could be cedars upon God's Lebanon! Oh that we would grow in
   Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!

   There is something of the sap in us, let us pray for more. We live upon
   Christ. If our hearts do not awfully deceive us, you and I can say--

   "On Christ the solid Rock I stand, All other ground is sinking sand."

   The Lord knows our hearts and He Himself knows that we can say as Peter
   did, "Lord, You know all things: You know that I love You." But oh, is
   there one among you that is content with himself? I am not--I am
   ashamed of myself-- forgetting the things that are behind, I would
   press forward to that which is before. Not as though I had already
   obtained, either were already perfect. Ah, Brothers and Sisters, there
   is such a height of glorious independence of man and a confident
   dependence upon God! And there is such a blessed internal joy and
   peace, such a Divine fullness of sap which we may yet have that I pray
   none of you rest till you obtain it to the praise and the glory of His
   Grace, who has made you accepted in the Beloved.

   Sinner, that which I have been holding up as the strength and beauty of
   a Christian, must be Life to you. Come, every man, and trust in the
   Lord, for if you trust in Him, you shall never be confounded. The Lord
   add now a blessing upon you, for Christ's sake. Amen.

                              The Chief Of Sinners

   A SERMON DELIVERED BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN
   TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Sinners; of whom I am chief." 1 Timothy 1:15.

   WHO among all the Scriptural writers can compare with Paul in the
   fullness of his testimony to the Grace of God? Upon the Doctrines of
   Grace, upon the experience of Divine Grace, upon everything that has to
   do with the exceeding abundant Grace of God through our Lord Jesus
   Christ, Paul is the mighty master and the great teacher. If it were
   right to look at him from an exclusively human point of view and speak
   of his genius rather than his inspiration, I might say of him that so
   mighty, so clear, so eloquent a teacher of the Truth of God has never
   existed since the days of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   Though Augustine was a particularly bright star and Calvin in after
   generations rivaled, if he did not even excel Augustine, Paul far
   excels both in the brilliance with which he exhibits every quality of
   Grace and Grace in everything that has a good quality. Or, to use
   another figure, Paul towers aloft above them all in the great mountain
   range, lofty though full many of their summits are. One reason for his
   clearness about Divine Grace was that he was himself a very pattern and
   model of its power. In him God had expressly, as much as in any other
   man, and perhaps more, shown forth the super-abundant power of His love
   in passing by transgression, iniquity and sin--and in making the very
   man who had been a ringleader of mischief, to become the leader of the
   hosts of the Lord.

   Paul calls himself in our text the chief of sinners. It is possible
   that he literally exceeded every other sinner, dared more and sunk
   deeper in crime than any of his fellows among the sons of men. If so,
   let no man that lives despair of mercy. If the gate of Heaven is wide
   enough for the chief of sinners to go through, then there must in that
   respect be room enough for those who must be less than the chief, who,
   though very great, yet cannot be quite so great as he. I say, though I
   hardly think so, that it is just possible that, taking certain
   circumstances into consideration, Paul really was in such sense the
   very chief of sinners. And yet I hardly think so, because he himself,
   in another place, calls himself less than the least of all saints,
   which was the modest apprehension of one who in another place affirmed
   that he was not a whit behind the very chief of the Apostles.

   Might it not, then, rather have been that his deep view of his own
   sinfulness and his clear sense of his guilt made him consider himself
   to be the chief of sinners, though, probably, there have been tens of
   thousands even greater than he? Tonight my business is to find out the
   chiefs of sinners and endeavor to describe them. And then, to enquire
   how it is that so often the very chiefs of sinners are saved.

   I. First, dear Friends, as Saul hunted out Believers, I have, tonight,
   TO TRY AND HUNT OUT THE CHIEFS OF SINNERS. Now who are they? They come
   under various characters and may be classified in different lists. We
   will begin with those who directly oppose themselves to God and to His
   Christ. These are chiefs among sinners. Paul did join their ranks. He
   set himself determinately against the name of Christ and thought with
   himself that he ought to do very much against that name.

   Now those who directly attack the Person of God come, first, under the
   head of blasphemers. Paul says he was such. He had, no doubt, used
   expressions quite as strong as those sometimes used by unbelieving Jews
   when they are much irritated by Christians. He had said some foul
   things about the Impostor crucified upon Mount Calvary--things,
   perhaps, more vile than he ever cared to remember--much less to repeat.
   He had been exceedingly mad, and when men are mad they say exceedingly
   mad things. He had been a blasphemer, and a blasphemer challenges the
   vengeance of the Almighty with no common effrontery.

   Have I one here whose mouth is foul with oaths? Has there strayed into
   this House of Prayer tonight one who has cursed God and dared in his
   angry moments to lift his puny hand of rebellion and curse the Most
   High God? Have I the misfortune--no, I will not call it so--have I the
   hopeful privilege of talking to one who has spoken against Jesus of
   Nazareth and who is determined to quench His religion, or to oppose it
   to the utmost of his power? Is it so?

   Then indeed, Friend, you are one of the chief of sinners, and I am glad
   that you are here, that I may tell you that there is mercy even for
   such as you are. For "all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven
   unto men." No matter how often or how foully you have cursed the Most
   High and damned yourself, He will not damn you if you will turn from
   the error of your ways and seek mercy through the blood of Him whom you
   have despised.

   Others come under the same class. For instance, we must here put the
   infidel, for although his words may not take the form of blasphemy, yet
   the very thought that there is no God is blasphemy. And he that dares
   to vent that thought is not only a fool, but one of the chief of
   sinners. And so you have tried to stultify your conscience and to
   silence its monitions by pretending to believe that there is no God!
   You have tried to rake up the stale arguments of Tom Paine and of
   Voltaire and you have chuckled when one who called himself a bishop of
   God's heritage dared to vent some strong things against the Book of His
   Divine inspiration.

   You know in your heart that there is a God! Your conscience tells you
   that He is a just God. You expect to be punished for your sins. That
   start the other night when you were alone, that cold shiver when
   someone spoke of death--all these prove that your infidelity is not so
   stout and brave a thing as you have dreamed it was. A poor, craven,
   cowardly thing it is, that turns pale at a sickbed and flies, with
   coward paleness on its cheek, when once it thinks of judgment to come.

   Oh, if you are here, you Atheist, you Deist, you disbeliever in Christ
   Jesus, you are one of the chief of sinners and I am glad you are
   here!--That I may tell you that a God of Love waits to embrace you and
   that He still declares this to be true--that He is able to save to the
   uttermost all them that come unto God by Him! Fling down your weapons,
   Man! You cannot fight the Most High! End this unequal quarrel. Have
   neither truce nor parley, but consider how you may be at peace with
   Him. The hand of His love is stretched out to accept the hand of your
   submission. Oh, be you reconciled to God through the death of His Son!

   And here I ought to include those who hold views derogatory of the
   Deity and the Person of Christ. Faithfulness to you, my Hearers,
   compels me to put down the Socinian. I will not call him Unitarian, for
   we all hold the unity of the Godhead. Trinitarians, but Unitarians are
   we still. Far otherwise the Socinian and the Arian--I put them down
   here--the men who say that Christ is not God, that the Redeemer of the
   world was but the son of Mary, that He who walked the waters of the
   deep, chained the winds, cast out evil spirits and made even Hades
   startle with His voice when the soul of Lazarus came back--that He was
   but a Prophet, a creature, a mere man!

   Surely, Sir, you are one of the chief of sinners to have talked thus of
   Him who is "very God of very God," the express image of His Father's
   Person! But even to you is Jesus gracious, and He bids you still
   believe in Him. You shall bow the knee to Him one day and worship Him,
   for, "at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow and every tongue
   confess that He is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." Bow your
   knee, NOW, and kiss the Son lest He be angry and you perish from the
   way when His wrath is kindled but a little. He bids you come to Him,
   then will He blot out your sins like a cloud and like a thick cloud
   your iniquities. The chiefs of sinners, we are sure, are found among
   those who directly attack the Person of Jehovah's Christ, yet even to
   these is the Gospel of salvation sent.

   Another group of princes and peers in the realm of evil may be
   described as those who attack Christ's people and who seek to pervert
   them from the right way. This sin pressed heavily upon the conscience
   of Paul. He had not only put them in prison, which was bad enough, but
   he had taken the saints into the synagogue and probably they had been
   beaten before the assembly and compelled to blaspheme. You, perhaps,
   know what that means--compel them to blaspheme. The Roman way of doing
   it was to say, "Curse Christ." Often did the Roman Emperor command the
   martyrs to curse Christ.

   And you remember Polycarp's answer?--"How can I curse Him? Sixty years
   have I known Him. He never did me a displeasure and I cannot and I will
   not curse Him." Then the whip was applied, or the hand was held over
   burning coals, or the flesh was pinched with hot irons. And then the
   question was put again--"Will you curse Christ now?" Paul says that he,
   though probably using milder means, compelled the professors of
   Christ's faith to blaspheme. And there may be some such here--the
   husband who persecutes his wife for Christ's sake. The father who
   charges his child, upon his obedience, never to go to the sanctuary of
   the Lord again.

   The master who plagues his servant, mocks and jeers and can never be
   content except when he is saying hard things against him. Have I not
   many here who still practice the device of cruel mocking? You abhor
   Christ and His people. You fight against God in His little ones.
   Beware! Beware! For this is a high sin! Nothing puts a man on his
   mettle like meddling with his children, "Touch me, if you will," the
   father says, "if you are a man, smite me if you dare." But touch his
   children, and the blood is in his cheeks and the mettle is up and there
   is no knowing what a man will do when he sees the offspring of his own
   heart ill-treated.

   So God will avenge His own elect that cry day and night unto Him,
   though He bears long with them. To you who thus rank with the chiefs of
   sinners, I say that Paul the persecutor "obtained mercy," and so may
   you! "This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that
   Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom" persecutors
   rank among the chief.

   There is another group whom you will all allow to be of the chiefs of
   sinners--those who have sinned foully in the world's esteem--violating
   the instincts of nature and outraging the common sense of morality and
   decency. It scarcely needs that I should mention the harlot that
   infests the streets and pollutes society. Or that worse wretch, the
   whoremonger, who first leads her astray. I speak plain words, such as I
   find in Scripture. Such God shall judge when He comes at the last day,
   for this temptation is a deep ditch and the abhorred of the Lord shall
   fall into it. This crying sin of our land needs to be sternly rebuked.
   Other sins are without the body, but this pollutes both body and soul
   and often sends down to generations yet unborn a horrid curse--at the
   very thought of which the soul is sick!

   Of all sins, young man, young woman, take care that you stand aloof
   from this! Pass not by the house of the strange woman if you love your
   life, for her gates lead down to death, even to the chambers of the
   damned! Yet, glory be to Divine Grace! There is mercy, mercy for
   such--and multitudes of these chiefs of sinners have become as the very
   brightest stars in Heaven--snatched by the strong arm of Jesus from the
   miry clay and out of that horrible pit. They are now clothed and in
   their right mind, they have gone to sit at the feet of Jesus, to sing
   of redeeming love.

   There was that Mary, that Mary whom Jesus had forgiven. Well might she
   love much! And many a loving spirit do I know, and there are some very
   dear to God's Church here, who love their Lord, and often shame some of
   us who stand more prominent than they who once drank deep of that
   bitter cup and once went to the very depths of that sin. Publish it in
   your streets! Tell it wherever you meet with the most loathsome and
   most defiled! Jesus is able to save to the uttermost! He was the friend
   of publicans and sinners. "This man receives sinners," is Jesus
   Christ's motto. Other men reject the sinner. They turn aside from
   her--woe unto her if she come between the wind and their nobility. But
   "this Man receives sinners"--receives them to His heart and to His
   bosom--to His Kingdom and to His Throne. You chiefs of sinners, rejoice
   that if you believe in Jesus there is mercy for you!

   And surely I may find another class of the chiefs of sinners among
   those who have become not only adepts themselves, but the tutors to
   others in the school of evil. Satan has a university and there are many
   who have fairly won their diplomas as first-class professors there.
   They have learned to sin with a high hand and with an outstretched
   arm--until they not only sin themselves--but delight in the sins of
   others. Have we not seen the old drunkard and how he gloats when he
   sees another man won to the army of the bestial! Have you not seen the
   eyes of some base old demon in a country village twinkle when he sees
   that fair-haired boy for the first time pander to the infamous customs
   in which he has long reveled?

   Have we not known some of those foul-mouthed masters of all baseness
   whose very talk is enough to make a whole parish sick with the
   pestilence of vice--men that you had better go over hedge and ditch
   seventy miles than meet! There are such. You have seen them, I dare
   say. And, mark you, when that being is a woman, if anything, it is then
   worse! The softer sex, usually by far more apt to teach, instills the
   secret vice of evil and wraps it up in insidious enchantments, by
   reason of which many a strong man has fallen when Delilah has been his
   charmed tutor in sin! I may not, oh, I hope I may not have one such
   being within earshot now.

   Yet , it is possible, amidst the thousands that this house now
   contains, but what there must be some of you who roll sin under your
   tongue as a sweet morsel and talk of it with a gusto till you tickle
   the fancies of others--and lead them into defilements which otherwise
   they never might have touched. You artfully conceal the book while
   putting the bait in the young man's way and thrusting the knowledge of
   new vices upon those who should have shunned them! Oh, you are the
   chief of sinners with a vengeance, and you shall be hung up like Haman
   upon the lofty gallows forever if you repent not!

   Yet, O Sovereign Grace! How can I tell Your heights? O sea of Love, how
   can I ever fathom Your depths! There is even mercy proclaimed for such.
   Turn, turn, why will you die, O house of Israel? Why will you perish?--

   "While the lamp holds out to burn The vilest sinner may return."

   I find no exception in the offer of mercy. All are included in the
   invitation of welcome, "Whosoever will, let him come and take of the
   water of life freely." "Though your sins are as scarlet they shall be
   as wool, though they are red like crimson they shall be whiter than
   snow." Here is a full, a free, a perfect and a complete pardon for all
   your past offenses.

   Though I have not yet finished the list, I would rather change the note
   for a minute. I have another class of the chiefs of sinners to find
   out. I, myself, belong to them, and I therefore speak with feeling. In
   this section we include those who have had much light and yet have
   sinned against it. They who have been taught better, who have had a
   knowledge of the way of the Truth of God and yet have turned aside to
   crooked paths. To have been nursed upon the lap of piety and dandled
   upon the knee of Christian affection is no small privilege. To be
   lighted to one's cradle by the lamps of the sanctuary, and to be hushed
   to sleep with a lullaby in which the name of Jesus comes as a sweet
   refrain--this involves an awful responsibility.

   No man can go to Hell over a mother's tears without accumulated
   vengeance. No son can rebel against a father's affectionate and tearful
   admonitions without perishing ten times more frightfully than as if he
   had never been thus privileged. Ah, my Hearers, alas, alas, for the
   hardness of your hearts--there are many such here now. I would
   charitably suppose that very few of you belong to the other classes I
   have been speaking of, but the great mass of you who are unconverted
   belong to this class. Do you remember young Man, how your mother put
   her arms around your neck and wooed you to turn to Christ?

   Do you remember that little Bible when you first went to school and
   that verse she inscribed as a motto--she watered it with her tears as
   she wrote it. Do you recollect those letters she addressed to you? She
   is now in Heaven, is she? Then let them be the more sacred to your
   recollection. And do you remember that Sunday school teacher? Was he
   not a father to you? Was not that excellent woman who used to entreat
   you to turn from the error of your ways a very mother to you in Israel?
   Do you not remember, young Woman, some of you, the earnest exhortations
   that my beloved Sister, Mrs. Bartlett, has addressed to you?

   If ever there was a woman that could, under God, move the heart and
   soul, she is that woman. And yet, there are some of you that listen to
   her voice and yet you are unconverted! You have the light shining upon
   your eyes and yet they are sightless still! You live in the land of
   mercy, where its bell summons you to come to its assembly of Divine
   Grace, but you will still not come! You have the light, but you shut
   your eyes against it! Remember, young Man, young Woman, when you sin
   you sin with seven-fold atrocity, because you know better! No--seventy
   sins are rolled into one in your sin of daring deliberate willfulness.

   Within that egg of sin there sleeps the seed of your greater damnation
   because you know the right and yet you choose the evil. Have I not now
   the privilege of speaking to some whose old familiar associations are
   awakened up by these feeble glances at your life story? Do you not feel
   just now as if you were kneeling down again in that little room and
   heard the native accents of your mother's prayer, while your lips
   hardly refrain from repeating afresh the words of your own prayer which
   she taught your lips to frame before she put you to your rest? Do you
   not remember it? And do you not remember sometimes when your conscience
   was awakened and your heart was almost broken, and your soul said, "I
   could almost be a Christian," but you excused yourself with a frivolous
   delay--"Go your way for this time. When I have a more convenient season
   I will send for you"?

   But, alas, that convenient season has never yet come. And your
   conscience grows seared. Drugged with the opiates of sin, you grow less
   and less tender of the affectionate appeal. Woe will be the day of your
   visitation, for it shall be cloudy indeed, unless you turn at the voice
   of reproof. But even to you, O chief of sinners, is the word of this
   salvation sent.

   There are those, too, who sit under an earnest ministry and yet go on
   in sin--they surely belong to the class of chief sinners. O, my
   Hearers, how I would to God that I could be as earnest with you as I
   want to be! The Lord knows there are times when I am not in the pulpit,
   when I feel that I could weep you to a Savior. But sometimes when
   standing here, the influence of this mighty throng seems rather to
   distract me than to bring my whole soul into play. And yet, the Lord
   knows how earnestly I long for you in the heart of the Lord Jesus
   Christ. I have not shunned to declare unto you the whole counsel of God
   as far as I have known it. I know I have failed in knowledge, but never
   in honesty.

   Yet I know there are some of you who come here and yet you live in sin.
   The world says, "So-and-So goes to Spurgeon's Tabernacle," and they
   expect you to be better for going there. And yet they say, "Ah, how
   they drink!" or, "Hear how they will swear!" Where are you? You used to
   have your shop open on the Sunday morning, but it is shut now. I am
   glad you have got as far as that. Still, let me tell you, you only
   compound your sin and make a covenant with Hell, if you outwardly pay
   respect to the Sabbath and secretly indulge in other profanities.
   Drunkenness may destroy you without Sabbath-breaking. It is not giving
   up one sin, it is giving up the whole.

   It is not the barter of one sin for another to quiet your conscience,
   which will satisfy justice or rescue you from destruction. Man, there
   must be a divorce between you and your sins! Not a mere separation for
   a season, but a clear divorce. Cut off the right arm! Pluck out the
   right eye and cast them from you, or else you cannot enter into eternal
   life. Are there not some of you who have for years listened to my
   ministry and yet you are none the better? And some of you are rather
   the worse, I fear. You are getting Gospel-hardened by it all.

   Well, by God's Grace, there is mercy for you, too! You are the chief of
   sinners, but the red flag is not run up yet-- the white flag still
   floats mast-high--the flag of invitation--the flag of love--the flag of
   mercy. Come to it! Come to Jesus now. You may never have another
   invitation. Soon may this tongue be cold in death, or your ears may be
   deaf forever, like clay-cold marble. Turn you, at this rebuke, for if
   after being often reproved, you harden your necks, you shall suddenly
   be destroyed and that without remedy. To you, even to the chief of
   sinners, is the word of this salvation sent!

   Drawing the bow at a venture, there is another class I would single
   out--those who are gifted from their childhood with a tender
   conscience. There are men who seem to be born without a conscience. So
   hard and dull of impression are they that if they have any faculty of
   distinguishing between good and evil, it is as though they had eyes and
   saw not, and ears but they hear not. And does it ever speak, the voice
   is so weak, you can never hear it. But there are those, on the other
   hand, who have naturally a quick understanding, a delicate
   sensitiveness, a ready perception of right and wrong, a strong and
   vigorous conscience. They never do sin without being aware of what they
   are doing and they are troubled and pestered, as they say, about it.

   They cannot sleep at night after they have been committing any serious
   breach of propriety. Even when they are walking the streets, or when
   they are busy, they are quickly startled at the recoil of their own
   transgressions. Oftentimes there is a certain uneasiness and
   fretfulness which comes over them because they are conscious that they
   are not pursuing the right course. Now, if you are gifted with this
   tender conscience and yet you constantly violate it and directly act in
   the face of your own convictions, you are the chief of sinners. But
   still, still Paul, the chief of sinners, found mercy--and so may you!

   And again--if you have had warning in sickness and especially if on
   your sick bed you have vowed unto the Lord that you would turn to Him,
   then you are covenant-breakers, you that violate vows made to the Most
   High--you must also be put among the first and foremost of
   transgressors. When the cholera was here some nine years ago, you vowed
   that if God would spare you, things should be different. He did spare
   you, but things are no better now than they were before. When the fever
   prostrated you, what promises you made and where are they now? You have
   lied unto the Eternal God! Is it little for you that you should have
   promised and not have paid--have vowed unto Him and not performed? Now,
   Sinner, you are a liar, as well as anything besides. You are a rogue, a
   dishonest one against God, with Whom the compact was made. But the
   invitation is still freely tendered unto you--come unto the Lord Jesus
   Christ and believe in Him--and you shall be made whole.

   The chiefs of sinners comprises so numerous a body. I believe everyone
   of us must be included in the list in some shape or other. I know
   this--if ever you and I are saved--if God shall give us very great
   mercy, we shall feel that we were the greatest sinners. When Paul saw
   how kindly his Master treated him, it seemed to break his heart--"What?
   Did I ever curse that Christ who has blessed me? He that is so rich in
   loving kindness, did I ever spurn Him?" Verily, now, I think I have had
   the blackest sight of sin when I have had the brightest sight of mercy.
   When my dear Lord and Master has privileged me, by allowing me to come
   near Him in prayer, and I have felt His love shed abroad in my
   heart--then it is that I have felt as if I could bring imprecations
   upon myself for ever having been a traitor to Him.

   What? Could I spit in Your face, my Redeemer and my Lord? Could I ever
   crown Your head with thorns, which now it shall be my life's task to
   crown with jewels? What? Did You love me so? Did You forgive me so and
   could I ever speak against You? It is great mercy that sets forth our
   great sin, for we only come to reckon ourselves the chief of sinners
   when we see the great love of God. So then, without amplifying any
   longer, I will put the invitation thus--whoever among you have sinned
   against the Most High, you are all on a level, and the invitation of
   mercy is put to you, each and all, and this is the Gospel--"He that
   believes and is baptized shall be saved, he that believes not shall be
   damned." May you be led to believe and to profess your faith according
   to God's way.

   II. Well, now, but a few minutes remain to me and I will endeavor to be
   brief while I try to answer the question, WHY ARE THESE WHO ARE
   PROVERBIALLY THE CHIEF OF SINNERS ARE VERY FREQUENTLY SAVED?

   One reason is to illustrate Divine Sovereignty. There is no jewel of
   His crown of which God is more jealous than His Sovereignty. "I will
   have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on
   whom I will have compassion." Now, when He saves the harlot, when He
   calls the persecutor by Sovereign Grace, then all men see that this is
   the finger of God and that He dispenses His love and kindness according
   to the purposes of His own absolute and uncontrollable will. He chooses
   the chief of sinners that He may show to all men that He will take the
   base things of the world and the things which are not, and things which
   are despised, to bring to nothing the things that are--that no flesh
   may glory in His Presence.

   Another reason is that He may show His great power. Oh, how Hell is
   made angry when some great champion falls! When their Goliaths are
   brought down, how the Philistines take to their heels! How Heaven rings
   with songs when some chief of sinners becomes a trophy of the Divine
   power! And how men talk, with glib tongues, of the great and mighty
   deeds of God, when the drunkard and the swearer and the prostitute are
   washed and made saints! What a noise it made at Elstow, when they said
   at the public-house on the green--"You know John Bunyan?" "Oh, yes, we
   know him! You mean the fellow that was always first at a game of
   tip-cat--he that could always drink the longest! Oh, yes, we know him."

   "Well, do you know, he was preaching over at Bedford yesterday."
   "What?" says one, "preaching at Bedford? I would as soon have thought
   of the devil preaching as John Bunyan! What a wonderful thing the
   Gospel must be, to change such a man as that!" And yet it was true!
   John Bunyan, who frequented the ale-house, who knew more about the
   county jail and more about the Celestial City that is on the other side
   the flood than most men of his times. It shows the power and the
   Sovereignty of God when such men are saved.

   And next, how it shows His Grace! When I have sometimes sat to see
   enquirers I have seen a number come in one after the other that have
   been born and brought up in the midst of piety and I have blessed God
   for them. But, by-and-by there has come in one whose tale has been
   terrible to tell and it was not easily told--except with many sighs and
   sobs and tears. But when it was disclosed, there have sat two weeping
   together--I scarcely know which wept more--he who wept because of
   Divine Grace illustrated in him or the other because he saw in another
   the Divine Grace which he had tasted for himself.

   Oh, when great sinners tell out their tales, they are so
   straightforward, so explicit! There is no muddle about it, no questions
   about when they were converted, or how, but there they are. They
   say--"Ah, Sir, it must be Divine! Such a change has been worked in me
   that nothing could have thus turned the lion to a lamb, the raven to a
   dove, but the Grace of God." In great sinners, then, the Grace of God
   is made conspicuous.

   Again--great sinners are very frequently called by God for the purpose
   of attracting others. You know that when some great transgressor finds
   mercy, straightway many hearts say--"Ah, then there is mercy for me." I
   am glad, I am very glad that there was a Manasseh, that there was
   David, that there was a Saul of Tarsus, and I am glad they are in the
   Bible. The wicked cut the stories out and they laugh at us and say,
   "These are your saints?" Ah, we can bear that, while we can say--"No,
   this is what they were by nature, but they were saved, for all that, by
   the distinguishing Grace of God, who saves men through faith and not by
   their works."

   Now, I believe that that case of David has been a solace to thousands,
   if not to millions. The hurt he did in his lifetime was certainly very
   great--but the incalculable benefit which has flown to the universal
   Church from the penitential Psalms--puts altogether into the shade the
   damage which the fall of David did to the Church in his own time. Not
   that there is less shame to the sinner, but that there is more glory to
   the Savior where sin abounded in the first instance and

   Divine Grace did much more abound in the sequel. We can well bear this
   spot, for the sake of the light which comes from the sun.

   Sinners! All of you! If you would put yourselves among the little ones,
   if your lives have never been grossly vile (I am glad if they have
   not)--let the fact that the great sinner enters and is washed, attract
   you. I have heard it said of the elephant, that sometimes before he
   crosses a bridge he puts his trunk and perhaps one foot, upon it. He
   wants to know if it is quite safe, for he is not going to trust his
   bulky body to things that were built only for horses and men. Well,
   after he has tried it, if he finds it strong enough, away he goes and
   his great carcass is carried right across the stream.

   Now, suppose you and I sat on the other side and said we were afraid
   the bridge would not bear us! Why, how absurd our unbelief would be! So
   when you see a great elephantine sinner, like the Apostle Paul, go
   lumbering over the bridge of mercy and not a timber creaks and the
   bridge does not even strain under the load--why then, methinks you may
   come rushing in a crowd and say--"It will bear us, if it will bear
   him--it will carry us across, if it can take the chief of sinners to
   Heaven!"

   And then, dear Friends, the saving of the chiefs of sinners is useful,
   because, when they are saved they generally make the most fiery zealots
   against sin. Have we not a proverb that, "The burnt child dreads the
   fire"? I noticed my host, on one preaching excursion, particularly
   anxious about my candle. Now, as everybody ought to know how careful I
   am, I was a little surprised and I put the question to him why he
   should be so wonderfully particular. "I had my house burned down once,
   Sir," said he. That explained it all. No man is so much afraid of fire
   as he, and they who have been in sin and know the mischief of it,
   protest against it the most loudly.

   They can speak experimentally. They talk of what they have tasted and
   handled to their own smart and ruin! Oh, what revenge there seems to be
   in the Apostle's heart against his sin! He seems to bring out the great
   battle-axes and weapons of war against it--and wherever he can see sin
   he smites right and left--anywhere. Persecution, death, martyrdom--all
   these are nothing to him if he can but get a blow at sin. He always
   seems to have the gun charged to the muzzle and no devil comes in his
   way but what he has a shot at him. There are no ramparts or hellish
   bulwarks but what Paul thinks he must take them, whether they are in
   Asia, or Italy, or Spain. This great knight-errant of the Cross is
   everywhere the great antagonist of sin, and so must those always be who
   are saved out of great iniquity.

   And then, again, they always make the most zealous saints. I have said
   and it will come true, though I am no prophet nor the son of a
   prophet--I have said that the Lord will deliver this city and deliver
   this age, not by ministers from col-leges--not by the sons of gentlemen
   or the inheritors of titles. But He will yet shake London and bring
   about a religious revival with the men who will come from St. Giles's
   and from White Chapel--from the slums, and from the dens and kens of
   infamy. God will take such men by-and-by, and He is beginning to work
   it already.

   There are one or two names that will come to your
   recollection--illustrious names in connection with the preaching in
   theatres--God will raise up more such and you shall see that when human
   wisdom and creature devices have done their utmost to make the Church
   of God the dull lethargic thing it now is, God, in the plenitude of His
   might will raise up some who have tasted that He is gracious and have
   drunk deeply of the cup of His love that will turn the world upside
   down. It is all an idle and a wicked tale that our places of worship in
   the City of London cannot be supported. I see them building new places
   in the suburbs and leaving the City itself destitute of the means of
   Divine Grace.

   Were the right men found, the Churches in the City of London might be
   as crowded as those in the suburbs. Only put into their pulpits men who
   know the guilt of sin and who know that Gospel in which is revealed the
   righteousness of God--men who know and preach Christ--then the effect
   would be palpable. Give us the men who do not talk as botanists might
   do upon botany, when they had not seen a flower, or as some might speak
   of various lands who have never traveled a league. But give us men who
   know experimentally those things that they labor to teach and let their
   tongues be set on fire of the Holy Spirit, and you shall then see
   London as full of the glory of the Lord as was Jerusalem of old.

   May this come to pass! May it begin to come to pass tonight! May the
   Lord find out, as He moves among this mass, some stray, strange being
   that has given himself up to desperation, to work mischief with both
   his hands--and may He say to him tonight, "I have need of you and I
   will have you." Oh, mighty Grace, do it tonight! He will have you, Man!
   Your will must be subdued. Your pride must come down. That proud temper
   of yours shall yield. "I am your Master. I made you. I bought you with
   My blood, and do you think I will lose you? I am mighty to save, do you
   think that you can overcome Me? I came forth on purpose to redeem you!
   Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?" O that the Lord would speak thus
   personally to some individual now!

   And now I have done when I have just put this before you. My Hearers,
   here is life and death. If you despise Christ, there is death for you.
   If you turn aside from the love and mercy which streams from the wounds
   of Jesus, the angry God shall find you in your sin and cut you in
   pieces and there is none that can deliver you. If you go on in your
   sin, you will soon meet with death. But a few Sundays ago we had to
   mark how sudden death thinned our ranks. Sometimes it is a working man.
   There was one, you know, some weeks ago, who lost his life in building
   the great bridge at Blackfriars, who was often a hearer here.

   There is scarcely a day passes but we hear of someone gone out of this
   great assembly. We are going one after another. The pastor may go soon,
   but perhaps before he goes he may see many of you carried to your
   graves--he cannot tell. But, oh, why will you remain without God and
   without Christ? If you had a lease of your lives you might go on in sin
   until the lease was out. But even then you would be foolish to be
   enemies to God and enemies to yourselves so long. But as you may die
   today, God help you to repent tonight.

   On the other hand, I set mercy before you--no man can say he has not
   been invited--no soul can say that I did not set the gate open wide
   enough! You are without excuse in the Day of Judgment. When the trumpet
   peals through Heaven and earth and awakes the slumbering dead--when
   Christ shall come in the clouds to judge the earth, I must give an
   account of the Gospel I have preached to you tonight. I would to God I
   could preach it better, but I cannot. You know what it is. You are
   without excuse. You have been invited. You have been entreated.

   You have been bid to come to the marriage supper. All things are ready.
   The oxen and the fatlings are killed--come to the supper. You that are
   in the highways and hedges, we would compel you to come in, that God's
   House may be filled. Come. "The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let
   him that hears say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whoever
   will, let him take the water of life freely."

   But if you come not, I must be a swift witness against you at the last.
   I am clear of your blood. I am clear of the blood of you all. God save
   you, for Christ's sake. Amen.

                              The Warrant of Faith

   A Sermon

   (No. 531)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, September 20th, 1863, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his
   Son Jesus Christ."--1 John 3:23.

   THE old law shines in terrible glory with its ten commandments. There
   are some who love that law so much, that they cannot pass over a
   Sabbath without its being read in their hearing, accompanied by the
   mournful petition, "Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
   keep this law." Nay, some are so foolish as to enter into a covenant
   for their children, that "they shall keep all God's holy commandments,
   and walk in the same all the days of their life." Thus they early wear
   a yoke which neither they nor their fathers can bear, and daily
   groaning under its awful weight, they labour after righteousness where
   it never can be found. Over the tables of the law in every Church, I
   would have conspicuously printed these gospel words, "By the deeds of
   the law shall no flesh living be justified." The true believer has
   learned to look away from the killing ordinances of the old law. He
   understands that "as many as are of the works of the law are under the
   curse, for it is written: Cursed is everyone that continueth not in all
   things which are written in the book of the law to do them." He
   therefore turns with loathing from all trust in his own obedience to
   the ten commands, and lays hold with joy upon the hope set before him
   in the one commandment contained in my text, "This is his commandment,
   that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ."

   We sing, and sing rightly too--

   "My soul, no more attempt to draw

   Thy life and comfort from the law,"

   for from the law death cometh and not life, misery and not comfort. "To
   convince and to condemn is all the law can do." O, when will all
   professors, and especially all professed ministers of Christ, learn the
   difference between the law and the gospel? Most of them make a
   mingle-mangle, and serve out deadly potions to the people, often
   containing but one ounce of gospel to a pound of law, whereas, but even
   a grain of law is enough to spoil the whole thing. It must be gospel,
   and gospel only. "If it be of grace, it is not of works, otherwise
   grace is no more grace; and if it be of works, then it is not of grace,
   otherwise work is no more work."

   The Christian then, turning his attention to the one command of the
   gospel, is very anxious to know first, what is the matter of the
   believing here intended; and secondly, what is the sinner's warrant for
   so believing in Christ; nor will he fail to consider the mandate of the
   gospel.

   I. First then, THE MATTER OF BELIEVING, or what is it that a man is to
   believe in order to eternal life. Is it the Athanasian creed? Is it
   true, that if a man does not hold that confession whole and entire, he
   shall without doubt perish everlastingly? We leave those to decide who
   are learned in matters of bigotry. Is it any particular form of
   doctrine ? Is it the Calvinistic or the Arminian scheme? For our own
   part we are quite content with our text--believing on "his Son Jesus
   Christ." That faith which saves the soul is believing on a person,
   depending upon Jesus for eternal life.

   To speak more at large of the things which are to be believed in order
   to justification by faith. they all relate to the person and the work
   of our Lord Jesus Christ. We must believe him to be God's Son--so the
   text puts it--"His Son." We must grasp with strong confidence the great
   fact that he is God: for nothing short of a divine Saviour can ever
   deliver us from the infinite wrath of God. He who rejects the true and
   proper Godhead of Jesus of Nazareth, is not saved, and cannot be, for
   he believes not on Jesus as God's Son. Furthermore, we must accept this
   Son of God as "Jesus," the Saviour. We must believe that Jesus Christ
   the Son of God, became man out of infinite love to man, that he might
   save his people from their sins, according to that worthy saying,
   "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners," even the chief. We
   must look upon Jesus as "Christ," the anointed of the Father, sent into
   this world on salvation's errand, not that sinners might save
   themselves, but that he, being mighty to save, might bring many sons
   unto glory. We must believe that Jesus Christ, Coming into the world to
   save sinners, did really effect his mission; that the precious blood
   which is shed upon Calvary is almighty to atone for sin, and therefore,
   all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men, since the
   blood of Jesus Christ, God's dear Son, cleanseth us from all sin. We
   must heartily accept the great doctrine of the atonement--regarding
   Jesus as standing in the room, place, and stead of sinful men, bearing
   for them the terror of the law's curse until justice was satisfied and
   could demand no more. Moreover, we should rejoice that as Jesus Christ,
   by his dying, put away for ever the sin of his people, so by his living
   he gave unto those who trust in him a perfect righteousness, in which,
   despite their own sins, they are "accepted in the beloved." We are also
   taught, that if we heartily trust our soul with Christ, our sins,
   through his blood, are forgiven, and his righteousness is imputed to
   us. The mere knowledge of these facts will not, however, save us,
   unless we really and truly trust our souls in the Redeemer's hands.
   Faith must act in this wise: "I believe that Jesus came to save
   sinners, and therefore, sinner though I be, I rest myself on him; I
   know that his righteousness justifies the ungodly; I, therefore, though
   ungodly, trust in him to be my righteousness; I know that his precious
   blood in heaven prevails with God on the behalf of them that come unto
   him; and since I come unto him, I know by faith that I have an interest
   in his perpetual intercession."

   Now, I have enlarged the one thought of believing on God's Son Jesus
   Christ. Brethren, I would not darken counsel by words without
   knowledge. "Believing" is most clearly explained by that simple word
   "trust." Believing is partly the intellectual operation of receiving
   divine truths, but the essence of it lies in relying upon those truths.
   I believe that, although I cannot swim, yonder friendly plank will
   support me in the flood--I grasp it, and am saved: the grasp is faith.
   I am promised by a generous friend that if I draw upon his banker, he
   will supply all my needs--I joyously confide in him, and as often as I
   am in want I go to the bank, and am enriched: my going to the bank is
   faith. Thus faith is accepting God's great promise, contained in the
   person of his Son. It is taking God at his word, and trusting in Jesus
   Christ as being my salvation, although I am utterly unworthy of his
   regard. Sinner, if thou takest Christ to be thy Saviour this day, thou
   art justified; though thou be the biggest blasphemer and persecutor out
   of hell, if thou darest to trust Christ with thy salvation, that faith
   of thine saves thee; though thy whole life may have been as black, and
   foul, and devilish as thou couldst have made it, yet if thou wilt
   honour God by believing Christ is able to forgive such a wretch as thou
   art, and wilt now trust in Jesus' precious blood, thou art saved from
   divine wrath.

   II. The WARRANT OF BELIEVING is the point upon which I shall spend my
   time and strength this morning. According to my text, the warrant for a
   man to believe is the commandment of God. This is the commandment, that
   ye "believe on his Son Jesus Christ."

   Self-righteousness will always find a lodging somewhere or other. Drive
   it, my brethren, out of the ground of our confidence; let the sinner
   see that he cannot rest on his good works, then, as foxes will have
   holes, this self-righteousness will find a refuge for itself in the
   warrant of our faith in Christ. It reasons thus: "You are not saved by
   what you do but by what Christ did; but then, you have no right to
   trust in Christ unless there is something good in you which shall
   entitle you to trust in him." Now, this legal reasoning I oppose. I
   believe such teaching to contain in it the essence of Popish
   self-righteousness. The warrant for a sinner to believe in Christ is
   not in himself in any sense or in any manner, but in the fact that he
   is commanded there and then to believe on Jesus Christ. Some preachers
   in the Puritanic times, whose shoe latchets I am not worthy to unloose,
   erred much in this matter. I refer not merely to Alleyne and Baxter,
   who are far better preachers of the law than of the gospel, but I
   include men far sounder in the faith than they, such as Rogers of
   Dedham, Shepherd, the author of "The Sound Believer," and especially
   the American, Thomas Hooker, who has written a book upon qualifications
   for coming to Christ. These excellent men had a fear of preaching the
   gospel to any except those whom they styled "sensible sinners," and
   consequently kept hundreds of their hearers sitting in darkness when
   they might have rejoiced in the light. They preached repentance and
   hatred of sin as the warrant of a sinner's trusting to Christ.
   According to them, a sinner might reason thus--"I possess such-and-such
   a degree of sensibility on account of sin, therefore I have a right to
   trust in Christ." Now, I venture to affirm that such reasoning is
   seasoned with fatal error. Whoever preaches in this fashion may preach
   much of the gospel, but the whole gospel of the free grace of God in
   its fulness he has yet to learn. In our own day certain preachers
   assure us that a man must he regenerated before we may bid him believe
   in Jesus Christ; some degree of a work of grace in the heart being, in
   their judgment, the only warrant to believe. This also is false. It
   takes away a gospel for sinners and offers us a gospel for saints. It
   is anything hut a ministry of free grace.

   Others say that the warrant for a sinner to believe in Christ is his
   election. Now, as his election cannot possibly be known by any man
   until he has believed, this is virtually preaching that nobody has any
   known warrant for believing at all. If I cannot possibly know my
   election before I believe--and yet the minister tells me that I may
   only believe upon the ground of my election--how am I ever to believe
   at all? Election brings me faith, and faith is the evidence of my
   election; but to say that my faith is to depend upon my knowledge of my
   election, which I cannot get without faith. is to talk egregious
   nonsense.

   I lay down this morning with great boldness--because I know and am well
   persuaded that what I speak is the mind of the Spirit--this doctrine
   that the sole and only warrant for a sinner to believe in Jesus is
   found in the gospel itself and in the command which accompanies that
   gospel, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." I
   shall deal with that matter first of all, negatively, and then,
   positively.

   1. First, NEGATIVELY; and here my first observation is that any other
   way of preaching the gospel-warrant is absurd. If I am to preach faith
   in Christ to a man who is regenerated, then the man, being regenerated,
   is saved already, and it is an unnecessary and ridiculous thing for me
   to preach Christ to him, and bid him to believe in order to be saved
   when he is saved already, being regenerate. But you will tell me that I
   ought to preach it only to those who repent of their sins. Very well;
   but since true repentance of sin is the work of the Spirit, any man who
   has repentance is most certainly saved, because evangelical repentance
   never can exist in an unrenewed soul. Where there is repentance there
   is faith already, for they never can be separated. So, then, I am only
   to preach faith to those who have it. Absurd, indeed! Is not this
   waiting till the man is cured and then bringing him the medicine ? This
   is preaching Christ to the righteous and not to sinners. "Nay," saith
   one, "but we mean that a man must have some good desires towards Christ
   before he has any warrant to believe in Jesus." Friend, do you not know
   what all good desires have some degree of holiness in them ? But if a
   sinner hath any degree of true holiness in him it must be the work of
   the Spirit, for true holiness never exists in the carnal mind,
   therefore, that man is already renewed, and therefore saved. Are we to
   go running up and down the world, proclaiming life to the living,
   casting bread to those who are fed already, and holding up Christ on
   the pole of the gospel to those who are already healed? My brethren,
   where is our inducement to labour where our efforts are so little
   needed ? If I am to preach Christ to those who have no goodness, who
   have nothing in them that qualifies them for mercy, then I feel I have
   a gospel so divine that I would proclaim it with my last breath, crying
   aloud, that "Jesus came into the world to save sinners"--sinners as
   sinners, not as penitent sinners or as awakened sinners, but sinners as
   sinners, sinners "of whom I am chief."

   Secondly, to tell the sinner that he is to believe on Christ because of
   some warrant in himself, is legal, I dare to say it--legal. Though this
   method is generally adopted by the higher school of Calvinists, they
   are herein unsound, uncalvinistic, and legal; it is strange that they
   who are so bold defenders of free grace should make common cause with
   Baxterians and Pelagians. I lay it down to he legal for this reason: if
   I believe in Jesus Christ because I feel a genuine repentance of sin,
   and therefore have a warrant for my faith, do you not perceive that the
   first and true ground of my confidence is the fact that I have repented
   of sin? If I believe in Jesus because I have convictions and a spirit
   of prayer, then evidently the first and the most important fact is not
   Christ, but my possession of repentance, conviction, and prayer, so
   that really my hope hinges upon my having repented; and if this be not
   legal I do not know what is. Put it lower. My opponents will say, "The
   sinner must have an awakened conscience before he is warranted to
   believe on Christ." Well, then, if I trust Christ to save me because I
   have an awakened conscience, I say again, the most important part of
   the whole transaction is the alarm of my conscience, and my real trust
   hangs there. If I lean on Christ because I feel this and that, then I
   am leaning on my feelings and not on Christ alone, and this is legal
   indeed. Nay, even if desires after Christ are to be my warrant for
   believing, if I am to believe in Jesus not because he bids me, but
   because I feel some desires after him, you will again with half an eye
   perceive that the most important source of my comfort must be my own
   desires. So that we shall be always looking within. "Do I really
   desire? If I do, then Christ can save me; if I do not, then he cannot."
   And so my desire overrides Christ and his grace. Away with such'
   legality from the earth!

   Again, any other way of preaching than that of bidding the sinner
   believe because God commands him to believe, is a boasting way of
   faith. For if my warrant to trust in Jesus be found in my experience,
   my loathings of sin, or my longings after Christ, then all these good
   things of mine are a legitimate ground of boasting, because though
   Christ may save me, yet these were the wedding-dress which fitted me to
   come to Christ. If these be indispensable pre-requisites and
   conditions, then the man who has them may truly and justly say, "Christ
   did save me, but I had the pre-requisites and conditions first, and
   therefore let these share the praise." See, my brethren, those who have
   a faith which rests upon their own experience, what are they as a rule?
   Mark them, and you will perceive much censorious bitterness in them,
   prompting them to set up their own experience as the standard of
   saintship, which may assuredly make us suspicious whether they ever
   were humbled in a gospel manner at all, so as to see that their own
   best feelings, and best repentances, and best experiences in themselves
   are nothing more nor less than filthy rags in the sight of God. My dear
   brethren, when we tell a sinner that foul and filthy as he is, without
   any preparation or qualification, he is to take Jesus Christ to be his
   all in all, finding in him all that he can ever need, when we dare on
   the spot to bid the jailor just startled out of sleep, "Believe in
   Jesus," we leave no room for self-glorification, all must be of grace.
   When we find the lame man lying at the temple gates, we do not bid him
   strengthen his own legs. or feel some life in them, but we bid him in
   the name of Jesus rise up and walk; surely here when God the Spirit
   owns the Word, all boasting is excluded. Whether I rely on my
   experience or my good works makes little difference, for either of
   these reliances will lead to boasting since they are both legal. Law
   and boasting are twin brothers, but free grace and gratitude always go
   together.

   Any other warrant for believing on Jesus than that which is presented
   in the gospel is changeable. See, brethren, if my warrant to believe in
   Christ lies in my meltings of heart and my experiences, then if to-day
   I have a melting heart and I can pour my soul out before the Lord, I
   have a warrant to believe in Christ. But to-morrow (who does not know
   this?) to-morrow my heart may be as hard as a stone, so that I can
   neither feel nor pray. Then, according to the qualification-theory, I
   have no right to trust in Christ, my warrant is clean gone from me.
   According to the doctrine of final perseverance, the Christian's faith
   is continual, if so the warrant of his faith must be always the same,
   or else he has sometimes an unwarranted faith which is absurd; it
   follows from this that the abiding warrant of faith must lie in some
   immutable truth. Since everything within changes more frequently than
   ever does an English sky, if my warrant to believe in Christ be based
   within, it must change every hour; consequently I am lost and saved
   alternately. Brethren, can these things be so? For my part I want a
   sure and immutable warrant for my faith; I want a warrant to believe in
   Jesus which will serve me when the devil's blasphemy comes pouring into
   my ears like a flood; I want a warrant to believe which will serve me
   when my lustings and corruptions appear in terrible array, and make me
   cry out, "O wretched man that I am;' I want a warrant to believe in
   Christ which will comfort me when I have no good frames and holy
   feelings, when I am dead as a stone and my spirit lies cleaving to the
   dust. Such an unfailing warrant to belief in Jesus is found in this
   precious truth, that his gracious commandment and not my variable
   experience, is my title to believe on his Son Jesus Christ.

   Again, my brethren, any other warrant is utterly incomprehensible.
   Multitudes of my brethren preach an impossible salvation. How often do
   poor sinners hunger and thirst to know the way of salvation, and there
   is no available salvation preached to them. Personally, I do not
   remember to have been told from the pulpit to believe in Jesus as a
   sinner. I heard much of feelings which I thought I could never get, and
   frames after which I longed; but I found no peace until a true, free
   grace message came to me, "Look unto me and be ye saved, all the ends
   of the earth." See, my brethren, if convictions of soul are necessary
   qualifications for Christ, we ought to know to an ounce how much of
   these qualifications are needed. If you tell a poor sinner that there
   is a certain amount of humblings, and tremblings, and convictions, and
   heart-searchings to be felt, in order that he may be warranted to come
   to Christ, I demand of all legal-gospellers distinct information as to
   the manner and exact degree of preparation required. Brethren, you will
   find when these gentlemen are pushed into a corner, they will not
   agree, but will every one give a different standard, according to his
   own judgment. One will sa the sinner must have months of law work;
   another, that he only needs good desires; and some will demand that he
   possess the graces of the Spirit--such as humility, godly sorrow, and
   love to holiness. You will get no clear answer from them. If the
   sinner's warrant to come is found in the gospel itself, the matter is
   clear and plain; but what a roundabout plan is that compound of law and
   gospel against which I Contend! And let me ask you, my brethren,
   whether such an incomprehensible gospel would do for a dying man? There
   he lies in the agonies of death. He tells me that he has no good
   thought or feeling, and asks what he must do to be saved. There is but
   a step between him and death--another five minutes and that man's soul
   may be in hell. What am I to tell him? Am I to be an hour explaining to
   him the preparation required before he may come to Christ? Brethren, I
   dare not. But I tell him, "Believe. brother, even though it be the
   eleventh hour; trust thy soul with Jesus, and thou shalt be saved."
   There is the same gospel for a living man as for a dying man. The thief
   on the Cross may have had some experience, but I do not find him
   pleading it; he turns his eye to Jesus, saying, "Lord, remember me !"
   How prompt is the reply, "To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise." He
   may have had onging desires, he may have had deep convictions, but I am
   quite sure he did not say, "Lord, I dare not ask thee to remember me,
   because I do not feel I have repented enough. I dare not trust thee,
   because I have not been shaken over hell's mouth." No, no, no; he
   looked to Jesus as he was, and Jesus responded to his believing prayer.
   It must be so with you, my brethren, for any other plan but that of a
   sinner's coming to Christ as a sinner, and resting on Jesus just as he
   is, is utterly incomprehensible, or, if it is to be explained at all,
   will require a day or two to explain it ill; and that cannot be the
   gospel which the apostles preached to dying men.

   Yet again, I believe that the preaching of alarms of conscience and
   repentance as qualifications for Christ, is unacceptable to the
   awakened sinner. I will introduce one, as Saltmarsh does in his
   "Flowings of Christ's Blood Freely to the Chief of Sinners." Here is a
   poor brother who dares not believe in Jesus. I will suppose him to have
   attended a ministry where the preaching is "If you have felt this, if
   you have felt that, then you may believe." When you went to your
   minister in trouble, what did he say to you? "He asked me whether I
   felt my need of Christ, I told him I did not think I did, at least I
   did not feel my need enough. He told me that I ought to meditate upon
   the guilt of sin, and consider the dreadful character of the wrath to
   come, and I might in this way feel my need more." Did you do so? "I
   did; but it seemed to me as if while I meditated upon the terrors of
   judgment, my heart grew harder instead of softer, and I seemed to be
   desperately set, and resolved in a kind of despair to go on in my ways;
   yet, some-times I did have some humblings and some meltings of heart."
   What did your minister tell you to do to get comfort then? "He said I
   ought to pray much." Did you pray? "I told him I could not pray; that I
   was such a sinner that it was of no use for me to hope for an answer if
   I could." What did he say then? "He told me I ought to lay hold upon
   the promises." Yes, did you do so? "No; I told him I could not lay hold
   upon the promises; that I could not see they were meant for me, for I
   was not the character intended; and that I could only find threatenings
   in the Word of God for such as I was." What did he say then? "He told
   me to be diligent in the use of the means, and to attend his ministry."
   What did you say to that? "I told him I was diligent, but that what I
   wanted was not means, I wanted to get my sins pardoned and forgiven."
   What did he say then? "Why, he said that I had better persevere and
   wait patiently for the Lord; I told him that I was in such a horror of
   great darkness, that my soul chose strangling rather than life. Well
   then, he said, he thought I must already be truly penitent, and was
   therefore safe, and that sooner or later I should have hope But I told
   him, a mere hope was not enough for me, I could not he safe while sin
   lay so heavy upon me. He asked me whether I had not desires after
   Christ. I said I had, but they were merely selfish, Carnal desires;
   that I sometimes thought I had desires, but they were only legal. He
   said if I had a desire to have a desire, it was God's work, and I was
   saved. That did prop me up for a time, sir, but I went down again, for
   that did not do for me, I wanted something solid to rest on." And
   sinner, how is it now with you? where are you now? "Well, sir, I scarce
   know where I am, but I pray you, tell me what I must do?" Brethren, my
   reply is prompt and plain; hear it. Poor soul, I have no questions to
   ask you; I have no advice to give you, except this, God's command to
   you is, whatever you may be, trust to the Lord Jesus Christ, and you
   shall be saved. Will you do it or no? If he rejects that, I must heave
   him; I have no more to say to him; I am clear of his blood, and on him
   the sentence comes, "He that believeth not shall be damned." But you
   will find in ninety-nine Cases out of one hundred, that when you begin
   to talk to the sinner, not about his repentings and his desirings, but
   about Christ, and tell him that he need not fear the law, for Christ
   has satisfied it; that he need not fear an angry God, for God is not
   angry with believers; tell him that all manner of iniquity was Cast
   into the Red Sea of Jesus' blood, and, like the Egyptians, drowned
   there for ever; tell him that no matter however vile and wicked he may
   have been, "Christ is able to save unto the uttermost them that come
   unto God by him;" and tell him that he has a right to come, be he who
   he may, or what he may, because God bids him come; and you will find
   that the suitability of such a gospel to the sinner's case, will prove
   a sweet inducement in the hand of the Holy Spirit, to lead that sinner
   to lay hold on Jesus Christ. O my brethren, I am ashamed of myself when
   I think of the way in which I have sometimes talked to awakened
   sinners. I am persuaded that the only true remedy for a broken heart is
   Jesus Christ's most precious blood. Some surgeons keep a wound open too
   long; they keep cutting, and cutting, and cutting, till they cut away
   as much sound flesh as proud flesh. Better by half heal it, heal it at
   once, for Jesus Christ was not sent to keep open the wounds, but to
   bind up the broken in heart. To you, then, sinners of every sort and
   hue, black, hard-hearted, insensible, impenitent, even to you is the
   gospel sent, for "Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners,"
   even the chief.

   I might here pause, surely, but I must add yet one other point upon
   this negative mode of reasoning. Any other warrant for the sinner's
   faith than the gospel itself, is false and dangerous.

   It is false, my brethren, it is as false as God is true, that anything
   in a sinner can be his warrant for believing in Jesus. The whole tenour
   and run of the gospel is clean contrary to it. It must be false,
   because there is nothing in a sinner until he believes which can be a
   warrant for his believing. If you tell me that a sinner has any good
   thing in him before he believes, I reply, impossible--"Without faith it
   is impossible to please God." All the repentings, and humblings, and
   convictions that a sinner has before faith, must be, according to
   Scripture, displeasing to God. Do not tell me that his heart is broken;
   if it is only broken by carnal means, and trusts in its brokenness, it
   needs to be broken over again. Do not tell me he has been led to hate
   his sin; I tell you he does not hate his sin, he only hates hell. There
   cannot be a true and real hatred of sin where there is not faith in
   Jesus. All the sinner knows and feels before faith is only an addition
   to his other sins, and how can sin which deserves wrath be a warrant
   for an act which is the work of the Holy Spirit?

   How dangerous is the sentiment I am opposing. My hearers, it may be so
   mischievous us to have misled some of you. I solemnly warn you, though
   you have been professors of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ for twenty
   years, if your reason for believing in Christ lies in this, that you
   have felt the terrors of the law; that you have been alarmed, and have
   been convinced; if your own experience be your warrant for believing in
   Christ, it is a false reason, and you are really relying upon your
   experience and not upon Christ: and mark you, if you rely upon your
   frames and feelings, nay, if you rely upon your communion with Christ,
   in any degree whatever, you are as certainly a lost sinner as though
   you relied upon oaths and blasphemies; you shall no more be able to
   enter heaven, even by the works of the Spirit--and this is using strong
   language--than by your own works; for Christ, and Christ alone, is the
   foundation, and "other foundation can no man lay than that is laid,
   which is Jesus Christ." Take care of resting in your own experience.
   All that is of nature's spinning must be unravelled, and everything
   that getteth into Christ's place, however dear to thee, and however
   precious in itself, must be broken in pieces, and like the dust of the
   golden calf, must be strawed upon the water, and thou wilt be made
   sorrowfully to drink of it, because thou madest it thy trust. I believe
   that the tendency of that preaching which puts the warrant for faith
   anywhere but in the gospel command, is to vex the true penitent, and to
   console the hypocrite; the tendency of it is to make the poor soul
   which really repents, feel that he must not believe in Christ, because
   he sees so much of his own hardness of heart. The more spiritual a man
   is, the more unspiritual he sees himself to be; and the more penitent a
   man is, the more impenitent he discovers himself to be. Often the most
   penitent men are those who think themselves the most impenitent; and if
   I am to preach the gospel to the penitent and not to every sinner, as a
   sinner, then those penitent persons, who, according to my opponents,
   have the most right to believe, are the very persons who will never
   dare to touch it, because they are conscious of their own impenitence
   and want of all qualification for Christ. Sinners, let me address you
   with words of life: Jesus wants nothing of you, nothing whatsoever,
   nothing done, nothing felt; he gives both work and feeling. Ragged,
   penniless, just as ye are, lost, forsaken, desolate, with no good
   feelings, and no good hopes, still Jesus comes to you, and in these
   words of pity he addresses you, "Him that cometh to me I will in no
   Wise cast out." If thou believest in him thou shalt never be
   confounded.

   2. But now, POSITIVELY, and as the negative part has been positive
   enough, we will be brief here. The gospel Command is a sufficient
   warrant for a sinner to believe in Jesus Christ. The words of our text
   imply this--" This is the commandment." My brethren, do you want any
   warrant for doing a thing better than God's command to do it? The
   children of Israel borrowed jewels of silver and jewels of gold from
   the Egyptians. Many, as they read the Bible, find fault with this
   transaction; but, to my mind, if God bade them do it, that was enough
   of justification for them. Very well; if God bid thee believe--if this
   be his commandment that thou believe--canst thou want a better warrant?
   I say, is there any necessity for any other. Surely the Lord's Word is
   enough.

   Brethren, the command to believe in Christ must be the sinner's
   warrant, if you consider the nature of our commission. How runs it? "Go
   ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature." It
   ought to run, according to the other plan, "preach the gospel to every
   regenerate person, to every convinced sinner, to every sensible soul."
   But it is not so; it is to "every creature." But unless the warrant be
   a something in which every creature can take a share, there is no such
   thing as consistently preaching it to every creature. Then how is it
   put?--"He that believeth and is baptised, shall be saved; he that
   believeth not shall be damned." Where is there a word about the
   pre-requisites for believing. Surely the man could not be damned for
   not doing what he would not have been warranted in doing. Our reaching,
   on the theory of qualifications, should not be," Believe in the Lord
   Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved;" but "Qualify yourselves for
   faith, be sensible of your sin, be regenerated, get marks and
   evidences, and then believe." Why, surely, if I am not to sow the good
   seed on the stony places and among the thorns, I had better give up
   being a sower, and take to ploughing, or some other work. When the
   apostles went to Macedonia or Achaia, they ought not to have commenced
   with preaching Christ; they should have preached up qualifications,
   emotions, and sensations, if these are the preparations for Jesus; but
   I find that Paul, whenever he stands up, has nothing to preach but
   "Christ, and him crucified." Repentance is preached as a gift from the
   exalted Saviour, but it is never as the cause or preparation for
   believing on Jesus. These two graces are born together, and live with a
   common life--beware of making one a foundation for the other. I would
   like to carry one of those who only preach to sensible sinners, and set
   him down in the capital of the kingdom of Dahomey. There are no
   sensible sinners there! Look at them, with their mouths stained with
   human blood, with their bodies smeared all over with the gore of their
   immolated victims--how will the preacher find any qualification there?
   I know not what he could say, but I know what my message would be. My
   word would run thus--"Men and brethren, God, who made the heavens and
   the earth; hath sent his Son Jesus Christ into the world to suffer for
   our sins, and whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have
   everlasting life." If Christ crucified did not shake the kingdom of
   Dahomey, it would be its first failure. When the Moravian missionaries
   first went to Greenland, you remember that they were months and months
   teaching the poor Greenlander about the Godhead, the doctrine of the
   Trinity, and the doctrine of sin and the law, and no converts were
   forthcoming. But one day, by accident, one of the Greenlanders
   happening to read that passage, "Behold what manner of love the Father
   hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the children of God,"
   asked the meaning, and' the missionary, hardly thinking him advanced
   enough to understand the gospel, nevertheless ventured to explain it to
   him, and the man became converted, and hundreds of his countrymen
   received the Word. Naturally enough, they said to the missionaries,
   "Why did not you tell us this before? We knew all about there being a
   God, and that did us no good; why did not you come and tell us to
   believe in Jesus Christ before?" O my brethren, this is God's weapon,
   God's method; this is the great battering-ram which will shake the
   gates of hell; and we must see to it, that it be brought into daily
   use.

   I have tried, on the positive side, to show that a free-grace warrant
   is consistent with the text--that it accords with apostolic custom, and
   is, indeed, absolutely necessary, seeing the condition in which sinners
   are placed. But, my brethren, to preach Christ to sinners, as sinners,
   must be right; for all the former acts of God are to sinners, as
   sinners. Whom did God elect? Sinners. He loved us with a great love,
   even when we were dead in trespasses and sins. How did he redeem them?
   Did he redeem them as saints? No; for while we were yet enemies, he
   reconciled us unto God by the death of his Son. Christ never shed his
   blood for the good that is in us, but for the sin that is in us. "He
   laid down his life for our sins," says the apostle. If, then, in
   election and redemption, we find God dealing with sinners, as sinners,
   it is a marring and nullifying of the whole plan if the gospel is to be
   preached to men as anything else but sinners.

   Again, it is inconsistent with the character of God to suppose that he
   comes forth and proclaims, "If, O my fallen creatures, if you qualify
   yourselves for my mercy, I will save you; if you will feel holy
   emotions--if you will be conscious of sacred desires after me, then the
   blood of Jesus Christ shall cleanse you." There would be little which
   is godlike in that. But when he comes out with pardons full and free,
   and saith, "Yea, when ye lay in your blood, I said unto you Live"--when
   he comes to you, his enemy and rebellious subject, and yet cries, "I
   have blotted out thy sins like a cloud, and like a thick cloud thine
   iniquities." Why, this is divine. You know what David said, "I have
   sinned." What did Nathan say? "The Lord has put away thy sin, thou
   shalt not die," and that is the message of the gospel to a sinner as a
   sinner. "The Lord has put away thy sin; Christ has suffered; he has
   brought in perfect righteousness; take him, trust him, and ye shall
   live." May that message come home to you this morning, my beloved.

   I have read with some degree of attention a book to which I owe much
   for this present discourse--a book, by Abraham Booth, called "Glad
   Tidings to Perishing Sinners." I have never heard any one cast a
   suspicion upon Abraham Booth's soundness; on the contrary, he has been
   generally considered as one of the most orthodox of the divines of the
   last generation. If you want my views in full, read his book. If you
   need something more, let me say, among all the bad things which his
   revilers have laid to his door, I have never heard any one blame
   William Huntingdon for not being high enough in doctrine. Now, William
   Huntingdon prefaced in his lifetime a book by Saltmarsh, with which he
   was greatly pleased; and the marrow of its teaching is just this, in
   his own words, "The only ground for any to believe is, he is faithful
   that hath promised, not anything in themselves, for this is the
   commandment, That ye believe on his Son Jesus Christ." Now, if William
   Huntingdon himself printed such a book as that, I marvel how the
   followers of either William Huntingdon or Abraham Booth, how men
   calling themselves Calvinistic divines and high Calvinists, can
   advocate what is not free grace, but a legal, graceless system of
   qualifications and preparations. I might here quote Crisp, who is pat
   to the point and a high doctrine man too. I mention neither Booth nor
   Huntingdon as authorities upon the subject, to the law and to the
   testimony we must go; but I do mention them to show that men holding
   strong views on election and predestination yet did see it to be
   consistent to preach the gospel to sinners as sinners--nay, felt that
   it was inconsistent to preach the gospel in any other way.

   I shall only add, that the blessings which flow from preaching Christ
   to sinners as sinners, are of such a character as prove it to be right.
   Do on not see that this levels us all? We have the same warrant for
   believing, and no one can exalt himself above his fellow.

   Then, my brethren, how it inspires men with hope and confidence; it
   forbids despair. No man can despair if this be true; or if he do, it is
   a wicked, unreasonable despair, because if he has been never so bad,
   yet God commands him to believe. What room can there be for
   despondency? Surely if anything Could cut off Giant Despair's head,
   Christ preached to sinners is the sharp two-edged sword to do it.

   Again, how it makes a man live close to Christ! If I am to come to
   Christ as a sinner every day, and I must do so, for the Word saith, "As
   ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him;" if every
   day I am to come to Christ as a sinner, why then, how paltry all my
   doings look! what utter contempt it casts upon all my fine virtues, m
   preachings, my prayings, and all that comes of my flesh! and though it
   leads me to seek after purity and holiness, yet it teaches me to live
   on Christ and not on them, and so it keeps me at the fountain head.

   My time flies, and I must leave the last head, just to add, sinner,
   whoever thou mayst be, God now commands thee to believe in Jesus
   Christ. This is his commandment: he does not command thee to feel
   anything, or be anything, to prepare thyself for this. Now, art thou
   willing to incur the great guilt of making God a liar? Surely thou wilt
   shrink from that: then dare to believe. Thou canst not say, "I have no
   right:" you have a perfect right to do what God tells you to do. You
   cannot tell me you are not fit; there is no fitness wanted, the Command
   is given and it is yours to obey, not to dispute. You cannot say it
   does not come to you--it is preached to every Creature under heaven;
   and now soul, it is so pleasant a thing to trust the Lord Jesus Christ
   that I would fain persuade myself thou needest no persuading. It is so
   delightful a thing to accept a perfect salvation, to be saved by
   precious blood. and to be married to so bright a Saviour, that I would
   fain hope the Holy Spirit has led thee to cry, "Lord, I believe; help
   thou mine unbelief."

                            Thanksgiving And Prayer

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 27, 1863, BY THE REV.
   C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "You crown the year with Your goodness. And your paths drop fatness."
   Psalm 65:11.

   POSSIBLY objections might have been raised to a day of thanksgiving for
   the abundant harvest if it had been ordered or suggested by Government.
   Certain Brothers and Sisters are so exceedingly tender in their
   consciences upon the point of connection between Church and State that
   they would have thought it almost a reason for not being thankful at
   all if the Government had recommended them to celebrate a day of public
   thanksgiving.

   Although I have no love to the unscriptural union of Church and State,
   I should on this occasion have hailed an official request for a
   national recognition of the special goodness of God. However, none of
   us can feel any objection arising in our minds if it is now agreed that
   today we will praise our ever-bounteous Lord and as an assembly record
   our gratitude to the God of the harvest. We are probably the largest
   assembly of Christian people in the world and it is well that we should
   set the example to the smaller Churches.

   Doubtless many other Believers will follow in our footsteps, and so a
   public thanksgiving will become general throughout the country. I hope
   to see every congregation in the land raising a special offering unto
   the Lord, to be devoted either to His Church, to the poor, to missions,
   or some other holy end. Yes, I would have every Christian offer
   willingly unto the Lord as a token of his gratitude to the God of
   Providence.

   I had almost forgotten that today we have to ask your contributions for
   the support of two ministers of our own body laboring in Germany. It is
   well that it so happens, because it furnishes an object for the
   practical expression of the thanks which we feel to Almighty God. While
   as the sum required for this object will at once be raised, our beloved
   college will be a worthy object for friends at a distance to assist
   with their free will offerings.

   Without any preface, we will divide our text as it divides itself. Here
   we have crowning mercies calling for crowning gratitude. And in the
   same verse, paths offatness, which should be to us ways of delight.
   When we have talked upon these two points, we may meditate for a few
   moments upon the whole subject and endeavor, as God shall help us, to
   see what duties it suggests.

   I. First of all, we have here CROWNING MERCIES, SUGGESTING SPECIAL AND
   CROWNING THANKSGIVING. All the year round, every hour of every day, God
   is richly blessing us--both when we sleep and when we wake His mercy
   waits upon us. The sun may leave off shining, but our God will never
   cease to cheer His children with His love. Like a river His loving
   kindness is always flowing with a fullness inexhaustible as His own
   Nature, which is its source. Like the atmosphere which always surrounds
   the earth and is always ready to support the life of man, the
   benevolence of God surrounds all His creatures--in it, as in their
   element--they live and move and have their being.

   Yet as the sun on summer days appears to gladden us with beams more
   warm and bright than at other times, and as rivers are at certain
   seasons swollen with the rain, and as the atmosphere itself on
   occasions is fraught with more fresh, more bracing, or more balmy
   influences than before, so is it with the mercy of God--it has its
   golden hours, its days of overflow when the Lord magnifies His Grace
   and lifts high His love before the sons of men.

   If we begin with the blessings of the nether springs, we must not
   forget that for the race of man the joyous days of harvest are a
   special season of excessive favor. It is the glory of autumn that the
   ripe gifts of Providence are then abundantly bestowed. It is the mellow
   season of realization, whereas all before was but hope and expectation.
   Great is the joy of harvest. Happy are the reapers who fill their arms
   with the liberality of Heaven. The Psalmist tells us that the harvest
   is the crowning of the year.

   What if I compare the opening spring to the proclamation of a new
   prince, the latest born of Father Time? With the musical voices of
   birds and the joyful lowing of herds, a new era of fertility is ushered
   in. Every verdant meadow and every leaping brook hears the joyful
   proclamation and feels a new life within. The little hills rejoice on
   every side. They shout for joy. They also sing. Throughout the warm
   months of summer the royal year is dressing itself in beauty and
   adorning itself in sumptuous array.

   What with the plates of ivory, yielded by the lilies, the rubies of the
   rose, the emeralds of the meads and all manner of fair colors from the
   many flowers, we may well say that, "Solomon in all his glory was not
   arrayed like one of these." No studs of silver or rows of jewels can
   vie with the ornaments of the year. No garments of needlework of divers
   colors can match the glorious vesture of Time's reigning son. But the
   moment of the coronation, when earth feels most the sway of the year,
   is in the fullness of autumn. Then it is when the fields are covered
   with a dose of gold, and fruits are glowing with the rich hues of
   ripeness, and the leaves are burnished with inimitable perfection of
   tint and shade.

   Then it is with a coronal of Divine goodness, amidst the glad shouts of
   toiling lads and the songs of rejoicing maidens, the year is crowned!
   Upon a throne of golden corn, with the peaceful sickle for his scepter,
   sits the crowned year bearing the goodness of the Lord as a coronet
   upon his placid brow. Or, what if we compare the year to a conqueror,
   striving at first with stern winter, wrestling hard against all his
   boisterous attacks, and at last joyfully conquering in the fair days of
   spring? He rides in triumph throughout the summer along a pathway
   strewed with flowers, and at last, mounting the throne amidst the
   festivities of harvest, while the Lord in loving kindness puts a diadem
   of beauty and goodness upon his head--

   "Cheerfulness and holy pleasure Well become our happy isle, When our
   God in copious measure Deigns to bless us with His smile; Joyful, then,
   all people come, Celebrate the harvest home."

   We may forget the harvest, living as we do, so far from rural labors,
   but those who have to watch the corn as it springs up and track it
   through all its numberless dangers until the blade becomes the full
   corn in the ear, cannot, surely, forget the wonderful goodness and
   mercy of God when they see the harvest safely stored. My Brothers and
   Sisters, if we require any considerations to excite us to gratitude,
   let us think for a moment of the effect upon our country of a total
   failure of the crops.

   What if today it were reported that as yet the corn was not carried,
   that the continued showers had made it sprout and grow till there was
   no hope of its being of any further use and that it might as well be
   left in the fields? What dismay would that message carry into every
   cottage? Who among us could contemplate the future without dismay? All
   faces would gather blackness. All classes would sorrow and even the
   throne itself might fitly be covered with sackcloth at the news.

   At this day the kingdom of Egypt sits trembling. The rejoicing and
   abounding land trembles for her sons. The Nile has swollen beyond its
   proper limit, the waters continue still to rise, and a few more days
   must see the fields covered with devastating floods. If it is so, alas
   for that land, in other years so favored as to have given us the
   Proverb of "Corn in Egypt." My Brothers and Sisters, should we not
   rejoice that this is not our case and that our happy land rejoices in
   plenty? If the plant had utterly failed and the seed had rotted under
   the clods, we should have been quick enough to murmur--how is it that
   we are so slow to praise?

   Take a lower view of the matter--suppose even a partial scarcity--at
   this juncture, when one arm of our industry is paralyzed, how serious
   would have been this calamity! With a staple commodity withdrawn from
   us, with the daily peril of war at our gates, it would have been a
   fearful trial to have suffered scarcity of bread. Shall we not bless
   and praise our Covenant God who permits not the appointed weeks of
   harvest to fail? Sing together all you to whom bread is the staff of
   life and rejoice before Him who loads you with benefits!

   We have none of us any adequate idea of the amount of happiness
   conferred upon a nation by a luxuriant crop. Every man in the land is
   the richer for it. To the poor man the difference is of the utmost
   importance. His three shillings are now worth four. There is more bread
   for the children, or more money for clothes. Millions are benefited by
   God's once opening His liberal hand. When the Hebrews went through the
   desert there were but some two or three millions of them, and yet they
   sang sweetly of Him who fed His chosen people.

   In our own land alone we have ten times the number. Have we no hallowed
   music for the God of the whole earth? Reflect upon the amazing
   population of our enormous city--consider the immense mount of
   poverty--think how greatly at one stroke that poverty has been
   relieved! A generous contribution, equal to that made for the
   Lancashire distress, would be but as the drop of a bucket to the relief
   afforded by a fall in the price of bread. Let us not despise the bounty
   of God because this great benefit comes in a natural way. If every
   morning when we awoke we saw fresh loaves of bread put into our
   cupboard, or the morning's meal set out upon the table, we should think
   it a miracle.

   But if our God blesses our own exertions and prospers our own toil to
   the same end, is it not equally as much a ground for praising and
   blessing His name? I would I had this morning the tongue of the
   eloquent, or even my own usual strength to excite you to gratitude, by
   the spectacle of the multitudes of beings whom God has made happy by
   the fruit of the field. My sickness today makes my thoughts wander and
   unfits me for so noble a theme, yet my soul pants to set your hearts on
   fire. O for Heaven's own fire to kindle your hearts! O come, let us
   worship and bow down, let us exalt the Lord our God and come into His
   Presence with the voice of joy and thanksgiving!

   But how shall we give crowning thanksgiving for this crowning mercy of
   the year? We can do it, dear Friends, by the inward emotions of
   gratitude. Let our hearts be warmed. Let our spirits remember,
   meditate, and think upon this goodness of the Lord. Meditation upon
   this mercy may tend to nourish in you the most tender feelings of
   affection, and your souls will be knit to the Father of spirits, who
   pities His children. Again, praise Him with your lips. Let Psalms and
   hymns employ your tongues today--and tomorrow, when we meet together at
   the Prayer Meeting, let us turn it rather into a Praise Meeting and let
   us laud and magnify His name from whose bounty all this goodness flows.

   But I think, also, we should thank Him by our gifts. The Jews of old
   never tasted the fruit either of the barley or of the wheat harvest
   till they had sanctified it to the Lord by the feast of ingatherings.
   There was, early in the season, the barley harvest. One sheaf of this
   barley was taken and waved before the Lord with special sacrifices, and
   then afterward the people feasted. Fifty days afterward came the wheat
   harvest, when two loaves, made of the new flour, were offered before
   the Lord in sacrifice, together with burnt-offerings, peace-offerings,
   meat-offerings, drink-offerings and abundant sacrifices of
   thanksgivings to show that the people's thankfulness was not stinted or
   mean.

   No man ate either of the ears, or grain, or corn ground and made into
   bread, until first of all he had sanctified his substance by the
   dedication of some unto the Lord. And shall we do less than the Jew?
   Shall he, for types and shadows, express his gratitude in a solid
   manner and shall not we? Did he offer unto the Lord whom he scarcely
   knew and bow before that Most High God who hid His face amidst the
   smoke of burning rams and bullocks? And shall not we, who see the Glory
   of the Lord in the face of Christ Jesus come unto Him and bring to Him
   our offerings?

   The Old Testament ordinance was, "You shall not come before the Lord
   empty." And let that be the ordinance of today. Let us come into His
   Presence, each man bearing his offering of thanksgiving unto the Lord.
   But enough concerning this particular harvest. It has been a crowning
   mercy this year, so that the other version of our text might aptly be
   applied as a description of1863, "You crown the year with Your
   goodness."

   Furthermore, Beloved, we have heard of heavenly harvests, the
   out-flowings of the upper springs, which, in days of yore, awakened the
   Church of God to loudest praise. There was the harvest of Pentecost.
   Christ having been sown in the ground like a grain of wheat, sprang up
   from it and in His resurrection and ascension was like the waved sheaf
   before the Lord. Let us never forget that resurrection which crowned
   the year of God's redeemed with goodness. It was a terrible year,
   indeed. It began in the howling tempests of Christ's poverty, want,
   shame, suffering, and death. It seemed to have no spring and no summer,
   but yet it was crowned with an abundant harvest when Jesus Christ rose
   from the dead.

   Fifty days after the resurrection came the Pentecost. The barley
   harvest had been passed wherein the wave-sheaf was offered. Then came
   the days of wheat harvest. Peter and the eleven that were with him
   became the reapers and three thousand souls fell beneath the Gospel
   sickle. There was great joy in the city of Jerusalem that day--all the
   saints who heard were glad, and Heaven itself, catching the Divine
   enthusiasm, rang with harvest joy! It is recorded that the saints ate
   their bread with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God.
   Pentecost was a crowning mercy, and it was remembered by the saints
   with crowning thanks.

   May I not say that we have had the like crowning mercy shown to this
   our highly-favored land, in the revivals which a few years ago were so
   plentiful among us and which even now hover over our heads? The Spirit
   of the Lord suddenly fell upon many a city and village--where the
   Gospel had been preached with dull and heavy tones, suddenly the
   minister began to glow--the cords which bound his tongue were snapped,
   and like a seraph full of heavenly fire he began to tell of the love of
   Jesus. Souls were moved as the trees of the woods are moved in the
   wind--spirits long dead in sin's tremendous sepulcher woke up at the
   quickening breath!

   They stood upon their feet as a great army--they praised the Lord.
   Other towns and other villages received the like Pentecostal shower and
   we had hoped--O that our hopes had been realized--that all England
   would have been filled with the same Divine enthusiasm and that the
   effects would have continued among us. To a great extent the revival
   has departed and many of our Churches are more stolid and cold than
   ever. And our denomination--never too zealous, seldom guilty of
   excessive heat, seems to have now, I think, as little earnest life as
   it ever had. Back to their old beds of slumber--back again to their old
   dens of routine--downward again to Laodicean lukewarmness have they
   stolen. Their goodness was as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it
   passes away. O that the Lord would once again crown the year with His
   goodness and send us revivals from the right hand of the Most High!

   Here it is, O well-beloved flock of my care and love, that I ask your
   gratitude, mainly and chiefly. My Brothers and Sisters, how the Lord
   has cheered and comforted our hearts while He has crowned our years
   with His goodness! Here these ten years have I, as He has enabled me,
   preached the Gospel among you. We have seen no excitement, no stirrings
   of an unwarranted fanaticism--no wildfires have been kindled--and yet
   see how the multitude have listened to the Gospel with unceasing
   attention. And the surging crowds at yonder doors prove that, as in the
   days of John the Baptist, so it is now--the kingdom of Heaven suffers
   violence and every man presses into it.

   As for conversions, has not the Lord been pleased to give them to us as
   constantly as the sun rises in his place? Scarcely a sermon without the
   benediction of the Most High--many of them preached in weakness, which
   none of you have known but the speaker--preached at times with throbs
   of heart and partings of anguish, which have made the preacher go home
   mourning that he ever preached at all. And yet success has come and
   souls have been saved! And the preacher's heart has been made to sing
   for joy, for the seed rots not, the furrows are good, the field has
   been well prepared and where the seed falls it brings forth a
   hundredfold, to the praise and honor of the Most High.

   Brethren, we must not forget this! We might have preached for nothing.
   We might have plowed the thankless rock and gathered no sheaves. Why
   then does He bless us? Is it our worthiness? Ah, no. Is it for anything
   in the preacher or in the hearers? God forbid that we should think such
   a thing! It has been the Sovereign Mercy of God which has prospered His
   own Truth among us and shall we not, for this, praise and bless His
   name?

   If we, as a Church, do not continue to be as prayerful and as earnest
   as we have been, the Lord may justly make us like Shiloh, which He
   deserted, until it became a desolation where not one stone was left
   upon another. No, I venture to say if we do not progress in
   earnestness, if you, my Hearers, do not become more than ever devoted
   to the Lord's cause. If there is not more and more of an earnest
   missionary spirit stirred up and nurtured among us, we may expect the
   Lord to turn away from us and find another people who shall more
   worthily repay His favors.

   Who knows but you may have come to the kingdom for such a time as this.
   Perhaps the Lord intends, by some of you to save multitudes of souls,
   to stir up His Churches and to awaken the slumbering spirit of
   religion. Will you prove unworthy? Will you say, "I pray you have me
   excused." Will you not rather, in looking back upon the plentiful
   harvest of souls reaped in this place, consider that you are in debt to
   God and therefore give to Him the fullest consecration that Believers
   can offer, because of the crowning mercies which we as a Church
   receive? "You crown the year with your goodness."

   Beloved, one more remark here. We are looking forward to a time when
   this world's year shall be crowned with God's goodness in the highest
   and most boundless sense. Centuries are flying and yet the darkness
   lingers--time grows old and yet the idols sit upon their thrones.
   Christ does not yet reign. His unsuffering kingdom has not come. The
   scepters are still in the hands of despots and slaves still fret in
   iron bonds in vain. In vain, O earth, have you expected brighter days,
   for still the thick and heavy night rests over your sons. But the day
   shall come--and the signs of its coming are increasing in their
   brightness--the day shall come when the harvest of the world shall be
   reaped. Christ has not died in vain. He redeemed the world with His
   blood and the whole world He will have.

   From eastern coast to western, Christ must reign. Yet will the Seed of
   the woman chase the powers of darkness back to their evil habitations.
   Yet shall He pierce the crooked serpent and cut leviathan that is in
   the depths of the sea. Yet shall the trumpet ring and the multitudes
   represented in Him when He rose as the great wave-sheaf rise from the
   dead from land and sea. And yet, in the day of His appearing, shall the
   kings of the earth yield up their sovereignty, and all nations shall
   call Him blessed. Tarry awhile, Beloved, wait yet a little season and
   when you shall hear the shout, "Hallelujah, hallelujah, the Lord God
   Omnipotent reigns," then shall you know that He crowns the year with
   His goodness.

   II. But we must leave this point and turn to the next. PATHS OF FATNESS
   SHOULD BE WAYS OF DUTY. "And your paths drop fatness." When the
   conqueror journeys through the nations, his paths drop blood--fire and
   vapor of smoke are in his tracks and tears and groans and sighs attend
   him. But where the Lord journeys, His "paths drop fatness." When the
   kings of old made progress through their dominions, they caused a
   famine wherever they tarried. For the greedy courtiers who swarmed in
   their camp devoured all things like locusts and were as greedily
   ravenous as palmer-worms and caterpillars. But where the great King of
   kings journeys, He enriches the land--His "paths drop fatness."

   By a bold Hebrew metaphor--and the Hebrew poetry certainly seems to be
   the most sublime in its conceptions--the clouds are represented as the
   chariots of God--"He makes the clouds His chariot." And as the Lord
   Jehovah rides upon the heavens in the greatness of His strength and in
   His excellency on the sky, the rains drop down upon the lands and so
   the wheel tracks of Jehovah are marked by the fatness which makes glad
   the earth. Happy, happy are the people who worship such a God, whose
   coming is ever a coming of goodness and of Divine Grace to His
   creatures!

   We see, then, dear Friends, that in Providence, wherever the Lord
   comes, His "paths drop fatness." He may sometimes seem to pinch His
   people and bring them into want, but if there is not a fatness of
   outward good there will be a fatness of inward mercy. Even the trials
   which the Lord scatters like coals of fire in His path, do but burn up
   the weeds and warm the heart of the soil. Do but trust the Lord and
   appeal to Him in all your straits and difficulties and you shall find
   that when He comes forth out of His hiding place for your help, His
   paths shall drop fatness. Your poverty shall be removed and your
   dejection of spirit shall be cheered.

   Beloved, we believe that our text has a fullness of meaning if it is
   viewed in a spiritual sense--"His paths drop fatness." In the use of
   the means, the sinner will find God's paths drop with fatness. Are you
   hungry and thirsty? Does your soul faint within you? Are you longing to
   be satisfied with favor? Then, Sinner, wait upon the Lord and hearken
   diligently unto the message of His Gospel. Be constantly searching the
   Scriptures, or listening to His Truth as it is proclaimed in your ears.
   Especially, Sinner, remember that the ways of the Lord are to be seen
   in the Person of Christ. Go to those hands which are the ways of Divine
   justice. Go to those feet which are the pathways of infinite love.
   Explore that side where deep affection dwells, and you shall find
   fatness of mercy dropping there.

   No sinner ever did come to God and was sent away empty. You may attend
   the means, I grant you, and yet find no comfort, for means are not
   always God's paths. But you cannot come to Christ, you cannot rest in
   Him and be disappointed. Trust in Him at all times and however deep
   your poverty, it shall have a superabundant supply. "His paths drop
   fatness."

   You also who are His people, I know that sometimes your souls grow
   faint. Weary with the wilderness, worn with its cares, torn with its
   briars, you come up to the House of God and oh, if you come there to
   see your Master and not merely to join in the routine of service. If
   you come there seeking after Him and panting for Him as the hart pants
   for the water brooks, you will find that the most common services--poor
   though the minister is, and plain the place and simple the
   people--though the music may have but little charm for the ear of taste
   and the words of the speaker may have none of the trappings of oratory,
   yet sweet to you shall be the worship of God's House, and you shall
   find that "His paths drop fatness."

   So, too, in the use of those precious ordinances--Baptism and the
   Lord's Supper. You that know the Truth and are made free by it, shall
   find that those paths drop fatness. I believe many of you are lean and
   starved because you are not obedient to your Lord's command in Baptism.
   You know what He bids you do, but you stand back from it. You
   comprehend your duty and perhaps you say you are Baptists in principle,
   forgetting that this very principle of yours is that which will condemn
   you unless you carry it out. In keeping that commandment there is a
   great reward. And many besides the Ethiopian noble of queen Candace's
   empire, have gone on their way rejoicing from the baptismal stream.

   It is peculiarly so at the Lord's Table. I would not give up the Lord's
   Supper as a means of Divine Grace for anything that could be devised.
   To the godless it must ever be a condemnation. But to the saint of God
   who comes there, desiring to be fed with the flesh of Christ, it
   becomes a feast, indeed. I do trust, dear Friends, that in a very short
   time we shall celebrate the Lord's Supper every Sunday. I am convicted
   that a weekly celebration is Scriptural and I see more and more the
   need of it. I think it is an ordinance to which we ought not to
   prescribe our own times and our own seasons, where the Word of God is
   so very express and so plain.

   Such was Apostolic custom--search for yourselves and see, indeed, if
   there were no Apostolic precedent. Methinks the sweetness of the
   service and the delightful nature of the ordinance might suggest to
   Christians that it was well to have it frequently. We cannot be
   satisfied once a month with communion with Christ and methinks we
   hardly ought to be satisfied with the sign itself so seldom. God's
   paths drop fatness--happy are they who diligently walk in them.

   Beloved, the Lord has other paths besides those of the open means of
   Grace and these, too, drop fatness. Especially let me mention to you
   the path of prayer. No Believer ever says, "My leanness, my leanness!
   Woe unto me," who is much in the closet. Starving souls generally live
   at a distance from the Mercy Seat. Close access to God in wrestling
   prayer is sure to make the Believer strong--if not happy. The nearest
   place to the gate of Heaven is the Throne of the heavenly Grace. Much
   alone and you will have much assurance--little alone with God, your
   religion will be very shallow. You shall have many doubts and fears and
   but little of the joy of the Lord.

   Let us see to it, Beloved, that since the soul-enriching path of prayer
   is open to the very weakest saint. Since no high attainments are
   required. Since you are not bid to come because you are an advanced
   saint, but freely invited if you are a saint at all, let us see to it,
   I say, that we be often in the way of private devotion. Be much on your
   knees, for so Elijah drew the rain upon famished Israel's fields.

   The like, certainly, I may say of the secret path of communion. Oh, the
   delights which are to be had by that man who has fellowship with
   Christ! Earth has no words which can set forth the holy mirth of the
   soul that leans on Jesus' bosom. Few Christians understand it. They
   live in the lowlands and seldom climb to the top of Nebo. They live
   outside. They come not into the holy place. They take not up the
   privilege of priesthood. At a distance they see the sacrifice, but they
   sit not down with the priest to eat their portion and to enjoy the fat
   of the burnt offering. Brother, Sister, sit always under the shadow of
   Jesus! Come up to that palm tree and take hold of the branches. Let
   your Beloved be unto you as the apple tree among the trees of the
   woods, and you shall find a never-failing fruit which shall ever be
   sweet unto your taste.

   I must not forget that the path offaith, too, is a path that drops
   fatness. It is a strange path--few walk in it, even of professors. But
   they who in temporals and in spirituals have learned to lean on God
   alone, shall find it a path of fatness. As we spoke the other morning
   concerning the cedars up there upon that stormy ridge, unwatered by a
   single river, and yet always green, so shall the Christian be who lives
   alone upon his God. Wait only upon God. Let your expectation be from
   Him. The young lions may lack and suffer hunger, but you shall not want
   any good thing, for the paths of the Lord shall drop fatness for you.

   my dear Hearers, I would to God the Lord would come into the midst of
   our Churches and congregations by His Spirit--then would His path drop
   fatness. We have a multitude of complaints at different times of the
   dullness and lethargy of the Churches. What we need is more of the
   Presence of the Holy Spirit--more of the holy baptism of His sacred
   influences. In a very quaint sermon by Matthew Wilkes I remember he
   said that ministers were like pens--some of them were common goose
   quills, writing very heavily and often requiring sharpening. Others of
   them, he said--the college men--were like steel pens and while they
   could make good fine up strokes, they could not make such heavy down
   strokes as some of the quills could.

   But, he said, neither the one pen nor the other could do anything
   without ink. And therefore, he said, our ministers want more ink. The
   ink is the Holy Spirit--"written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of
   the living God." And so Mr. Wilkes suggested that people, instead of
   finding fault with the minister, would do well to pray, "Lord, give him
   more ink--give him more ink!" There was much in that prayer, for we
   need often to be dipped in that ink, or else we cannot make a mark on
   your hearts. However experienced we may be in saved service, you and I
   cannot serve God effectually, nor see any power resting on our
   ministry, except as we get more of the Spirit of the living God.

   1 would that the Churches laid to heart more and more the real need of
   the times. We have been building hosts of Chapels lately and raising
   thousands of pounds. And because there were revivals and we hear of
   them every now and then, we have been thinking that we are in a good
   state. Now I venture to say that all our denominations are in a bad
   state. There is one which I mention with profound respect, whose
   statistics cause me sincere sorrow. I believe that in that large,
   wealthy and most earnest body of Christians, the Wesleyans, the clear
   increase of all the Wesleyan Chapels in the whole metropolis, including
   a wide district around London, for the whole of this year, is far from
   equal to the annual increase of this one Church.

   If I am not mistaken, the increase throughout the whole of the United
   Kingdom is about four thousand five hundred, being scarcely two per
   cent upon the whole body. If our Baptist denomination could have as
   good and clear statistics, I exceedingly much question whether we
   should be found, taking the whole of us together, to be in a much
   better state. The fact is, denominations, when they are poor and
   despised and live upon God and are all earnest, always increase and
   have many conversions. But we are getting, all of us, so respectable,
   building fine Chapels and looking after schools and all sorts of things
   that the Spirit of God is departing from us--we are losing the Divine
   anointing and the blessed unction--we are congratulating ourselves upon
   an enlightenment which does not exist and upon an advancement that is
   all moonshine.

   Look at the journals for last week and see with horror a picture of
   superstition worthy of the dark ages exhibited in a country village,
   where, to my knowledge, there is both an Independent and Baptist Chapel
   and yet the people believe in witchcraft still! Is this, is this the
   effect of religion? Why, our places of worship do not operate as they
   should upon the people. They are, in most places, mere clubs where good
   people spend their Sundays, but the outlying mass is not touched. To a
   great extent we have lost the old fire, the Divine enthusiasm, the
   Pentecostal furor, that sacred flame of the first Apostles! We need all
   these, by God's Grace, if ever we are to startle a dying world.

   And in this place, where God has favored us with much of His Presence,
   we are getting into very much the same condition. How many of you who
   once were earnest are now as cold as slabs of ice! Some of you do
   hardly anything for my Lord and Master. Converted, I trust, you
   are--but where is your first love? Where is the love of your espousals
   which made some of you talk of Jesus by day and dream of Him by night?
   O for a return to God's paths--O for a revival once again in the midst
   of the Churches. Ten years ago we could speak honestly that the
   Churches were almost dead, but I think they are worse now, because they
   have cherished the idea that they are not so dead as they were!

   We are as bad as ever--with a name to live--whereas we are dead. O that
   some trumpet voice could wake our sleeping Churches once again! Can you
   live without souls saved? If you can, I cannot. Can you live without
   London being enlightened with the light of God? If you can so live, I
   pray my Master let me die. Can you bear to fight and win no victories?
   To sow and reap no harvests? Brethren, if you are right, you cannot
   endure it, but you must endure it till the Lord comes forth. Let us
   pray, therefore, with might and main, with a holy violence which will
   take no denial! Let us pray the Lord to come forth out of His hiding
   place, for His "paths drop fatness," and there is fatness to be found
   nowhere else besides.

   III. And now I close. The whole subject seems to give us one or two
   suggestions as to matters of duty. "You crown the year with Your
   goodness." One suggestion is this--some of you in this house are
   strangers to God, you have been living as His enemies and you will
   probably die so. But what a blessing it would be if a part of the crown
   of this year should be your conversion! "The harvest is past and the
   summer is ended and you are not saved." But oh, what a joy, if this
   very day you should turn unto God and live! Remember, the way of
   salvation was freely proclaimed last Sunday morning, it runs in this
   style--"This is the Commandment, that you believe on Jesus Christ whom
   He has sent."

   Soul, if this day you trust in Christ, it shall be your spiritual
   birthday, it shall be unto you the beginning of day! Emancipated from
   your chains, delivered from the darkness of the valley of the shadow of
   death, you shall be the Lord's free man. What do you say? O that the
   Spirit of God would bring you this day to turn unto Him with full
   purpose of heart!

   Another suggestion. Would not the Lord crown this year with His
   goodness if He would move some of you to do more for Him than you have
   ever done before? Cannot you think of some new thing that you have
   forgotten, but which is in the power of your hands? Can you not do it
   for Christ today?--some fresh soul you have never conversed with--some
   fresh means of usefulness you have never attempted?

   And lastly, would not it be well for us if the Lord would crown this
   year with His goodness by making us begin from this day to be more
   prayerful? Let our Prayer Meetings have more at them and let everyone
   in his closet pray more for the preacher, pray more for the Church. Let
   us, everyone of us, give our hearts anew to Christ. What do you say
   today, to renew your consecration vow? Let us say to Him, "Here, Lord,
   I give myself away to You once more. You have bought me with Your
   blood, accept me again. From this good hour I will begin a new life for
   a second time if Your Spirit is with me. Help me, Lord, for Jesus
   Christ's sake." Amen.

                The Queen Of The South, Or The Earnest Enquirer

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 4, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this
   generation and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts
   of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than
   Solomon is here." Matthew 12:42.

   OUR Savior, in this chapter, administered a rebuke to two sorts of
   people. He reproved those who hear the Gospel, but who are not brought
   to humiliation and repentance. He rebuked them by the example of the
   Ninevites, who, having but one short and terrible warning from the
   Prophet Jonah, clothed themselves in sackcloth, turned unto God in
   penitence and so preserved their city. He then rebukes another
   class--those who have not curiosity enough to care to hear the Gospel,
   or who, if they hear it, give it no attention, as though it were not
   worthy of human thought.

   First, He rebukes those who hear and despise the Word and then those
   who are of so stolid a heart as to refuse to give it an honest and
   candid hearing. These are shamed by the example of this Queen of the
   South, who came from the uttermost parts of the earth, enticed by fame
   to listen to the wisdom of King Solomon. He declares that her hallowed
   curiosity which led her to journey so far to profit by the wisdom of a
   man, will, in the day ofjudgment, condemn us, if we refuse to hear the
   voice of the Son of God, and are not moved to enquire concerning the
   heavenly wisdom which He reveals.

   Will you kindly open your Bibles at the tenth chapter of the First of
   Kings, for I shall have to constantly refer to the historical narrative
   in order to bring out in full relief the conduct of the ancient queen.
   O that the Spirit of God may convince some of you of sin, by the
   example of that wise-hearted woman!

   The three points we shall consider this morning, with regard to the
   Queen of Sheba, are these--first, let us commend her for the possession
   of an enquiring spirit. Then let us observe how she conducted her
   enquiry. And, in closing, let us remark the result of an enquiry so
   well conducted.

   I. First LET US COMMEND HER FOR HER ENQUIRING SPIRIT. In this point she
   will rise up in judgment against many here present. She was a queen.
   Queens have many cares, multitudes of occupations and engagements, but
   she neither considered it beneath her dignity to search into the wisdom
   of Solomon, nor a waste of valuable time to journey to his dominions.
   How many offer the vain excuse that they cannot give due attention to
   the religion of Jesus Christ for want of time? They have a large
   family, or a very difficult business to manage.

   This woman rebukes such, for she left her kingdom and threw off the
   cares of State to take a long journey that she might listen to the
   royal sage. How much rather ought men to be willing, if it were
   absolutely necessary, (and I believe it never is), to neglect their
   business for a season, that they might find out the way of salvation
   for their souls? "What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world
   and lose his own soul?" And, on the other hand, of what account would
   be his loss, though he should lose his all, if he did but find his soul
   and were saved at the last? You cannot say, any of you, that you have
   an excuse in the shortness of your time, or in the difficulties of your
   position. If the Queen of the South can come to Solomon, you also can
   consider the teaching of Christ.

   Her royal court was, doubtless, already stored with wisdom. The princes
   of the eastern realms were always careful to gather to themselves a
   band of wise men who found in their patronage both subsistence and
   honor. In the court of so great a lover of learning as was the Queen of
   Sheba, there would certainly be a little congress of magi and wise
   men--and yet she was not content with what she knew already--she was
   determined to search after this Divine wisdom, of which she had heard
   the fame. In this she rebukes those of you who think you know
   enough--who suppose that your own home-spun intelligence will suffice,
   without sitting at the feet of Jesus.

   If you dream that human wisdom can be a sufficient light without
   receiving the brighter beams of Revelation. If you say, "These things
   are for the unintelligent and for the poor, we will not listen to
   them," this queen, whose court was full of wisdom, and yet who leaves
   it all to find the wisdom which God had given to Solomon, rebukes you.
   The wisdom of Jesus Christ as much surpasses all human knowledge as the
   sun outshines a candle. Comparison there can be none, contrast there is
   much. He who will not come to the Fountain which brims with wisdom, but
   trusts to his own leaking cisterns, shall wake up too late to find
   himself a fool.

   Consider, too, that the queen came from a very great distance to hear
   the wisdom of Solomon. The journey from Arabia Felix, or from
   Abyssinia, whichever the country may have been, was a long and
   dangerous one--a much more serious matter than it would be in these
   times. And performed by the slow process of traveling by camel, the
   journey must have occupied a very long season. Coming, as Matthew says,
   "from the uttermost parts of the earth," there were doubtless mountains
   to be climbed, if not seas to be navigated and deserts to be crossed.

   But none of these difficulties could keep her back. She hears of wisdom
   and wisdom she will have. So she boldly ventures upon the journey with
   her numerous train, no matter how far she may have to travel. Very many
   have the Gospel brought to their doors and yet will not leave their
   chimney corners to listen to it. We have thousands in London who have
   but to walk across the street and hear the Word and yet they lie about
   at home. And there are hundreds of others who when they do come, are
   inattentive under the ministry, or, if they listen, pay no more real
   attention to it than though it were some old worn-out story which it is
   a respectable custom to hear, but which could not possibly be of any
   service to them.

   The Queen of Sheba, toiling across the desert, of the weaker sex though
   she was, shall rise up in judgment against those who neglect the great
   salvation and treat the Savior as though it were nothing to them that
   Jesus should die.

   Do not forget, too, that this woman was a foreigner to Solomon and that
   she already had a religion--probably one of the older forms of
   idolatry--perhaps the Sabean worship of the sun. Now, many persons
   argue in these times, "Would you have me change my religion?" It is
   supposed to be an impertinence to imagine that a Roman Catholic could
   give any considerations to the claims of the religion of Free Grace. Or
   that men belonging to another Church should listen with anything like
   candid attention to a doctrine at variance with that which they have
   heard from their youth. "Would you have me change my religion?"

   Yes, that I would, if your religion is false. If your religion has not
   changed you, I would that you would change your religion--for a
   religion which does not renew a man's character and make him
   holy--which does not change his confidence and make him rest upon
   Christ--a religion which does not make altogether a new man of him,
   from top to bottom, is a religion of no value and the sooner he gives
   it up the better. Because my mother or my grandmother happened to be
   blind, am I to be blind, too, if there is sight to be had? Suppose they
   dragged a heavy chain behind them all their days, am I to drag the
   same, because, indeed, I sprang of their loins?

   Hereditary godliness, if it is not personal godliness, is a thing of
   small value. But hereditary ungodliness is a most damnable
   heritage--get rid of it, I pray you. Remember, to your own master you
   stand or fall on your own account. Each soul enters through the gate of
   life alone. And through the iron gate of death it departs alone. Every
   man should search in solitary earnestness, apart from all the rest of
   the world, to know what the Truth of God is, and knowing it, it is his
   to come out alone on the Lord's side. Yes, we would have you give
   attention to the things of God, even though you should have been
   brought up in other customs and should have honestly espoused another
   form of religion. Prove the spirits whether they are of God. If your
   soul has been deceived, there is yet time to be set right. God help
   you, that you may find out the Truth.

   It is worthy of observation that this woman coming from afar, made a
   journey which was very expensive. She came with a great train of camels
   bearing spices and very much good and precious stones. She looked upon
   the treasures of her kingdom as only valuable because they would admit
   her into the presence of the keeper of the storehouse of wisdom. Now,
   our Lord Jesus Christ asks nothing of men except their hearts. He does
   not sell the Truth to any of them, but gives it freely without money
   and without price. And what if men will not have it, if they refuse to
   lend their ears and to give their thoughts to Divine things, shall they
   not be utterly inexcusable when this heathen queen shall rise up and
   shall declare that she gave her rubies and her pearls, her spices and
   her camels to King Solomon, that she might learn his human wisdom?

   O Sirs, should we lose the light of our eyes and the use of our limbs,
   yet were it better to enter into life blind and lame, than having those
   eyes and limbs to be cast into Hell fire. "Skin for skin, yes, all that
   a man has will he give for his life." And if he would give all that for
   his temporal life, oh, how much more costly is the spiritual life and
   how cheap were the price if he could give a thousand martyrdoms to
   redeem his soul? But nothing of this kind is asked--the Gospel presents
   freely to every needy soul just that which he requires. It cries--"He
   that has no money, let him come, buy wine and milk without money and
   without price." O my dear Hearers, if you have refused the invitation
   of Christ's Gospel, well may you tremble at the thought that the Queen
   of Sheba shall rise up in judgment against you!

   Note that this queen had received no invitation. King Solomon never
   bade her come. She came unsought for, unexpected. You have been bid to
   come--hundreds of times in this House of Prayer has the voice been
   heard crying, "The Spirit and the Bride say, Come." Even you who are
   strangers to this House, in every corner of the streets of this city
   you may hear the invitation of Christ. The Bible, which is God's
   written invitation, is in all your houses and you may search it if you
   will. Therefore, if you, followed with invitations and urged with line
   upon line and precept upon precept, will not come when God's Providence
   brings the Gospel to your very gates, if you will not seek King Jesus,
   then shall you be condemned indeed, by this Queen of Sheba.

   Little had she ever heard of Solomon, remember that--nothing but a
   rumor of his fame. Some of his ships which went to Tarshish for gold
   had probably been driven by stress of weather to the Abyssinian coast,
   or possibly they may have gone the way from the head of the Red Sea
   round to the Indies, where probably Tarshish was situated. And so they
   made a common practice of calling at one of the ports of Southern
   Arabia or Abyssinia. From these sailors her subjects had heard strange
   stories of the mighty king. They had heard of his throne of gold and
   ivory, of the glory of his army and the multitude of his chariots.
   Above all, they had heard something concerning the temple and his God.

   She, influenced merely by rumor, comes that distance. Well, but we have
   a sure word of testimony brought to us by Prophets and priests
   innumerable. We have it here in this Book, written by the Divine finger
   and stamped with the eternal seal. We, ourselves, know that there is
   wisdom in Christ, our own consciences tell us that He is no
   deceiver--that His Gospel is most true and precious. What fools are we,
   what fools twice told, if, with this certainty of gaining so much, we
   yet shrink from the glorious adventure and will not go to Him who will
   give us wisdom and eternal life!

   One might continue thus to show the excellence of this woman's
   enquiring spirit, but we have only space to notice that the object
   which she journeyed after was vastly inferior to that which is proposed
   to our enquiry. We bid the careless soul think himself of the Son of
   God. She went that distance to see a son of man, a mere man, who, with
   all his wisdom was a fool. She journeyed all that way to see one who
   was wise himself, but who had power to impart but a very small portion
   of his wisdom. Whereas we invite the sinner to come to one who is made
   of God unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctifi-cation and redemption.
   We tell him that all Christ has He is ready to bestow, that His
   abundance is only an abundance for others, and His fullness is that out
   of which all of us have received.

   She went to hear a man who had wisdom--we bid you come to one who is
   Wisdom--Wisdom itself consolidated. Talk you of the royalty of Solomon?
   We invite you to a greater king than he, who is Lord of Heaven and
   earth, and Hell. Speak you of his riches?--we tell you of One who has
   unspeakable riches of Divine Grace and glory. True, she might gain by
   the journey, it was but a probability--but whoever comes to Christ
   becomes rich to all the intents of bliss. No soul ever trafficked with
   our Solomon without being at once enriched. If he came empty-handed,
   poor, feeble, naked and sinful to accept from our Jesus His great
   salvation, he was never sent away empty. You that despise the Gospel,
   who go in and out of the place of worship as those doors turn upon
   their hinges, take heed, lest this Queen of the South rise up in
   judgment against you to condemn you.

   II. Let us observe to this queen's worthy commendation, HOW SHE
   CONDUCTED THE ENQUIRY. Observe that she did it in person. She did not
   send an ambassador to go and search into the matter, but personally and
   on her own account, she set out to see Solomon himself. Was it not the
   Duke of Wellington who, on one occasion rebuked one of his officers for
   railing against the Bible, by asking him if he had ever read it and
   when the other frankly confessed he had not, showed him how base it was
   to find fault with that which he did not understand?

   Most persons who object to the religion of Christ have never
   investigated it. This I am sure of, no man has ever had an intelligent
   idea of the Person of the Savior, of the graciousness of His work, who
   ever could think or speak against Him afterward. Watts is correct when
   he says--

   "His worth, if all the nations Anew, Sure the whole world would love
   Him, too."

   To know, to comprehend the Character and office and work of Jesus
   Christ is the road to obtaining an earnest faith in Him and love
   towards Him.

   Nor can I think that any man did ever honestly enquire at the hand of
   Christ what that gracious mystery is that He came to teach, without
   receiving from Him a gracious smile of encouragement. Whosoever will be
   converted let him become as a little child. And becoming as a little
   child and sitting at the feet of Jesus, he shall get the treatment of
   all other little children--he shall hear the Master say, "Of such is
   the kingdom of Heaven." The honest seeker after the Lord Jesus, who
   personally draws near in earnest prayer and humble entreaty, shall find
   peace and good.

   Remark, in the next place, that the queen went first of all to Solomon.
   She went and she went to Solomon. The way to learn the faith of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, is to go to Him. Some people want to begin at the
   doctrine of election and so they stumble at the stumbling stone. Some
   must learn, first of all, where predestination meets free will--and if
   they cannot see that, they turn aside with disgust. Others would remove
   the difficulties of the Pentateuch, or solve the problems of geology.
   But if they were wise, they would go at once to the Master Himself. I
   find not that she enquired of the butlers, of Adoniram who was over the
   tribute, or even of the king's mighty men, the Cherethites and
   Pelethites, but she sought Solomon.

   From his own lips, from him immediately and directly she will get the
   resolution of her knotty questions and understand his wisdom. Go to
   God, poor Soul, in Christ Jesus. Straightforward makes the best runner.
   There are things which will puzzle you, there are depths too deep for
   you, but go to God in Christ Jesus hanging upon yonder Cross. Reflect
   upon the mystery of His great Atonement and yield your faith up to
   it--and you shall then begin to understand the wisdom of our mighty
   Solomon. If you cannot comprehend all teaching, may the Spirit enable
   you to grasp His Person and that is enough.

   When she had obtained an audience of the king, observe what she
   did--"She told him all that was in her heart." This is the way to know
   the Lord--tell Him all that is in your heart. Your doubts, your fears,
   your hardness of heart and impenitence--confess the whole. That man is
   near to knowing Christ who begins to know himself. And he who will
   confess as much as he knows of his own corruption, depravity,
   sinfulness, necessities and inabilities, shall soon have a gracious
   answer of peace.

   Tarry not because your heart is vile, it is viler than you think it
   is--but go with it just as it is and tell Jesus all. Are you like the
   woman with the issue of blood? I pray you tell Him all the truth and He
   will say, "Your faith has made you whole." Why do you try to hide
   anything from Omniscience? He knows the corners of your heart, the deep
   places and the dark places there are in His hands. If you should tell
   Him He will know no more! Why then do you hesitate? Tear off the veil
   from your heart and then you shall find mercy.

   Moreover, she proposed to Solomon her hard questions. I do not know
   what they were, and I do not particularly care. The Jewish rabbis have
   invented a few very stupid ones, which they say were her hard
   questions. But I know if you come to our Solomon, to Christ, these will
   be your hard questions, "My Lord, how can mercy and justice kiss each
   other? How can God forgive sin and yet punish it?" Jesus will point you
   to His wounded hands and feet, He will tell you of His great Atonement,
   how by a substitution God is dreadful in His justice and boundless in
   His love. Then you will put to Him the question, "How can a sinful
   creature be accepted in the sight of a holy God?"

   He will tell you of His righteousness and you will see how, covered
   with the imputed righteousness of the Redeemer, a sinful soul is as
   acceptable before the Lord as though it had never offended. You will
   say to Him, "Can you tell me, Jesus, how it is that a weak soul with no
   power shall yet be able to fight with the devil and overcome the world,
   the flesh and Satan?" And Jesus will answer, "My Grace is sufficient
   for you. My strength shall be perfect in your weakness," and so, all
   the knotty questions will be answered. No, if you are puzzled about
   electing love, or anything else in Scripture, if you will tell Him all
   that is in your heart and be willing to learn from Him, there is no
   hard question which your soul can suggest, but Jesus Christ will answer
   it.

   This good woman, in pursuing her enquiry, listened carefully to what
   Solomon told her. It is said he answered all her questions. Oh, there
   is a blessed communion between Christ and a trembling soul. If you will
   tell Him all your failings, He will tell you all His merit. If you will
   tell Him your weakness, He will tell you all His strength. If you will
   tell Him your distance from God, He will tell you His nearness to God.
   If you will show Him how hard your heart is, He will tell you how His
   heart was broken that you might live. Be not afraid, only make a clear
   revelation to Him and trust in Him and He will make a sweet Revelation
   to you.

   When she had gone thus far, she went on to notice everything in
   connection with Solomon. The Queen of Sheba saw "the wisdom of Solomon.
   And the house that he had built." She did not notice the house first,
   you see, she went to Solomon first. A seeking soul goes to Christ
   first, tells Him her heart, learns the love of Jesus, and then
   afterward sets to work to learn everything else about Jesus. Now, it is
   very pleasant to a seeking soul to find out the house which Christ has
   built--His glorious Church built of costly stones purchased by His own
   blood. It is built of great stones--great sinners made into great
   trophies of His love--made of hewn stones, stones hewn out of the
   quarry of sin, cut and shaped by His own Grace to lie in our
   predestined niche forever.

   It is a glorious thing to understand Christ's Church--to know the
   foundations of it--laid in the Covenant of Grace. The pinnacles of it
   towering to the highest Heaven. The great Master who reigns in it,
   Jesus Christ, who is Head over all things to His Church--her glorious
   windows letting in light through the ordinances and the preaching of
   the Word-- her doors that admit in the saints--her gates of brass and
   bars of steel shutting out the devils of Hell and all the thieves and
   robbers that would break in. There is enough to occupy a soul for years
   in understanding the house which Jesus has built.

   Then she observed "the meat of his table." "For My flesh is meat,
   indeed, and My blood is drink, indeed." Oh, how ravishing to a poor
   soul to discover that Christ, who is our life, is also the staff of
   life--"I am that living bread. Your fathers did eat manna in the
   wilderness and are dead. He that eats of the bread that I shall give
   him, shall never hunger and shall never thirst." Oh, the meat of His
   table! What luxuries! Men, indeed, did eat angels' food, but--

   "Never did angels taste above, Redeeming Grace and dying love." What
   sweet food--what satisfying food--what abundant food--what constant
   provisions--what rare provisions, too!

   In the same book of Kings you will find how many fallow deer and
   roebucks and bushels of fine corn and fat oxen and birds King Solomon
   had to put upon his table every day. But my Lord and Master places the
   infinite treasures of His own Person upon His table every day and sends
   out the summons to His children--"All things are ready. My oxen and
   fat-lings are killed. Come you to the supper." Happy soul that knows
   concerning the meat of His table!

   She looked next to "the sitting of his servants." See how we sit to
   learn at the feet of Jesus--how we sit to commune at the feet of Jesus,
   as Mary did--no, how some of the servants today are sitting up yonder
   in glory--no, all of them are there--for He has raised us up together
   and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Oh, if the
   soul ever comes to know what "sitting in heavenly places" means--what
   being in Heaven means while we are on earth--then the sitting of the
   servants will be a marvel!

   And the next were "his ministers." Well, and Christ has ministers
   everywhere. Streams and tempests are His servants--clouds and darkness
   are His slaves. "Remember that Omnipotence has servants everywhere."
   Think of His ministers that are in Heaven--"He makes His angels
   spirits, His ministers a flame of fire." And then there are His
   ministers here on earth, who may be called His cupbearers. There are
   those whom He has called out from among men and gifted to preach the
   Word, who take the cup of salvation in their hands and bear it to
   fainting souls, and in the name of Jesus act as His butlers. For so it
   is in the margin--like good stewards bringing out of His treasury
   things new and old.

   There is a near connection between faithful ministers and Christ. For
   when John saw Christ, He walked among the candlesticks--that is, in the
   Churches. But He had the stars in His right hand. So are His ministers
   ever there, and thus their being taught and owned of the Lord is a
   subject worthy of wonder. Happy soul that has learned to see the beauty
   of Christ in His ministers and cupbearers. And their apparel--ah, here
   is a subject! Why, this is the apparel of all His saints--the white
   linen of the righteousness of Christ.

   And then those priestly garments with which He girds His people, so
   that they, as the high priest of old, make music as they walk, while
   the sweet bells of faith and the pomegranates of good works sweetly
   smite together and give forth golden notes. "Her clothing shall be of
   worked gold," says the sweet Psalmist, when he sings of the Church.
   "She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework." Now such
   is the apparel of every child of God, and it is little wonder if an
   enquiring soul like the Queen of Sheba should be made to marvel at it.

   There remained one thing more--the most wonderful of all--it was "his
   ascent to the house of the Lord," the gigantic viaduct from the palace
   to the temple. She looked at that. "Why," she said, "I never thought
   that such a valley could be bridged, I never dreamed that ever two such
   mountains as those, so wide apart, could be brought so close together."
   As she saw the king and his royal train walk along the viaduct, her
   soul was utterly astonished. Methinks I see my King's ascent to the
   House of the Lord. There was the mountain of our Fall and ruin, and
   yonder the great mountain of God's love and a valley of Divine justice
   went between. Jesus Christ has built a noble viaduct. He first trod it
   Himself, opening for us a new and living way of access between man and
   God. He Himself ascends up on high, with trumpets' joyful sounds, and
   opens the gate of Heaven to all Believers, by thus making an ascent to
   the House of the Lord.

   You and I may ascend unto His holy hill, may climb to the seventh
   Heaven and sit down with Christ upon His Throne, even as He has
   overcome and has sat down with the Father upon His Throne. Oh, glorious
   ascent to the House of the Lord! I think the Septuagint version reads
   it, "And his thank-offerings in the House of the Lord." Well, that is
   the same thing, because our Savior's sacrifice is the living way by
   which we ascend into the holy hill of the Lord. If nothing else can
   fill one with wonder, we must be amazed even in eternity, to think of
   His matchless offering. He gave His body to be wrung with anguish and
   His soul to be torn with grief--"who, though He was rich, for our sakes
   became poor, that we through His poverty might be made rich." The
   first-born sons of light desire in vain to know the depth of this love,
   they cannot reach the mystery, the length and height of this glorious
   ascent to the House of the Lord.

   Do note that she did not begin with all this. You see she began with
   Solomon. She did not begin with the ascent to the House of the Lord,
   much less with the ministers and butlers--she began with the king
   himself. Sinner, begin with Jesus. Let your first enquiry be, "Is there
   balm in Gilead? Is there a physician there?" Let your cry be that of
   the startled jailer, "What must I do to be saved?" Like he, obey the
   Apostolic injunction, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
   be saved."

   May the Holy Spirit bring you to this, and then afterward He shall lead
   you into all the Truth of God. He shall take the keys and open room
   after room and cabinet after cabinet, and casket after casket, till He
   has shown you all the crown jewels and revealed to you the regalia of
   the King of kings, and let you into the secret of the heart of God in
   Christ Jesus your Lord. Only be willing, like the Queen of Sheba, to
   search. For, if not, her wisdom in her enquiry shall rise up in
   judgment against you to condemn you.

   III. And now, thirdly, let us note THE RESULT OF OUR ENQUIRY. The first
   result was a confession of faith. "It was a true report that I heard in
   my own land, of your acts and of your wisdom." She did not hold her
   tongue and go slinking back to Abyssinia without a single word of
   confession--but having tested and being convicted--she could not refuse
   giving her testimony to the truth of the rumor.

   Soul, if you shall come to Jesus Christ and try Him, when you shall
   have joy and peace in believing, you will say it was a true report.
   Why, I have seen hundreds and thousands who have given their hearts to
   Jesus, but I never did see one that said he was disappointed in it,
   never met with one who said Jesus Christ was less than He was declared
   to be. I remember when first these eyes beheld Him, when the burden
   slipped from off my heavy-laden shoulders, and I was free. Why, I
   thought this, that all the preachers I had ever heard had not half
   preached, they had not half told the beauty of my Lord and Master. So
   good! So generous! So gracious! So willing to forgive! It seemed to me
   as if they had almost slandered Him.

   They painted His likeness, doubtless, as well as they could, but it was
   a mere smudge compared with the matchless beauties of His face. You
   that have ever seen Him will say the same. I go back many a time to my
   home, mourning that I cannot preach my Master even as I, myself, know
   Him--and what I know of Him is so little compared with the
   match-lessness of His Grace. Would that I knew Him more and that I
   could explain it better! Instead of thinking that your trust in Christ
   has been an unprofitable speculation, you will exclaim with joy, "The
   half has not been told me." She expressed, then, her faith in Solomon.
   And oh, if you have any faith and have found Him to be true, out with
   it! Be not secret Believers, but stand forward for your Lord and
   Master.

   Next she made a confession of her unbelief. "Howbeit I believed not the
   words until I came and my eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was
   not told me: your wisdom and prosperity exceeds the fame which I
   heard." "I did not believe it," said she, "until I came and saw." It is
   the way with you. We have to cry, "Who has believed our report?" Men
   will not readily believe our report, but when you once come and try it,
   you will think, "How could I have doubted, how could I ever have been
   unbelieving?" God forgives your unbelief, but you will never forgive
   yourselves. You will say, me-thinks, even in Heaven, "How could I have
   been so foolish as to doubt the message which came to me from the Most
   High." Does not faith always lead to a sense of unbelief? And when most
   of all we have learned not to stagger, is it not then we discover more
   and more how vile a thing it is to doubt the Word of the Most High?

   Having done this, she declared that her anticipations were exceeded.
   Upon that we will say no more and only add that next she spoke a kind
   word for his servants--"Happy are your men, happy are these, your
   servants, which stand continually before you and that hear your
   wisdom." Why she thought that every little page in Solomon's court was
   more honored than she was! She was a queen, but then she was a queen of
   a distant land and so she seems to have drunk in the spirit of David
   when he said, "I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than
   dwell in the tents of wickedness." She seemed almost willing to give up
   Sheba and all its spices and its gold, if she might but be a maid of
   honor in the court of king Solomon!

   I am sure that is the way with any of us who have ever been to Jesus.
   How we love His people! You are no lover of Christ if you do not love
   His children. As soon as ever the heart is given to the Master of the
   house, it is given to the children of the house. Love Christ and you
   will soon love all that love Him. Do you not, dear Friends, esteem the
   people of God to be the excellent of the earth? Are they not all your
   delight? Time was, if they dropped into your house, you looked at the
   clock for fear they should talk too long upon religious subjects. But
   now, if they will but talk of your Master, they may stop all night if
   they like. Now you feel it so pleasant to speak of His name, that if
   you meet a Christian you feel a love to him--and if he is despised and
   his character is slandered, you feel you must stand up for him.

   I know some of you wish you could always be in God's House. There are
   some children of God in this place who are here whenever the door is
   opened. They wish there were seven Sundays in the week that they could
   always sit and hear the name of Jesus. They delight to see His minister
   and rejoice that sometimes the cupbearer brings forth the spiced wine
   of the Lord's pomegranate and bids His children drink of it even to the
   full.

   This good woman next blessed Solomon's God in these beautiful
   words--"Blessed be the Lord your God, which delights in you, to set you
   on the throne of Israel: because the Lord loved Israel forever,
   therefore made He you king to do judgment and justice." She blessed his
   God. So we are drawn to a sweet union of heart to God through a
   knowledge of Christ, and as our love flows downward from Christ to His
   people, so it goes upward from Christ to His Father.

   You will notice that she avowed her love to Him because of His
   everlasting love to His people. Notice she does not say anything about
   Abyssinia--she is thinking about Israel, about the chosen. She sees
   distinguishing, discriminating, electing love--and she perceives the
   everlastingness of this love--"Because He loved Israel forever,
   therefore He has made you king." O Brothers and Sisters, may we so grow
   in Divine Grace that we may love the Father because He has made Christ
   to be the Anointed--because He loved His Church and gave His Son for
   it, that He might cleanse it from all sin by His own precious blood!

   Once more, she then did what was the best proof of her truthfulness,
   she gave to Solomon of her treasures--"She gave the king a hundred and
   twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store and precious
   stones there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the
   Queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon." And so souls that know the beauty
   of Christ give Him all they have. There are no such spices as those
   which come from newly-converted souls. Nothing gives Christ greater
   delight than the love of His people. We think our love to be a very
   poor and common thing, but He does not think so--He has set such a
   store by us that He gave His heart's blood to redeem us.

   And now He looks upon us as being worth the price He paid. He never
   will think that He had a bad bargain of it and so He looks upon every
   grain of our love as being even choicer spices than archangels before
   the Throne can render to Him in their songs. What are we doing for
   Christ? Are we bringing Him our talents of gold? Perhaps you have not
   one hundred and twenty, but if you have one, bring that.

   You have not very much spices, but bring what you have--your silent,
   earnest prayers, your holy, consistent life, the words you sometimes
   speak for Christ, the training up of your children, the feeding of His
   poor, the clothing of the naked, the visitation of the sick and those
   in prison, the comforting of His mourners, the winning of His
   wanderers, the restoring of His backsliders, the saving of His
   blood-bought souls--all these shall be like camels laden with
   spices--an acceptable gift to the Most High.

   When she had done this, Solomon made her a present of his royal bounty.
   She lost nothing. She gave all she had and then Solomon gave her quite
   as much again, for I will be bound to say King Solomon would not be
   outdone in generosity, such a noble-hearted prince as he and so rich. I
   tell you, Jesus Christ will never be in your debt. Oh, it is a great
   gain to give to Christ. We give Him pence and He gives us pounds. We
   give Him years of labor and He gives us an eternity of rest. We give
   Him days of patient endurance and He gives us ages of joyous honor. We
   give Him a little suffering and He gives us great rewards.

   "I reckon that the sufferings of this present life are not worthy to be
   compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us." Besides what He
   gives us in the Covenant of Grace, you note, He does for us what
   Solomon did for her, He gives us all that is in our heart, all that we
   can desire. What a King is our Savior who will not let His people have
   one ungrati-fied wish, if that wish is a good one! Knock and the gate
   shall open. "Open your mouth wide and I will fill it," says the Lord.
   "According to your faith so be it done unto you." "Whatsoever you ask
   in prayer believe that you have it and you shall have it." What
   precious promises! And all these are given to those who come with a
   humble enquiry, willing to get Christ first and then to get the rest
   afterward.

   Well, Beloved, we are told that this Queen went home to her nation and
   tradition says that she was the means ofproselytizing the Abyssinian
   people. I do not know whether that was true or not. It is remarkable
   that in the Apostles' days, there should have been an eunuch, a man of
   great authority under Candace, Queen of Ethiopia. It looks as if there
   may have lingered something of the Divine light in this woman's
   dominions right on to the day of the Savior, so that there was found
   another queen there at that time and another noble personage who would
   come all that distance to Jerusalem to worship.

   Well, whether she did or not, I know what you ought to do. If you have
   come to King Solomon and searched and found for yourselves, go and
   spread the fame of it. Talk about Him everywhere. It was the fame of
   Him that first brought you--increase that fame and others will come.
   Talk of Him when you stay in your house and when you go by the way,
   when you sit down and when you rise up. Count no place to be an unfit
   place to talk of Jesus. Bear Him in your bosom in your business. Carry
   Him in your heart in your pleasures. Wear His name as a frontlet
   between your eyes and write it on the doorposts of your house--for He
   is worthy for Whom you shall do this.

   His name shall be remembered as long as the sun, and men shall be
   blessed in Him--yes, all men shall call Him blessed, all kings shall
   fall down before Him. The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts,
   the whole earth shall be filled with His glory. Amen and amen! The
   prayers of David, the son of Jesse, were ended. And so shall ours be,
   too, when that consummation shall have really taken place.

               The Mighty Power Which Creates And Sustains Faith

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 11, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The exceeding greatness of His power to us-ward who believe, according
   to the working of His mighty power, which He worked in Christ, when He
   raised Him from the dead and set Him at His own right hand in the hea
   venly places, far above all principality and power and might and
   dominion and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also
   in that which is to come. And has put all things under His feet and
   gave Him to be the head over all things to the Church, which is His
   body, the fullness of Him that fills all in all." Ephesians 1:19-23.

   To believe on the Lord Jesus Christ with all our heart is one of the
   simplest things imaginable. To trust Christ, to depend upon His power
   and faithfulness is such a childlike act that one sees no extraordinary
   difficulty in it. Yet, to bring the human mind to exercise simple faith
   in Jesus is a work of the most astounding power. To bring down the
   pride of man, to subjugate his will and to captivate his passions so
   that he shall cheerfully accept that which God presents to him in the
   Person of Christ Jesus, is a labor worthy of God.

   How strangely vile are they who cannot be brought to know their own
   mercies, except by an Omnipotent power! The blessed Spirit of God is
   always the secret Author of faith. It is not of ourselves, it is the
   gift of God. Our text twice over uses the strongest words which could
   be employed to set forth the Almighty power exhibited in bringing a
   soul to believe in Jesus and in bringing that believing soul onward
   till it ascends to Heaven. You will carefully notice we have first of
   all this expression, "The exceeding greatness of His power." And then
   we have on the other side of the word "Believe," lest it should escape
   from the sacred barrier, these words, "According to the working of His
   mighty power."

   Now, the first expression is a very amazing one. It might be read
   thus--"The superexcellent, sublime, overcoming, or triumphing greatness
   of His power." And the other is even more singular--it is a Hebrew mode
   of speech forced to do duty in the Greek tongue--"The effectual working
   of the might of His strength." Or, "The energy of the force of His
   power," or some such strong expression as that. As if the Apostle was
   not content to say, "You believe through the power of God," nor
   "through the greatness of that power," but "through the exceeding
   greatness of His power."

   And not satisfied with declaring that the salvation of man is the fruit
   of God's might, he must needs put it, His mighty power--no, as if that
   were not enough, he writes the energy, the efficacious activity of the
   power of that might. No amount of straining at the passage can ever get
   rid of the grand doctrine which it contains, namely, that the bringing
   of a soul to simple faith in Jesus and the maintenance of that soul in
   the life of faith displays an exercise of Omnipotence such as God alone
   could put forth.

   Nor need we, dear Friends, be at all surprised at this, when we
   recollect what the work of salvation really is. Be it never forgotten
   by us that the salvation of a soul is a creation. Now, no man has ever
   been able to create a fly, nor even a single molecule of matter. Man
   knows how to fashion created substance into many forms. But to create
   the minutest atom is utterly beyond his might. Jehovah alone creates.
   "All things were created by Him and for Him." No human or angelic power
   can intrude upon this glorious province of Divine power--creation is
   God's own domain.

   Now, in every Christian there is an absolute creation--"Created anew in
   Christ Jesus." "The new man, after God, is created in righteousness."
   "Regeneration is not the reforming of principles which were there
   before, but the implantation of a something which had no existence. It
   is the putting into a man a new thing called the spirit, the new
   man--the creation not of a soul, but of a principle higher still--as
   much higher than the soul as the soul is higher than the body. Since
   the life and principle created are the most glorious of all God's
   works, being in fact a part of the Divine nature itself, I may say most
   boldly that in the bringing of any man to believe in Christ, there is
   as true and proper a manifestation of creating power, as when God made
   the heavens and the earth.

   Further than this, there is more than creation--there is destruction.
   No man can destroy anything. Since the world began, not a single
   particle of matter has ever been annihilated. You may cast matter into
   the depths of the sea, but there it is. It still exists. Cast it into
   the fire and the fire consumes it--but either in the ash or in the
   smoke, every atom survives. Fire does not destroy a single particle.
   There is as much matter in the world now as when God first spoke it out
   of nothing. It is as great an exercise of divinity to destroy as it is
   to create--

   "Know that the Lord is God alone-- He can create and He destroy."

   In the regeneration of every soul there is a destruction as well as a
   creation. The old man has to be destroyed--the stony heart has to be
   taken away out of our flesh. And though this is not done in all of
   us--no, nor in any of us com-pletely--yet the day shall come when sin
   shall be utterly destroyed--both root and branch and all evil
   principles shall be torn up by the roots and, like our sins, they shall
   cease to be--so that if they were searched for they could not be found.
   When the morning stars sang together because a world was made, creation
   was their one theme.

   God made the world out of nothing. That was an easy task compared with
   making a new heart and a right spirit, for "nothing" at least could not
   oppose God--"nothing" could not stand out against Him. But here, in
   salvation, God had to deal with an opposing something which He has to
   fight with and to destroy. And when that has been reduced and overcome,
   then comes in the creating power by which we are made new creatures in
   Christ Jesus. So that it is a double miracle, something more than
   creation--it is creation and destruction combined.

   The work of salvation is most truly a transformation. "Be you
   transformed by the renewing of your mind." You who have been made anew
   in Christ Jesus know in your own hearts how great that transformation
   is. The wolf, with all its bloodthirsty tendencies, feeds quietly with
   all the amiable gentleness of the lamb. The lion eats straw like the
   ox. The desert becomes a garden, and the dry land springs water. What
   is more wonderful still, stones of the brook become children unto
   Abraham. The Lord takes the man who is like the leopard--covered with
   spots--and cleanses him till he is whiter than snow.

   He takes the Ethiopian, black as night, and does but touch him with the
   matchless blood of Jesus and he becomes all together fair and lovely.
   None of the fanciful transformations of which Ovid sang of old could
   ever rival the matchless work of God when He displays His power upon
   the human mind. Oh, what a difference between a sinner and a saint,
   between "dead in trespasses and sins," and quickened by Divine Grace!
   If God should speak to Niagara and bid its floods in their tremendous
   leap suddenly stand still--that were a trifling demonstration of power
   compared with the staying of a desperate human will. If He should
   suddenly speak to the broad Atlantic and bid it be wrapped in flames,
   we should not even, then, see such a manifestation of His greatness as
   when He commands the human heart and makes it submissive to His love.

   Remember, too, as if this were not enough, that the conversion of a
   soul is constantly compared to quickening--the quickening of the dead.
   How great the miracle when the dry bones in Ezekiel's vision suddenly
   became a great army! Greater still is the transcendent work of night
   when dead souls are quickened and made to serve the living God! Indeed
   it is not only the first act of conversion which displays Divine
   power--but the whole of the Christian's career, until he comes to
   perfection--is a clear display of the same. The spiritual life may be
   likened unto the burning bush which Moses saw in Horeb. It burnt, but
   it was not consumed. Such is the Christian--like a bush, he is most
   fitting fuel for the flame. Yet the flame does not hurt him. It kindles
   about him, but he is not destroyed.

   Or the Christian life may be likened to walking upon water. As Peter
   trod the waves and did not sink so long as his faith looked to Jesus,
   so the Believer, every day, in every footstep that he takes is a living
   miracle. Faith, too, in its life may be compared to flying--"They shall
   mount up on wings as eagles." "I bear you as upon eagles' wings." The
   Believer every day takes venturesome flights into the atmosphere of
   Heaven, rises above the world, leaves its cares and its wants beneath
   his feet and that, too, with no other wings but those of faith and
   love. Herein is a continued and splendid miracle of the Divine power.

   But to come to our text--laying it down, then, as being most certain
   that the work of the conversion and sanctifica-tion of a Believer is an
   amazing display of Divine might--we have in the text given to us a most
   singular analogy. The Apostle declares to us by the Holy Spirit that
   the very same power which raised Jesus Christ from the dead and exalted
   Him to the highest Heaven is seen in the conversion and preservation of
   every individual Believer. Now, we shall first notice the analogy.
   Secondly, we shall consider the reason of it. And thirdly, we shall
   observe the inferences which come from it.

   I. First of all, we shall consider THE ANALOGY WHICH THE APOSTLE HERE
   POINTS OUT. Conceive that you hold a great pair of golden compasses.
   You are to put one foot of the compass here upon the grave of Christ.
   You are to open those compasses till you reach Christ ascending up into
   Heaven. Widen them again and again and again, till you put down the
   other foot of the compass where Christ is Head over all things to the
   Church, which is His fullness. Now, can you imagine such a stretch as
   that? You have to conceive of the power by which the dead body of
   Christ is brought to all that pre-eminence of honor--and then to
   remember that just such power is seen in you if you are a Believer.

   In examining the wonderful picture before us, we begin with Christ in
   the grave, by noticing that it was in Christ's case a real death. Those
   loving hands have taken Him down from the Cross. Those weeping eyes
   have let fall hallowed drops upon His face. Tenderly have the women
   wrapped Him about with spices and fine linen, and now He is about to be
   put into the tomb. He is assuredly dead. The pericardium of the heart
   has been pierced--blood and water have both freely flowed. Lift up the
   pierced hand and it falls at once to His side. The lids of yonder eyes,
   so red with weeping, do but cover eyes glazed with death. The foot has
   no power of motion.

   Take up the Corpse, you loving bearers, carry it and put it into the
   tomb--this is no trance, but a most certain death. So is it with us--by
   nature we are really dead. We were dead in trespasses and sins. Try to
   stir the natural man to spiritual action and you cannot do it. Lift up
   his hand to good works, he has no power to perform them. Try to make
   the feet run in the ways of righteousness. They will not move an inch.
   The fact is that the heart is dead. The living pulse of spiritual life
   which was in our parent Adam has long ago ceased. Neither can the eyes
   perceive any beauty in Immanuel, nor can the nostril discover the
   fragrance of the Lord's sweet spices, nor can the ear hear the voice of
   the Beloved. The man is absolutely and entirely dead as to anything
   like spiritual life. There he lays in the grave of his corruption and
   must lay there, and rot, too, unless Divine Grace shall interpose.

   In Christ's case, He was not only dead, but as the text tells us, He
   was among the dead. "He has raised up Jesus Christ from the dead." Do
   notice that. He lay for some time sleeping among those who dwelt in the
   tomb--among the dead. Three days and nights He is a denizen of the
   lonely shades. He was numbered among the victims of death's dart. "He
   made His grave with the wicked and with the rich in His death." Such
   were some of us--we were among the dead--and "were by nature the
   children of wrath," even as others in the case of some of us, our
   outward life was just that of other ungodly men. Were they drunkards?
   So were we. Were they immoral? So were we. Did they take delight in the
   flesh? So did we. Did they follow the desires of the mind? So did we.

   Were they hard-hearted and impenitent and unbelieving? So were we.
   Whatever may be said of any ungodly man, may be said of at least some
   of those whom God has quickened by His Divine power. We, like Jesus,
   were reckoned among the dead. If you had seen His Corpse, you would
   have discovered no difference between it and the body of another, save
   only that He saw no corruption. Dear Brothers and Sisters, in this our
   case is lower than that of our Lord, for we did see corruption. The old
   man is "corrupt according to the deceitful lusts." Yes, more, we were
   "children that are corrupters," and in nothing did we differ from
   others, save that the Lord had predestinated that no bands of death
   should hold us forever, for He was determined to save and to bring us
   to His right hand.

   Come with me again to the new tomb in the garden. Will that sleeper
   ever rise? Will that hallowed tomb ever be burst? No, never while time
   and eternity shall last, unless God shall interfere. Here comes a
   heavenly messenger. His face is like lightning and his raiment white as
   snow--and for fear of him the keepers do quake and become as dead men.
   So, when the time comes, in God's great power, He sends His
   messenger--it is no angelic spirit whose face is like lightning but it
   is some humble minister of Christ, who, nevertheless, is clothed with
   power.

   He has in his mouth a sharp two-edged sword and when he speaks of
   Christ, for fear of Him sins tremble and the prejudices and enmities of
   men's hearts become as dead men. The Divine power is seen all the more
   in the fact that the messenger in the second case is an earthen vessel,
   a poor creature of flesh and blood. There is a Divine mandate for our
   resurrection, as much as for that of Jesus Christ.

   There came with that messenger a mysterious life. You cannot see it,
   but inside that tomb a Spirit has fallen upon those once bleeding limbs
   and entered that lifeless Corpse. The eyes shall soon see the light,
   for the hands are already unwinding the napkin from the brow. The
   cerements are unbound, one by one. The feet are free and the whole
   frame is clear of every encumbrance. No one saw the life come back. If
   anyone had watched that Corpse, they could not have seen the vital
   spark of heavenly flame return to its proper altar. No, it was a
   mysterious thing.

   Ah, there was a time with us when the messenger of God came, but he
   could not quicken us. He could only make the keepers shake and tremble.
   But a mysterious life from God the Holy Spirit fell into our souls and
   we were as we never were before. We trembled with a new fear, rejoiced
   with a new joy, believed with a fresh confidence and hoped with a
   Divine hope. We lived! And oh, can we ever forget the moment when first
   we began to live unto God? Divine Spirit, You did it. Let all the glory
   be unto Your name.

   Then came an earthquake, by which the stone was rolled away, showing
   that the power put forth was enough to shake the earth and to make all
   the elements obedient. Surely when God shakes but common dust and clay,
   and rock and stone, we wonder and men stand in awe. But when he rends
   the harder marble of our hearts and moves the grosser cast and heavier
   earth of our spirits, there is reason to praise and bless His name! The
   stone being removed, forth came the Savior. He was free--raised up no
   more to die. He stood erect, beheld by His followers, who, alas, did
   not know Him. And even so we, when the Divine life has come and the
   Divine energy has burst our tomb, come forth to a new life--no more to
   die.

   Then men of the world know us not, because they knew Him not. They
   misunderstand our motives, they misrepresent our actions, they contort
   our words--because now we have a life of which they are not the
   subjects and have come into a resurrection-state to which they are
   utter strangers. You see the parallel holds. We, too, in the same
   manner as Christ was raised from the dead, have been made to live in
   newness of life, even as the Master Himself said, "As the Father raises
   up the dead and quickens them. Even so the Son quickens whom He wills."

   Please to note here, dearly beloved Friends, that in the resurrection
   of Christ, as in our salvation, there was put forth nothing short of a
   Divine power. It was not angelic or arch-angelic, much less was it
   human. What shall we say of those who think that conversion is worked
   by the free will of man? Who ascribe man's salvation to his own
   goodness of disposition, or to his willingness to accept that which God
   presents to him? Beloved, when we shall see the dead in the graves rise
   by their own power, then expect to see ungodly sinners turn to Christ.
   It is not the ministry, it is not the Word preached, nor the Word heard
   in itself. All the power proceeds from the Holy Spirit.

   Observe again, that this power was irresistible. All the soldiers and
   the high priests could not keep the body of Christ in the tomb. Death
   himself could not hold Christ in his bonds. When the life-pangs first
   began to move in Jesus, he could no longer be held by death. Then was
   death swallowed up in victory. The Father brought forth His begotten
   Son and said, "Let all the angels of God worship Him." He was the first
   begotten from the dead. Irresistible is the power put forth, too, in
   the Christian. No sin, no corruption, no temptation, no devils in Hell,
   nor sinners upon earth can ever stop the hand of God's Grace when it
   intends to convert a man. If God says, "You shall," man shall not say,
   "I will not," or, if he does, as the trees of the woods before the
   hurricane are torn up by the roots, so shall the human will give place
   to the irresistible power of Divine Grace.

   Observe, too, that the power which raised Christ from the dead was
   glorious. It reflected great honor upon God and brought great dismay
   upon the hosts of evil. So there is great glory to God in the
   conversion of every sinner.

   Lastly, it was everlasting power. "Christ being raised from the dead
   dies no more. Death has no more dominion over Him." So we, being raised
   from the dead, go not back to our dead works nor to our old
   corruptions, but we live unto God. Because He lives, we live also, for
   we are dead and our life is hid with Christ in God. The parallel will
   hold in every point, however minute. "Like as Christ was raised up from
   the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in
   newness of life."

   You see I have not stretched the compasses half-way yet. We have only
   proceeded so far as to see Christ raised from the dead. But the power
   exhibited in the Christian goes farther than this--it goes onward to
   the ASCENSION. If you will carefully read the story of the ascension,
   you will notice first that Christ's ascension was contrary to nature.
   How should the body of a man without any means be borne upward into the
   air? "While He blessed them He was taken out of their sight." So the
   Christian's rising above the world, his breathing another atmosphere,
   is contrary to nature. How would you marvel if you saw a man suddenly
   rise up into the sky? Wonder more when you see a Christian rise above
   temptation, worldliness, and sin. When you discover him forsaking those
   things which once were his delight and mounting towards Heaven!

   You will observe again, that the disciples could not long see the
   rising Savior. "A cloud received Him out of their sight." So in our
   case, too, if we rise as we should rise, if the Spirit of God works in
   us all the good pleasure of His will, men will soon lose sight of us.
   They will not understand us. They will be certain to run here and
   there, wondering at this and marveling at that. They will call us mad,
   fanatical, wild, enthusiastic, and I know not what else. And we, on our
   part, must not wonder at it, for now we look down and wonder at them as
   much as they wonder at us. They think it strange that we should be
   looking for unseen things, and hoping for that which we see not. We, on
   the other hand, look down upon them and wonder how it is that they can
   heap together things of clay, and find a living joy in dying things and
   fix eternal hopes on shadows that are soon--so soon--to melt away
   forever.

   Jesus Christ continued to ascend by that same Divine power until He had
   reached the seat of Heaven above. He was gone, really gone from earth
   altogether. Such is the Christian's life. He continues to ascend--the
   Lord makes him dead to the world and the carnal multitude know him no
   more. Where his treasure is, his heart is also. He is risen with Christ
   and his affection is set on things above, not on things on the earth.
   See, Beloved, we have stretched our compass somewhat wide now, when we
   say that there is as much Divine power seen in raising the Christian
   above the world, as in raising Christ from the grave into Heaven.

   But that is not all. When the Master had come to Heaven, we are told in
   the text, that He was made to sit down at the right hand of God.
   Sitting at the right hand implies honor, pleasure and power. Conceive
   the change! "He was despised and rejected of men, a Man of Sorrows and
   acquainted with grief." They spat in His face and bowed the knee,
   saying, "Hail, King of the Jews." He has sat down at the right hand of
   the Majesty on High. He was full of misery--"My soul is exceedingly
   sorrowful, even unto death," said He. The plowers made deep furrows
   upon His back and His visage was more marred than that of any man. But
   now His joy is full. He is at the right hand of God, where there are
   pleasures forever-more.

   He was a worm and no man--the despised of the people. "All they that
   see Me laugh Me to scorn." They shake the head. They thrust out the
   lip, saying, "He trusted in God that He would deliver Him. Let Him
   deliver Him, seeing He delights in Him." But see Him now! He has sat
   down forever at the right hand of God, even the Father. Note the change
   from depths of reproach to heights of Glory! From fearful deeps of
   sorrow to glorious summits of bliss! From weakness, shame and
   suffering, to strength and majesty and dominion, and glory! Such is the
   change in the Christian--just such a change.

   You, too, what were you? Were you worthy to have been cast upon a
   dunghill? No, scarcely fit for that. You were like salt which had lost
   its savor, neither fit for the land nor yet for the dunghill. God and
   man might have cast you out. You were utterly worthless and fit for
   nothing. As for suffering, ah, how were your bones broken by
   convictions of sin! The sorrows of death compassed you and the pains of
   Hell get hold upon you, for the arrows of God stuck fast in your loins,
   and the sword of God pierced to the dividing asunder of your soul and
   spirit.

   As for power, what power had you? You could not lift a finger. You
   could not pray. You could not believe. And yet, where are you now? Why,
   if you know where you are, you are this day as a Believer sitting down
   at the right hand of God--God's Beloved One, ministered unto of
   angels--God's Son, endowed with power and made to sit and reign
   together with the Lord Jesus Christ! All that sitting at the right hand
   of God can mean in respect to the Man Christ Jesus, it means in respect
   to every Believer.

   The Apostle Paul, in Hebrews, writes concerning man in Christ Jesus,
   "What is man, that You are mindful of him? Or the son of man, that You
   visit him? You made him a little lower than the angels. You crowned him
   with glory and honor and did set him over the works of Your hands--You
   have put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that He put
   all in subjection under him, He left nothing that is not put under him.
   But now we see not yet all things put under him. But we see Jesus, who
   was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death,
   crowned with glory and honor." At the right hand of God is the
   Believer's place at this very day. May an act of faith give you a sweet
   enjoyment of it.

   But note next, that Christ was not only put at God's right hand, but He
   had a complete triumph given--far above all principalities and powers,
   that neither good angels have eminence compared with Him, nor evil
   angels any power in contrast with Him. It is not only said that He was
   above them, but far above them. And so is the Believer. As for evil
   angels, the Lord shall tread Satan under your feet shortly. As for holy
   angels, "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister
   for them that shall be heirs of salvation?" So that we, in the Person
   of our Lord, are far above all principalities and powers.

   You will not fail to observe that man has also universal dominion,
   Follow the passage--"And has put all things under his feet." And so has
   the Lord put all things under His people's feet. Their sins and
   corruptions, their sorrows and afflictions, this world and the world to
   come, are all made subject unto us, when He makes us kings and priests,
   that we may reign forever. No, as if this were not enough, Christ is
   then honored with a gracious Headship. He is made to be Head over all
   things to His Church and He is made the fullness of that Church for,
   "He fills all in all."

   But, as if the Believer must be made like his Lord even here, observe
   that if Christ fills all in all, the Church is His fullness in Christ,
   the Church is the head of the universe under God. For You have made him
   a little lower than the angels, and have crowned him with glory and
   honor. You made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands. You
   have put all things under his feet: all sheep and oxen, yes, and the
   beasts of the field. The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea and
   whatever passes through the paths of the sea.

   I do not know whether I have brought forth the parallel completely. If
   you view our Lord as descending in His agony ever so deep and then
   behold Him in His glory ever so high. If by combining judgment and
   imagination, hope and fear, you can get some glimmering of a thought of
   how low the Savior went and how loftily He climbed, then you may
   transfer that to your own state--the same power is at work today, has
   been at work and will be at work in you--to lift you up from equal
   depths to equal heights, that in all things you may be like unto
   Christ. And having been like He is, numbered with the transgressors,
   you may like He obtain the lot and the heritage to reign forever and
   ever at the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens.

   I cannot speak on such a topic as this--it overpowers me--it is by far
   too grand for my limited gifts of utterance, but I trust not too great
   for human delectation. We can delight in it and suck honey, marrow and
   fatness from it.

   II. Now we must note, in the second place, THE REASON OF THIS. Why does
   God put forth as much power towards every Christian as He did in His
   beloved Son? Well, my Brothers and Sisters, I believe the reason is not
   only that the same power was required, and that by this means He gets
   great glory, but the reason is this--union. It lays in the word--union.
   There must be the same Divine power in the member that there is in the
   Head, or else where is the union? If we are one with Christ, members of
   His body, of His flesh and of His bones, there must be a likeness.

   Note, first, that there cannot be a body at all--I mean not a true
   living body--unless the members are of the same nature as the Head. If
   you could conceive a human head joined to bestial limbs, you would at
   once understand that you were not looking upon a natural body. If here
   were a dog's foot, and there a lion's mane, and yet a man's eyes, and a
   human brow, you could never conceive of it as a body of God's creation.
   You would look upon it as a strange monstrosity, a thing to be put out
   of sight, or to be shown for fools to gaze at as a nine-day wonder. But
   certainly not as a thing to display Divine wisdom and power.

   Nebuchadnezzar's dream, you remember, had an image of which the "head
   was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his
   thighs of brass, his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of
   clay." Do you think that the person of Christ is to be so odd a medley?
   Our Head, we know, is like much fine gold. Thanks be unto God, we are
   well persuaded that a body of God's making will be of the same material
   all the way through. He will not have, I say, a perfectly glorious Head
   allied to members in which the Divine energy has never been seen. The
   same power which sparkles about the Head must shine in the members, or
   else it cannot be a body constituted according to the analogy of
   nature, or according to the usual methods of the Divine Worker.

   This is not the most forcible mode of putting it. Let us notice that if
   all the members were not like the Head and did not display the same
   power it would not be glorious to God. Some of the old tapestries were
   made at different times and in different pieces and occasionally the
   remark is heard, "That part of the battle-scene must have been worked
   by a different needle from the other. You can see here an abundance and
   there a deficiency of skill. That corner of the picture has been
   executed by a far inferior hand."

   Now, suppose in this great tapestry which God is working--the great
   needlework of His love and power--the mystical Person of Christ--that
   we should say, "The Head has been worked, we can see, by a Divine
   hand--that glorious brow, those fire-darting eyes, those honey-dropping
   lips are of God, but that hand is by another and an inferior artist and
   that foot is far from perfect in workmanship." Why, it would not be
   glorious to our Great Artist. But when the whole picture is by Himself
   we see that He did not begin what He could not finish and that He had
   not inserted a single thread of inferior value.

   Note again, that it would not be glorious to our Head. I saw the other
   day a cathedral window in the process of being filled with the richest
   stained glass. Methinks the great person of Christ may be compared to
   that great cathedral window. The artists had put in the head of the
   chief figure in the most beautiful glass that ever human skill could
   make, or human gold could purchase. I have not seen it since, but
   imagine for an instant that the workers afterward found that their
   money failed them and they were obliged to fill in the panes with
   common glass.

   There is the window, there is nothing but a head in noble colors and
   the rest is, perhaps, white glass, or some poor ordinary blue and
   yellow. It is never finished. What an unhappy thing, for who will care
   to see the head? It has lost its fullness. There is the head, but it is
   strangely circumstanced. If you complete it with anything inferior, you
   mar and spoil it. It is the head of an imperfect piece of workmanship.
   But, dear Friends, when all the rest of the picture shall have been
   worked out with just the same costly material as the first part, then
   the head itself shall be placed in a worthy position and shall derive
   glory as well as confer glory upon the body. You can read this parable
   without an interpreter.

   I must add that if anything, the power manifested in the member should
   be greater than that manifested in the Head--if anything, it should be
   greater. A marble palace is to be built. Well, now, if they build (and
   oh, how many people do this kind of thing in their houses) the front
   with costly stone and then erect the back with common stock bricks. If
   the pinnacles are made to soar with rich Carrara to the skies, and then
   down in the walls common stone is seen, everybody says, "This was done
   to save money." But if the whole structure throughout, from top to
   bottom, is of the same kind, then it reflects much honor upon the great
   builder and declares the wealth which he was able to expend upon the
   structure.

   But suppose that some of the blocks of marble used in the foundation
   have lain in a very dark quarry and have been subject to damaging
   influences, so that they have lost their gloss and polish--then surely
   they will want more polishing--more workmanship to make them look like
   that bright cornerstone, that noble pinnacle which is brought out with
   shouts. Christ Jesus was in His nature fit, without any preparing, to
   be a part of the great temple of God. We in our nature were unfit. And
   so, if anything, the power should be greater. But we are constrained to
   rejoice that we find in Scripture that it is just the same power which
   lifted the man Christ Jesus to the throne of God, which now shall lift
   each one of us to live and reign with Him.

   Moreover, to conclude this point, the loving promise of our Lord will
   never be fulfilled (and He will never be contented unless it is),
   unless His people do have the same power spent upon them as He has.
   What is His prayer? "I will that they also, whom You have given Me, be
   with Me where I am. That they may behold My glory." And then He adds,
   "The glory which You gave Me I have given them." You know how the union
   stands--"I in them and You in Me." We must be like our Head. Is He
   crowned--we must be crowned, too.

   He is a good Husband. He will enjoy nothing without His spouse. When
   she was poor, He became poor for her sake. When she was despised, He
   was spit upon, too. And now that He is in Heaven, He must have her
   there. If He sits on a throne, she must have a throne, too. If He has
   fullness of joy and honor and glory forever--then so must she. He will
   not be in Heaven and leave her behind. And He will not enjoy a single
   privilege of Heaven without her being a sharer with Him. For all these
   reasons, then, you see it is clear why there should be the same power
   in the Believer as there was in Christ.

   III. Well, WHAT ARE THE INFERENCES FROM ALL THIS? Two or three--they
   will only be hinted at, so do not grow weary. The first inference is
   this--what a marvelous thing a Christian is. A marvelous personage am I
   if I am a Believer in Christ. I am by doubting and fearing led to look
   down upon myself as despicable--but when I reflect that the Eternal has
   put His engraving tool upon me--no, that He has exerted the whole of
   His Omnipotence in me and will continue to exert it till He brings me
   to Himself--Lord, what is man? How strangely honored! How near have You
   brought him to Yourself, so that now there is no creature between God
   and man!

   God first--man as a creature far distant but yet second--as an adopted
   and regenerated being, brought as near to God as a son is brought to a
   father. And who shall tell how near this may be? Lord, what a mighty
   thing can Your Grace make out of that poor crawling worm called man!
   How have You exalted him and made him to be higher even than
   principalities and powers! Let us love and bless God who has done this
   much for us.

   Then, secondly, why should I doubt God's power for others? If God has
   put forth so much power to save me, cannot He save anyone? The might
   which brought Christ from the dead and took Him to Heaven is such a
   tremendous power that it surely can bring the drunkard, the harlot, the
   blasphemer to Christ. Let me pray, then, for the chief of sinners. Let
   me encourage the vilest of the vile to believe in Jesus, for there is
   ability in Christ to save just such.

   Again, why should I ever have any doubts about my ultimate security? Is
   this irresistible power engaged to save me? Then I must be saved. Does
   the devil vow that he will destroy me? Do my corruptions threaten to
   overwhelm me? Who can stay Omnipotence? Who shall come into the
   struggle with the Most High, or match himself with the Eternal? Aha!
   Aha! You enemies of my soul. I laugh you to scorn. If God is with us,
   who can be against us?

   And lastly, how doleful the state of those who are not converted. See
   where you lie--so dead, so helpless, so ruined, so undone--needing
   nothing less than this eternal power to save you from the wrath to
   come! Ah, indeed I know this to be the case with many present here. Our
   preaching does you very little good. You come here in the morning and I
   know what you do in the afternoon. You would not be absent from
   listening to the morning's sermon, nor would you be absent from the
   evening's pleasure!

   And when the Bible and the hymnbook have been put up, the newspaper
   will take the place. There are some who sit under our earnest appeals
   (and thank God they are earnest and often prevalent) and yet they are
   as unmoved as slabs of marble when oil runs down them. In a state of
   death and ruin are you. I see no human power that can help you--in vain
   the minister, in vain the preaching. Your damnation is sure, you will
   go down to Hell and perish and that without mercy.

   Yet gladly would I hope that God would have pity upon you yet. Still
   Christ is lifted up and, "whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but
   have everlasting life." If you can now believe in Christ, the mighty
   power of God is working in you. Trust Him now and you give the best
   evidence that Jesus' irresistible might has been displayed upon you, as
   it was upon the Person of the King of kings. The Lord bless you with
   His mercy, for Christ's sake. Amen.

                Ben-Hadad'S Escape--An Encouragement For Sinners

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY EVENING, OCTOBER 11, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And his servants said unto him, behold now, we have heard that the
   kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray you,
   put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads and go out to the
   king of Israel: perhaps he will save your life. So they girded
   sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their heads and came to the
   king of Israel and said, your servant Ben-Hadad says, I pray you, let
   me live. And he said, is he yet alive? He is my brother. Now the men
   did diligently observe whether anything would come from him and did
   hastily catch it: and they said, your brother Ben-Hadad. Then he said,
   go you, bring him. Then Ben-Hadad came forth to him. And he caused him
   to come up into the chariot. And Ben-Hadad said unto him, the cities,
   which my father took from your father, I will restore. And you shall
   make streets for you in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then
   said Ahab, I will send you away with this covenant. So he made a
   covenant with him and sent him away."

   1 Kings 20:31-34.

   ALTHOUGH the manners and customs of warfare were exceedingly rough and
   cruel in those primitive ages, yet it appears that the kings of Israel
   gained a name for being merciful. I do not find recorded in Scripture
   any particularly merciful acts of theirs and I should conclude that the
   kings of other countries must have been very ferocious, if the kings of
   Israel were at all merciful. Ancient records and memorial slabs record
   tortures so horrible that you could not listen-- if I were to describe
   them--although they were the common barbarities with which Assyrian and
   Babylonian victors concluded their wars.

   It seems that the kings of the house of Israel did not go to the
   lengths of savage cruelty usual among their neighbors. Upon which we
   are led to remark that where the true worship of God does not make men
   what they should be, yet it betters them in some respects. The kings of
   Israel were all idolaters, but yet the presence of a little salt, a few
   of the godly in the land, had an effect upon the State. And the
   situation of the little kingdom of Judah, close at their elbow, with
   its Temple and its Prophets, influenced the manners and customs of the
   people, so that, "the kings of the house of Israel were merciful
   kings," and this not because they feared God themselves, but because
   there were others who did and whose influence and example, perhaps,
   unconsciously, softened public sentiment and mitigated the ruthless
   ferocity of war.

   Is this nothing? Is it not a high honor to the seven thousand who bowed
   not the knee to Baal, that in this respect they made Baal's worshippers
   bow to them? Little do we know how much of the apparent morality of
   this country is due to the real religion which we have in our land.
   There are thousands of men in London who would open their shops tonight
   if it were not for the influence of those who fear the Lord. Their
   shops are closed, not because they take any interest in the Christian's
   day of rest, but out of respect to custom. Sins, which now hide their
   heads under the veil of night, would stalk through our streets with
   barefaced impudence if once Christianity were withdrawn.

   Bad as the customs of trade are, without the purifying power of the
   godly, they would be infinitely worse. The whole fabric of our
   commerce, politics and war, is manifestly affected for the better by
   our religion. Let those, then, who do not feel its power, yet at least
   think well of it for this fact--that it is a blessing to our country.
   And while other nations have been rent with civil war, while revolution
   has followed revolution and class has been set against class, the
   religion of Jesus Christ has made our land a happy land and a land,
   after all, in which there is more generous benevolence towards the
   needy and more mutual sympathy than in any other kingdom or even in any
   republic beneath the sky.

   Thank God for true religion! Even if it does not convert a man, yet its
   presence in his neighborhood tends to sober him and to keep him from
   running into so great an excess of riot. This, however, is but
   by-the-by. I plunge now at once into the subject before me.

   My soul tonight yearns, as it did last Thursday night, to induce some
   timid, seeking soul to make a venture of it and to come boldly to
   Christ. Last Thursday night, you remember, we spoke of Esther and how
   she said, "I will go in unto the king, which is not according to the
   law, and if I perish, I perish." We tried to urge those of you who were
   then present to do the same. We reminded you that though it was
   contrary to law, yet it was not contrary to Gospel, and we therefore
   bade you come, just as you were, into the presence of the Great
   King--promising, on His behalf, that He would stretch out the golden
   scepter to you. Tonight our line of things is precisely the same. Our
   object is the same and we pray that we may have a greater blessing than
   we did then.

   There are three things in the text--first, mercy's report. Secondly,
   misery's resolve. And thirdly, misery's reception.

   I. First, then, MERCY'S REPORT. Down there is a dark cellar. In an
   inner chamber, shut out from the light of day, with, perhaps, only a
   fire or a candle to light him--we see the fugitive King. He who came up
   from Syria with a hundred and fifty thousand men at his feet now
   returns with but a handful of men left. He had sworn in his audacity
   that he would take away Samaria by handfuls, that he would bring so
   many men that each one should require to take but a handful and the
   whole city of Samaria should be cast to the winds.

   The king of Israel had simply replied, "Let not him that girds on his
   harness boast himself as he that puts it off." There sits Ben-Hadad. He
   reminds me of Napoleon after the flight from Waterloo, sitting down by
   the fire in a peasant's cot, his boots and his gray coat covered with
   mire and his face full of dark anxiety and gloomy fears--a man of iron,
   but a man of rusted iron and worn by adversities. There sits Ben-Hadad.
   But he is not like Napoleon, for his soul is cowed and broken and
   humbled and subdued.

   He who bragged so loudly is now a pitiful spectacle of meanness and
   dismay. His servants whisper around the fallen king and their most
   assuring word is a humbling one, "The kings of the house of Israel are
   merciful kings." This is a sweet note to poor Ben-Hadad's ear. The
   boastful king, who never dreamed of mercy to others, is now glad to
   have half a chance of mercy for himself.

   But I come to you tonight, not to whisper mercy. I come to you, who
   have defied God and have been His enemies, but who now are broken
   beneath His power, and my voice is no timid whisper made up of mingled
   hope and fear. As ambassador from the God of Israel. I proclaim the
   fullness of His mercy.

   Thus run mercy's report. First, there is mercy. It is God's essential
   attribute and He can never cease to be merciful. As long as He is God,
   mercy will be one trait in His Divine Character. A God unmerciful were
   not the God of Revelation. There is mercy yet. He has already opened
   bags of mercy and scattered the golden treasure lavishly among the
   forlorn beggars at His footstool. But there are bags untied yet, sealed
   up still with the red seal of the Covenant--bags of mercy, I say, yet
   unused. You have not exhausted the loving kindness of Jehovah. You have
   required much, you have pressed the exchequer of God's mercy to a great
   extent, but its coffers are deep as the sea. No--deep as the gates of
   Hell--

   "Deep as your helpless miseries are, And boundless as your sins."

   Mercy is not dead. It lives still--yes, lives in its ancient strength
   and riches of glory. Mercy is not drained. It flows evermore towards
   the sons of men. There is mercy. There is mercy!

   My proclamation certifies to you, O trembling Heart, that this mercy is
   tender mercy. Your bones are broken tonight, your heart is wounded,
   your spirits are dried up and you are ready to despair. But I tell you
   that God has tender mercy for such as you are. As I sat in the hospital
   yesterday and saw the many cases of maimed limbs and gushing wounds, I
   could but think how tender the nurses ought to be and how downy should
   be the surgeon's finger as he set the broken bones or bound up the
   sores.

   Doubtless there are some persons who have iron hands and hard hearts
   and so, while they are bone-setting or binding up wounds, they do it
   roughly and cause the patient much pain. But, O Sinner, here is the
   tender mercy of our God set forth, which, like a day spring from on
   high, has visited us! "A bruised reed will He not break, nor quench the
   smoking flax." He crowns us with loving kindnesses and with tender
   mercies. He binds up the broken in heart and heals all their wounds.
   Like as a mother comforts her children, even so does the Lord comfort
   His people. And like as a father pities His children, so the Lord
   pities them that fear Him. My Lord is as gracious in the manner of His
   mercy as in the matter of it. Glory be to His name! O Sinner, come to
   the gentle Jesus and live!

   There is great mercy. There is nothing little in my God. His mercy is
   like Himself--it is infinite. You cannot measure it. You may mount in
   the balloon of your imagination, but you cannot reach to the firmament
   of His mercy. "As high as the heavens are above the earth, so high are
   His thoughts above your thoughts and His ways above your ways." Your
   sin is of great measure, but there is no measure to His Grace. His
   mercy is so great that it forgives great sins to great sinners, after
   great lengths of time--and then gives great favors and great privileges
   and raises us up to great enjoyments in the great Heaven of the great
   God.

   As John Bunyan well says --"It must be great mercy or no mercy, for
   little mercy will never serve my turn." Do you feel that, burdened
   Conscience, do you feel that? In God there is great mercy for the
   harlot, for the drunkard, for the thief, for the whoremonger, for the
   adulterer and such like. Here is great mercy, which, like a great flood
   bursting upwards, shall cover the highest mountains of your sins. The
   bath of blood is opened for crimson stains. The Great Physician died to
   heal the foulest disease and He lives as Intercessor, to save to the
   uttermost them that come unto God by Him.

   Hear me again, O troubled Conscience, the mercy of my Lord is rich
   mercy. Some things are great, but have little efficacy in them, like
   wine mingled with water--they cannot revive the fainting. But every
   drop of the mercy of my God is worth a Heaven. Let but a drop of this
   mercy fall upon a soul and it shall be enough to save it. It is rich,
   unutterably rich mercy. When you get this mercy it will be a cordial to
   your drooping spirits. It shall be a golden ointment to your bleeding
   wounds. It shall be a heavenly bandage to your broken bones. It shall
   be a royal chariot for your weary feet. It shall be a bosom of love for
   your trembling heart. It is rich mercy.

   I cannot tell you what the mercy of God would not do. Nor can I tell
   you all that it would do. I cannot tell you what it would not do, for I
   know of no good thing which it would refuse. I cannot tell you all it
   would do for the catalogue is too long and Watts did not exaggerate,
   when he said--

   "But O! Eternity's too short To utter half its praise."

   Mercy, rich mercy! The Lord does not give away halfpence in the
   streets. He does not open His door and throw out bones half-picked, and
   broken crusts, and dry, stale meat. But He opens the door and bids His
   heralds cry, "My oxen and My fatlings are killed, come to the supper!
   "He does not distribute pebbles, but diamonds and gems of priceless
   cost-- bought, not with corruptible things as with silver and gold--but
   with the precious blood of Jesus.

   No, so rich is this mercy, that Heaven had only one Koh-i-noor, one
   "mountain of light," and God gave that. That diamond, that glittering
   diamond--his Only-Begotten Son--sparkles with light upon the bosom of
   forgiven sinners. O the depths of the mercy and goodness of the Lord!

   But our proclamation is not concluded yet. In fact we have but begun.
   There is in God, according to the express word of Scripture, manifold
   mercy. What a fine word that is! Do you understand it? Many-fold mercy!
   Here I open one fold of it and I find remission for transgressions
   past. I open another and I find pardon for sins to come. I open the
   next and I find constraining mercy to lead me into the paths of
   righteousness. No, I find that the folds are more than I can count. I
   cannot possibly reckon up the innumerable mercies which are wrapped up
   one within another.

   As John Bunyan says, all the flowers in God's garden are double. There
   is no single mercy--no, they are not only double flowers--they are
   manifold flowers. There are many flowers upon one stalk and many
   flowers in one flower. You shall think you have but one mercy, but you
   shall find it to be a whole flock of mercies! Our Beloved is unto us a
   bundle of myrrh, a cluster of camphire. When you lay hold upon one
   golden link of the chain of Divine Grace, you pull, pull, pull, but lo,
   as long as your hand can draw there are fresh "linked sweets" of love
   still to come. Manifold mercies!

   Like the drops of a luster, which reflect a rainbow of colors when the
   sun is glittering upon them and each one, when turned in different
   ways, from its prismatic form shows all the varieties of color, so the
   mercy of God is one and yet many, the same yet ever changing, a
   combination of all the beauties of love blended harmoniously together.
   You have only to look at mercy in that light and that light and that
   light, to see how rich, how manifold it is. Poor Sinner, does not this
   talk suit you? Why, if there are many folds, there is a fold for you.
   And if your case seems to be an extraordinary one and you have manifold
   sins and manifold sorrows, here are manifold mercies to suit you!
   Perhaps your mercy is in the last fold and the devil wants to prevent
   its being opened, but God never had a mercy yet which He did not,
   sooner or later, give to the one for whom He had predestinated it. And
   He will give mercy yet to you.

   Notice further, that as it is manifold mercy, so it is abounding mercy.
   The farther we go down the stream of mercy, the deeper it becomes and
   the broader it grows. God's mercy, instead of being exhausted by all He
   has given away, is still as fresh as ever. I say, Soul, God has given
   away enough mercy to save millions of spirits who are now in Heaven and
   yet

   He has as much mercy now as when He began! His giving does by no means
   impoverish Him. I suppose that the shining of the sun, though the fact
   cannot be seen by us, does diminish the store of light in that great
   luminary. But it is not so with the shining of God's mercy. I suppose
   that when I breathe the air, though none can tell it, there is so much
   less of good oxygen for others to breathe.

   But when I breathe God's mercy, there is just as much left as there was
   before. If you take a cupful of water out of the ocean, you cannot see
   the difference, but there certainly is that cupful less in the sea. But
   when you take what mercy you will out of this Divine sea, this
   shoreless ocean of mercy--there is just as much left as when you first
   came. You see then, O Sinner, that the Lord has super-abounding mercy,
   and therefore, if your sin has gone on multiplying, His mercy has done
   the same.

   The mathematician will tell you that numbers, in the process of
   multiplication, will mount to figures so vast that only the calculating
   machine can give what the number will be, and even then, when the
   figures stand in a long row, man may look at them, but he will have no
   idea of what the figures mean. But if you had a calculating machine and
   all the calculating machines that ever were, put together, you could
   not calculate the extent of the super-abounding mercy of God in Christ
   Jesus--enough for every seeking soul forever.

   Poor, trembling Soul, let the silver trumpet ring this good news in
   your ears that this is mercy which will never leave you. "Surely
   goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life." If you get
   mercy tonight, you have obtained mercy forever. If mercy is your friend
   this evening, mercy will be with you in temptation to keep you from
   yielding--with you in your troubles to prevent you from sinking under
   them. Mercy will be with you living, to be the light and life of your
   countenance. And mercy will be with you dying, to be the joy of your
   soul in your last moments. "He that trusts in the Lord, mercy shall
   compass him about."

   You shall have ranks and files of mercies, before and behind and on
   every side of you. You shall have the mercy which endures forever. I
   cannot think what Arminians make of that Psalm--"His mercy endures
   forever." They think that we can exhaust God's mercy, that a child of
   God once saved can yet lose the mercy of God by his sin. Beloved, let
   us never indulge such a thought! For the God who began to be merciful
   to us will be merciful to us even unto the end, and that end shall be
   without end.

   Sinner, have you heard this proclamation? It is not yet finished. Let
   me tell you that the mercy of God flows freely. It wants no money and
   no price from you, no fitness of frames and feelings, no preparation of
   good works or penitence. Free as the brook which leaps from the
   mountainside, at which every weary traveler may drink, so free is the
   mercy of God. Free as the sun that shines and gilds the mountain's brow
   and makes glad the valleys without fee or reward--so free is the mercy
   of God to every needy sinner. Free as the air which belts the earth and
   penetrates the peasant's cottage as well as the royal palace without
   purchase or premium--so free is the mercy of God in Christ.

   It tarries not for you. It comes to you as you are. It waylays you in
   love. It meets you in tenderness. Ask not how you shall get it! You
   need not climb to Heaven, nor descend to Hell for it. The Word is near
   you--on your lips and in your heart. If you believe on the Lord Jesus
   with your heart and with your mouth make confession of Him, you shall
   be saved. If, as guilty, you will accept the great Atonement and be
   washed therein, rejoice O Heaven, and sing O earth, for the sinner is
   saved! Saved through abounding mercy.

   It is mercy fresh and strong tonight! Mercy ready for you while that
   clock is ticking! Mercy which has followed you to this, your eleventh
   hour, and waits for you on the borders of the grave. It is mercy which
   will not easily take a denial from you, but pleads with you now,
   tonight. Sinner, may the Spirit of God come forth with that energy
   which raised Jesus from the dead and make you say, "Lord, I would be
   saved by Your mercy! God be merciful to me a sinner."

   This is mercy's report. O that my lips could tell it better! May God
   open Your ears to hear it and to believe it. Pause a moment that those
   in whom the Holy Spirit is working may breathe a silent prayer--and
   then let us advance to the second head.

   II. MISERY'S RESOLVE. You will come with me into that inner chamber and
   look at Ben-Hadad for a moment. Where are you now, Ben-Hadad? Where are
   your legions now? Where now the flaunting banners--the proud glory of
   Syria? You are broken in pieces--broken as a ship when the rough north
   wind has cast aside her mast and shattered all her sails. Where are you
   now? "Mock not at my misery," the king replies, "I have heard that the
   kings of Israel are merci- ful. If I sit here I shall be slain by some
   fierce trooper. I will bestir myself, something must be done. I will
   get me unto the king of Israel."

   Note then, first, that Ben-Hadad saw the necessity of direct and
   immediate action. Misery, where are you? In yonder sinner have you
   taken up your lodging? I would gladly do you service, and therefore
   will I speak. Sinner, if you sit still, you must die. You are like the
   prodigal, your money is spent. You have wasted your substance in
   riotous living. You have fed the swine and you have tried to feed on
   their husks, but you cannot fill your belly with them. If you stay
   among those swine troughs, you will die--you will perish of hunger.
   Even now your gaunt limbs stare at you and your bare bones rebuke you.

   Man, it is time for you to say, "I will arise. I will arise." O my
   Hearers, I fear that a deadly sleep has fallen upon some of you! You
   are in sin and you know it, but you take no action about it. The
   trembling of the jailer when he said, "What must I do to be saved?" has
   not seized hold on you. You are in the Enchanted Ground and, like
   Heedless and Too-bold, you are asleep upon the seats of the arbor. And
   when shaken in your slumber, you dreamily mutter, "A little more sleep,
   a little more slumber, a little more folding of the hands."

   Oh, if you knew how near you are to the gates of death! I feel with
   trembling that my speech is prophetic to someone here. If you knew, O
   immortal Soul, how soon the curtain shall be drawn! How in a moment you
   shall see the now invisible God face to face, you would shake like an
   aspen leaf in your seat tonight. As the Lord my God lives, there is but
   a step between you and death. "Set your house in order. For you must
   die, and not live." May the Holy Spirit bestir you to take direct
   action! Immediate action!!

   There is no time to waste. The sun has gone down and it may never rise
   on you again. The harvest is past and the summer is ended and you are
   not saved. For you there will be no beaming spring, no blooming summer
   of next year. But the cold sod shall cover you and the daisy shall
   bloom above your grave. "Prepare to meet your God, O Israel." Thus says
   the Lord unto you--"Because I will do this, consider your ways."--

   "Haste, traveler, haste. The night comes on,
   And many a shining hour is gone.
   The storm is gathering in the west,
   And you far off from home and rest.
   Haste, traveler, haste.
   Then linger not in all the plain,
   Flee for your life, the mountain gain.
   Look not behind, make no delay,
   O speed you--speed you on your way.
   Haste, traveler, haste.
   Poor, lost benighted Soul, are you
   Willing to find salvation now?
   There yet is hope, hear Mercy's call,
   Truth, life, light, way, in Christ is all--
   Hasten to Him, haste."

   If you are what I take you to be tonight--one sent here that God may
   save you--you will, tonight, begin to cry unto God and will, tonight,
   seek Him who looses the seven stars and turns the shadow of death into
   the morning. Soul, tonight, lay hold upon the hem of Jesus' garment and
   make a Covenant with Him that you may be saved.

   Come again with me down into that dreary vault and we will see
   Ben-Hadad again. He is in his dressing room. Let us not intrude upon
   the king in his dressing room. Surely he is putting on his imperial
   purple and placing his crown upon his head, is he not? Ah, a strange
   dressing room this and a singular dressing room. He has a rope, such a
   rope as men hang dogs with, and he puts it upon his neck. And as for
   his loins, the dainty garments of Egyptian fine linen are all laid
   aside and he wraps himself about with a piece of an old sack and then
   he scatters ashes upon himself. Fit dressing room for a vanquished
   supplicant!

   Ah, Sinner, Sinner, there is wisdom here! If you would come before God
   in Christ, betake you to your dressing room. Not to trim yourself, not
   to make yourself dainty and fair. Not to perfume yourself with choice
   essences of self-righteousness--not to gird yourself with sumptuous
   apparel. No, no, in your case the words of Isaiah 3 have a spiritual
   meaning--"In that day the Lord will take away the finery: The jingling
   anklets, the scarves, and the crescents. The pendants, the bracelets,
   and the veils. The headdresses, the leg ornaments, and the headbands;
   The perfume boxes, the charms, and the rings; The nose jewels, the
   festal apparel, and the mantles. The outer garments, the purses, and
   the mirrors. The fine linen, the turbans, and the robes. And so it
   shall be: Instead of a sweet smell there will be a stench. Instead of a
   sash, a rope. Instead of well-set hair, baldness. Instead of a rich
   robe, a girding of sackcloth. And branding instead of beauty."

   The finery is all gone--not a rag left--not an ornament spared. Sinner,
   it is so with you! Your proper array is the sackcloth of repentance and
   the rope of acknowledgment that you deserve to die. Man, I say, and let
   this be the first act you do--confess that you are vile. Come! Off with
   that fine garment. I know you have been to Church twice every Sunday
   for the last few years, but away with that, away with that--trust not
   to that. I know that you were sprinkled in your infancy and have been
   confirmed since. But trust not in these observances, for all such
   confidence shall be but as a phantom and a dream of the night.

   I know that you have attended this Tabernacle ever since it was built
   and listened to our ministry for years. But boast not of that! Away
   with that as a ground of trust--pull off that garment. You have never
   failed in business. You have brought up your children well. You never
   swear. You were never a drunkard--midnight orgies never saw you mixed
   up in them. This is well, but I pray you, put not on this as your
   proper dress--the proper dress for a sinner to go to Christ in is
   sackcloth and the rope.

   "Well," says one, "I never will acknowledge that I deserve to be
   damned!" Then you never will be saved. "Well," says another, "I never
   will take the language of a great sinner upon my lips." Then you shall
   never be saved. For unless you are willing to confess that God may
   justly damn you, God will never save you. But, by God's Grace, if you
   feel in your heart tonight that if He sends your soul to Hell, His
   righteous Law approves it well, if you wonder how it is that you are
   not in the pit and marvel why such mercy should have been shown to
   you--come, Brother, come--come as you are, for you wear the true
   court-dress of a Sinner!

   When a beggar goes out to beg at the door, should he put on a new black
   coat and a clean white cravat and kid gloves? No, verily, let him
   clothe himself in tatters--the more rents he has the better--for
   tatters are the livery of a beggar and rags are the court-dress of a
   mendicant. So, come in your sins! Come in your doubts! Come in your
   hardness of heart! Come in your impenitence! Come in your deadness!
   Come in your lethargy! Come as you are--foul, vile, filthy, waiting for
   no amendment, but with a rope upon your neck and a garment of sackcloth
   about your loins! Come now, come now! God help you to come--

   "Come, needy and guilty! Come, loathsome and bare! Though leprous and
   filthy, Come just as you are."

   We will follow Ben-Hadad and hear the king at his prayers. He has come
   before the king of Israel and he has a petition to offer. What will it
   be? Bring the big book--turn to the collect for Quinquagesima
   Sunday--will not that suit him? Will not our beautiful liturgy serve
   his turn? No, no! Living souls must have living words and their own
   words, too, for I cannot adopt another man's petition. They must be my
   own children, sprung from my own loins. The dead soul may parrot out a
   printed prayer, but the living soul pants to be rid of such
   tag-rags--such bondage. The living spirit can no more be content with a
   mere form of prayer, than the blazing, flaming comet could be chained,
   belted and held fast in prison.

   It must have words of its own. Well, but it will be a very fine
   extemporary prayer, will it not--five-and-twenty minutes' long--an
   orthodox, Nonconformist supplication? Oh, dear no! These long, dry,
   prosy prayers suit dead souls, but living souls want something more
   burning, more full of fire! When they come before the Lord, they cannot
   pray in that fashion, but this is the way--"Your servant Ben-Hadad
   says, I pray you, let me live." Ah, that is the Sinner's prayer-- "Your
   servant says, I pray You, let me live." Why, there is not one awakened
   person here who cannot pray such a prayer as that!

   That suits the clown in his roughness and it may suit and must suit the
   peer in his politeness. However dull the intellect, this prayer can be
   understood. And however high the perceptions, this prayer can reach our
   desires to the full extent--"Your servant says, I pray You, let me
   live." John, John, pray in this form--"Your servant John says, I pray
   You, let me live." Jane, put it so--"Your servant Jane says, I pray
   You, let me live." Ah, that is the sort of prayer--"God be merciful to
   me a sinner."

   If a man should meet you in the street as you walked along and should
   say, "If you please, Sir, wait a minute," and should then draw out of
   his pocket a long roll and proceed to read to you a fine, well-written
   oration--well, however beautifully it might be put together, he might
   have a quotation from the "Rambler," or sentences like those of the
   flowing Addison, but you would say, "Yes, yes, but I have not time to
   listen to that, Sir." But suppose that as you were going along, a man
   came to you and said, "Sir, I am starving. I pray you, for God's sake,
   help me"? Then you know what you are at and if your hand does not go
   into your purse very soon, it is only because you may suspect him of
   being an impostor--but you know that this is the kind of language which
   moves the human heart.

   How does your child come to you when he wants anything? Does he open a
   big book and begin reading, "My dear, esteemed and venerated parent. In
   the effulgence of your parental goodness"? Nothing of the kind. He
   says, "Father, my clothes are worn out, please buy me a new coat." Or
   else he says, "I am hungry, let me have something to eat." That is the
   way to pray and there is no prayer which God accepts but that kind of
   prayer--right straight from the heart, and right straight to God's
   heart. We miss the mark when we go about to gather gaudy words.

   What? Gaudy words on the lips of a poor sinner? Fine phrases from a
   rebel? There is more true eloquence in, "God be merciful to me a
   sinner," than in all the books of devotion which bishops and
   archbishops and Divines ever compiled. "Your servant Ben-Hadad says, I
   pray you, let me live." I feel inclined to stop and ask you to bow your
   heads in your pews and pray that prayer--"O God, Your servant says, I
   pray You, let me live. O cut me not down as a cumberer of the ground,
   but let me live. I am dead in trespasses and sins, quicken me, O Lord,
   and let me live. And when You come to slay the wicked on the earth, I
   pray You, let me live. And when You shall destroy the ungodly and sweep
   them with the besom of destruction into the pit that is bottomless, I
   pray You, let me live."

   You see there is not a word of merit. There is nothing about what man
   has done. Ben-Hadad only calls himself a servant. "Make me as one of
   your hired servants. Your servant says, I pray you, let me live." He
   does not ask for honor, or wealth, or station--

   "Wealth and honor I disdain, Earthly comforts, Lord, are vain. These
   can never satisfy, Give me Christ, or else I die."

   Christ, Christ, Christ! Give me Christ! "Your servant says, I pray You,
   let me live."

   Well now, we have gone as far as we ought to do, I suppose, in
   intruding on the king's privacy, but I wish he would let me look in his
   right hand. I wonder what that is which he carries there? He has
   doubtless there some warrant for his prayer, some ground for expecting
   that he will find grace in the sight of his enemy. Let us open his
   hand. What is it? Why, I can hardly see it, it is so little. Let us
   bring it to the light and look at it. Yes, I see it, it is only a
   little "perhaps." It says--"Perhaps he may save your life." That is
   all--a little "perhaps," and yet, with nothing but this to carry in his
   hands, he ventured to go, with the rope upon his neck, to the king of
   Israel.

   Sinner, I will give you something more than that to go with. I should
   not like to go into the Bank of England with only a perhaps in my hand,
   with a note saying that perhaps the cashier would give me ten pounds. I
   am afraid, I am afraid that my perhaps would not be good for much. But
   I should not mind going there with a promissory note signed with a good
   name. Sinner, here is a promise for you. Here is one. "Come now, let us
   reason together, says the Lord"--there is the signature-- "Though your
   sins are as scarlet, they shall be as wool, though they are red like
   crimson, they shall be whiter than snow."

   That is better then "perhaps," is it not? Here is another--"The blood
   of Jesus Christ, God's dear Son, cleans us from all sin." Is not that
   better than "perhaps"? Here is another--"All manner of sin and
   blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men." Surely that is better than
   "perhaps." Here is another--"The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And
   let him that hears say, Come. And let him that is athirst, come. And
   whoever will, let him take the water of life freely." Is not that
   better than "perhaps"? Go then, Soul, go to the King and you shall meet
   with a gracious reception.

   III. The third head is MISERY'S RECEPTION. We have been with Ben-Hadad
   in the vault and now we will go with him to the palace. He marches
   along, doleful and dolorous all the way till he gets into the presence
   of the king. His servants, who are round about him, are all straining
   their ears to catch a word from the king and the first word they get is
   a kind enquiry-- "Is he yet alive?" Ah, there was something in that.
   And so if you are coming to the King, my Lord begins to say--"What?
   Sinner, are you yet alive?

   Why, that is the wretch who thought he would blow his brains out, is he
   yet alive? Why, that is the sinner who ran his body into such an excess
   of sin that he well-near killed himself--is he yet alive? What? That
   sinner who for years never had a good thought, is there a tear in his
   eye tonight? Does he begin to live? Is he yet alive? That man who has
   heard sermon after sermon and never felt under one, does he begin to
   feel tonight? Is he yet alive? What? That man who despised a mother's
   prayers and rejected a father's intercessions?

   The man who has been at sea and shipwreck has not softened him--who has
   had the yellow fever in the West Indies and that has not brought him
   down--what? Does he begin to feel tonight? Is there some motion of the
   Spirit in him? Are there some yearnings after God? Is he yet alive?"
   See how kind is the enquiry. My Master seems to look out of my eyes
   tonight and as He weeps over you He cries--"How can I give you up,
   Ephraim? How can I deliver you, Israel? How shall I set you as Admah?
   How shall I make you as Zeboim? My heart is moved, my repentings are
   kindled together. I will not destroy him, for I am God and not man."

   The next word of the king of Israel is suggestive, "He is my brother."
   I think I see the gleam of pleasure which went over the poor courtiers
   faces as they heard it. If the king had said some hard word, they might
   have heard it with grief, but when he said--"He is my brother," they
   whispered to one another--"My brother? My brother Ben-Hadad? Why, that
   vile Ben-Hadad had threatened this king with all sorts of mischief. He
   deserved nothing but death in return."

   When the Israelite king was in great necessities, Ben-Hadad sent to
   demand of him his wife and his children, and all that he had. And when
   the king volunteered to acknowledge that Ben-Hadad was his sovereign
   lord and that they were his, Ben-Hadad ordered him to send immediately
   the best of his wives and the best of his children, and when the king
   would not do that, Ben-Hadad said--"The gods do so unto me, and more
   also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the
   people that follow me." Hear the boaster! How dare he use such
   insulting language to the king of Israel?

   And yet here is this king of Israel now saving--"He is my brother"!
   What, brother to such a scoundrel, such a braggart, such a tyrant, such
   a thief, such a rapacious robber, who would rake the whole world and
   spoil a man's house and rob his bed--brother to him? Yes, says Ahab,
   "He is my brother." Well, I do not admire that in the king of Israel,
   but I do admire it in my Lord Jesus, that he should turn round to a
   black sinner and say, "He is my Brother. I am his elder Brother. He is
   a child of God, accented in the Beloved. He is heir of God and joint
   heir with Me, of all things." Well, trembling, quickened Sinner, what
   do you think of this, that Jesus Christ is your Brother? Have you no
   love towards Him?

   Why surely if you are a convicted and awakened sinner, the thought of
   your adoption into the Lord's family, of your being the Brother of
   Christ, will make the tears roll down your cheeks and you will say,
   "How could I have offended against such a Lord? Lord, let me live for
   my Brother's sake." The next thing the king of Israel did was to take
   Ben-Hadad up into his chariot. Ahab lets his bragging adversary ride
   with him in his carriage. And Jesus will take you up into His Church,
   no, into His heart, into the chariot of His Grace and you shall ride
   with Him even through the streets of Heaven, amidst universal
   acclamations.

   He did one thing more, he made a covenant with him. God makes a
   Covenant with sinners in the Person of Christ. He gave Him to be a
   Covenant for His people, a leader and commander to His people. And
   those hearts who are led by Grace to accept the mercy of God in Christ
   Jesus, know that this is the result of a Covenant made before the world
   began by God with elect sinners in the Person of Christ Jesus. O
   Sinner, such is the infinite mercy of God that the very thought of it
   should make you weep!

   I have known the time when I thought God would never have mercy on me,
   and yet the thought of His love to other people would bring the tears
   to my eyes. I could not help saying once, I remember, that I would love
   God even if He damned me, because He was so gracious to others.
   Something of that emotion ought to be in your soul and if there is,
   then methinks it must be a work of Divine Grace. If you begin to be in
   love with the mercy of God, it is because the mercy of God is in love
   with you.

   O poor Soul, mercy is to be had for the asking. It is to be had on no
   terms and no conditions except these--"He that believes and is
   baptized, shall be saved." Trust Jesus! Trust Jesus just as you are for
   everything, and you are saved. And we will meet again in that land
   where they wear no sackcloth on their loins, nor ropes upon their
   necks--but where their heads are crowned with immortal honor and their
   bodies are robed in immortality.

   Christ is the way, the truth and the life. Look to Him, all you ends of
   the earth, look to Him and live! The Lord enable you to do so, for
   Jesus' sake. Amen.

                                Jehovah-Shammah

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 25, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Whereas the Lord was there." Ezekiel 35:10.

   HEREIN lay the special security of the chosen land. The Edomites saw
   the whole country of Israel and Judah left desolate. Babylonians and
   Chaldeans had carried away the people and ravaged the land, therefore
   the proud inhabitants of the city in the rock said--"These two nations
   and these two countries shall be mine and we will possess it." The
   dukes of Edom counted upon an easy conquest and such, indeed, the Holy
   Land would have proved, had there not been one great difficulty--quite
   unknown to them--"The Lord was there."

   Jehovah Himself was still in possession, even though His rebellious
   people had been carried into captivity. HE would never allow that the
   Idumea should hold Jehovah's land in possession, and with despiteful
   hearts cast it out for a prey. From this one incident we gather that
   whatever may be the machinations and devices of the enemies of God's
   people, though there is nothing else to thwart them, there is this as
   an effectual barrier--the saints are God's heritage and the Lord is
   there, to guard and hold His own. The book of Ezekiel, if you will
   notice, concludes with these blessed words, as the name of the great
   city of the latter days. When all conflicts shall be ended, when the
   scattered shall be gathered, when the tabernacle of the Lord shall be
   among them. Then this which is Zion's bulwark today, shall be her
   everlasting glory. JEHOVAH-SHAMMAH--" The Lord was there."

   As Palestine was preserved from the enmity of Mount Seir by the
   presence of the great Jehovah, so the Church and each separate member
   of it is constantly kept by the power of a present God, despite the
   rage of adversaries. In enlarging upon this cheering Truth of God, I
   shall invite you to notice the Church as a despised people, constantly
   triumphant. Next, we will observe the Christian, in his opposed life,
   perpetually victorious. Thirdly, a desolate soul graciously delivered
   from Satan. And lastly, a ruined and depraved earth, resplendent with
   perfect beauty--and all because "The Lord was there."

   I. Consider, then, A DESPISED PEOPLE CONSTANTLY TRIUMPHANT, BECAUSE
   "THE LORD WAS THERE." "Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated." Here
   election divides two races forever. Since that hour the rejected have
   always displayed a deadly hatred towards the elected. The seed of the
   profane Esau, who sold his birthright, have in all generations
   maintained perpetual strife against the children of the accepted Jacob,
   upon whom the Lord has looked with the eyes of discriminating Grace.

   The Prophet Obadiah denounces a curse upon Edom for their violence to
   their brother Jacob--"In the day that you stood on the other side. In
   the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces and
   foreigners entered into his gates and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even
   you were as one of them. But you should not have looked on the day of
   your brother in the day that he became a stranger. Neither should you
   have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their
   destruction. Neither should you have spoken proudly in the day of
   distress. Neither should you have stood in the crossway, to cut off
   those of his that did escape. Neither should you have delivered up
   those of his that did remain in the day of distress."

   An eternal enmity is put between the serpent and the woman--between his
   seed and her seed. This was evidenced at the beginning of human
   history, in the case of Cain and Abel--and the story of the great
   battle of Armageddon, when Gog and Magog shall be utterly overthrown,
   will stand upon the last page of the world's story as a sure proof that
   the old enmity is as hot as ever. The people of God have always been,
   in every age, a hated and despised people. This may be seen if you will
   notice a few facts.

   1. The adversaries of God's Israel have often thought in their hearts
   that they would utterly destroy them. When Israel dwelt in Egypt and
   the single household began to be a great nation, Pharaoh said unto His
   people, "Come on, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply."
   Hard bondage, in mortar and in brick and in all manner of service in
   the field was tried until their lives were made bitter. But the
   tyrant's purpose was not accomplished, for the more they afflicted
   them, the more they multiplied and grew.

   Then spoke the king unto the midwives--"If it is a son, then you shall
   kill him. But if it is a daughter, then she shall live." O deep-laid
   scheme of a cruel and wily despot! Now he thinks that the work is
   surely done. The Nile will be covered with the dead bodies of Israel's
   sons and Egypt will know no fear from her bond slaves. Little did he
   dream that the mid-wives would violate his orders and far less that
   from the river which he worshipped would spring the man who would make
   the fields of Zoan mourn and avenge upon the first-born of Egypt the
   slaughter of Israel's sons.

   As it was fabled of Hercules that while a babe in his cradle, he
   strangled with his infant hands the serpents which came to destroy him,
   so was it with the chosen nation. While yet feeble as a child in Egypt,
   it was more than a match for the craft and malice of the dragon, for
   "the Lord was there."

   In after years a Pharaoh of like spirit grievously oppressed the people
   until Jehovah brought them forth with a high hand and with an
   outstretched arm. They had scarcely been free more than a few
   hours--they had gone but a few furlongs from Egypt, when the heart of
   Pharaoh was hardened and he said, "I will pursue, I will overtake, I
   will divide the spoil--my lust shall be satisfied upon them." Behold
   the hosts of Israel--they are entangled in the land--the wilderness has
   shut them in. The Red Sea rolls before them. Now Pharaoh, now may you
   destroy them at a blow! How is the prey snatched from the hand of the
   mighty! How gloriously is captivity led captive! The sea divides, the
   waters stand upright like an heap and the chosen people of God are led
   through the deep as through a wilderness, for "the Lord was there."

   After-years present us with numberless occasions in which the people
   who bore the oracles of God were in imminent peril and were
   miraculously preserved by her great King. Well did the Psalmist sing,
   "God is in the midst of her. She shall not be moved: God shall help her
   and that right early. The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: He
   uttered His voice, the earth melted. The Lord of Hosts is with us. The
   God of Jacob is our refuge."

   To single out one case among many, let us remember the boastings and
   the shame of Sennacherib. The great king has taken the defended cities
   of Judah and sent his foul-mouthed servant, Rabshakeh, to demand the
   surrender of Jerusalem, that he may carry away all the people of the
   land. Hezekiah comforts the minds of the people, saying, "The Lord will
   deliver us." Rabshakeh writes a blasphemous letter and cries to the
   people on the wall, "Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the
   Lord will deliver us. Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his
   land out of the hands of the king of Assyria?

   "Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where are the gods of
   Sepharvaim? And have they delivered Samaria out of my hands? Who are
   they among all the gods of these lands that have delivered their land
   out of my hands, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my
   hands?" Thus he boasts against the living God and counts upon the ready
   possession of the Holy City. And what happens? He had calculated that
   his ferocious troops would cut to pieces the insignificant armies of
   Hezekiah. He looked upon Jerusalem as a cauldron, and all the
   inhabitants thereof as the pieces of flesh that are boiled therein--but
   he forgot that the Lord was there. He knew not Jehovah-Shammah.

   He little dreamed of the secret reason why the virgin daughter of Zion
   despised him and laughed him to scorn. But when the hook was in his
   nose, when the thousands of his troops had fallen like leaves in
   autumn, and when he himself was smitten by his own sons in the house of
   Nisroch, his god, then all the nations knew that God was great and
   greatly to be feared in the mountain of His holiness. Had not the Lord
   been on Judah's side, she would have been as stubble to the fire. But
   the Lord was there, and her foe could not prevail.

   Fly on still in your vision of the Lord's marvelous works, till you
   come to the Church of God properly called. How easy it seemed to Herod
   to destroy once and for all the followers of Jesus! They are but a
   handful. He will take James to begin with and Peter shall follow. The
   Apostles shall be the first fruits of the bloody harvest which he means
   to reap. Aha! Aha! Foolish Herod, a greater Herod than you are sought
   to destroy Him who was King of the Jews. In his blind fury he smote all
   the young children of Bethlehem, but the newborn Prince escaped the
   murderous sword and so shall this young child, the new-formed Church,
   escape out of your wolfish fangs.

   She shall fly to the uttermost ends of the earth and shall be free. Her
   Word shall go forth throughout every land and people. Need I say that
   you have but to change name and circumstances and this story may be
   repeated thousands of times? During the first centuries, the dragon
   incessantly persecuted the woman--"The serpent cast out of his mouth
   wa- ter as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be
   carried away of the flood." One of the Roman emperors set up a
   monument, "In the memory of a destroyed superstition called
   Christianity." But was our holy religion destroyed?

   Could the dragon prevail against the remnant which kept the
   Commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ? Behold the
   multitudes who this day bow the knees at the name of Jesus of Nazareth!
   Diocletian dyed the earth red with the blood of saints, and if it had
   not been that the Lord was there, certainly the Roman sword must have
   cut off forever the woman's seed. But why do I linger here? All ages
   and all lands witness to the same struggle. Our own country, at the
   Reformation, is a clear instance. Mary hunted out the saints of God. As
   the bloodhound tracks the fugitive slave, so she tracked the faithful
   wherever they were hidden.

   But the stakes of Smithfield and the dungeons of the Lollards' Tower
   were not sufficient to destroy the people of God. And Elizabeth,
   equally bloody against those who followed the Lord fully, having set up
   a semi-papal hierarchy, sought to parry Puritans out of the land. Her
   successors followed in her steps, but neither the hangman's rope, nor
   loathsome dungeons, nor the dragoons of Claverhouse, nor fines, nor
   banishment, nor death could destroy the separated Church of God--for
   her God was her refuge and high tower. How came it, let us ask, that
   all the regal and priestly power was foiled and could not stand against
   the people scattered and peeled?

   How did this anvil break so many hammers? How could this earthwork
   stand against the fire of such well-manned batteries? Was there any
   human force in the Church capable of resisting these bloody
   persecutions? Brethren, there was none but this--Jehovah-Shammah, "the
   Lord was there." The Lord being there, immortality, no, eternity was in
   the Church. God is eternal, He is in the Church and His Church is
   immortal, too. Who shall quench immortality? Where is the sword that
   can snap the links of eternity? When God the Immortal shall bow His
   head to weakness. When age shall palsy His arm and death shall send His
   terrible shaft into His heart, then may the Church of God be destroyed.
   But not till then, because "the Lord was there."

   2. The enemies of the Church have frequently shown their scorn of her
   by the ridicule which they have cast upon her attacks. When the Church
   defies the world, the proud servants of Satan are filled with derision.
   Even as Midian rested in unguarded security, fearless of Gideon and his
   three hundred men, comparing him to a poor barley-cake which they could
   eat at once if it were not unworthy of their notice, so the ungodly
   despise the zeal of the godly. But as the cake of barley-bread fell
   upon the tent of Midian and smote it that it lay along, even so the
   Church is more than conqueror.

   How loudly did Goliath mock at David! How he cursed him by his
   gods--"Come to me and I will give your flesh unto the fowls of heaven
   and to the beasts of the field." But Goliath falls like a tottering
   tower headlong upon the ground. His own sword slays him and the
   despised David bears the monster's head triumphantly in his hand. So,
   doubtless, in Apostolic times, the world ridiculed the armies of the
   Lord. "These poor men!" said kings and princes--and they smiled in
   royal scorn of the mendicant band, "what kingdom can they set up?"

   "Unlearned and ignorant men!" muttered the philosophers, as they cast
   their mantles about them and mocked at the strange doctrine of the
   resurrection of the dead. "This handful of weaklings," said the
   commander of the legions of Rome. "This handful! A miserable eleven,
   what can they do against innumerable priests and worshippers supported
   by the eagles of an universal empire?" "Aha! Aha!" said the world, "was
   anything ever so despicable, so fanatical, so foolish! Eleven
   fishermen!

   "Get back to your nets and to your boats! Go back to the lake of
   Gennesaret! Transform the fishes into men and then come back and think
   to turn us from the ancient gods of our fathers into worshippers of the
   crucified Man of Nazareth." Yet for all their wisdom, their laughter
   was ill-spent, for the Lord was there and therefore the attacks of the
   brave eleven were followed by speedy victory. Wherever they marched
   they cast down the idols' temples. No, they hurled the gods themselves
   to the moles and to the bats and the few, the ignorant, the poor, the
   weak--in the course of a few score years had cast the pomps of
   priesthood, the pride of philosophy, and even the might of kings--from
   the abodes of their glory and trod them like mire in the streets,
   because Jehovah-Shammah, "the Lord was there."

   How constantly has the world ridiculed the Church in every effort she
   has put forth for her own enlargement? "What of these feeble Jews,"
   said Sanballat and Tobiah--"will they fortify themselves, will they
   revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish? Even that which they
   build, if a fox goes up, he shall break down their stone wall." But
   they built the wall and the timbers were fixed in their places. How
   vexed must Tobiah and Sanballat have been when they saw the city rising
   upon its heap.

   The same has been the case in all time. To quote a modern instance of
   what has ever been the case--Sydney Smith said when Carey talked of
   evangelizing India, that a consecrated cobbler was going out to preach
   the Gospel to educated and enlightened Hindus. But the consecrated
   cobbler took his post and dug in India a well of which thousands shall
   yet drink. That man of God has placed the battering ram of the Gospel
   in such a position, that before long the hoary bastions of idolatry
   will tremble and the world shall see that the weakness of God is
   stronger than man.

   It is really an absurd thing for us to talk about overcoming the world
   and converting the heathen and comforting God's people and enlarging
   the borders of the Church. It is, I say, an absurd thing if we talk so
   in our own strength, but it is not absurd when this little word comes
   in--"Whereas the Lord was there." Then we have Omnipotence in our
   midst. If God is there, the Church has God's Omnipotence. And little do
   our enemies know our might. Omnipotence walks forth, in the youthful
   David to fight Goliath. Omnipotence goes forth in the consecrated
   cobbler to fight with Juggernaut and the gods of the heathen. And
   feeble though the Church may be to this day, unlearned and to a great
   extent still made up of the poor of this world, yet the day shall come
   when the earth shall know that the Church is mightier than the
   mightiest of her foes, because Jehovah-Shammah, "the Lord was there."

   3. Let me again remind you that the world's estimation of the Church
   has frequently been seen in the way in which it will mock at all her
   teachings. The wise men of this world have always something far
   superior to anything that the Bible can reveal. Even bishops make great
   discoveries and find out that perfect wisdom has made very many
   blunders in the book of Exodus. New theologians are every now and then
   starting most remarkable schemes of doctrine--their own wood, hay and
   stubble, being, in their own opinion, infinitely superior to the gold
   and the silver and precious stones of God's Inspiration.

   Well, they may go on and tell us that the Gospel is a vulgar thing and
   only fit for the poor. They may assure us that it will suit very well
   the uneducated masses, but the intellectual and enlightened few want
   something better. Ah, we can well endure their boasting, for the
   Doctrines of Grace are the loftiest of all philosophy and the most
   intellectual of all teachings--because Jehovah-Shammah, the Lord is in
   them. And where God is, there is perfect wisdom--where God is, there is
   incomprehensible knowledge.

   The sum total of all human knowledge is but as a drop in the bucket
   compared with the wisdom of God. And the wisdom of God is in and with
   the teachings of His Church, wherever Jesus Christ is lifted up. He is
   the wisdom of God and the power of God, and therefore in answer to the
   world's railing against our folly, we reply, "Yes, but the foolishness
   of God is wiser than man," and, in Scripture, "Jehovah-Shammah," the
   Lord is there.

   4. Do they not, also, very frequently cast in our teeth our trials?
   They will say of the Christian, "Where is He now?" When Israel's hills
   were desolate, then Edom said, "Where is their God?" The sons of Esau
   boasted and said, "Let us go up and take possession." It is ever the
   part of the ungodly, when they find a Christian in distress, to say,
   "Where is your God? God has forsaken him. Let us persecute and take
   him." Yes, and we should have been swallowed up quickly by our fierce
   foes, only that, in the worst moments of the Church, God is there.

   If she is in prison, God is there. At the stakes where her martyrs
   burn, God is there. The silenced ministers may have to conceal
   themselves in the caves and dens of the earth, but God is there. Tried
   though the Christian is, God is with him in the furnace. Nebuchadnezzar
   can cast in but three, he cannot, however, cast out the Fourth! Where
   the Church shall be Christ shall walk the coals with His people and
   they shall come out of their trials triumphant--for God is there. Where
   God is, there is everlasting love. Where God abides, there is immutable
   affection. And, therefore, let this be our comfort, God is with you,
   Israel, passing through the fire.

   Beloved, the world shows its disrespect of us by the way in which it
   often treats the Christian. It sees him poor and naked and miserable,
   and therefore pushes him about as though he were a beggar and not one
   of the royal blood. Little do they know that however poor the Christian
   may be, the Lord is there. The image of Jesus Christ is in every
   Christian's face, but especially in the face of a poor Believer. The
   Holy Spirit dwells in that body, however clothed with rags, however
   emaciated by hunger and disease.

   You remember the other day that certain young men treated rudely a
   pale-faced person whom they saw sitting in the railway carriage--pushed
   him about, struck him and so forth and went to their homes, no doubt,
   boasting of the way in which they treated a poor fool who had not the
   spirit, as they would say, to defend himself. To their consternation it
   turned out to be a peer of the realm whom they had thus ill-treated.
   And then how small they seemed. What abject apologies they offered. Ah,
   it was quite a different thing then. They would not have pushed his
   grace, his lordship, the duke. Oh if they had only known it--they
   thought him only some common man.

   And so nowadays the world elbows the Christian, pushes him, strikes
   him. But when it finds out what a Christian is, then how small their
   mirth will seem--they would not have done it if they had known who it
   was. They knew not the Lord of Glory and if they knew not Him, how
   shall they know His people? Let it ever be remembered that wherever
   there is a true Christian, there is Glory, because God is there and God
   is never apart from His own Glory. The very honor and dignity and
   majesty of Deity itself guards every follower of the Savior, however
   much he may be despised among men.

   O for a celestial tongue to set forth the honor and safety of the
   chosen people, an honor which streams from the Presence of God as light
   pours from the sun! You will see how it is. There was a little flock--a
   multitude of ravening wolves all hungry and athirst for blood came
   howling on. They rushed to the very edge of the fold. They were about
   to leap in and suck the blood of the sheep, but suddenly they started
   back like whipped curs. See how they turn tail and take to flight, for
   lo, a mysterious One lifts His hand over the fold. A voice cries, "Get
   you gone!" and back they go--they little dreamed that the Lord was
   there. Had they known it they would scarcely have attempted a task so
   impossible as the destruction of a people who had God in the midst of
   them and therefore could not be moved.

   II. But I must leave this for want of time and introduce THE OPPOSED,
   AND YET A CONQUEROR. Moses saw at the back of the desert a bush
   burning. It was nothing but a bush. The fire was real. The fire was
   quite capable of consuming the bush in but the twinkling of an eye, and
   yet though the bush burned with fire, it was not consumed. It is such a
   sight as this that I bid you now look upon for a few moments, my
   Beloved.

   In the Lord Jesus Christ a Christian man is constantly opposed and yet
   perpetually preserved because the Lord is there. The very moment that a
   Christian is born again, Satan seeks to destroy him. The early
   convictions of a newborn soul are always the subject of Satanic attack.
   Frequently the devil will employ our old companions to laugh us out of
   our fears--"Come along, old fellow," they will say, "do not give way to
   this melancholy misery. There is a first-class play tonight--come and
   see it. We shall meet at the tavern--we will have merriment and a rare
   time of it."

   Satan hopes that with the laughs, the jeers, the jests and merriment,
   he will destroy utterly all convictions of sin. Little does he dream
   that the Lord is there and where God sends the arrow home, no devil can
   ever draw it out. Where the Lord convicts of sin, it is not possible
   that those convictions should be staunched, except by a Savior's
   wounds. If we should attempt to blow out a candle, since the candle was
   lit by human power, human power may put it out. But he were the
   greatest of fools who should try to blow out the sun. For He alone who
   kindled its matchless rays can ever quench them.

   If, then, the convictions of sin are natural, and come from man, man
   may destroy them. But if the sunlight of God has risen in a human
   heart, no power--human or satanic--shall ever be able to destroy the
   glorious day which the day-star foretold. If I attempt to stop in its
   course a stone which has been slung from human hand, I may, perhaps,
   accomplish my purpose. But who is he that could interpose to stop a
   meteor as it flashes across the sky? Who shall cast a bridle about the
   neck of the planet as it flies in its tremendous pathway? Who shall
   bind it fast in its place, or thrust a bit into its jaws? If God is in
   the thing, it must traverse its destined pathway, in spite of all
   opposition. So, Beloved, where the Lord begins a true heart-breaking
   and real conviction of sin, it cannot be destroyed. Why? Because
   Jehovah-Shammah, the Lord is there.

   Then, as the Fiend has tried to destroy conviction, he will next shoot
   his arrows against our faith. Poor, feeble Follower of Jesus, he will
   worry you. "Oh," says he, "he is but a little one, I will encounter him
   in full fury, I will strike him to the ground and spill his soul." But
   the faith which God gives to us overcomes the world--yes, and overcome
   the old dragon, too. It is a faith which lives under pressure and
   load--mountains may be piled upon it--but it still breathes under the
   terrific weight. It lives in the midst of death, swallowing up death in
   victory. It defies the power of Hell's fiery darts. They are not only
   turned aside, but they are quenched upon the shield of faith.

   Satan may throw all sorts of accusations in our pathway, but faith dies
   to the Advocate. He may strike us many a cowardly blow with fierce
   temptations such as suited our former state and the corruptions of our
   flesh, but if God is in our faith and He is in it if it is real and
   genuine, "more is He that is for us than all they that are against us."
   There shall be this ever for our preservation--"the Lord is there."

   Beloved, have not you always found that not only your faith but all
   your good works are the subjects of Satan's attacks? I never yet had a
   virtue or possessed a Divine Grace but what it was sure to be the
   target for hellish bullets, whether it was hope, bright and sparkling,
   or love, warm and fervent, or patience, all enduring, or zeal, flaming
   like coals of fire. The old enemy of everything that is good has tried,
   if he could, to destroy or mar it. And why is it that anything virtuous
   or lovely survives in you? There can be no reason given except this,
   "God is there."

   God dwells in His people. Every good thing which springs up in the
   human heart is an emanation from the indwelling Deity. And being such,
   the Destroyer may vent his malice upon it, but as the waves are broken
   against the rocks, so shall his cruel spite be broken against the power
   of the most high God--God is in it.

   Note, Beloved, how sedulously Satan aims against the perseverance of
   God's people. "They will never hold on their way," says he. You and I
   have thought we never should. Sometimes we have sat down and become
   weary in well-doing-- the troubles of the way, our non-successes, our
   frequent sorrows, perhaps the backsliding of our heart from God--all
   these have made us say, "I shall never reach my journey's end and see
   my God with acceptance." And yet you have not fallen away from Grace
   yet, not yet have you disgraced your character, not yet gone back to
   your old lusts.

   Old Adam has given you many a grip in the side, as though he would tear
   the heart out of you, but you have held on your way despite all that he
   could do. How is this? Why, God was in you, and if He had not been
   there, then, indeed, had you been a prey unto your adversaries. I went
   last week into the lighthouse at Holyhead and marked the lights that
   warn the mariner crossing the sea, or guide him in time of storm into
   the haven. I noticed in the second story of the lighthouse many large
   vats filled with oil laid up in store that the lamps might be
   constantly trimmed for months to come. I compared that in my own mind
   to that gracious provision of Divine Grace which the Lord lays up in
   store for His people. The lamps would go out but Jehovah-Shammah, the
   Lord is there--we have the all-sufficiency of God laying up a store of
   oil so that our lights may be always trimmed.

   A Christian is something like an express train. On some of our
   railroads you know there are express trains which do not stop to take
   water, the water lies in a trench in the middle between the rails and
   as the train runs it sucks up its own supply of cold water and so
   continues its course without a pause. Our God in Divine Grace has
   prepared in advance our needs. He prepares supplies for His own people
   so that without their stopping to seek the streams of
   creature-confidence--sometimes without the use of means--He is pleased
   to speed them on their pathway towards Heaven, fed by a Divine
   arrangement of Grace.

   O it is blessed to think that if God is there, everything a Christian
   can want for his final persevering, for his eternal life, is ready at
   hand. I have no doubt, Beloved, we shall find that when we come to die,
   our dying confidence will be the object of the enmity of all the powers
   of Hell. Perhaps Jordan will overflow her banks and Satan will issue
   his command, "Come here, principalities and powers, here is the man
   that we could not overturn in life, let us at last overthrow him in
   death."

   Perhaps like John Knox, you may have your blackest day at the last, but
   oh, thanks be unto God that gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus
   Christ! We have no fear for our dying confidence, for "God is there,"
   even there where the billows are the most tempestuous and the water is
   most chill. We shall feel the bottom and know that it is good. Our feet
   shall stand upon the Rock of Ages even in our dying moments. Beloved,
   from the first of a Christian's life to the last, the only reason why
   he does not perish is because "the Lord is there."

   How often has the devil reckoned without his host? He has thought,
   "Surely I shall destroy and devour that lamb." So, indeed, he would
   have, if it had belonged to anybody else--but seeing it belonged to the
   Lord--the Lord was there to protect it, to pluck it out of the jaws of
   the lion and out of the paws of the bear and to preserve it even to the
   end. I think, my Soul, you have learned never to love anything of which
   you cannot say, "The Lord is there." If you have a grace, a virtue, a
   good work, a prayer--and the Lord is not in it--away with it! Away with
   it!

   But if you have the feeblest prayer that ever was prayed and the
   faintest hope that ever gladdened a man, if God is in it, never give it
   up--for where there is God there is something firmer than adamant and
   the axes of your adversaries shall have their edges turned against it.

   III. Now, with greater brevity still, I come to dwell upon the third
   point, which is this--A DESOLATE SOUL, NOT DESTROYED, BECAUSE GOD IS
   THERE. I wish I could convey, by my words, some little inkling of my
   own joy of heart while I was thinking over the third part of my
   subject. I thought of the dead sinner. But an elect sinner and the
   devil, like the sons of Edom, said, "I shall have that dead sinner, I
   shall have him." "My purpose is," says Satan, "that he shall dwell
   forever with me, in extreme misery. I have laid hold upon him," says
   he, "and he has made a league with Hell. He is mine, he is mine
   forever."

   But stop, stop, the Lord was there before the devil. Does the devil
   have a purpose? Ah, but God's purpose is older than the devil's
   purpose. Does the sinner make a covenant? Yes, but then, God's Covenant
   was made before that sinner was born! And what is the devil's purpose
   compared with God's purpose? You see God is there before him--"Whereas
   the Lord was there." "I have purposed says the Lord, to make that
   sinner My child, a new heart also will I give him and a right spirit
   will I put within him. I will sprinkle clean water upon him and he
   shall be clean. From all his filthiness will I cleanse him."

   Satan, you are deceived, the purpose of God is before you. "Ah, but,"
   said Satan, "he is mine, I will have him, I will go and take
   possession, he is mine." And so he is about to enter the vineyard and
   take possession of the vines of sour grapes, when lo, someone meets him
   on the threshold and says, "What are you doing here?" "I am come to
   take possession," says he. "Take possession," says Christ, "I have a
   claim upon this vineyard, I bought it and paid for it with drops of
   blood. What are you doing here? You say, 'I will possess this land,'
   whereas the Lord was there."

   And He shows the Fiend the print of the nails and points him to His
   wounded side and says, "Whatever your claim may be, Mine is a higher
   claim. I bought, I paid for, I have the acceptance from the Divine hand
   and this vessel of mercy was Mine. Mine long before you could have any
   claim upon it." "Yes, yes," says the devil, "but I have been providing
   for this soul that it shall lie in Hell forever. I have determined to
   put such-and-such temptations in its pathway that it may go on step by
   step till it makes its bed in Hell."

   "Ah," says the Lord, "I have been before you. If you have a providence
   so have I, and My Providence is older than yours. I have watched this
   man from the cradle even until now. And even when you have been leading
   him astray further and further from Me, I have overruled it all to
   bring him nearer and nearer to the predestined spot and to the
   appointed moment when the Eternal Council shall be fulfilled and that
   man shall be turned from darkness to light."

   Satan, no doubt, thinks he lays his plans very prettily. There is only
   this to deceive his calculations and baffle his designs--"Whereas the
   Lord was there." Perhaps the Evil One led you here this morning to
   ridicule the Gospel, but the Lord may be in it and you may be brought
   to His feet. I have known the devil lead men into sin and yet the very
   sin has been blessed of God to their conviction and conversion. I
   remember one whose life had been eminently moral before, who was
   self-righteous, but the devil led him into a trap and his fall opened
   his eyes to see the depravity of his heart. And so the devil had his
   head cut off with his own sword--he was taken in his own net.

   Beloved, whatever Satan may do in Providence, God is the Master of
   Providence, and He is waiting to be gracious, still. But the devil will
   say, "Yes, but I have him--I have got him now. I have put into his
   thoughts and into his mind all manner of falsehood and he is mine."
   "No," says Christ, "the Lord is there. He knows the Gospel--today is
   the Gospel preached in his ears--"believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and
   you shall be saved." "Yes," says the devil, "he may know it, but I have
   the power over him, I have my hand upon the bit and the bridle--I will
   manage and control him."

   But I trust the Lord will say to elect souls who are here this
   morning--"No, but I have the power over you. The Spirit of God shall go
   with the Word, to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power
   of sin and Satan unto God." And then shall it be said once more, "The
   dead soul had almost gone to Hell, but it could not go, for the Lord
   was there in the road to stop him in his ruinous career."

   Do I address a backslider--one who used to be a member of a Christian
   Church, but who has gone back to the world? Ah, poor Soul, if you ever
   were a child of God, you will come back, yet. You will never live at
   ease--you cannot live happily, I know. But by God's Grace you will not
   live to your life's end what you now are--if the Lord is in you. The
   devil may get you to give up the means of Divine Grace. He may lead you
   to attend the public house. He may tempt you to forget the Sabbath and
   to become as vile as other men. But if God is there, he will be cheated
   of his prey yet.

   At the last moment, if never before, I pray that you may hear the voice
   that says, "Return, return." O that you would hear it this morning!
   Come, Backslider, God has not cast you away! Having loved you with an
   everlasting love, He has not forgotten you. Come to His feet. Confess
   your wanderings and offenses and now, again, enter into His family and
   rejoice with joy unspeakable and fullness of glory! You cannot be
   ruined, for "the Lord is there." You shall be saved, for "the Lord is
   there," and will not leave you nor forsake you.

   IV. And now lastly--and this is but a hint. The same, dear Friends, is
   true with regard to THE ENTIRE WORLD. The world cannot be destroyed,
   because "Jehovah is there." This world once shone, like its sister
   stars, bright and fair. But a sad shadow of eclipse was thrown upon
   it--it became swathed in the mists of sin and though the glory of the
   Lord has risen upon it, yet still much of the gloom and the thick
   darkness continues. Shall that darkness cover all the nation? Shall the
   light become dim forever?

   No, no! "The whole creation groans and travails in pain together until
   now." Shall its groans and travails end in nothing? No, no. The day
   comes when, "The glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh
   shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it."

   There are signs which we sometimes think portend the speedy coming of
   the Son of Man, "when He shall stand in the latter day" upon Mount
   Olivet and reign with all His ancients gloriously. Then shall it be
   seen that since God in all ages was in the world with Patriarchs and
   Prophets, with Christ and His Apostles and with His Church throughout
   all time, there always was a reason why the world should yet be
   saved--why there should be a new Heaven and a new earth, wherein dwells
   righteousness.

   Despair not for the world, Beloved. Work on, hope on, pray on and
   expect every blessing, for God is in the earth still, and therefore it
   can never be the devil's globe--it can never be wholly given up to the
   enemy of Jehovah-Shammah, "the Lord is there." Now I do not know where
   the Great Master is about to conduct some of you. You are, perhaps,
   about to journey across the sea. You may have, some of you, to go to a
   bed of sickness, but remember I give you this for your cordial--"The
   Lord is there." It may be, Brothers and Sisters, some of you are
   appointed unto death, you are come to the borders of the dark valley.

   Or else, bereavement will befall you and you will have to visit and
   re-visit the grave with children and friends and relatives. Remember
   the Lord is there. Through floods and flames, if Jesus leads, I'll
   follow where He goes. Anywhere with Jesus! Anywhere with Jesus! Nowhere
   would I be without Him. If He says, "I am with you," then will I
   neither fear the floods nor the fires, nor death, nor life, nor things
   present, or things to come.

   This shall be my joyous trust and boast--"The Lord is there." God bless
   you. And in the school, the College and our beloved classes, may it be
   said, "the Lord is there." Amen.

                            Encourage Your Minister!

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 18, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT CORNWALL ROAD CHAPEL, BAYSWATER.

   "Encourage him." Deuteronomy 1:38.

   MOSES could not conduct the people into the promised land. Nor can the
   Law bring any man to Heaven. The Law may lead a man out of the Egypt of
   his sin, and it may bring him into the wilderness of conviction. There
   it may provide him with food and nourish him with some little comfort,
   but the Law can never give rest to the spirit into Canaan. Moses can
   never conduct the Israel of God. This was left for Joshua, whose name,
   you know, is but another form of the name, Jesus. As Joshua, alone,
   could drive the Canaanites out of the land, and give a portion to all
   the seed of Israel, so Jesus, alone, can give rest unto the heirs of
   Heaven.

   Moses cannot do it. He may see the promised land, but he can never
   enter it. Legal convictions may be accompanied with some desires
   towards Divine things, yes, and some apprehensions of their sweetness,
   too. But the ultimate enjoyment, the rest which remains for the people
   of God, can only come to the Believer through Jesus Christ. See here
   the weakness of the Law. It is not able to bring us to our rest. "By
   the works of the Law shall no flesh living be justified." Fly then, to
   Jesus. For He is the Captain of our salvation, by whom our foes shall
   be subdued and our everlasting inheritance secured.

   It is not, however, my purpose to explore the mystic truth which is
   couched beneath. I confine myself this morning to the moral on the
   surface. Joshua was a young man in comparison with Moses. He was about
   to undertake the onerous task of commanding a great people. He had,
   moreover, the difficult enterprise of leading them into the promised
   land, and chasing out the nations which possessed it. The Lord
   commanded Moses, therefore, to encourage Joshua, that in the prospect
   of great labor he might not be dismayed. This teaches us, I think, that
   GOD, EVEN OUR GOD, IS GRACIOUSLY CONSIDERATE OF HIS SERVANTS and would
   have them well fitted for high enterprise with good courage.

   He does not send them as a tyrant would send a soldier upon an errand
   for which he is not capable. Nor does He afterward withhold His succor,
   forgetful of the straits to which they may be reduced. But He is very
   careful of His servants and will not let one of them perish. He counts
   them as the apple of His eye, keeps them at all hours and defends them
   from all dangers. Why is this? The Lord our God has strong reasons for
   being thus considerate of His servants. Are they not His children? Is
   He not their Father? Does He not love them? If all human loves could be
   put together, they would scarcely make a drop in a bucket compared with
   the oceans of love which God the Father has towards His children.

   All mothers' loves, all the loves of friends, of brothers and of
   sisters, of husbands and of wives--if all piled together, would be a
   molehill, compared with the towering mountain of the Divine love which
   God the Father has towards His chosen. We are--and there is no other
   figure which sets forth the whole length and breadth of that love--we
   are as dear to God as His Only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ--

   "So dear, so very dear, to God I cannot dearer be;
   The love wherewith He loves His Son, such is His love for me."

   "As the Father has loved Me, even so have I loved you," said Christ.

   Now, none of us would send a child of ours upon a difficult enterprise
   without being anxious for his welfare. We would not put him upon a
   trial beyond his strength, without, at the same time, guaranteeing to
   stand at his side and make his strength equal to his day. Moreover, the
   Father Himself is concerned as to His honor in all that they do. If any
   servant of God shall fall, then God's name is despised. The daughters
   of Philistia would rejoice and the inhabitants of Ekron triumph. "Aha!
   Aha," they would say, "so we would have it! God's servants are put to
   the rout. Jehovah was not able to give them victory. They trusted in
   Him and they were confounded. They rested upon Him and they fell to the
   ground."

   Think not that the heavenly Father will ever permit this to be said.
   Will He ever send forth His servants to let them fall by the hand of
   the Adversary? He is too jealous of His great name. His honor is too
   much concerned ever to permit this. You feeble ones, to whom God has
   given to do or to suffer for His name's sake, rest assured that He has
   His eyes upon you now. He cannot leave you, unless He can cease to be
   "God over all, blessed forever." He cannot forget you, for His heart of
   love can never change, and the relationship which He has towards you
   can never be dissolved.

   Beloved, God the Father cares for His children because they are His
   children and because His honor is concerned in them. How sweet the
   thought--if I fail, God fails--if I succeed, being God's sent servant,
   God has all the honor. Could I lean on Him and fail, then to that
   degree God's purpose is not fulfilled, God's promise is not kept, God's
   Nature is not glorified. Oh, when you can fall back on the name, the
   renown, the very Character of God. When you can say, as Moses said upon
   the Mount, "What will You do for Your great name?" When you can plead
   as Luther did, "Lord, this is no quarrel of mine, it is Yours! You know
   You did put me to speak against Your foes and now if You leave me,
   where is Your Truth?" When you can plead with God in this way, surely
   He will rescue you. You cannot fail when your cause is God's cause.

   Nor is the Divine Father, alone, concerned. Is not the Son of God
   concerned in the welfare of His Brothers and Sisters? He has bought
   them with His blood. That which a man dearly purchases he will highly
   prize. If he did not, it would be as much as to confess that he had
   paid too costly a sum for what he bought. You are bought with a price.
   A price tremendous enough. The King of Glory gave His heart's blood to
   redeem poor worms like ourselves, but He will never confess that He
   gave too much for us. In love He will esteem the purchase equal to the
   price He paid. The love and the price are both infinite.

   As He looks upon any one of His people, He says, "There is My
   purchase," and He values you not so much for what you are intrinsically
   worth as because He sees the drops of His own blood upon you. "There,"
   says He, "is the travail of My soul. There is the Divine satisfaction
   My Father gives Me for the sufferings I endured." Do you think that
   when He thus values His servants He will leave them without His help?
   It cannot be. Moreover our blessed Lord has passed through precisely
   those very troubles to which He calls His people. "We have not a High
   Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities."
   "He was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin."

   The thorn in your foot pierced His heel before it touched you. The
   sorrow which sends the tears gushing from your eyes have first of all
   swollen His heart--

   "In every pang that rends the heart, The Man of Sorrows had a part."
   "In all their affliction He was afflicted and the angel of His Presence
   saved them." If you have been widowed, you feel a compassion for those
   who are brought into the like state, to which others who have never
   passed through it are strangers. Were you ever a fatherless child? I
   know you will love orphans. Now our Lord and Master was forsaken of His
   Father. "My God, My God, why have you forsaken Me?" He says. He has
   gone all the length of human grief, and therefore it is not possible
   that He should be inconsiderate concerning any one of His Beloved.

   Do you not know, to crown this point, that every Believer is actually a
   part of Christ? We are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His
   bones. Were the poor servants of God at Damascus persecuted? Christ
   suffered. "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?" To this very day our
   Head is in sympathy with us--

   "He feels at His heart all our sighs and our groans, For we are most
   near Him, His flesh and His bones." Do you think the Head will not care
   for the members? Shall I let my finger fester uncared for, until it
   needs to be cut away from mortification? Not while my brain can think,
   or my tongue can speak. And Jesus, so long as He can see His people and
   His tongue can make any intercession, will not let even the meanest
   member of His Mystical Body suffer for lack of supplies. Even as God
   cared for Joshua, so does Christ care for you this morning, beloved
   Member of the Body of Christ.

   Is not this sufficient argument--the Father's interest and the Son's?
   If not, remember the most blessed Spirit. He dwells in all the people
   of God. How can He dwell in them and not be mindful of them? We forget
   the sick and the poor because they live in a back street and we do not
   pass there. But you could not have poverty pining in your own house,
   methinks, without readiness to relieve it. You would not have sickness
   lying in your own chamber without showing sympathy. Now our body is the
   house of the Holy Spirit. He dwells in the body as in a temple, and do
   you think that He will see His people languish for lack of Divine Grace
   while He is present with them?

   Can it be that He will walk in them and see them famish, perceive their
   lack and destitution and not supply their wants? Dream not so harshly
   of the tender and blessed Spirit, whose name is "the Comforter." Be it
   never forgotten that it is His office to supply the wants of God's
   people. It is the Holy Spirit's business to see after the saints. "If I
   go away," said Jesus, "I will send the Comforter unto you." So long as
   they had the personal Presence of the Lord Jesus Christ, the disciples
   could want for nothing. As long as He had a crust of bread, they had
   half.

   If He had a place where to lay His head at any time given Him by
   charity, they could rest with Him. "Where I am there shall also My
   servant be," was Christ's loving rule. When He went away, then they
   were left like orphans until the Spirit of God came as another
   Comforter, "who should abide with them forever." Do you think that the
   Holy Spirit will neglect His office? O you weak and trembling Believer,
   do you imagine that God the Holy Spirit will be negligent of His sacred
   trust? Can you suppose that He has undertaken what He cannot, or will
   not, perform?

   Now if it is His business to work in you, to strengthen you, to
   illuminate you, to comfort you, do you suppose He has forgotten you?
   Why say you, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, "My way is hid from the Lord
   and my judgment is passed over by my God? Have you not known, have you
   not heard, that the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the
   earth, faints not, neither is weary." You are near to Him. Now His eyes
   are upon you. Like as a father pities His children, even so the Lord
   pities you. And like as a mother tenderly fondles her suckling, even so
   the Lord loves you. The heart of His love is yearning over you, pitying
   your sufferings, ready to help you in your distresses. Trust in Him and
   He will surely encourage you, and with your fears exchanged for faith,
   you shall triumph over every foe, and realize every promise.

   Observe well how far the tender consideration of God for His servants
   extends! He not only considers their outward state and the absolute
   interests of their condition, but He remembers their spirits and loves
   to see them of good courage. Some people think it a small thing for a
   Believer to be full of doubts and fears, but I do not think so. I
   perceive from this text that my Master would not have you entangled
   with fears. He would have you without carefulness, without doubt,
   without sorrow. He says, "Encourage him"--as much as if He had told
   Moses that it was an important thing for His servant Joshua to have his
   courage duly sustained.

   My Master does not think so lightly of your unbelief as you do. You are
   desponding this morning. Well, this is a grievous matter. My Lord loves
   not to see your countenance sad. It was a law, you remember, of
   Ahasuerus, that no one should come into the king's court dressed in
   mourning. But it is not the law of my Master, for you may come mourning
   as you are. But still He would have you put off those rags and that
   sackcloth, for surely there is much reason to rejoice. Rejoice in the
   Lord always! Be of good courage! Wait on the Lord, for He will renew
   your strength.

   The Christian man must have his spirits sustained in order that he may
   glorify the Lord. If his spirits are kept up, he will be able to endure
   trial upon trial. He comes to the fire, but it will never kindle upon
   him when his faith is firm. He walks through the rivers, but the floods
   never overflow him while he can look to his God. The sweetest songs
   Believers ever have are those they sing at night. God's people are like
   the nightingale--their music is best heard when the sun is gone down.
   Oh, how much depends on your spirit being supported! Let the spirit
   sink and a little trouble lays like a dead weight upon the soul.

   On the other hand, if faith is firm, tons of trouble become light as a
   feather. Unless the spirits of God's people are sustained, they will
   dishonor their God. They will think harsh things of Him, and perhaps
   they will speak harsh things against Him, and so the holy name of God
   will not be had in good repute. What a bad example it is! This disease
   of doubt and discouragement is an epidemic that soon spreads among the
   Lord's flock. One downcast Believer makes twenty sad. This phobia is a
   contagious species of madness as soon are men are bitten with it. If
   there is one doubt of the promise of God, straightway a whole
   congregation will begin to foam with like doubts.

   When Paul was in the ship and took bread and ate it in the midst of the
   storm, then all the crew were encouraged. But if Paul had been
   downcast, then, from the captain to the smallest cabin boy, there would
   have been great distress. Oh, be of good courage for the sake of your
   Brothers and sisters in Christ. When you would say a hard or bitter
   thing, keep it back as David did, lest he should offend against the
   generation of God's people. "When I thought to know this, it was too
   painful for me." Unless your courage is kept up, Satan will be too much
   for you.

   My experience teaches me that the cowardly old Tempter always comes
   upon us when we are in our worst state. If he would but meet me
   sometimes, I could drive him as chaff before the wind. But he will
   always meet me when an attack of bile, or some domestic trouble, or ill
   tidings in the camp hinder my cheerfulness. Then, sure enough, in some
   dark, narrow lane stands the arch-enemy, with his sword drawn and he
   swears he will spill the blood of my soul. But just let the heart be
   right, let the spirit be joyful in God my Savior and the joy of the
   Lord shall be your strength and no fiend of Hell shall make headway
   against you.

   Besides, labor is light to a man of cheerful spirit! You can work all
   day and almost all night when the spirits are right--but once let the
   heart sink and your soul lack encouragement--and then you grow weary
   and cry, "Would God it were evening and the shadows were drawn out,
   that we might rest from our toil." Success waits upon cheerfulness. The
   man who toils rejoicing in his God, believing with all his heart, has
   success guaranteed. He who sows in hope shall reap in joy. He who
   trusts in the Lord and laughs at impossibilities, shall soon find that
   there are no impossibilities to laugh at! To the man who is confident
   in Jehovah, all things are possible. It is thus of paramount importance
   that the spirits of the Christian should be constantly kept up. God so
   considers it. Thus says the Lord, "Encourage him." Make the good man's
   heart glad. Make the Believer sing with joy. "Encourage him."

   II. Secondly, we remark that GOD USES HIS OWN PEOPLE TO ENCOURAGE ONE
   ANOTHER. He did not say to the angel, "Gabriel, there is My servant
   Joshua, about to take the people into Canaan--fly down and encourage
   him." God never works needless miracles. If His purposes can be
   accomplished by ordinary means, He will certainly accomplish them
   without using miraculous energy. Gabriel would have not been half so
   well fitted for the work as Moses. A Brother's sympathy is more
   precious than an angel's embassy.

   The angel, swift of wing, had better known the Master's bidding than
   the people's temper. An angel had never experienced the hardness of the
   road, nor seen the fiery serpents. Nor had he led the stiff-necked
   multitude in the wilderness. Moses felt it all. For my part, I am glad
   to think that God does His work by man. It gives us such a bond of
   brotherhood. We must be dependent on one another. We need condolence in
   our grief. And we invite companionship in our joys. So, being mutually
   dependent on one another's countenance and counsel, we are fused more
   completely into one mass and made more thoroughly one family.

   To whom, then, should this work of encouraging the people be committed?
   Surely the elders should do it. Those of riper years than their
   fellows. I know some aged persons, who whenever they see a young
   Christian, make it a point to inform him of all the difficulties and
   perils of the road. Like Mistrust and Timorous, they have always a
   doleful story to tell about the way to Heaven. This was the old style
   of Christian in many of our Churches.

   For my part, I think that the aged Christian is better employed in
   looking after the lambs of the flock and trying to carry them in their
   bosoms. Talk cheerily to the young and anxious enquirer. Lovingly try
   to remove stumbling blocks out of his way. When you find a spark of
   Divine Grace in the heart, kneel down and blow it into a flame. Leave
   the young Believer to discover the roughness of the road by degrees.
   Tell him of the strength which dwells in God, of the sureness of the
   promise, of the delightfulness of fellowship with Jesus, of the charms
   of communion with Christ. Entice the young Christian on as good mothers
   teach their children to walk by holding out here a sweet, and there
   some tempting thing, that they may put their trembling feet one after
   the other and at last know how to walk.

   I would that every Church had many of these aged Brothers and Sisters,
   fathers and mothers in Israel, who take this for their motto whenever
   they see a young Christian,--"Encourage him." I know of nothing more
   inspiriting than to hear the experience of a gray-headed saint. I have
   found much spiritual comfort in sitting at the feet of my venerable
   grandfather, more than eighty years of age. The last time I saw him, I
   said to him, "I suppose you have had many trials, Grandfather?" He
   said, "I have not had too many and the most of what I have had, I have
   made myself."

   "And do you think that God will ever leave His people?" I asked. "No,"
   he said, "for if He would leave one of them, He would have left me. But
   He is a faithful God, and I have proved Him, for I have known His love
   more than seventy years, and yet He has been faithful to me. Not one
   good thing has failed of all that the Lord God has promised." Why, it
   comes home to the hearts of us young people and makes us feel that we
   have found something which it is safe to depend upon when those who
   have gone through the valley can bear such a word of testimony as this!

   Do not let a word of peevishness come out of your mouth, my aged
   Brothers and Sisters. Let no syllable of complaining ever escape you.
   Let your mouth be filled with your Lord's praises and with His honor
   all the day and so you will encourage others.

   Not the aged only, but the wise in the family should be comforters. All
   Believers are not equal in knowledge. Some are quick of apprehension in
   the ways of the Lord. They rapidly acquire doctrinal knowledge. And
   experimental knowledge comes to them with a brighter light than it does
   to duller intellects. There are in all our Churches those who never
   will be doctors of divinity. Though they know right well that they are
   sinners and that Christ saves them, and so their acceptance is secured,
   if you talk to them about the mysteries of the Gospel they will soon
   get into depths where they lose their footing, for they have not
   learned to swim.

   Perhaps they will never be able to understand, or at least to
   appreciate, the doctrine of election. Now, wiser men should not keep
   their knowledge to themselves. Above all they should not use it to
   criticize. I could tell of men who carry knowledge like a sword. They
   listen to the sermon and when they meet some friend who gained a little
   good from it, they will cavil. They say, "Oh, the first or the third
   point I did not think quite sound." They will be sure to have something
   to say that will knock the bread from the mouths of those who are
   willing to eat. They are more knowing than wise.

   Moses was wise in doctrinal knowledge. With what consummate wisdom he
   addressed Joshua. "Be strong and of a good courage--for you must go
   with this people unto the land which the Lord has sworn unto their
   fathers to give them. And you shall cause them to inherit it. And the
   Lord, He it is that does go before you. He will be with you. He will
   not fail you, neither forsake you--fear not, neither be dismayed." Oh
   you that have searched the Scriptures through and know its
   promises--you that have been among these beds of spices and whose
   garments smell of frankincense, be sure to quote the promises of God to
   trembling hearts, and especially to those engaged in arduous labor for
   the Master.

   Comfort them. Repeat the doctrine of God's faithfulness. Say to them,
   "He will be with you. He will not fail you, neither forsake you--fear
   not, neither be dismayed." Oh that the wise-hearted in the Lord's
   family would be thus employed at all times!

   Nor can I doubt that the happier sort of Christians ought always to be
   engaged in comforting the mournful and sorrowing. You know whom I mean.
   Their eyes always sparkle! Wherever they go they carry lamps bright
   with animation. Sunshine gleams in their faces. They live in the light
   of God's Countenance. We have some of a more somber countenance, good
   people, too. They always see the black side of affairs. Now, you who
   are happy, try to encourage those that are downcast. Oh, dear Friends,
   I am afraid we neglect this duty, many of us.

   You will say, "How can I perform it?" Speak a kind word always. Find
   out those who are weary and give them a word of consolation. Even a
   smile from your face may do them good. Do not avoid them because they
   are melancholy, but rather pursue them. Hunt them out. Do not let them
   be quiet in their nest of thorns. If the Lord has given it to you to
   soar aloft into the clear blue ether, try to carry your friend with you
   and lift him above the clouds. Suppose your house is on a hill and he
   lives down in the marsh, ask him to climb the hill and stay with you.

   Perhaps you have the keys of the promise. Use the key and open the door
   for him. It is just possible that you may live in the upper story where
   you can see further and behold more of the blessed land. Ask him to
   come up from his cellar and walk on the roof of your palace and scan
   the prospect through your telescope, "Encourage him."

   Let the Brother of low degree be likewise encouraged by these who are
   rich among you. You may frequently breathe comfort into a desponding
   spirit by seasonable help. The destitute will think himself rich upon
   your leavings. Perhaps your poor Brother thinks you look down upon him
   because you are better off than he is--try to prevent his thinking so.
   If God has blessed you with a good position in Providence, be ready to
   encourage those that are poor and needy. Oh, if all these things I have
   been counseling should be put in practice, what a vast amount of
   happiness, by God's Grace, would be created! Our Churches would be more
   like families.

   I do not like people to come into a place of worship like so many
   icebergs floating out to sea and wishing to avoid each other. I like to
   see all distinctions broken down, except the distinctions of superior
   Grace and those only observed because one Brother has cast in more to
   the common treasury of the Church of spiritual riches than another can
   do. I like those who fear the Lord to speak often to one another. We
   are getting into a bad state when they who fear the Lord speak often
   against one another. I believe that this one practice of encouraging
   each other might restore to the Churches that holy fraternity and
   blessed love which once distinguished them.

   I am sure this would enrich you all. It is by commerce that countries
   grow rich. France sends her exports to England and England repays her
   with abundance. The labor of the humble and the skill and enterprise of
   the lofty contribute to the great commonwealth. An exchange of thought
   tends to help. A stream of holy wealth would flow through our Churches
   if each one would seek the other out with this aim of holy
   encouragement. How many a good thing is strangled in birth! How many a
   good enterprise is dashed to pieces on the shoals before it gets out to
   sea.

   Encourage that loving-hearted Sister who thinks that she might at least
   take an infant-class in the Sunday school. Encourage that aged woman
   who has but little talent, but who yet might go from house to house to
   attend the sick. Encourage that poor struggling tradesman who would do
   something for the Master if he could by any means be delivered from the
   constant cares which harass him. Encourage every soul that has a spark
   of Divine Grace in it. Labor to help others and you shall find a most
   gracious return in your own soul. God encourages you. Christ encourages
   you as He points to the Heaven He has won for you. The Spirit
   encourages you as He works in you to will and to do of His own will and
   pleasure. Do you then act the Divine part and go forth to encourage
   others, according to the motto, "Encourage him."

   III. I advance to THE OBJECT that is uppermost in my mind. It struck me
   some six weeks ago that I might say a few things to my Brother's
   congregation which he might not like to say himself. And that as his
   was a new enterprise--and I am sure all our hearts anxiously desire it
   the very richest success--I might possibly take the liberty of saying a
   few things to you, the congregation clustering around this pulpit,
   which may be useful in the future of the Church. I shall speak of him
   as a stranger, as I should speak of any other young man anxious to
   build up a Church and glorify his Master.

   I believe there is a special occasion for the exercise of this duty of
   encouraging one another in the case of the minister and Church in this
   place. It is a fresh enterprise surrounded with peculiar difficulties
   and demanding special labor. "Why," you say, "should a minister need
   encouraging? We have plenty of troubles all the week long with our
   losses here and crosses there. We want encouragements, but surely
   ministers do not." Ah, if you want to have a refutation of that idea
   you had better come into this pulpit and occupy it a little time. If
   you would like to exchange, I would truly say that so far as the
   pleasure of my voice is concerned, apart from the spiritual joy my Lord
   gives me, I would change places with a crossing-sweeper, or a man who
   breaks stones on the road.

   Let a man carry out the office of a Christian minister aright and he
   will never have any rest. "God help," says Richard Baxter, "the man who
   thinks the minister has an easy life." Why, he works not only all day,
   but in his sleep you will find him weeping for his
   congregation--starting in his sleep with his eyes filled with tears, as
   if he had the weight of his congregation's sins resting on his heart
   and could not bear the load. I would not be that man in the ministry
   who does not feel himself so fearfully responsible that if he could
   escape from the ministry by going with Jonah into the depths of the
   sea, he would cheerfully do it.

   For if a minister is what he should be, there is such a weight of
   solemn concern, such a sound of trembling in his ears that he would
   choose any profession or any work, however arduous, sooner than the
   preacher's post. "If the watchman warn them not they shall perish, but
   their blood will I require at the watchman's hands." To sit down and
   ponder over the question--"Am I free of his blood?" is terrible. I have
   sometimes thought I must have a day or two of rest, but I frankly
   confess that rest is very little rest to me, for I think I hear the
   cries of perishing souls, the wailings of spirits going down to Hell,
   who chide me thus--"Preacher, can you rest? Minister, can you be
   silent? Ambassador of Jesus, can you cast aside the robes of your
   office? Up! And to your work again."

   As Mr. Whitfield said, when he thought of the ministry and what was
   concerned in it, he wanted to stand on the top of every hackney coach
   in London and preach the Gospel as he rode along. It is a work so
   solemn that if you do not encourage your minister, your minister will
   probably sink down in despair. Remember that the man, himself, needs
   encouragement, because he is weak. Who is sufficient for these things?
   To serve in any part of the spiritual army is dangerous, but to be a
   captain is to be doubly exposed. The most of the shots are aimed at the
   officers. If Satan can find a flaw in our character, then it will be,
   "Publish it, publish it, publish it!" If he can lend us to keep back a
   doctrine or go amiss in practice, or wander in experience, he is glad
   enough.

   How delighted is the devil to break the vessels of mercy. Pray for the
   poor minister, whom you expose to perish, if you do not preserve him by
   supplication. If there were a ship at sea stranded and broken on the
   rocks and someone volunteered to carry a rope to the sinking crew, you,
   standing on the shore, could do no more--methinks you could not do
   less--than cry, "O God! Help him to bear the rope to that wrecked
   ship." Pray for the minister and encourage him, for there are plenty to
   discourage him. There are always carping spirits abroad who will remind
   him of any fault. He will be afflicted by those cowards who will not
   dare to sign their names to a letter, but send it to him anonymously.

   And then there is the devil, who, the moment the man has got out of the
   pulpit, will say, "There is a poor sermon! You will never dare to
   preach it again." After he has been preaching for weeks there will come
   a suggestion, "You are not in your proper sphere of labor." There are
   all sorts of discouragements to be met with. Professing Christians will
   backslide. Those who do remain will often be inconsistent, and he will
   be sighing and crying in his closet, while you, perhaps, are thanking
   God that your souls have been fed under him.

   Encourage your minister, I pray you, wherever you attend--encourage him
   for your own sakes. A discouraged minister is a serious burden upon the
   congregation. When the fountain gets out of order, you cannot expect to
   find water at any of the taps. And if the minister is not right, it is
   something like a steam engine in a great factory--everybody's loom is
   idle when the power is out of order.

   See that he is resting upon God and receiving His Divine power and you
   will all know, each Sunday, the benefit of it. This is the least thing
   you can do. There are many other things which may cause you expense,
   effort, time--but to encourage your minister is so easy, so simple a
   matter, that I may well press upon you to do it.

   Perhaps you will say, "Well, if it is so simple and easy, tell us, who
   are expecting to settle down in this place, how we can encourage the
   minister here." Well, you can do it in several ways. You can encourage
   him by very constant attendance. By the way, looking round here, I
   think I know some of the persons present who belong to neighboring
   Chapels.

   What business have you here? Why did you leave your own minister? If I
   see one come into my place from the congregation of another Brother in
   the ministry, I would like just to give him a flea in his ear such as
   he may never forget. What business have you to leave your minister? If
   everyone were to do so, how discouraged the poor man would be! Just
   because somebody happens to come into this neighborhood, you will be
   leaving your seats?

   A compliment to me, you say. I thank you for it. But now, in return,
   let me give you this advice--these who are going from place to place
   are of no use to anybody. But those are the truly useful men who, when
   the servants of God are in their places, keep to theirs and let
   everybody see that whoever discourages the minister, they will not, for
   they appreciate his ministry.

   Again, let me say by often being present at the Prayer Meetings you can
   encourage the minister. You can always tell how a Church is getting on
   by the Prayer Meetings. I will almost prophecy the kind of sermon on
   the Sunday from the sort of Prayer Meeting on the Monday. If many come
   up to the House of God and they are earnest, the pastor will get a
   blessing from on High. It cannot but be, for God opens the windows of
   Heaven to believing prayer. Never fail to plead for your pastor in your
   closet.

   Oh, dear Friends, when you mention a father's name and a child's name,
   let the minister's name come forth, too. Give him a large share in your
   heart, and both in private and public prayer, encourage him. Encourage
   him, again, by letting him know if you have received any good. Oh, if
   there should come into this House of Prayer a sinner needing a Savior
   and not knowing the way, and my Brother's words shall point him to the
   Savior's Cross. If he should be the means of showing you what faith
   means and of leading you to believe in Him who has reconciled us unto
   God by His death, do not conceal the good news--come and tell it!

   The best way to do it will be by proposing to be united with the Church
   in fellowship. Our Church Meeting nights, when we receive fresh
   candidates into fellowship, are the harvest nights in the Christian
   ministry. Then we see how God's cause prospers in our hand. But if many
   in the Church who have been converted fail to let the minister know it
   and hold back, how is the poor man to be comforted?

   I know I address some here--God's people--who have never made a
   profession. Suppose all God's people did as you do? And they have as
   much right to do it as you have. How, I ask you, would the ministry
   itself be maintained? How could ministers' hearts be kept from
   breaking, if they never knew of any conversions? Make haste! Do not put
   it off! Delay not to keep God's commandments, but come forward at once
   and be baptized, and acknowledge what God has done for your soul.

   Again, you can all encourage the minister by the consistency of your
   lives. I do not know when I ever felt more gratified than on one
   occasion, when sitting at a Church Meeting, having to report the death
   of a young Brother who was in the service of an eminent employer, a
   little note came from him to say, "My servant, Edward_, is dead. I send
   you word at once, that you may send me another young man. For if your
   members are such as he was, I never wish to have better servants around
   me."

   I read the letter at the Church Meeting and another was soon found. It
   is a cheering thing for the Christian minister to know that his
   converts are held in repute. Of another member of my Church an ungodly
   employer said, "I do not think anything of him. He is of no use to
   anybody. He cannot tell a lie!" Oh, that is the honor which a Christian
   minister longs and pants after, to have consistent followers, to have
   those listening to him who will adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.

   Gather round my Brother, all of you, and encourage him, by earnestly
   aiding and abetting him in every good word and work. There is a
   neighborhood here, I am told, requiring evangelization. Here we have,
   side-by-side, poverty and riches. Shall not yonder wretched potteries
   be the better for the building of this House of Prayer? I am sure my
   friend, Sir Morton Peto, would think he had wasted his money if it were
   merely for the gathering of a congregation and not for improving the
   neighborhood.

   We build our Houses of Prayer always with a view to the people round
   about. We believe it is like opening a well in the wilderness, or an
   oasis in the desert, or placing a drinking fountain where thirsty souls
   may drink. It is introducing a new physician into the neighborhood to
   attend to the diseases and sickness of souls. Oh, how my heart yearns
   after the success of this house--not only because the minister is my
   blood brother, and also my Brother in Christ, but because he is a
   valiant soldier of Christ.

   To preach the Truth of God he has not hesitated to make himself a
   multitude of enemies elsewhere and will not be ashamed to do the same
   here, if the same case should occur. I honor him because he has honored
   my Master. And I expect that you will get from him the Truth, the whole
   Truth and nothing but the Truth--so far as God has taught it to him. I
   know he is ready to lay down his own neck for the conversion of souls.
   I know his earnestness to do anything for the conversion of sinners.

   And if you do not encourage him, you will bring down upon your head
   every curse of those who reject the Prophet of God. But encouraging
   him, you will see a Church flocking around him which shall last long
   after our time. It shall be a perennial stream of benediction to ages
   yet unborn, until Christ Himself shall come and consummate the kingdom,
   by reigning Himself in Person among the sons of men. May the Lord grant
   His blessing!

   Some of you cannot encourage the minister. You can encourage no one,
   for you are not born again yourselves. Oh, if you have not passed from
   death unto life, the first thing that can encourage him is to begin to
   think about your own state. Where are you? What are you? Out of God,
   out of Christ, out of safety? You will be out of life and out of
   Heaven--shut in the pit forever, except you repent. Oh, you will
   encourage the preacher, if the Lord leads you, to consider your ways
   and turn from sin and from self-righteousness, too. Look to the
   Almighty Savior, able to save unto the uttermost all among you who
   shall trust Him. May the Lord add a blessing, for Christ's sake. Amen.

                          Caleb--The Man For The Times

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 1, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But My servant Caleb, because he had another spirit in him and has
   followed Me fully, him will I bring into the land he went. And his seed
   shall possess it." Numbers 14:24.

   IT is a rough name that--"Caleb." Most translators say it signifies "a
   dog." But what matters a man's name? Possibly the man himself was
   somewhat rough--many of the heartiest of men are so. As the unpolished
   oyster yet bears within itself the priceless pearl, so oftentimes
   ruggedness of exterior covers worth. A dog, moreover, is not all
   badness, though, "Without are dogs and sorcerers." It has this virtue,
   that it follows its master. And therein this Caleb was well-named. For
   never dog so followed his master as Caleb followed his God.

   As we have seen the faithful dog following his master when he is on
   horseback through mud and mire and dirt, for many a weary mile, even
   though the horses heels might wound him, so Caleb keeps close to God.
   And even if stoning threatens him, yet is he well content to follow the
   Lord fully. The name, however, has another signification and we like it
   rather better--it means "All heart." Here was a fitting surname for the
   man, whose whole heart followed his God. He says himself that he
   brought a report of the land according to all that was in his heart.

   He was a man of a healthy and mighty spirit. He did nothing
   heartlessly. His spirit was not the Laodicean luke-warmness, which is
   neither hot nor cold, which God spits out of His mouth--it was a spirit
   of holy heat, of noble daring. If I may not call him lion-hearted,
   never lion had a braver heart than he. Many mortals appear to have no
   heart. They are like corporations of which we are often told that a
   corporation has a head--does it not have a new mayor every year? And
   yet who ever saw it blush?

   It certainly has a mouth, for it swallows much--and hands, for it can
   grasp much--and feet, for it takes long strides. But whoever heard of a
   corporation with either heart or conscience? In the same manner it may
   be said of many persons--they have a head to understand and think, and
   feet to move and hands to act, but heart of compassion and a feeling
   heart they have not. Doubtless you have seen--doubtless you have met
   persons without hearts. The moment you come into their company you
   perceive what they are, as readily as the voyager on the Atlantic knows
   when there is an iceberg in the neighborhood--by the sudden chill which
   comes over him.

   You shake the man's hand--it drops into your hand as cold as a dead
   fish. The man's blood is cold as a December frost. You talk with him,
   but no effort on your part can stir the frozen current of his soul. You
   begin to speak to him about religion--which he professes to love so
   much--his words are few, his syllables faint, for his heart is not in
   the matter. Others we have the privilege of knowing--I trust there are
   many such in this community--who cannot talk of Jesus without emotion--

   "Their pulse with pleasure bounds, The Master's name to hear."

   If they sing, they wake up their glory, saying, with David, "Awake,
   psaltery and harp. I myself will awake right early." If they pray, it
   is the wrestling prayer of Jacob at the brook Jabbok. And if they serve
   their God, they carry out the words of the Apostles, "Whatever you do,
   do it heartily, as unto God and not unto man." It is a hearty Caleb,
   then. We will rather interpret his name this way than the other. But if
   we put both together, he shall be a dog for faithfully following his
   God, but he shall be all heart, because he so fully follows his Lord.

   There are three things about Caleb worthy of consideration,
   then--first, his faithful following. Secondly, his favored reward. And
   thirdly, his inner character--that which was the secret source of his
   following God, namely, that "he had another spirit."

   I. First, then, let this brave veteran stand before us. Let us look at
   him and learn something of HIS FAITHFUL FOLLOWING OF HIS GOD. Perceive,
   Beloved, he never went before his God. That is presumption. The highest
   point to which the true Believer ever comes is to walk with God, but
   never to walk before Him. It is true that we walk before the Lord in
   the land of the living, but that is in another sense, meaning under His
   eyes. We never run before God so as to outrun His Providence and become
   the directors of our own steps.

   They who travel before the cloud will soon find other clouds lowering
   upon them. Those who leave the fiery pillar and will be their own
   guides, shall soon be in the fire, without a guide to bring them out
   again. We ought to follow the Lord. The sheep follow the shepherd. "He
   puts forth His own sheep," says Christ, "and goes before them, and they
   follow Him." They follow as the soldier follows the captain--he points
   the road, leads the van and bears the thick of the danger--while the
   faithful warrior keeps close behind.

   They follow as the disciple follows the Master, not teaching, nor
   discussing, nor disputing, but sitting at His feet, believing that when
   He leads in the way of knowledge, it is a true and a right way, whereas
   if we seek to be wise beyond what is written, we make unto ourselves
   pits and traps and fall into a snare. Caleb followed the Lord. Many
   others do the same, but then they can not win that adverb, which is
   Caleb's golden medal. He followed the Lord, "fully," says one text,
   "wholly," says another.

   Some of us follow the Lord, but it is a great way off, like Peter, or
   now and then as did Saul the king. We are not constant. We have not
   given our whole heart to God. The essence, then, of the man's faithful
   following lies in the adverb--"fully." And here, by your leave, in
   explaining this word "wholly." I shall follow the explanation of good
   Matthew Henry. I cannot think of a better, nor even of one so good,
   myself.

   1. He followed the Lord wholly, that is, first of all, he followed Him
   universally, without dividing. Whatever his Master told him to do, he
   did--

   "In all the Lord's appointed ways His journey he pursued."

   He did not say, "I will perform this duty and neglect the other. I will
   be faithful to my conscience and to my God upon this point, but that
   shall be left unto another day." He took the Commandments as he found
   them and if they were ten he did not desire to make them nine. Nor did
   he want to change their order and put that second which God had put
   first. He did not wish to divide the commands. What God had joined
   together, he did not desire to put asunder. He followed the Lord
   without picking and choosing, being universally obedient to his
   Master's Law.

   Brethren, I wish we could say the same of all professed Christians. You
   see Caleb was quite as ready to fight the giants as he was to carry the
   clusters. We have a host who are ready for sweet duties. Pleasant
   exercises and spiritual engagements which bring joy and peace are
   always very acceptable. But as for the fighting of giants--how many
   say, "I pray you have me excused." To defend Christ's cause against
   adversaries, to submit themselves to rebuke, to go up single-handed and
   fight against the Lord's foes--from this the many will draw back and we
   are afraid there are some that draw back unto perdition, because they
   have never had the perfect heart given to them which is obedient to God
   in all His will.

   If you have a servant who will choose which of your commands she will
   obey, she is rather the mistress than the servant. If you, dear
   Brother, shall say concerning the Lord's will, "I will do this and I
   will not do that," you do in fact make yourself master. The spirit of
   rebellion is in you, you have already erred and strayed from your
   Lord's ways and set up the standard of revolt. Mind that you do not
   pierce yourself through with many sorrows. Some excuse themselves for
   neglecting duties on the ground that they are non-essential--as if all
   duty was not essential to the perfect follower of Christ.

   "They are unimportant," says the man, "they involve nothing." Whereas
   it often happens that the apparently unimportant duty is really the
   most important of all. Many a great lord, in the olden times, has given
   up his land on copyhold to his tenant. And perhaps the fee which was to
   be annually paid was to bring a small bird, or a peppercorn--in some
   cases it has been the bringing of a turf, or a green leaf. Now, if the
   tenant should on the annual day refuse to do his homage and say it was
   too trifling a thing to bring a peppercorn to the lord of the manor in
   fee, would he not have forfeited his estate? Thus he would have been
   setting himself up as superior owner and asserting a right which his
   feudal lord would at once resist.

   It is even so--to quote a single instance--in the matter of Believer's
   Baptism. When the Believer says, "Well, surely this is but a small
   thing, I may safely neglect it," does he not therein deny unto his
   Sovereign Lord and Master that act of homage which, though it is simple
   in itself, is nevertheless full of meaning, because it is an
   acknowledgment of the superior rights of the great King? Who told you
   it was nonessential? Who bade you neglect it? Surely it must be a
   spirit of darkness that talked with you!

   The Jew of old must not neglect circumcision. His child shall be cut
   off from the congregation of Israel unless the painful rite be
   performed. He must not refuse the paschal supper, for if he does, the
   destroying angel shall smite his household. And in that Passover
   everything must be observed. Not a bone must be broken. The creature
   must not be eaten raw, nor sodden at all with water. It must be roasted
   in the fire. It must be eaten with bitter herbs. There are minute
   particulars given and every one of these having the solemn command of
   God upon them are to be carefully observed by the children of Israel
   throughout all generations.

   Surely it must be so with Christian ordinances and with the commands of
   the King of Heaven. We cannot violate them with impunity. The spirit
   which would prompt us to neglect one of the least of them is of the
   devil and leads down to Hell--a spirit of partial obedience is a spirit
   of radical disobedience. The old Prophet did but eat and drink at
   Bethel and that, too, as he thought, upon prophetic authority, and yet
   the lion slew him because he rebelled against the express bidding of
   God.

   We are not to imitate the Pharisee who tithed the mint, anise and
   cummin, and then neglected the weightier matters of the Law, but we are
   to remember that Jesus said, "These things ought you to have done and
   not to have left the other undone." So that mint and anise and cummin,
   are still to be tithed. And still in the little as well as in the great
   our obedience to God is to be carried out. Take care, dear Friends,
   that, like Caleb, you follow the Lord fully, that is, universally,
   without dividing.

   Now may I put a question of conscience to all around me? Is there not
   something that I know to be my Master's will which I have not done?
   Brothers and Sisters, is there not some command which as yet you have
   not obeyed? Some self-denying duty which you have shirked, some holy
   engagement for the good of your fellow men, or for your Lord's glory,
   which you have carelessly avoided? If it is so, do, I pray you, see to
   it, for you can never have the blessing of Caleb till you have the
   complete and universal spirit of obedience which Caleb had.

   2. But secondly, Caleb followed the Lord fully, that is, sincerely
   without dissembling. He was no hypocrite. He followed the Lord with his
   whole heart. One of the safest tests of sincerity is found in a
   willingness to suffer for the cause. I suppose that the twelve spies
   met each other in the south part of the land and held a little
   consultation as to what should be the report they would bring up. Like
   twelve jurymen they were now to bring in their verdict and ten of them
   were agreed--"It is a land that flows with milk and honey, but it eats
   up its inhabitants. It is full of giants with cities walled up to
   Heaven and it is impossible for us to take possession of it."

   Caleb and Joshua both dissent from that verdict. I cannot tell what
   were the arguments and the reasonings, what the bantering and the jests
   and the jeers, to which Caleb was exposed from the other ten princes.
   But we do know that when they came to give in their verdict Caleb dared
   to stand forth, alone, and declare that such was not his testimony.
   Joshua appears to have said nothing, probably from prudential reasons,
   because, being the servant of Moses, the people would attach less
   importance to what he said, arguing that he was sure to take part with
   Moses and would be biased by his superior.

   Therefore Caleb stood out alone and took the brunt of the tumult. How
   courageous was that man, who had only numbered forty summers, to put
   himself in opposition to the other ten princes and declare in flat
   contradiction to them--"Let us go up. We are able to possess the land."
   When the people took up stones and Joshua was forced to speak with
   Caleb, it was with no small peril and required no little mental courage
   to stand up amidst the insults and jeers of the crowd and still to
   bring up a good report of the land. Caleb followed the Lord sincerely.

   O Beloved, how many profess to follow God who follow Him without their
   hearts! The semblance of religion is often dearer to men than religion
   itself. As one says, many a man has spent five hundred pounds upon a
   picture of a beggar by Murillo, or a brigand by Salvator Rosa, who
   would not give a penny to a real beggar and go out of their wits at the
   sight of a brigand. The picture of religion, the outward name of it,
   men will give much to maintain. But the reality of relig-ion--ah, that
   is quite a different thing.

   Many of our Churches are surmounted with the Cross in stone, but how
   few of the worshippers care to take up the Cross of Christ daily and
   follow Him. We know religious men who are respected by the ungodly, not
   for their religion, but on account of some adventitious circumstance.
   It was not the religion itself they cared for. If you should take a
   bear in a cage into a town, men will pay their money to see it, but let
   it loose among them and they will pay twice as much money to get rid of
   it. So sometimes if a religious man has gift or ability, there are many
   who will regard and admire him, but not for his religion.

   Let the religion itself come abroad in the daily actions of his life
   and then straightway they begin to abhor him. There is much false love
   to Jesus--much unhallowed profession. Let us remember, however, that
   the day is coming when all false profession will be destroyed. The fan
   in Christ's hands will leave none of the chaff remaining upon the wheat
   heap and the great fire will not suffer a single particle of dross to
   be unconsumed. Happy shall that man be whose faith was a real faith,
   whose repentance was sincere, whose obedience was true, who gave his
   heart, his whole heart to his Master's cause!

   3. The third point is most noteworthy. Caleb followed the Lord wholly,
   that is, cheerfully without disputing. Those who serve God with a sad
   countenance, because they do what is unpleasant to them, are not His
   servants at all. Our God requires no slaves to grace His Throne. He is
   the Lord of the empire of love. The angels of God serve Him with songs,
   not with groans. And God loves to have the joyful obedience of His
   creatures. In fact I will venture to say that that obedience which is
   not cheerful is disobedience, for the Lord looks at the heart of a
   thing and if He sees that we serve Him from force and not because we
   love Him, He will reject our offering.

   That service which is coupled with cheerfulness is hearty service, and
   therefore true. Take away joy from the Christian and you have taken
   away, I believe, that which is the test of his sincerity. If a man is
   driven to battle, he is no patriot, but he that marches into the fray
   with flashing eye and beaming face, singing, "It is sweet for one's
   country to die," proves himself to be sincere in his patriotism.
   Cheerfulness, again, makes a man strong in service. It is to our
   service what oil is to the wheels of a railway carriage. Without its
   proportion of oil, the axle soon grows hot and accidents occur. And if
   there is not a holy cheerfulness to oil our wheels, we shall not be
   able to serve God with anything like power.

   The man who is cheerful in his service of God proves that obedience is
   his element. I have seen the sea birds in stormy weather flying over
   the land with their huge heavy flapping wings. What a contrast between
   them and the lark, which, as it mounts to Heaven makes its wings
   vibrate many times in a moment, while these heavy broad-winged
   creatures fly as if they could not fly. They are out of their element.
   They long till again they shall be swimming upon the sea.

   Some men in the service of God are like these heavy swans. Their wing
   goes every now and then with a sort of dying flap--there is no
   sprightliness of life in them. They are out of their element. Now God
   will never receive at our hands an obedience which is not consistent
   with our nature. Understand me, if it were possible for a man with an
   unspiritual nature, with a fallen nature, to perform the very same work
   which is performed by a saint, his nature would mar his act. God looks
   at the nature from which the act comes, and if He sees that it comes
   from a spiritual, renewed, regenerated nature, then He recognizes that
   obedience is our element and so accepts our service.

   Let me put this question round among you all. Brothers and Sisters, do
   you serve the Lord cheerfully? Frequently people give to the cause of
   God because they are asked. A guinea is dragged out of them. Do you
   think God cares for your guinea? You might as well have kept it. No
   blessing can come to you. When you give to the cause of God, do it
   cheerfully. He that gives must not give grudgingly, or else he has
   offered an unacceptable offering unto God. When you come out to week
   night services, do you come because you should come, or do you love to
   come? This is the mark of the genuine child of God, the true
   Caleb--that he can sing--

   "Make me to walk in Your commands It is a delightful road." The man has
   his heart right, he feels at home in the work of the Lord! Here is his
   joy--

   "It is love that makes our cheerful feet In swift obedience move."
   Caleb was one of those who served the Lord cheerfully.

   4. But now there is a fourth point, he followed the Lord constantly
   without declining. Having begun when he first started upon the search
   to exercise a truthful judgment, he persevered during the forty days of
   his spying and brought back a true report. Forty-five years he lived in
   the camp of Israel, but all that time he followed the Lord and never
   once consorted with murmuring rebels. And when his time came to claim
   his heritage at the age of eighty-five, the good old man is following
   the Lord fully. Still his speech betrays him. He shows a constant
   heart. God set his seal upon that man's soul in his youthful days and
   he remained his God's when gray hairs adorned his brow.

   Beloved, how many professors fail in this respect? They follow the Lord
   by fits and starts. They go out from us because they are not of us. For
   if they had been of us, doubtless they would have continued with us.
   They leap into religion as the flying fish leaps into the air. They
   fall back again into their sins, as the same fish returns to its
   element. They make a great name for a time like the crackling of
   thorns, but lo, the flame has soon expired, for they are not like the
   miraculous bush which burned, God dwells not in them!

   Caleb was kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation. He
   could say with Jude, "Now unto Him who is able to keep me from falling,
   unto Him be honor and glory forever and ever." He was not as some are,
   who imitate the lame beggar who limped all day in the streets to gather
   money and then at night went to the thieves' kitchen, where all the
   dainty bits were brought out of the bag, the money flowed freely and
   the wine and the good cheer was bought. Then the rogue unloosed his
   lame leg and danced as merrily as the rest.

   No, Caleb was not of this kind. He did not limp in virtue nor leap in
   vice. His walk was ever the same and the way was always straight. God
   had delivered him from dissimulation, and had given him constancy in
   its place. How brightly he shone when he was left alone, faithful among
   the faithless. Even Joshua for awhile is silent. But we may compare
   him, to use the metaphor of good old Gotthold--we may compare him to a
   tree. The wind had been blowing--it was a dreadful hurricane and
   Gotthold walked into a forest and saw many trees torn up by the roots.

   He marveled much at one tree which stood alone and yet had been unmoved
   in the tempest. He said, "How is this? The trees that were together
   have fallen and this alone stands fast!" He observed that when the
   trees grow too closely they cannot send their roots into the
   earth--they lean too much upon each other. But this tree, standing
   alone, had space to thrust its roots into the earth and lay hold on the
   rock and stones, and so when the wind came, it fell not. It was so with
   Caleb--he always would lay hold upon his God, not upon men. And so when
   the wind came, he stood.

   I saw this morning a huge tree which stood by the water's edge but
   yesterday, blown into the large pond upon our common. Well might it
   fall during such a night, but there were other trees further from the
   water that stood fast. You know it is our prosperity, our
   mercy-side--it is where the water comes to the root, where the plenty
   comes. But the temptation comes, too, and we are ever weakest where
   perhaps we dreamt we were the strongest. Caleb was constant because he
   was a rooted man and even success did not overturn him. He was not one
   of those plants which spring up quickly because there is no depth of
   earth. He had a firm hold upon his God.

   You know, my Sisters, how you wear your rings. I would that every
   Christian wore his graces after the same fashion. You wear not only the
   wedding ring, but the keeper, too. And every Christian should wear the
   keeper of constancy to guard the ring of his faith. Caleb had set a
   seal upon his heart and a bracelet upon his arm--his love was strong as
   death and endured even to the grave. He saw the Lord, he loved the
   Lord, he trusted the Lord. And for these reasons he followed the Lord
   wholly. Here I leave him, only asking you, dear Friends, to see to it
   that you have his holy perseverance. Therefore pray, "Hold You me up
   and I shall be safe," and trust yourself where Caleb trusted
   himself--in the hands of God.

   I will give you those four subdivisions again: universally, without
   dividing. Sincerely, without dissembling. Cheerfully, without
   disputing. Constantly, without declining.

   II. Now for the second point, which is CALEB'S FAVORED PORTION. In
   reward for his faithful following of his

   Master, his life was preserved in the hour ofjudgment. The ten fell,
   smitten with plague, but Caleb lived. Blessed is the man who has the
   God of Jacob for his confidence--

   "He that has made his refuge God Shall find a most secure abode; Shall
   walk all day beneath His shade, And there at night shall rest his head.
   What though a thousand at your side, At your right hand ten thousand
   died, Your God His chosen people sa ves Among the dead, amidst the
   graves."

   If any man shall experience special deliverances, Caleb is he. If he
   follows God fully, God will fully take care of him. When you look to
   nothing but your Master's honor, your Master will look to your honor.

   When Queen Elizabeth sent a certain merchant over to Holland, he
   complained to her, "If I do your Majesty's business, my own business
   will be ruined." "You do my business," said the Queen, "and I will see
   to your business." It is so with our God. "My servant, serve Me, and I
   will serve you." Caleb is willing to give his life for his Master, and
   therefore his Master gives him his life. There are many who seek their
   life that lose it. And there are some who lose it for Christ's sake,
   that find it to life eternal. Caleb was also comforted with a long life
   of vigor. At eighty-five he was as strong as at forty and still able to
   face the giants.

   If there is a Christian man who shall have in his old age a vigor of
   faith and courage, it is the man who follows the Lord fully. I have in
   my mind's eye one who gave himself, while yet a young man, to his
   Master's cause. He has zealously served the Church in his day and
   generation and it is his privilege now to see the good of God's chosen.
   His heart is so glad at the sight of God's mercy that he is ready to
   say with Simeon--"Lord, now let Your servant depart in peace, according
   to Your word: for my eyes have seen Your salvation."

   We gain our old saints from among those faithful young ones. If ever we
   are to see among us noble veterans-- champions of the age whose heads
   shall be crowned with gray hairs of honor--we must look for those who
   in the beginning of their days were hearty in their Master's cause,
   were universal in their obedience, thorough in their consecration to
   God. Experience, wisdom, Divine Grace are the gifts of our Lord Jesus
   to those who walk with zeal and earnestness in His ways.

   Again, Caleb received as his reward great honor among his Brothers and
   Sisters. He was at least twenty years older than any other man in the
   camp except Joshua. How the mothers would hold up their little children
   in their arms to look at Caleb as he walked down the street! "All
   died," the mothers would say, "all died in Israel's host, except that
   man who walks yonder with steadfast tread. All died and their carcasses
   were buried in the wilderness, except that man and Joshua the son of
   Nun." At their council he would be regarded with as much reverence as
   Nestor in the assemblies of the Greeks. In their camps he would stand
   like another Achilles in the midst of the armies of Lacedaemon.

   As king and sire he dwelt among men. As some mighty Alp lifts its head
   nearer to Heaven than all its compeers--its pure, snow-white head
   communing with celestial things--so this gray-headed old man must have
   seemed a towering summit in the midst of Israel's worthies! A
   Grace-made prime minister of the people of Israel after Joshua himself
   had departed. Well, Brothers and Sisters, such will God make of us if
   we give our hearts wholly to Him. I say, again, if we honor God He will
   honor us. "They that honor Me I will honor. They that despise Me shall
   be lightly esteemed."

   Inconsistent professors--men and women who may be Christians, but who
   never enter thoroughly into the Lord's work--are never honored in the
   Church. They must necessarily keep in the background. They are rather
   tolerated than admired. But warm-hearted spirits, zealous and full of
   life--these are the men who stand like Joseph's sheaf in the midst of
   his Brothers and Sisters' sheaves which do obeisance unto it.

   Again--and you will think this is a strange thing to say--Caleb had the
   distinguished reward of being put upon the hardest service. That is
   always the lot of the most faithful servant of God. There were three
   huge warriors in Mount Hebron. No one will undertake to kill them
   except our good old friend Caleb. These Anakims, with their six toes on
   each foot and their six fingers on each hand, are to be upset and
   driven out. Who is to do it? If nobody else will offer himself, here is
   Caleb. No, he does not merely allow himself to be sent upon the
   service, but he craves permission to be allowed to take the place, the
   reason being because it was the worst task of the war and he panted to
   have the honor of it.

   Grand old man! Would God you had left many of your like behind you. If
   there is some pleasant thing to do for Christ, how we scramble after
   the service. But if there is a front place in the battle, "Oh, let
   Brother So-and-So do it." Do you not notice the way most men decline
   the honor of special danger? "Our friend So-and-So is much better
   qualified for that. Let him take it." If we were true heroes we should
   each of us contend which should undertake the most hopeless, the most
   difficult, and the most dangerous task. Who wins the honor? Why the man
   that leads the forlorn hope!

   But there are not many who will strive to have the privilege of going
   first. They are not quite so fond of being knocked off the ladder and
   sent headlong from the wall to have their brains knocked out on the
   ground--not quite so desirous of being blown to pieces by the
   batteries. But, truly, if we could rival even earthly soldiers in their
   bravery and self-sacrifice, it were well. Caleb had the distinguished
   honor of being permitted to lead the van against the gigantic

   Anakim. Follow the Lord fully and the devil himself will be afraid of
   you--keep close to your Lord and defy all the fiends of Hell.

   Last Tuesday morning, when I left London to go to Worcester to preach,
   the fog was about as thick as I have ever seen it, but what did that
   matter? The engine had just to keep on the rails, stick fast to the
   metals and she was safe. There was no particular need of seeing,
   because the road was laid down. And when a Christian knows he is right,
   he may go straight on, fog or no fog. But when a man gets off the road,
   then he may well pause, for he may be in a ditch and no one knows how
   soon he may come to grief. Get your heart right and you are independent
   of weather. Get your soul right and you may defy the sharpest arrow of
   the Adversary. The Lord is with us, if we are with Him.

   This grand old man in his after years had the honor of enjoying what he
   had once seen. He had only seen the land when he said, "We are able to
   take it." But others said, "No, no, no." Well, he lived not only to
   take it, but to enjoy it for himself. We get in some of our Churches--I
   say nothing of mine just now--certain reverend old gentlemen who might
   as well have gone to Heaven years ago, who if there is any enterprise
   to be undertaken, say, "Oh, no, no! It cannot be done." They sit down
   and figure away on a piece of paper with their pencil and say, "We have
   not enough money. It cannot be done."

   Perhaps some youthful soldier of Christ in the army says, "It can be
   done. I am sure we can do it." But the good old man, having made up his
   mind never to walk by faith, stands to his watchword, "It is
   imprudent." That is the big word with which they try to knock out the
   brains of young Zeal--"imprudent, imprudent!" But thank God there are
   others of another sort, who though they grow gray, say, "Well, I do not
   know. I may be thought to be a boy in my old age, but I do believe that
   God will hear prayer and that if it is God's work we can do it." And
   the old man lays his hand on the young soldier's shoulder and bids him
   go on and God be with him.

   That is the kind of Caleb I like! May such men live to see the reward
   of their confidence! Indeed they shall see that God is true to their
   faith and that He does reward those who dare to do hard things in
   confidence in His name. I may be speaking to some people from the
   country. You have got a minister down there but he wants to do a little
   more good than you like him to do. Now mind what you think. Stand back.
   If you cannot help him, let him alone. But I do pray you, on the other
   hand, endeavor to encourage him, cheer him on, for you will never win a
   Hebron for yourself or the Church if you are always talking about the
   giants and the difficulties and the dangers. There are no difficulties
   to the man who has faith enough to overcome them.

   To conclude this point, good old Caleb left a blessing to his children.
   He had many sons, but he fought for them and carved out a portion for
   them all. And he had a daughter, too, whom he promised to give to wife,
   you will remember, to anyone who would smite Kirjath-Sepher. He was a
   man of such a kind that he did not like to have a man for a son-in-law
   who could not fight as well as himself. He delighted to see valor in
   young people and so he offered his daughter as a prize. When he had
   given his daughter, she came to him and asked for a double blessing.

   She had the field and a south country--she would have the land of
   springs--and he gave her the blessing of the upper and the nether
   springs. If there is any man who shall be able to leave his children
   the blessing of the upper and nether springs, it is the man who follows
   the Lord fully. If I might envy any man, it would be the Believer who
   from his youth up has walked through Divine Grace according to his
   Lord's Commandments and who is able, when his day comes, to scatter
   benedictions upon his rising sons and daughters and leave them with
   godliness which has the blessing of this life and that which is to
   come. The blessing of the upper and the nether springs, then, was the
   reward of good old Caleb.

   There are some of us who are young in years, members of this Church,
   men and women, and we have before us, I hope, the opportunity, if God
   gives us Divine Grace, of becoming Calebs. And if the Lord should spare
   me as he spared Joshua, and spare you as he spared Caleb, we may yet,
   when our hairs are gray, do something, still, for the Lord our God,
   when those that fought the fight before us shall sleep among the clods
   of the valley. O for the Holy Spirit within us and the love of Jesus
   upon us, that we may be accepted in the Beloved!

   III. And now, the last point of all--CALEB'S SECRET CHARACTER. The Lord
   says of him, "Because he has another spirit with him." He had another
   spirit--not only a bold, generous, courageous, noble and heroic spirit,
   but the Spirit and influence of God which thus raised him above human
   inquietudes and earthly fears. Therefore he followed God
   fully--literally he filled after him. God showed him the way to take
   and the line of conduct he must pursue--and he filled up this line, and
   in all things followed the will of his Master. Everything acts
   according to the spirit that is in it.

   Yonder lamp gives no light. Why? It has no oil. Here is another. It
   cheers the darkness of the cell. Why? It is full of oil and oil is the
   mother of light. There are two huge bags of silk. One of them lies
   heavily upon the ground, the other mounts up towards the stars. The one
   is filled with carbonic-acid gas. It cannot mount, it acts according to
   the spirit that is in it. It has a heavy gas and there it lies. There
   is another full of hydrogen and it acts according to the spirit that is
   in it and up it goes. The light air seeks the lighter regions and up it
   mounts. Everything recording to its own order. The real way to make a
   new life is to receive a new spirit. There must be given us, if we
   would follow the Lord fully, a new heart and that new heart must be
   found at the foot of the Cross, where the Holy Spirit works through the
   bleeding wounds of Jesus.

   Dear Friends, I would to God that we had, all of us, that which is the
   distinguishing mark of a right spirit, the spirit offaith. That spirit
   which takes God at His Word, reads His promise, and knows it to be
   true. He that has this spirit will soon follow the Lord fully. Unbelief
   is the mother of sin, but faith is the nurse of virtue. More faith,
   Lord, more simple childlike faith upon a precious Savior! Then a
   faithful spirit always begets a meek spirit and a meek spirit always
   begets a brave spirit. It is said of the wood of the elder tree that
   none is softer, but yet it is recorded of old that Venice was built
   upon piles of the elder tree because it will never rot.

   And so the meek-spirited man who is gentle and patient lasts on
   bravely, holding his own against all the attacks of the destroying
   Adversary. The true Believer has also a loving spirit as the result of
   Jesus' Grace. He loves God, therefore he loves God's people and God's
   creatures. And having this loving spirit he has next a zealous spirit
   and so he spends and is spent for God and this begets in him a heavenly
   spirit. And so he tries to live in Heaven and to make earth a Heaven to
   his fellow men, believing that he shall soon have a Heaven for himself
   and for them, too, on the other side of the stream.

   Such a spirit had good Caleb. We cannot imitate him till we get his
   spirit. We are dead until He quickens us. O that the Holy Spirit would
   lead us to go to Jesus just as we are and look up to Him and beseech
   Him to fulfill that great Covenant promise--"A new heart also will I
   give them, a right spirit will I put within them." You and I have not
   followed the Lord fully. What shall we do, then? First let us humbly
   repent. Caleb means a dog. Let us learn from a dog. When a dog has done
   amiss, and you take a stick and are about to beat him, he will lie down
   on the ground and howl and creep to your feet and look up so piteously
   at you that you throw down your stick.

   Now let us each do the same. Let us each be Calebs--dogs in this. Let
   us crouch at the feet of God's justice. Let us look up into the face of
   God's mercy and through Jesus Christ He will forgive us. Having done
   this, may He enable us to exercise a simple faith in Christ. As the
   child lives hanging upon the mother's breast and deriving its
   nourishment from the parent, so be it yours and mine to hang upon the
   wounds of our own dear Lord. And tonight when we come to His Table, let
   us eat His flesh and drink His blood, keeping close to His Person,
   receiving our life from the secret channels of His life, living upon
   Him.

   Ah, if we live close to Jesus, we must be Calebs! He that is one with
   Jesus will follow God because Jesus is perfect in His following of His
   Father. And we, being parts of Him, shall be perfect, too. But the Holy
   Spirit's work must begin by bringing us to Jesus just as we are. God
   help us to trust Him as we are and then, by His Grace He will make us
   Calebs and keep us to the end. Amen.

                             Heavenly Lovesickness!

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 8, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my Beloved, that
   you tell Him that I am sick of love." Song of Solomon 5:8.

   SICK! That is a sad thing. It moves your pity. Sick of love--lovesick!
   That stirs up other emotions which we shall presently attempt to
   explain. No doubt certain sicknesses are peculiar to the saints--the
   ungodly are never visited with them. Strange to say, these sicknesses,
   to which the refined sensibilities of the children of God render them
   peculiarly liable, are signs of vigorous health. Who but the Beloved of
   the Lord ever experience that sin sickness in which the soul loathes
   the very name of transgression, is unmoved by the enchantments of the
   Tempter, finds no sweetness in its besetting sins, and turns with
   detestation and abhorrence from the very thought of iniquity?

   No less is it for these, and these alone, to feel that self sickness
   whereby the heart revolts from all creature confidence and strength,
   having been made sick of self, self-seeking, self-exalting,
   self-reliance, and self of every sort. The Lord afflicts us more and
   more with such self sickness till we are dead to self, its puny
   conceits, its lofty aims, and its unsanctified desires. Then there is a
   twofold lovesickness. Of the one kind is that lovesickness which comes
   upon the Christian when he is transported with the full enjoyment of
   Jesus, even as the bride elated by the favor, melted by the tenderness
   of her Lord, says in the fifth verse of the second chapter of the Song,
   "Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love."

   The soul, overjoyed with the Divine communications of happiness and
   bliss which came from Christ, the body scarcely able to bear the
   excessive delirium of delight which the soul possessed, she was so glad
   to be in the embraces of her Lord that she needed to be stayed under
   her overpowering weight ofjoy. Another kind of lovesickness, widely
   different from the first, is that in which the soul is sick, not
   because it has too much of Christ's love, but because it has not enough
   present consciousness of it. Sick, not of the enjoyment, but of the
   longing for it. Sick, not because of excess of delight, but because of
   sorrow for an absent lover.

   It is to this sickness we call your attention this morning. This
   lovesickness breaks out in two ways and may be viewed in two lights. It
   is, first of all, the soul longing for a view of Jesus Christ in Grace.
   And then again, it is the same soul possessing the view of Divine Grace
   and longing for a sight of Jesus Christ in Glory. In both these senses
   we, as accurately as the spouse, may adopt the languishing words, "If
   you find my Beloved, tell Him that I am sick of love."

   I. First, then, let us consider our text as the language of a soul
   LONGING FOR THE VIEW OF JESUS CHRIST IN GRACE.

   1. Do you ask me concerning the sickness itself--What is it? It is the
   sickness of a soul panting after communion with Christ. The man is a
   Believer. He is not longing after salvation as a penitent sinner under
   conviction, for he is saved. Moreover, he has love to Christ and knows
   it. He does not doubt his evidence as to the reality of his affection
   for his Lord, for you see the word used is, "My Beloved," which would
   not be applicable if the person speaking had any doubt about her
   interest.

   Nor did she doubt her love, for she calls the spouse, "My Beloved." It
   is the longing of a soul, then, not for salvation, and not even for the
   certainty of salvation, but for the enjoyment of present fellowship
   with Him who is her soul's Life, her soul's All. The heart is panting
   to be brought once more under the apple tree. To feel once again His
   "left hand under her head, while His right hand does embrace her." She
   has known, in days past, what it is to be brought into His banqueting
   house, and to see the banner of love waved over her. She therefore
   cries to have love visits renewed.

   It is a panting after communion. Gracious hours, my dear Friends, are
   never perfectly at ease except they are in a state of nearness to
   Christ. For mark you, when they are not near to Christ, they lose their
   peace. The nearer to Jesus, the nearer to the perfect calm of Heaven.
   And the further from Jesus, the nearer to that troubled sea which
   images the continual unrest of the wicked. There is no peace to the man
   who does not dwell constantly under the shadow of the Cross. For Jesus
   is our peace and if He is absent, our peace is absent, too.

   I know that being justified we have peace with God, but it is "through
   our Lord Jesus Christ." So that the justified man himself cannot reap
   the fruit of justification, except by abiding in Christ Jesus, who is
   the Lord and Giver of peace. The Christian without fellowship with
   Christ loses all his life and energy. He is like a dead thing. Though
   saved, he lies like a lumpish log--

   "His soul can neither fly nor go To reach eternal joys."

   He is without liveliness. Yes, more, he is without animation till Jesus
   comes. But when the Lord sensibly sheds abroad His love in our hearts,
   then His love kindles ours. Then our blood leaps in our veins for joy,
   like the Baptist in the womb of Elizabeth.

   The heart when near to Jesus has strong pulsations, for since Jesus is
   in that heart, it is full of life, of vigor and of strength. Peace,
   liveliness, vigor--all depend upon the constant enjoyment of communion
   with Christ Jesus. The soul of a Christian never knows what joy means
   in its true solidity, except when she sits, like Mary, at Jesus' feet.
   Beloved, all the joys of life are nothing to us. We have melted them
   all down in our crucible and found them to be dross. You and I have
   tried earth's vanities and they cannot satisfy us. No, they do not give
   a morsel of meat to satiate our hunger.

   Being in a state of dissatisfaction with all mortal things, we have
   learned through Divine Grace that none but Jesus, none but Jesus can
   make our souls glad. "Philosophers are happy without music," said one
   of old. So Christians are happy without the world's goods. Christians,
   with the world's goods, are sure to bemoan themselves as naked, poor
   and miserable, unless their Savior is with them. You that have ever
   tasted communion with Christ will soon know why it is that a soul longs
   after Him. What the sun is to the day, what the moon is to the night,
   what the dew is to the flower-- such is Jesus Christ to us.

   What bread is to the hungry, clothes to the naked, the shadow of a
   great rock to the traveler in a weary land--such is Jesus Christ to us.
   What the turtle is to her mate, what the husband is to his spouse, what
   the head is to the body-- such is Jesus Christ to us. And therefore, if
   we have Him not, no, if we are not conscious of having Him. If we are
   not one with Him, no, if we are not consciously one with Him, little
   marvel if our spirit cries in the words of the Song, "I charge you, O
   you daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my Beloved, tell Him that I am
   sick of love." Such is the character of this lovesickness.

   We may say of it, however, before we leave that point, that it is a
   sickness which has a blessing attending it-- "Blessed are they that do
   hunger and thirst after righteousness." And therefore, supremely
   blessed are they who thirst after the Righteous One--after Him who in
   the highest perfection embodies pure, immaculate, spotless
   righteousness. Blessed is that hunger, for it comes from God. It bears
   a blessing within it. For if I may not have the blessedness in full
   bloom of being filled, the next best thing is the same blessedness in
   sweet bud of being empty till I am filled with Christ. If I may not
   feed on Jesus, it shall be next door to Heaven to be allowed to hunger
   and thirst after Him.

   There is a hallowedness about that hunger since it sparkles among the
   beatitudes of our Lord. Yet it is a sickness, dear Friends, which,
   despite the blessing, causes much pain. The man who is sick after Jesus
   will be dissatisfied with everything else. He will find that dainties
   have lost their sweetness and music its melody and light its
   brightness--life itself will be darkened with the shadow of death to
   him--till he finds his Lord and can rejoice in Him.

   Beloved, you shall find that this thirsting, this sickness--if it ever
   gets hold upon you--is attended with great vehemence. The desire is
   vehement as coals ofjuniper. You have heard of hunger that breaks
   through stone walls--but stone walls are no prison to a soul that
   desires Christ. Stone walls, no, the strongest natural barriers, cannot
   keep a lovesick heart from Jesus. I will venture to say that the
   temptation of Heaven itself, if it could be offered to the Believer
   without his Christ, would be as less than nothing. And the pains of
   Hell, if they could be endured, would be gladly ventured upon by a
   lovesick soul, if he might but find Christ.

   As lovers sometimes talk of doing impossibilities for their fair ones,
   so certainly a spirit that is set on Christ will laugh at impossibility
   and say, "It shall be done." It will venture upon the hardest task, go
   cheerfully to prison and joy- fully to death, if it may but find its
   Beloved and have its lovesickness satisfied with His Presence. Perhaps
   this may suffice for a description of the sickness here intended.

   2. You may enquire concerning the cause of this lovesickness. What
   makes a man's soul so sick after Christ? Understand that it is the
   absence of Christ which makes this sickness in a mind that really
   understands the preciousness of His Presence. The spouse had been very
   willful and wayward, she had taken off her garments, had gone to her
   rest, her sluggish slothful rest, when her Beloved knocked at the door.
   He said "Open to Me, My Beloved. For My head is filled with dew and My
   locks with the drops of the night."

   She was too slothful to wake up to let Him in. She urged excuses--"I
   have put off my coat. How shall I put it on? I have washed my feet. How
   shall I defile them?" The Beloved stood waiting, but since she opened
   not, He put in His hand by the hole of the lock and then her heart was
   moved towards Him. She went to the door to open it and to her surprise
   her hands dripped with myrrh and her fingers with sweet smelling myrrh
   upon the handles of the lock. There was the token that He had been
   there, but He was gone. Now she began to bestir herself and seek after
   Him.

   She sought Him through the city, but she found Him not. Her soul failed
   her. She called after Him, but He gave her no answer and the watchmen,
   who ought to have helped her in the search, smote her and took away her
   veil from her. Therefore it is that now she is seeking, because she has
   lost her Beloved. She should have held Him fast and not have permitted
   Him to go. He is absent and she is sick till she finds Him. Mingled
   with the sense of absence is a consciousness of wrong-doing.

   Something in her seemed to say, "How could you drive Him away? That
   heavenly Bridegroom who knocked and pleaded hard, how could you keep
   Him longer there amidst the cold dews of night? O unkind heart! What if
   your feet had been made to bleed by your rising? What if all your body
   had seen chilled by the cold wind, when you were treading the floor?
   What had it been compared with His love to you?" And so she is sick to
   see Him, that she may weep out her love and tell Him how vexed she is
   with herself that she should have held to Him so loosely and permitted
   Him so readily to depart.

   So, too, mixed with this, was great wretchedness because He was gone.
   She had been for a little time easy in His absence. That downy bed,
   that warm coverlet had given her a peace, a false, cruel and a wicked
   peace. But she has risen now, the watchmen have smitten her, her veil
   is gone and, without a friend, the princess is deserted in the midst of
   Jerusalem's streets. Her soul has melted for heaviness and she pours
   out her heart within her as she pines after Her Lord. "No Love but my
   Love, no Lord but my Lord," she says, with sobbing tongue and weeping
   eyes. For none else can gratify her heart or appease her anxiety.

   Beloved, have you ever been in such a state, when your faith has begun
   to droop and your heart and spirits have fled from you? Even then your
   soul was sick for Him. You could do without Him when Mr.
   Carnal-Security was in the house and feasted you--but when he and his
   house have both been burned with fire, the old lovesickness came back
   and you wanted Christ. Nor could you be satisfied till you found Him
   once again. There was true love in all this and this is the very
   essence of all lovesickness.

   Had not she loved, absence would not have made her sick, nor would her
   repentance have made her grieve. Had she not loved, there would have
   been no pain because of absence and no sinking of spirits. But she did
   love, and thus all this sickness. It is a delightful thing to be able
   to know when we have lost Christ's company that we do love Him--"Yes,
   Lord, You know all things. You know that I love You. I did deny You.
   Yes, in the moment of Your sorrow, I said, 'I know not the Man.' I did
   curse and swear that men might think I was no follower of Yours, but
   still You know all things, You know that I love You."

   When you can feel this, dear Friends, the consciousness that you love
   will soon work in you a heart-burning, so that your soul will not be
   satisfied till you can tell out that love in the Master's Presence and
   He shall say unto you, as a token of forgiveness, "Feed My sheep." I do
   not doubt that in this sickness there had been some degree of fear.
   Sorrowful woman! She was half afraid she might never find Him again.
   She had been about the city--where could He be? She had sought Him on
   the walls and on the ramparts, but He was not there.

   In every ordinance, in every means of Divine Grace, in secret and in
   public prayer, in the Lord's Supper and in the reading of the Word, she
   had looked after Him--but He was not there. And now she was half afraid
   that though He might give His Presence to others, yet never to her. And
   when she speaks, you notice there is half a fear in her voice. She
   would not have asked others to tell Him if she had any assuring hope
   that she should meet Him herself--"If you find Him," she seems to say,
   "O you true converts, you that are the real daughters of Jerusalem. If
   He reveals Himself to you, though He never may to me, do me this
   kindness, tell Him that I am sick of love."

   There is half a fear here and yet there is some hope. She feels that He
   must love her still, or else why send a message at all? She would
   surely never send this sweet message to a flinty, adamantine heart,
   "Tell Him I am sick of love," and she remembered when the "glances of
   her eyes had ravished Him. She remembered when a motion from her hand
   had made His heart melt and when one tear of her eyes had opened all
   His wounds afresh. She thinks, "Perhaps He loves me still as He loved
   me then, and my moans will enchain Him. My groans will constrain Him
   and lead Him to my help."

   So she sends the message to Him--"Tell Him, tell Him I am sick of
   love." To gather up the causes of this lovesickness in a few words,
   does not the whole matter spring from relationship? She is His spouse.
   Can the spouse be happy without her beloved Lord? It springs from
   union. She is part of Himself. Can the hand be happy and healthy if the
   life-floods stream not from the heart and from the head? Fondly
   realizing her dependence, she feels that she owes all to Him and gets
   her all from Him. If, then, the fountain is cut off, if the streams are
   dried, if the great source of all is taken from her, how can she but be
   sick?

   And there is, besides this, a life and a nature in her which makes her
   sick. There is a life like the life of Christ, no, her life is in
   Christ, it is hid with Christ in God. Her nature is a part of the
   Divine nature. She is a partaker of the Divine nature. Moreover she is
   in union with Jesus and this piece divided, as it were, from the body,
   wriggles like a worm cut asunder and pants to get back to where it came
   from. These are the causes of it. You will not understand my sermon
   this morning but think me raving, unless you are spiritual men. "But
   the spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is judged of no man."

   3. What endeavors such lovesick souls will put forth. Those who are
   sick for Christ will first send their desires to Him. Men use pigeons
   sometimes to send their messages. Why, what sort of carrier pigeons do
   they use? The pigeon is of no use to send anywhere but to the place
   from which it came, and my desires after Christ came from Him, and so
   they will always go back to the place from which they came. They know
   the way to their own dovecot, so I will send Him my sighs and my
   groans, my tears and my moans. Go, go, sweet doves, with swift and
   clipping wings, and tell Him I am lovesick.

   Then she would send her prayers. Ah, methinks she would say of her
   desires, "They will never reach Him. They know the way but their wings
   are broken and they will fall to the ground and never reach Him." Yet
   she will send them whether they reach Him or not. As for her prayers,
   they are like arrows. Sometimes messages have been sent into besieged
   towns bound to an arrow, so she binds her desires upon the arrow of her
   prayers and then shoots them forth from the bow of her faith. She is
   afraid they will never reach Him, for her bow is slack and she knows
   not how to draw it with her feeble hands which hang down.

   So what does she do? She has traversed the streets. She has used the
   means. She has done everything--she has sighed her heart out and
   emptied her soul out in prayers. She is all wounds till He heals her.
   She is all a hungry mouth till He fills her. She is all an empty brook
   till He replenishes her once again and so now she goes to her
   companions and she says, "If you find my Beloved, tell Him I am sick of
   love." This is using the intercession of the saints. It is unbelief
   that makes her use it, and yet there is a little faith mixed in her
   unbelief. It was an unbelief but not a misbelief.

   There is efficacy in the intercession of saints. Not of dead
   saints--they have enough to do to be singing God's praises in Heaven
   without praying for us--but saints on earth can take up our case. The
   king has his favorites. He has his cupbearers. He has some that are
   admitted into great familiarity with him--give me a share in a good
   man's prayers. I attribute, under God, the success the Lord has given
   me to the number of souls in every quarter of the earth who pray for
   me. Not you alone, but in every land there are some that forget me not
   when they draw near in their supplications.

   Oh, we are so rich when we have the prayers of saints! When it is well
   with you, speak for me to the Captain of the Host and if He should say
   to you, "What was his message?" I have no other message but that of the
   spouse, "Tell Him I am sick of love." Any of you who have close
   familiarity with Jesus, be the messengers, be the heavenly tale-bearers
   between lovesick souls and their Divine Lord. Tell Him, tell Him we are
   sick of love. And you that cannot thus go to Him, seek the help and aid
   of others. But after all, as I have said, this is unbelief though it is
   not misbelief, for how much better it would have been for her to tell
   Him herself.

   "But," you say, "she could not find Him." No, but if she had had faith
   she would have known that her prayers could. For our prayers know where
   Christ is when we do not know, or rather, Christ knows where our
   prayers are--and when we cannot see Him they nevertheless reach Him. A
   man who fires a cannon is not expected to see all the way where the
   shot goes. If he has his cannon rightly sighted and fires it, there may
   come on a thick fog, but the shot will reach the place. And if you have
   your hearts sighted by Divine Grace after Christ, you may depend upon
   it--however thick the fog--the hot shot of your prayer will reach the
   gates of Heaven though you cannot tell how or where.

   Be satisfied to go to Christ yourself. If your Brothers and Sisters
   will go, well and good, but methinks their proper answer to your
   question would be in the language of the women in the sixth chapter,
   the first verse, "Where is your Beloved gone, O you fairest among
   women? Where is your Beloved turned aside? That we may seek Him with
   you." They will not seek Him for us they say, but they can seek Him
   with us. Sometimes when there are six pair of eyes, they will see
   better than one. And so, if five or six Christians seek the Lord in
   company, in the Prayer Meeting, or at His Table, they are more likely
   to find Him. "We will seek Him with you."

   4. Blessed lovesickness! We have seen its character and its cause and
   the endeavors of the soul under it. Let us just notice the comforts
   which belong to such a state as this. Briefly they are these--you shall
   be filled. It is impossible for Christ to set you longing after Him
   without intending to give Himself to you. It is as when a great man
   prepares a feast. He first puts plates upon the table and then
   afterward there comes the meat. Your longings and desires are the empty
   plates to hold the meat. Is it likely that Christ means to mock you?
   Would He have put the dishes there if He did not intend to fill them
   with His oxen and with His fatlings?

   He makes you long--He will certainly satisfy your longings. Remember,
   again, that He will give you Himself all the sooner for the bitterness
   of your longings. The more pained your heart is at His absence the
   shorter will the absence be. If you have a grain of contentment without
   Christ, that will keep you longer tarrying. But when your soul is sick
   till your heart is ready to break, till you cry, "Why tarries He? Why
   are His chariots so long in coming?" When your soul faints until your
   Beloved speaks to you, and you are ready to die from your youth up,
   then shortly He will lift the veil from His dear face and your sun
   shall rise with healing beneath His wings. Let that console you.

   Then, again, when He does come, as come He will, oh, how sweet it will
   be! Methinks I have the flavor in my mouth now and the fullness of the
   feast is yet to come. There is such a delight about the very thought
   that He will come, that the thought itself is the prelude, the
   foretaste of the happy greeting. What? Will He once again speak
   comfortably to me? Shall I again walk the bed of spices with Him? Shall
   I ramble with Him among the groves while the flowers give forth their
   sweet perfume--I shall! I shall! And even now my spirit feels His
   presence by anticipation--"Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like
   the chariots of Amminadab."

   You know how sweet it was in the past. Beloved, what times we have had,
   some of us! Oh, whether in the body or out of the body, we cannot
   tell--God knows. What mountings! Talk you of eagles' wings? They are
   earthly pinions and may not be compared with the wings with which He
   carried us up from earth! Speak of mounting beyond clouds and stars?--
   They were left far, far behind. We entered into the unseen, beheld the
   Invisible, lived in the Immortal, drank in the Ineffable, and were
   blessed with the fullness of God in Christ Jesus, being made to sit
   together in heavenly places in Him.

   Well, all this is to come again, "I will see you again and your heart
   shall rejoice." "A little while and you shall not see Me: and again, a
   little while and you shall see Me." "In a little wrath I hid My face
   from you for a moment. But with everlasting kindness will I have mercy
   on you, says the Lord your Redeemer." Think of this! Why, we have
   comfort even in this lovesickness! Our heart, though sick, is still
   whole, while we are panting and pining after the Lord Jesus--

   "O love Divine, how sweet You are, When shall I find my willing heart
   All taken up with You? I thirst, I faint, I die to prove The fullness
   of redeeming love-- The love of Christ to me."

   II. And now, secondly, with as great brevity as we can, this
   lovesickness may be seen in A SOUL LONGING FOR A VIEW OF JESUS IN HIS
   GLORY.

   1. And here we will consider the complaint itself for a moment. This
   ailment is not merely a longing after communion with Christ on
   earth--that has been enjoyed and generally this sickness follows that--

   "When I have tasted of the grapes, I sometimes long to go Where my dear
   Lord the vineyard keeps And all the clusters grow."

   It is the enjoyment of Eshcol's first fruits which makes us desire to
   sit under our own vine and our own fig tree before the Throne of God in
   the blessed land.

   Beloved, this sickness is characterized by certain marked symptoms. I
   will tell you what they are. There is a loving and a longing, a
   loathing and a languishing. Happy soul that understands these things by
   experience. There is a loving in which the heart cleaves to Jesus--

   "Do not I love You from my soul? Then let me nothing love-- Dead be my
   heart to every joy When Jesus cannot move."

   A sense of His beauty! An admiration of His charms! A consciousness of
   His infinite perfection! Yes! Greatness, goodness and loveliness, in
   one resplendent ray combine to enchant the soul till it is so ravished
   after Him that it cries with the spouse, "Yes, He is altogether lovely.
   This is my Beloved and this is my Friend, O you daughters of
   Jerusalem." Sweet loving is this--a love which binds the heart with
   chains of more than silken softness and yet more firm than adamant.

   Then there is a longing. She loves Him so that she cannot endure to be
   absent from Him. She pants and pines. You know it has been so with
   saints in all ages--whenever they have begun to love they have always
   begun to long after Christ. John, the most loving of spirits, is the
   author of those words which he so frequently uses--"Come quickly, even
   so, come quickly." "Come quickly," is sure to be the fruit of earnest
   love. See how the spouse puts it--"O that You were as my brother, that
   sucked the breasts of my mother! When I should find You without, I
   would kiss You. Yes, I should not be despised."

   She longs to get hold of Him. She cannot conclude her song without
   saying, "Make haste, my Beloved and be You like to a roe or to a young
   hart upon the mountains of spices." There is a longing to be with
   Christ. I would not give much for your religion if you do not long to
   be with the Object of your heart's affections. Then comes a loathing.
   When a man is sick with the first lovesickness, then he does not
   loathe--it is, "Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples." When a
   man has Christ, he can enjoy other things. But when a man is longing
   after Christ and seeking after Christ, he loathes everything else--he
   cannot bear anything besides.

   Here is my message to Jesus--"Tell Him"--what? Do I want crowns and
   diadems? Crowns and diadems are nothing to me. Do I want wealth and
   health and strength? They are all very well in their way. No--"Tell
   Him, tell the Beloved of my soul that I grieve after Himself--His gifts
   are good--I ought to be more grateful for them than I am, but let me
   see His face. Let me hear His voice. I am sick of love, and nothing but
   that can satisfy me, everything else is distasteful to me."

   And then there is a languishing. Since she cannot get the society of
   Christ--cannot as yet behold Him on His Throne nor worship Him face to
   face--she is sick until she can. For a heart so set on Christ will walk
   about traversing highway and by-way, resting nowhere till it finds Him.
   As the needle once magnetized will never be easy until it finds the
   pole, so the heart once Christianized never will be satisfied until it
   rests on Christ--rests on Him, too, in the fullness of the beatific
   vision before the Throne. This is the character of the lovesickness.

   2. As to its Object--what is that? "Tell Him that I am sick of love."
   But what is the sickness for? Brethren, when you and I want to go to
   Heaven I hope it is the true lovesickness. I catch myself sometimes
   wanting to die and be in Heaven for the sake of rest. But is not that a
   lazy desire? There is a sluggish wish that makes me long for rest.
   Perhaps we long for the happiness of Heaven--the harps and crowns.
   There is a little selfishness in that, is there not? Allowable, I grant
   you. But is not there a little like selfishness? Perhaps, we long to
   see dear children, beloved friends that have gone before. But there is
   a little of the earthy there.

   The soul may be as sick as it will, without rebuke, when it is sick to
   be with Jesus. You may carry this to its utmost extent without either
   sin or folly. What am I sick with love for? For the pearly gates?--No.
   But for the pearls that are in His wounds. What am I sick for? For the
   streets of gold?--No. But for His head which is as much fine gold. Am I
   sick for the melody of the harps and angelic songs?--No. But for the
   melodious notes that come from His dear mouth. What am I sick for? For
   the nectar that angels drink?--No. But for the kisses of His lips.

   What am I sick for? For the manna on which heavenly souls feed?--No.
   But for Himself, who is the meat and drink of His saints. Himself!
   Himself! My soul pines to see HIM! Oh, what a Heaven to gaze upon! What
   bliss to talk with the Man, the God, crucified for me! To weep my heart
   out before Him. To tell Him how I love Him, for He loved me and gave
   Himself for me. To read my name written on His hands and on His
   side--yes, and to let Him see that His name is written on my heart in
   indelible lines. To embrace Him, oh, what an embrace when the creature
   shall embrace His God-- to be forever so close to Him that not a doubt,
   nor a fear, nor a wandering thought can come between my soul and Him
   forever!--

   "Forever to behold Him shine, Forevermore to call Him mine, And see Him
   still before me. Forever on His face to gaze, And meet His full
   assembled rays, While all the Father He displays To all the saints in
   Glory."

   What else can there be that our spirit longs for? This seems an empty
   thing to worldlings, but to the Christian this is Heaven summed up in a
   word--"To be with Christ, which is far better," than all the joys of
   earth. This is the Object, then, of this lovesickness.

   3. Do you ask what are the excitements of this sickness? What is it
   that makes the Christian long to be at Home with Jesus? There are many
   things. There are sometimes some very little things that set a
   Christian longing to be at Home. You know the old story of Swiss
   soldiers, that when they have enlisted into foreign service they never
   will permit the band to play the "Ranz des Vaches"--the Song of the
   Cows, because as soon as ever the Swiss hears the Song of the Cows, he
   thinks of his own dear Alps and the bells upon the cows' necks and the
   strange calls of the herd-boys, as they sing to one another from the
   mountain peaks.

   And he grows sick and ill with homesickness. So if you were banished,
   if you were taken prisoner or a slave, why, to hear some note of one of
   old England's songs would set your spirit pining for home, and I do
   confess, when I hear you sing sometimes--

   "Jerusalem! My happy home! Name ever dear to me; When shall my labors
   have an end, In joy and peace and you?"

   It makes me say, "You daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my Beloved,
   tell Him that I am sick of love." It is the song of home that brings
   the homesickness.

   We remember what He used to be to us, what sweet visits we have had
   from Him. Then we get sick to be always with Him. But, best of all,
   when we are in His presence, when our soul is overjoyed with His
   delights--when the great deep sea of His love has rolled over the
   mast-head of our highest thoughts and the ship of our spirit has gone
   right down, foundering at sea in the midst of an ocean of delights--ah,
   then its highest, its deepest thought is, "O that I may always be with
   Him, in Him, where He is, that I might behold His Glory: the Glory
   which His Father gave Him, and which He has given me, that I may be one
   with Him, world without end."

   I do believe, Brothers and Sisters, that all the bitters and all the
   sweets make a Christian when he is in a healthy state, sick after
   Christ--the sweets make his mouth water for more sweets and the bitters
   make him pant for the time when the last dregs of bitterness shall be
   over. Wearying temptations, as well as rapt enjoyments all set the
   spirit on the wing after Jesus.

   4. Well now, Friends, what is the cure of this lovesickness? Is it a
   sickness for which there is any specific remedy? There is only one cure
   that I know of, but there is some relief. A man that is sick after
   Christ, longs to be with Him and pants for the better land, singing as
   we did just now--

   "Father, I long, I faint to see The place of Your abode."

   He must have the desire realized, before the thirst of his fever will
   be relieved. There are some reliefs and I will recommend them to you.

   Such, for example, is a strong faith that realizes the day of the Lord
   and the Presence of Christ, as Moses beheld the promised land and the
   goodly heritage, when he stood on the top of Pisgah. If you do not get
   Heaven when you want it, you may attain to that which is next door to
   Heaven and this may bear you up for a little season. If you cannot get
   to behold Christ face to face, it is a blessed make-shift for the time
   to see Him in the Scriptures and to look at Him through the glass of
   the Word. These are reliefs, but I warn you, I warn you of them. I do
   not mean to keep you from them--use them as much as ever you can--but I
   warn you from expecting that it will cure that lovesickness.

   It will give you ease but it will make you more sick still, for he that
   lives on Christ gets more hungry after Christ. As for a man being
   satisfied and wanting no more when he gets Christ--why he wants nothing
   but Christ it is true, and in that sense he will never thirst. But he
   wants more and more and more and more of Christ. To live on Christ is
   like drinking seawater, the more you drink the more thirsty you grow.
   There is something very satisfying in Christ's flesh--you will never
   hunger except for that--but the more you eat of it the more you want.
   And he that is the heartiest feaster and has eaten the most, has the
   best appetite for more.

   Oh, strange is this, but so it is. That which we would think would
   remove the lovesickness and is the best stay to the soul under it, is
   just that which brings it on more and more. But there is a cure, there
   is a cure and you shall have it soon--a black draught and in it a
   pearl--a black draught called Death. You shall drink it, but you shall
   not know it is bitter, for you shall swallow it up in victory! There is
   a pearl, too, in it--melted in it. Jesus died as well as you, and as
   you drink it, that pearl shall take away all ill effect from the
   tremendous draught.

   You shall say, "O Death, where is your sting? O Grave, where is your
   victory?" When you have once drank that black draught, you are secure
   against that lovesickness forever. For where are you? No pilgrimage, no
   weary flight through cold ether. You are with Him in Paradise! Do you
   hear that, Soul? You are with Him in Paradise, never to be separated,
   not for an instant! Never to have a wandering thought, not one! Never
   to find your love waning or growing cold again! Never to doubt His love
   to you any more! Never more to be vexed and tempted by sighing after
   what you cannot view. You shall be with Him, where He is--

   "Far from a world of grief and sin, With God eternally shut in."

   Till then, Beloved, let us strive to live near the Cross. Those two
   mountains, Calvary and Zion, stand right opposite one another. The eye
   of faith can sometimes almost span the interval. And the loving heart,
   by some deep mystery of which we can offer you no solution, will often
   have its sweetest rapture of joy in the fellowship of His griefs. So
   have I found a satisfaction in the wounds of a crucified Jesus, which
   can only be excelled by the satisfaction I have yet to find in the
   sparkling eyes of the same Jesus glorified. Yes. The same Jesus!

   Well spoke the angels on Mount Olivet--"This same Jesus, which is taken
   up from you into Heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen
   Him go into Heaven." This same Jesus! My Soul coats on the words! My
   lips are fond of repeating them. This same Jesus!--

   "If in my soul such joy abounds
   While weeping faith explores His wounds,
   How glorious will those sears appear,
   When perfect bliss forbids a tear?
   Think, O my Soul, if it is so sweet
   On earth to sit at Jesus'feet,
   What must it be to wear a crown
   And sit with Him upon His Throne?"

   Would to God you all had this lovesickness! I am afraid many of you
   have it not. May He give it to you. But oh, if there is a soul here
   that wants Jesus, he is welcome! If there is one heart here that says,
   "Give me Christ," you shall have your desire. Trust Jesus Christ and He
   is yours. Rely upon Him. You are His. God save you and make you sick of
   vanities, sick after verities--pining even unto sickness for Jesus
   Christ, the Beloved of my soul, the sum of all my hope, the sinner's
   only Refuge and the praise of all His saints, to whom be everlasting
   glory. Amen.

                          The Lambs And Their Shepherd

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 15, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He shall gather the lambs with His arm and carry them in His bosom.'"

   Isaiah 40:11.

   THE people of God are most fitly compared to sheep. The excellencies of
   their moral and spiritual character furnish one side of the picture,
   for like sheep they are gentle in their lives and are well accepted,
   whether living or dying, as a sacrifice unto God. Their frailties and
   weaknesses complete the likeness, for they are prone to wander--full of
   wants, powerless in self-defense, and not able to escape from their
   enemies by rapid flight. No creature has less power to take care of
   itself than sheep. Even the tiny ant with its foresight can provide for
   the evil day, but this poor creature must be tended by man or else
   perish. Such are the people of God--timid, weak, defenseless--unable to
   provide for themselves and compelled to depend for everything upon Him
   whose name is, "That great Shepherd of the sheep."

   As the people of God individually are comparable to sheep, so the
   Church as a whole finds a very fit representative in a flock. A flock
   is a multitude. Diversities of character, of state, of age, of
   condition are always to be found in a flock. Yet, while a multitude, it
   is but one. One in association--they journey or lie down together--in
   the same pasture they rest. They are led beside the same still waters.
   They are one in nature--they are equally sheep and, however much they
   may differ, their diversity is not half so great as their agreement.
   Two Believers may greatly differ. But only let me be assured that they
   are both sheep of the Lord's pasture, and I will find ten points of
   likeness for one of difference.

   They are one, moreover, in property--they are the property of one
   Owner, being bought with one price in one great transaction, when their
   one great Shepherd laid down His life for the sheep. The saints are
   intimately and truly united. Even now they are secretly one in their
   absent Head but they shall soon be visibly one in their glorious Lord
   when He comes in the glory of His Father and all His holy angels with
   Him. Then He shall place the sheep at His right hand forever. In all
   flocks, unless they are cursed by barrenness, there will be lambs and
   these will make up a very important part of the community.

   In all healthy Churches, those Believers who are comparable to lambs
   make up the major part. And though in our own we have many strong ones
   who are fit to lead the way and not a few competent to bear the burden
   well, yet the majority, I suppose, are the little ones of the flock.
   Mr. Ready-to-Halt, on his crutches, is the commander of quite a
   regiment, distinguished as Mr. Fearing, Mr. Little-Faith, Mr.
   Feeble-Mind, Miss Much-Afraid and the like, who are slender in
   knowledge, shallow in experience, and weak in faith. It is, therefore,
   with great delight we find our gracious Lord executing the office of
   Shepherd in a peculiarly tender manner towards the lambs.

   Special need has here its own appropriate promise--great weakness is
   met by great consolation. The best place is found for those in the
   worst circumstances, and the most loving care bestowed on those most
   exposed to danger. "He shall gather the lambs with His arms and carry
   them in His bosom."

   First, let us describe the lambs. Secondly, let us express our fears
   about them. Thirdly, let us rejoice in the tenderness of the great
   Shepherd over them. And, fourthly, let us hear that great Shepherd's
   voice.

   I. First LET ME ENDEAVOR TO DESCRIBE THE LAMBS. Our first word
   concerning them is that they are truly sheep. They are not sheep in
   maturity, but they are sheep to a certainty. Leave them to their good
   Shepherd's care. Let them continue to lie down in the green pastures
   and feed beside the still waters, and they will become as fully
   developed as yonder ewes of the flock. It is true that not a bone in
   them is of full size, nor a muscle of full strength. Still, who shall
   dare to exclude them from the fold?

   The newborn convert is possessed of the true nature and life of faith,
   even as the life of a babe is the same life as that which is found in
   perfection in the full grown man. Every member is there, but it is in
   miniature. The vital processes are the same, although upon a smaller
   scale. Indeed, the whole man is in the child and so the whole life of
   God is in the fee- blest Believer. If you will mark the signs of a
   sheep, you shall see them more or less distinctly in every one of the
   lambs. The sheep of God are harmless, "Holy, harmless, undefiled,
   separate from sinners." They can bear, but they cannot revenge. They
   have neither power nor will to hurt others.

   They would sooner be cheated a thousand times than wrong their fellow
   men. They may sometimes be "wise as ser-pents"--they are commanded to
   be so. But then they blend with this the obedience to the precept, "Be
   you harmless as doves." If I see any man injuring his fellows--tearing,
   rending, fighting, quarrelling--if I see him blustering and proud,

   1 discern at once that he is no sheep of God. For this is the mark of
   the Lord's people--that they, when reviled, revile not again--but have
   put on as the elect of God, a heart of compassion, kindness and
   long-suffering. You will find this holy non-resistance of evil even
   more in the lambs than in some of the sheep, for worldly influences
   frequently wear off this beautiful bloom from older professors.

   The sheep goes further than the non-inflicting of evil, it bears evil
   without complaint. They are led to the slaughter and they are silent.
   They are thrown down by the shearer, but they are dumb. There is
   nothing revolting in the sight of the slaughter of a lamb even by our
   ordinary butchery, for the gentle creature is so passive and silent
   that with scarcely a struggle its life oozes forth from it. Long before
   the knife is at their throats, the swine awaken all the neighborhood,
   fitly teaching us how rebellious are the wicked under their trials and
   how horribly they are afraid of death.

   But in the case of the lamb there is so little to shock or disgust,
   that the most delicate might have stood in the tabernacle of old and
   seen the multitudes of lambs slaughtered without feeling any other
   emotion than a hallowed awe at the sinfulness of sin and the value of
   the Atonement by which it is put away. The extraordinary patience of
   the sheep is seen in God's people when they joyously endure a weight of
   affliction and pass through the valley of death with composure. Whether
   it is to the knife of death or to the shears of his persecutors, the
   faithful is alike patient and the lambs of the flock partake of the
   same endurance.

   Sheep, again, are clean creatures--clean in their feeding--carrion
   never tempts them--clean in their habits. The sow may revel in her
   wallowing in the mire, but sheep love the green pastures. And if it
   dirties itself it is not easy till it has cleaned itself as best it
   may. So God's people are holy. Be specially mindful of holiness, my
   beloved Friends, for when men begin to despise holiness, they lose one
   of the most prominent marks of a child of God. Now the lambs may not
   have all the excellencies of the sheep, but they quite as earnestly
   pant after holiness. Their daily prayer is--

   "Teach me to run in Your commands, It is a delightful road. Nor let my
   head, nor heart, nor hands, Offend against my God."

   They pant to be perfect in their obedience to God, and sigh and cry
   when they find, by daily experience, that the flesh lusts for evil and
   that the tendency of the heart is to go astray. Furthermore the sheep
   is guileless. You see the lion creeping through the thicket full of
   cunning. But sheep have none. "Poor, simple sheep," we say. And God's
   people are a simple people. Like Nathaniel of old, we may say of them,
   "Behold an Israelite, indeed, in whom is no guile." Those who are
   crafty and cunning betray but very little of the spirit of Jesus. Jesus
   was no dupe for knaves, but at the same time, a fool was safe in His
   hands.

   And so with the Christian, he is not to be so foolish as to be the prey
   of every deceiver, but he is to be so generous that the most foolish
   shall never be wronged, or have advantage taken of them by him. The
   lambs bear this character as well as the sheep--they, too, know no
   guile. Again, sheep are tractable. When a man tames a lion so that he
   may sport with it, he gets the name of lion-tamer. Nobody is renowned
   for taming a sheep, for it has a tractable disposition. And so all the
   elect of God, when they have been renewed by Divine Grace, have an
   obedient and yielding spirit. They are willing to follow their great
   Protector at His will. "Not my will, but Yours be done," is the
   constant bleat of every sheep and every lamb of the flock when it is in
   a right state of heart. The lambs, then, are truly sheep in all the
   essential points.

   Do not forget, dear Friends, that the lambs are truly CHRIST'S sheep.
   They are as dearly bought with His blood. They are as surely objects of
   His care. They are as manifestly illustrations of His power. They shall
   as certainly be proofs of His faithfulness, as the strongest of the
   flock. When you look upon a child of God who has only known his Lord
   for the last few days, you must not despise him, for he is as dear to
   the Savior's heart as the most advanced Believer. He was as much loved
   in all eternity as you were, and will be as much loved in the eternity
   to come as you can be.

   Well, but if they are truly sheep and truly Christ's sheep, why are
   they lambs? And in what way are they distinguished? Some of them are
   lambs for age, though not all. For there are some young Christians who
   are full grown, and there are others very aged who remain to be lambs,
   still. Growth in Divine Grace does not coincide with progress in human
   stature. Many men are seventy years old and are, nevertheless, little
   children in Grace. And, on the other hand, there are a few who at
   twenty are as solid and profound and spiritual as veterans of eighty.
   It is not a man's age alone, yet for the most part the young in years
   are also children in the Divine family.

   The distinguishing mark lies rather in spiritual deficiencies--they are
   but children in knowledge. Many in the Church do not as yet understand
   the loftier doctrines of Revelation. They know Christ. They know
   themselves, somewhat, but they cannot "comprehend with all saints, what
   are the lengths and breadths." As yet they have not taken a high degree
   in Christ's school. They sit at His feet with Mary, but they have not
   come to lean their heads upon His bosom with John. Some doctrines
   greatly puzzle them. They are the subjects of many doubts and fears
   under which they would not suffer if they knew more. They are easily
   put out by those who oppose themselves against the Word of God because
   they are not established in what they know. They have not yet come to
   know the arguments which prove a doctrine. They believe, but scarcely
   know why they believe--and in this respect they are but lambs of the
   flock.

   They are immature also in experience. They know that they have an evil
   heart, but they have not felt all its evil yet-- they know not the
   plague within as they will when God permits the fountains of the great
   deep to be broken up. Their heavy trials are yet to come. They have not
   yet felt the foot of Satan upon their necks in the valley of
   humiliation, nor trod the dark places of the Valley of Death. They have
   not tried and proved this wicked world--they are consequently too
   trustful of men. They have not yet proved the promises of God and their
   veracity. They have not as yet passed through the deep waters supported
   by an Almighty arm.

   They have not forded the floods of flame, protected by Omnipotent love.
   They are shallow in the inner life, their experience is only up to
   their ankles. They have not learned to swim in the stream. Their little
   boats keep near the shore. They have not passed the great and deep sea.
   They are raw recruits in the army and have not yet seen the garments
   rolled in blood. So are they lambs in tenderness of feeling. They are
   too susceptible, and therefore acutely feel the unkindness of the
   world. If anyone speaks evil of them, they fret over it. If their
   conduct is misconstrued by the wicked, they are greatly troubled.

   They have sleepless nights as the results of a slander which stronger
   saints would smile at. They have not as yet acquired that hardness to
   which the Christian soldier attains by enduring hardness. Young
   Believers cry out where advanced Believers would hardly wince. An ounce
   is more to them than a pound to the strong man. They cannot bear the
   brunt of the battle or the storm--they need seasoning for the strife.
   They are lambs for tenderness.

   Then, again, they are timid and trembling, and dare not courageously
   proclaim themselves at all times on the Lord's side. To give a reason
   of the hope that is in them with meekness and fear is a great trial to
   them. Coming before the Church was a very blessed lesson to them--it
   braced their nerves and exercised their courage. They need a few more
   such exercises, for they are still very retiring and love most the rear
   of the army. They can hardly pray in public. If they were asked to say
   a few words even to five or six children in a Sunday school class, they
   would quake for fear. It will be some time before they can be compared
   to lions for boldness. They have need of more Divine Grace lest they
   fail to avow their Lord in the hour ofpersecution. They are poor timid
   lambs still.

   Perhaps, too, they are subject to melancholy, to doubts and fears and
   distresses of mind. They cannot mount up as on the wings of eagles, but
   their wings are so broken that they lie on the ground and flutter. They
   are the subjects of very great questioning. They sing that hymn which
   just expresses the groanings of doubting babes--

   "It is a point I long to know, Oft it causes anxious thought Do I love
   the Lord, or no? Am I His, or am I not?"

   When any trial assails them, how difficult it is for them! When a
   temptation assaults them, they do not yield to it, but it gives them
   very grievous pain and costs them many struggles. They cannot even
   think of meeting Apollyon without feeling the blood fly from their
   cheeks for very fright.

   I might continue thus to describe the various weaknesses and
   infirmities of the lambs, but I must stop. Suffice it to say that
   everything which is wanted to make them perfect Christians they already
   have. But they have it as yet in an im- mature and undeveloped state.
   Everything is there. But it is feeble. Their faith is yet a sapling and
   not a tree. Their love is a spark, not a fire. Their hope is a
   fledgling and not a full grown bird. In all respects they are
   immature--weak eyes, hands hanging down, feeble knees and stammering
   tongue--all show their need of more Grace.

   I will give you a picture of some of them, to bring them more before
   your mind. There is one dear lamb--a boy of thirteen or fourteen. A
   pious mother has made that child the object of her constant prayers. He
   comes to a Sunday school class. He sits in the Tabernacle--it always
   gives me great joy to see so many lads and children come here--and I
   frequently notice that many of them are as attentive during the
   preaching of the Word as any of the elder folks. Well, the Lord blesses
   the Word to that child while but thirteen or fourteen. You know we have
   had the happiness of receiving several such into our Church.

   Now, as you look upon that curly-headed young soldier, you cannot but
   think of all the trouble which may befall him and temptations that may
   assail him. I am sure there are neither mothers nor fathers in the
   whole Tabernacle who do not feel the tears welling up into their eyes.
   We begin to pray, "Lord, keep that lamb. Preserve it safely." We
   think--I am afraid there is a little self-conceit about it--that a
   child is more in danger than we are. And our heart is moved to anxious
   prayer for it. What more melting sight than a child baptized into Jesus
   upon profession of its faith? May many such lambs be found among us!

   Picture another. There are many such here, and thank God there is a
   dear mother in connection with this Church who nurses and nourishes
   them. I refer to the case of a young woman--father and mother are
   ungodly. She is out in a situation. She works and honorably toils. The
   Grace of God has entered her heart and there is something inexpressibly
   beautiful about her young piety--for she has had to forsake fond
   associations for Christ's sake. In the workroom they point at her as a
   religious girl--they give her a name of scorn. She bears it--she bears
   it cheerfully. But when we think of how she has to suffer every day, we
   may well be anxious. Perhaps there is poverty mingled with her other
   trials. And poverty has its temptations and some of these are of the
   severest character.

   When we see these young women, and young men, too, thus exposed to
   perilous persecutions and cruel mockings, we number them with the lambs
   and our heart is very anxious for them. We are glad to see them brought
   into the fold, but we rejoice with trembling. These are our jewels.
   These are the sheaves that we reap in our Master's fields. But when we
   recollect the temptations to which they are exposed, we look with pity
   upon these poor tempted ones and thank our loving Jesus that there is a
   promise on purpose for them.

   I might single out too, as another specimen, yonder aged woman. She has
   lived for seventy years without God and without Christ, knowing nothing
   beyond a formal religion--bearing "a name to live"--but being truly
   "dead." And now, at last, in her old age, when the body is tottering
   and the faculties feeble, she has found Christ and she has come forward
   to be baptized. It has been our joy to receive some into Church
   fellowship who have passed the threescore years and ten allotted to
   human life and have gone trembling down into the baptismal pool in
   obedience to their Lord.

   Seeing their infirmities and the fact that much of the intellect is
   weakened--the eyes have become dim so that they cannot read, and the
   memory has become frail so that sermons do not profit them as they do
   younger persons--we look upon these as lambs, needing as they do so
   much of the gathering arm and the nourishing bosom of the great Bishop
   and Shepherd of souls.

   Shall I pause to describe one other? You know her well. She is a member
   of the Church, but she thinks she ought not to be in her fit of grief.
   She even writes to the pastor to tell him that she wishes he would put
   her out, for she is not a Christian. And yet, in a few days, she
   retracts the note and begs him to forget it. She very seldom can read
   her title clear--in fact, she never did but once or twice--and that was
   on very bright sunshiny days when her soul was exceedingly glad. She is
   like Mrs. Much-Afraid in the castle--Giant Despair has shut her up in
   one of his dark dungeons and frequently uses the crab-tree cudgel upon
   her until she has grown a sorrowful creature, indeed. We have a few
   Brothers and Sisters of the same spirit. They go limping and halting.
   We number these, too, among the lambs of the flock.

   I have given a too lengthy description, but you will not fail, from
   this time on, very readily to recognize the lambs. You will see that in
   all Christian Churches they make up a large proportion.

   II. Let us come then, in the second place, to EXPRESS OUR FEARS
   CONCERNING THESE LAMBS OF THE FLOCK. We are afraid for them, because of
   the howling wolves there are about. Some of us can bear to be laughed
   at. We have grown so used to it that it has become the atmosphere which
   we breathe. But we do pity these new beginners. We know the cruel
   mockings, which if they break not the bones, yet often break the
   heart--and we are afraid lest these lambs should turn back, lest they
   should say, "I cannot endure this," and so seek the warm side of the
   hedge and forsake their Lord and Master.

   Yet more, we are afraid of another order of wolves--the wolves in
   sheep's clothing--those hypocrites, who by their bad living cause the
   poor lambs to stumble and make them think that surely, religion must be
   a deception and a lie. And those other wolves--doctrinal wolves--full
   of all manner of error. We have them always prowling round our
   Churches. There is the Antinomian, too glad to get hold of any young
   lamb he can seduce with his fawning pretences to love a Free Grace
   Gospel and the freewill wolf, which drags some away from the Truth of
   God. And wolves of all sorts that are continually trying to deceive, if
   it were possible, the very elect.

   We are afraid for these young ones, knowing how easily they are carried
   about by every wind of doctrine. We are equally alarmed, too, because
   of their association with the goats. There is another flock in the
   world--the devil's flock. It is not easy for a Christian man to
   associate with the world without feeling the influence of it. We are
   afraid for some of the young ones, when they have to mingle in their
   work and in their family associations with the baser sort. The worst
   form of ill association is an ungodly marriage. I do not know anything
   that gives me more satisfaction than to see our Brothers and Sisters,
   who have walked in the faith of God, united in marriage--the husband
   and the wife both fearing and loving God.

   It is a delightful spectacle and is the best means of building up the
   Church with a generation which shall fear the Lord. But a very fruitful
   source of ruin to Church members is that of a young man or a young
   woman choosing an ungodly partner in life. They never can expect God's
   blessing upon it. They tell you, sometimes, they hope to be the means
   of their friend's conversion. They have no right to hope such a thing.
   It so seldom occurs. The much more likely thing is that the ungodly one
   will drag the other down to his level than that the godly one shall
   pull the other up.

   We are fearful, I say, for the lambs--for we have marked some of them
   that were as earnest as they well could be and apparently as loving to
   their Lord and Master--but another love came across their path and
   where are they now? Perhaps the House of God sees them no longer and
   the theater or the ball room is now their delight. When we think of
   some cases of this kind that have occurred we do tremble for the lambs.
   And we lift up our hearts in prayer to God for them, that they may be
   kept, as kept they will be, if they are truly the Lord's.

   Then we are jealous over the lambs, because of the old lion. We have
   some of us had to meet him face to face, and I do assure you I had
   sooner suffer any temptation that the world or the flesh can bring than
   to be tempted of the devil. For when Apollyon meets Christian in the
   valley, it is no child's play. A man needs to be the master of every
   heavenly weapon to get the victory there. Better to go twenty miles
   round, over hedge and ditch, than to have one conflict with Satan.
   There is nothing gained by it. Even should we overcome, we shall be
   wounded and to our dying day will bear the scars of the terrible
   conflict.

   I can now remember one or two instances in which I have had to stand
   foot to foot with that arch-Fiend. And though my soul has held her own
   through Divine Grace, I look back upon those days of trial with sorrow
   still, for there were blasphemous thoughts injected which I never can
   forget. They were fiery darts thrown at me, and though the barbed
   shafts have been drawn out, the wounds are still there. Would God it
   had been possible to have gone that road without contending with the
   Fiend! We are afraid for you, young Lambs, when we think of the lion.

   We are even more concerned when we think of the bear. A flattering
   world hugs tightly. The lion tears and rends and rages--but the
   world--when it takes to loving, speaks, oh, so gently! And puts the
   thing so nicely! It loves the Chris-tian--so it says. It is fashionable
   to be religious. It is a creditable thing to be a professor and then
   the world says, "Come to my arms. I love you. Come and be one with me
   and be a Christian, too! Be not so Puritanical as to thrust me away."
   We are more afraid of the hugs of the bear than of the teeth of the
   lion.

   When we put all these dangers together, we add to them the fact that
   lambs are subject to the same diseases which are incident to all sheep.
   They, too, get the foot-rot of weariness in the ways of God. They begin
   to be slothful and sluggish in the cause of God. They, too, suffer from
   coldness of heart, have a tendency to wander and catch the stiff neck
   of pride. Dear Lambs of the flock! Those who have to see after you and
   are God's under-shepherds may well offer no apology when they say they
   tremble for you and put up earnest prayers on your behalf!

   III. In the third place, let us REJOICE IN THE GOOD SHEPHERD. "He shall
   gather the lambs with His arm and carry them in His bosom." Who is He
   of whom such gracious words are spoken? Who is He that cares so
   tenderly for lambs? Listen! These are the words of Isaiah--"Behold, the
   Lord God will come with strong hands and His arms shall rule for Him.
   Behold, His reward is with Him and His work before Him. He shall feed
   His flock like a shepherd." So, then, it is the Lord Jehovah who comes
   forth to bless His people in this fashion!

   What condescension is here! The Lord God, the Eternal and Infinite,
   acts the part of a Shepherd. But let us read on. The words which follow
   the text may well astound you, when you see how our great God stoops
   from His loftiness to carry lambs in His bosom. "Who has measured the
   waters in the hollow of His hand and meted out Heaven with the span and
   comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the
   mountains in scales and the hills in a balance? Who has directed the
   Spirit of the Lord, or being His counselor has taught him?...Behold,
   the nations are as a drop of a bucket and are counted as the small dust
   of the balance. Behold, He takes up the isles as a very little thing."

   And yet this same God who does all these things gathers lambs in His
   arms and carries them in His bosom! I am sure we are not sufficiently
   sensible of the infinite love of God in stooping to consider us. Alas,
   that such condescension should be so unregarded! Remember, I pray you,
   that infinite power engages to protect you, that inimitable affection
   sets itself on you, that wisdom which cannot err watches for your good,
   and that which never can be turned aside pledges itself to bless you.
   Why, that God should provide for such creatures as we are is some
   condescension! That He should think of them with a Father's heart is
   marvelous.

   "What is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that You
   visit him?" That He should carry man, no, the weakest of such men, the
   lambs among this flock--that He should carry them in His arms! What
   shall I say to this? I will be silent on a theme which needs a more
   eloquent tongue than mine. Blessed be the name of such a gracious God.
   Brethren, rejoice in this tender Shepherd. Be confident, be grateful,
   be joyful, be thankful, be of good cheer evermore, for He it is that
   carries you is Jesus Christ!

   But why? Why does He carry lambs in His bosom? First, because He has a
   tender heart and any weakness at once melts Him. If He sees a lamb He
   stops as you would do if you are gentle of spirit. If He hears your
   sigh, your groan, or marks your ignorance or your feebleness--the very
   tenderness of His mind, even if there were nothing else--would
   constrain Him to look upon you. But more, it is His office to consider
   the weak. For this it is that He was made a faithful High Priest--that
   He might have compassion on the ignorant. For this it is that He became
   the Mediator. He were nothing if He had not this--I mean to say that
   His office would be a mere sinecure, but a nominal thing, if there were
   no weak and feeble ones for Him to care for.

   Remember, too, that He was a Lamb Himself once. What a mysterious fact!
   If a man could have been a lamb and known a lamb's weakness, how would
   he sympathize with it! Our Jesus was and is the Lamb of God that takes
   away the sin of the world. He knows what strong temptations mean for He
   has felt the same. Do you enquire for more reasons why He carries them
   in His bosom? He purchased them with blood. He sees the marks of His
   passion upon each of them, and therefore He prizes them and will not
   suffer them to perish. They are His property. He is their Proprietor.
   Another man's lamb He might not so carefully carry. But His own lamb,
   the gift of His Father, the purchase of His blood, the heritage of His
   reward--He must and will care for that.

   Moreover, remember, He is responsible for that lamb. At Jacob's hand
   Laban required all the sheep. And at Jesus' hand every elect one will
   be required at the last. He is the Surety of the Everlasting Covenant,
   and He is bound by Covenant engagements to bring the many sons home to
   Glory and not to suffer one whom His Father has given Him to perish by
   the way. Nor will He fail in His Covenant, my Beloved. He will be true
   to His pledge and say at the last, "Here am I, and the flock committed
   to My care."

   Moreover, they are all a part of His Glory. This flock will be as the
   jewels of His crown. If He lost one of them He would lose a part of His
   fullness, a part of His reward of His soul's travail. Therefore will He
   never turn away His eyes from them, or His hands from doing them good,
   but He will preserve them to the end.

   But what does He say He will do? He says, "He will carry them." How
   does He do that--how does Jesus carry weak saints? Sometimes He carries
   them by not permitting them to endure much trouble. "He tempers the
   wind to the shorn lamb." He takes them up in the arms of Providence and
   carries them where there is no trouble. At other times they are carried
   in His arms by having some tender, loving person to take care of them.
   He carries them instrumentally. As Christians and the other women had
   Mr. Great-Heart to kill the giants for them, so many saints are carried
   in the bosom of Christ Jesus by the loving care of some godly relative,
   or friend, or pastor.

   At other times, such lambs are carried by having an unusual degree of
   love given them, and consequently a large amount of joy, so that they
   bear up and stand fast. Though their knowledge may not be deep, they
   have great sweetness in what they do know. They may have but little to
   feed on, but that little is great from its nutritive power, and they
   have strong digestive powers given them by which they may even suck
   honey out of a rock, and oil out of a flinty rock. The little becomes
   much. The barley loaves and few small fishes are sufficient for the
   thousands of their necessities.

   Sometimes He carries them by giving them a very simple faith. Their
   faith may not be very strong, but it is very simple. And after all, I
   do not know whether I would not almost as soon have a simple faith as a
   strong faith, if the two could be divided. That simple faith which
   takes the promise just as it stands--may not comprehend its meaning
   fully--yet it believes it and runs straight to Jesus with every
   trouble. That is very beautiful in a child. The child has no great
   extent of knowledge and is not strong enough to defend itself, but what
   does it say when mistreated in the street? "I will tell Father." And so
   simple souls will go and tell their Father. They run to their big
   Brother, the great Savior. And so the simplicity of their faith gives
   them an unusual degree of confidence and they are carried in Jesus'
   bosom.

   But to close this point. How does He carry them? He carries them in His
   bosom--not on His back. That is how He carries stray sheep--He flings
   them over His shoulders rejoicing, but they do not rejoice, mind you.
   They will not rejoice, for they have wandered. They must be made to
   feel the weight of the crook and they must pray, "Make the bones which
   you have broken to rejoice." But, "He carries the lambs in His bosom."
   Here is put forth, Brothers and Sisters, boundless affection. Could He
   put them in His bosom if He did not love them much? Where does the
   Father place the Son? He is in the bosom of the Father. Where did
   Abraham carry Lazarus? In his bosom. Where did Naomi bear her young
   grandson Obed? He was in her bosom. Where did the man in the parable
   put his little ewe lamb? In his bosom. Christ is boundless in His
   affection.

   Then there is tender nearness. How near to a man is that which is in
   His bosom! Here you see the Lord Jesus Christ does not put His people
   at a distance from Himself so that He has to stretch out His hands for
   them, but He keeps them near. He needs not stretch out His hands at
   all. So near are they that they could not possibly be nearer. Then it
   is a hallowed familiarity. Lambs, when put into the bosom, having no
   intellect, cannot therefore learn anything. But the lambs of Christ's
   flock, whenever they ride in Christ's bosom, talk with Him. They tell
   Him all their secrets and He tells them His. "The secret of the Lord is
   with them that fear Him. And He will show them His Covenant."

   Oh, there are some precious love passages between Christ and His weak
   ones when they are snugly housed in His bosom! It is almost profanity
   to talk of the union and communion, the fellowship and converse, the
   delightful interchange of everything that is sweet and loving between
   Christ and His chosen ones in His bosom! And then, dear Friends, you
   must not fail to remember that there is perfect safety. The dear ones
   in His bosom--what can hurt them? They must hurt the Shepherd first.
   How can they get the lamb out of the Shepherd's arms? Must they not cut
   off the Shepherd's arms before they can hurt the lamb? Must they not
   smite Him through His body before they can kill the creature whom He
   embraces?

   How safe are you, O weak Believers! You are borne up on eagles' wings.
   The shot must pierce the parent bird before it can reach you. The devil
   must destroy your Shepherd before he can slay you. Here is comfort! Oh,
   what a soft place to ride! How warm! Oh, how the warmth of the
   Shepherd's heart cheers His lambs! The warmth of Jesus and the
   delightful comfort of His Presence shall be enjoyed by you--the very
   weakest of you in answer to the supplications we put up for you--and as
   a result of your faith in Jesus.

   I do not know what you think after reading this promise, but I think I
   should like to be a lamb again. Some of us have outgrown our times of
   doubts, and fearfulness, and so on. We have to take the work of a
   shepherd. I love to be a shepherd under my Master. But there is many a
   time I envy you. I would delight to sit in the pew and hear a sermon
   instead of preaching, sometimes--to be fed--instead of feeding you.
   Some of you have grown to be strong men and are engaged in looking
   after others. You now look back, not with sorrow, exactly, but with
   some regret upon the sweetness of your young days--when you were so
   little in Israel--but were so daintily fed, so wondrously cared for.

   You remember what the shepherds did with Mr. Great-Heart and all the
   company when they came to the Delectable Mountains. The shepherds said,
   "Come in, Mr. Ready-to-Halt, come in, Mr. Fearing, come in, Mrs.
   Much-Afraid." But they never said, "Come in, Mr. Great-Heart." We look
   after the feeble. As to you that are strong, we know you will take the
   comforts to yourselves. Ah, but the strongest sometimes get very weak.
   And those that do exploits for God at times feel as if they could creep
   into a mouse-hole and hide their heads anywhere among the very feeblest
   of the Lord's people if they could but enjoy the comforts which He is
   pleased to give them.

   IV. And now, to conclude, LET US HEAR THE SHEPHERD'S VOICE. If you are
   the lambs, hear the Shepherd's voice which says, "Follow Me." You that
   are weak and feeble and young in the Divine life, keep close to Jesus.
   Imitate the example of Caleb, of whom we spoke a Sunday or two ago, and
   follow the Lord fully. Be obedient to all His commands and let His
   faintest wish be your Law. Keeping close to Jesus, you shall realize
   the sweetness of the text.

   To you that are not lambs, and as yet are not brought openly into His
   fold, hear His words, "Come unto Me." That gentle Shepherd who
   condescends to carry the lambs may well entice you to Himself. Come,
   guilty Souls, and flee away to Him who will not break the bruised reed
   nor quench the smoking flax. Take His yoke upon you and learn of Him,
   for He is meek and lowly of heart, and you shall find rest unto your
   souls. No domineering Lord commands you to crouch as a slave at His
   feet. The generous Jesus says, "Come unto Me, all you that labor and
   are heavy laden and I will give you rest." By His love and by His pity,
   by His deep compassion and His infinite love, I beseech you, come to
   Him!

   Then, too, those of us who are His sheep, let us hear the Shepherd's
   voice, saying, "Feed My lambs." If at any time we have offended, and
   like Peter, backslidden, let this be the token of our love--this the
   seal by which we show to Him how true is our repentance--let us feed
   the lambs. O matrons and strong men--mothers in Israel and princes in
   our host-- look well to your sons and daughters! See well to your
   little ones! Train them up for Jesus! Where you see the Divine spark,
   blow them with your warm breath. Watch for the feeble.

   "Comfort you, comfort you My people, says your God. Speak you
   comfortably" unto the tender ones. Lay yourselves out, Beloved, to do
   good to these weak ones. Spend and be spent. Bear their burdens, and so
   fulfill the Law of Christ. And the Lord accept and bless you all,
   whether sheep or lambs, for His dear sake. Amen.

                              Direction In Dilemma

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 22, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Standstill and see the salvation of the Lord." Exodus 14:13.

   GOD'S great design in all His works is the manifestation of His Glory.
   Any aim less than this were unworthy of Himself. He cannot act for the
   good of His creatures as an ultimate aim, for that were for God to be
   impelled by a motive less great than His own Nature. Since there can be
   nothing greater than the Infinite and there can be but one Infinite--if
   the infinite God is moved by an infinite motive which is the only one
   worthy of Him, that motive must be found in His own Glory. It is, then,
   the Lord's will to manifest His Glory to the sons of men. But how shall
   the Glory of God be manifested to such fallen creatures as we are?

   Man's eyes are not single, he has ever a side glance towards his own
   honor and so is not qualified to behold the Glory of his God. Vanity
   has covered our eyes with scales more dense than those which fell from
   the eyes of Saul of Tarsus. We are always prone to put a high estimate
   upon what we are, or may be, or can feel, or do. It is clear, then,
   that self must stand out of the way that there may be room for God to
   be exalted. And this is the reason, the true secret, why God brings His
   people, oftentimes, into straits and difficulties, that, being brought
   to their wits' end and made conscious of their own folly and weakness,
   they may be fitted to behold the majesty of God when He comes forth to
   work their deliverance.

   A man whose life shall be one even and smooth path will see but little
   of the Glory of God, for he has few occasions of self-emptying, and
   therefore but little fitness for being filled with the Revelation of
   God. They who navigate little streams and shallow creeks know but
   little of the God of tempests. But they who "go down to the sea in
   ships and do business in great waters, these see the works of the Lord,
   and His wonders in the deep." Among the huge Atlantic waves of
   bereavement, poverty, temptation and reproach, we learn the power of
   Jehovah, because we feel the littleness of man. Self-esteem is that
   speck in the eye which most effectually mars human vision. The Great
   Surgeon of souls removes this from us chiefly by sanctified
   afflictions.

   At the mouth of the furnace the Great Purifier sits as a Refiner to
   purify the sons of Levi--and when this work has been achieved and they
   have become pure in heart, the Divine purpose is accomplished. Then
   God's Glory is manifested, for the pure in heart shall see the Lord.
   Thank God, then, dear Brothers and Sisters, if you have been led by a
   rough road--it is this which has given you your experience of God's
   loving kindness. Your troubles have enriched you with a wealth of
   knowledge to be gained by no other means. Your trials have been the
   cleft of the rock in which God has set you as He did His servant Moses,
   that you might behold His Glory as it passed by.

   Praise your God, O sons of sorrow that you have not been left to the
   darkness and ignorance which continued prosperity might have involved.
   Bless Him that you have been capacitated to show forth His Glory by
   being permitted and honored to endure a great fight of affliction. Our
   one aim in life is, I trust, to glorify our God, and if so, are not
   those afflictions precious which enable us to honor Him? We will call
   them friends if they help us to praise God. We will wear them as jewels
   and rejoice in them as a bride rejoices in her ornaments if they aid us
   in glorifying our blessed Lord. In this spirit we may almost envy the
   children of Israel as we see them entangled in the wilderness and
   overtaken by their foes, for now shall they see the mighty arm of God
   made bare!

   Our text exhibits the posture in which a man should be found while
   exercised with trial. Methinks, also, it shows the position in which a
   sinner should be found when he is under trouble on account of sin. We
   will employ it in both ways.

   I. Take our text first as A PICTURE OF THE BELIEVER WHEN HE IS REDUCED
   TO GREAT STRAITS. Then God's command to him is, "Stand still and see
   the salvation of the Lord." In this brief sentence there are two things
   very conspicuous--first, what is to be done, "Stand still." And
   secondly, what is to be seen, "See the salvation of the Lord."

   1. What is to be done? The man is brought, we will suppose, into very
   extraordinary difficulties. He cannot retreat-- that is sure
   destruction. He cannot go forward--that appears to be an impossibility.
   On the right hand he is shut up by Providential hindrances--on the left
   an adversary prevents him. Here, then, is the counterpart of Israel's
   position-- Egyptians behind, the Red Sea in front, the craggy steeps of
   Pi Hahiroth on the right and the fortresses of Migdol and Baal Zephon
   frowning on the left. What is the Believer to do? The Master's word is
   the same to him as to Israel, "Stand still."

   Brethren, let me warn you of other advisers. Despair whispers, "Cast
   yourself down, lie down and die. Complain against God. Give it all up.
   You have been buffeting for years with circumstances and you have made
   no headway. Give up the unfair contest. Float with the stream, even
   though you go over the waterfall. Let the worst come to the worst, for
   there is no hope of any success in life for you. If the Lord will
   always give you evil and not good, then curse God and die. No longer
   attempt to provide things honest in the sight of all men, just let
   things go as they will. Drift into poverty, or die in a ditch. God has
   given you up--evidently you have been the butt for all His arrows, the
   target for all His shots. Now, despair, let there be an end of the
   thing."

   Not so, says the God of our salvation. He loves us too well to bid us
   yield to despondency. He would have us put a cheerful courage on and
   even in our worst times rejoice in His love and faithfulness. Faith
   hears the bidding of her faithful God and is not willing to be shut up
   in the iron cage of despair. No, she defies the old giant to put so
   much as a finger upon her. Lie down and die? That she never will, while
   her God bids her stand. See, Beloved, the word stand. What does it
   mean? Keep the posture of an upright man, ready for action, expecting
   further orders, cheerfully and patiently awaiting the directing voice.
   This is a noble posture, but to despair is mean and beggarly.

   Up, Brothers and Sisters, play the man, be strong! While Jehovah lives
   there is no room for fear. A happy future awaits you--yes, the present
   itself is bright with mercy--for the Lord's love is still the same--

   "Behind a frowning Providence He hides a smiling face."

   "Ah," says Cowardice, "Retreat." Cowardice whispered to the children of
   Israel that it was better to go back into Egypt. They are willing to go
   with ropes on their necks and their hands bound behind them and give
   themselves up to Pharaoh. To have their lives spared, they will
   relinquish their liberty. Hear them--they are basely talking about
   their graves while they are yet alive!

   So Cowardice, sometimes, when the Christian comes into a great strait,
   whispers, "Retreat to the worldling's way of action! You cannot play
   the Christian's part, it is too difficult. Evidently there are some men
   who can have faith in God and can live in this world, but you cannot.
   If you must be in business, it is vain to attempt to be a Christian,"
   says Cowardice. "Do as others do--follow the hollow maxims and tricky
   customs that once ruled you. Let the shop be opened again on Sunday.
   Adulterate the goods once more. Tell lies as you once did. Be as other
   men are--go back and be Satan's slave. It is evident that religion will
   not keep a coat on your back and bread on your table. Give it up now.
   Go back! Relinquish the ways of God and be once more a bond slave to
   your own corruptions and to the world's evil habits."

   Ah, Trembler, however much Satan may urge this course upon you, you
   cannot follow it if you are a child of God. Cowardice may bid you do
   it, friends may advise it, and the devil may drive you to it--but if
   God has quickened you by His Divine Spirit, there is a something in you
   which is bound to go forward, which you yourself may struggle against,
   by virtue of the power of the old man, but which will get the mastery
   over you and lead you in a Divine captivity. So that even when evil is
   most rampant, the force of Divine Grace within will impel you towards
   the right, constraining you to stand in the ways of God.

   Where God impels forward, Hell cannot drive back. O Sun, you turn not
   back because of the clouds which veil your splendors. Predestinated of
   the Lord to persevere in your perpetual path, you climb, still, the
   steep of Heaven and soon you descend to the western deeps. You pause
   not for tempest, hurricane, or storm. As a strong man runs a race, so
   do you speed onward towards your far-off goal, for the Almighty bade
   you move and in His might you travel onward evermore. So is it with
   you, Christian, God has said, "Forward." His Divine fiat has bid you go
   from strength to strength, and so you shall, and neither death nor Hell
   shall turn you from your course.

   What if for a while you are called to stand still? This is but to renew
   your strength for some greater advance in due time. Dream not, I pray
   you, of so much as looking back! Take courage and in believing silence
   possess your soul while your Captain bids you, "Stand still, and see
   the salvation of the Lord."

   Rashness, another evil counselor, cries, "Do something! Something or
   other must be done! Do not despair! Do not turn back, but stir yourself
   and leave no stone unturned. To stand still and wait is sheer idleness.
   There is no time to be lost. You must do something, be it right or
   wrong." Yes, but it is well to remember that in some cases, the more
   haste, the worse speed. When a Christian is in very sharp trouble, one
   of his strongest temptations is to be in an unbelieving, fretful state
   of agitation which leads him to premature and unwise action. How sadly
   some who are weak in faith are doing and nudging themselves by
   indiscreet haste! If they could but be quiet in faith, and stand still
   in patience until the Master led the way, they would be led aright. But
   they run before the cloud and fall into the net.

   So in a hurry are they to escape from Pharaoh's clutches that they run
   into them! I am sure that much of the sin which we commit when we are
   in trouble is produced by our being in a flurried state of heart. For
   then our soul is like a silly dove without heart--which has forgotten
   the dovecot and therefore flies here and there, round and round--at
   imminent peril of its life from the hawk. We must be doing something at
   once--we must do it, so we think--instead of looking to God, who will
   not only do something but who will do everything. Many of us, when in a
   strait, are hardly reasonable in our hasty endeavors. Fear blindfolds
   the judgment and makes fools of us. Why is there any need of such
   speedy leaping--why not stand still and look?

   Are all means gone forever if not snatched at in an instant? Will the
   Lord's arm grow short if I wait His time? Such questions we forget to
   ask. And therefore on we go, but our rash advance sinks us deeper in
   the mire. Very soon we try something else and only plunge into greater
   trials. We fly to this friend and take his advice, and then to that,
   and get the reverse. Then we go by our own judgment and are, perhaps,
   greater fools, still. O that we could learn to trust in the Lord with
   all our hearts and lean not to our own understanding! What the
   Christian does with cool deliberation, when he has waited upon God,
   when, like David, he has said, "Bring here the ephod," he does with a
   purpose, and God is with him.

   But what he does when he is excited or depressed, with an aching head
   and a fluttered heart, he will usually find cause to mourn over and
   possibly he will be involved in more trouble through what he has done
   himself, than through the affliction which God sent him. But faith, I
   say, listens neither to Despair, nor to Cowardice, nor to Rashness--it
   hears God say, "Stand still," and, immoveable as a rock, it stands.

   Another hiss of the old serpent, is the suggestion of presumption. "On,
   on," says Presumption, "neck or nothing, make or break. If the sea is
   before you, march into it and expect a miracle. It is true you have no
   Divine command, but never mind, your own daring will work wonders. You
   know you are ordained to inherit Canaan, and therefore go on towards
   it, sea or no sea. God has not commanded you and He has not as yet
   divided the sea, but still go on."

   Dear Brothers and Sisters there is much hellish craft in this
   temptation. It is peculiarly adapted to beguile those advanced
   Christians who know what it is to walk by faith. I am afraid it is very
   easy for us to mistake presumption for faith, although there is a wide
   difference between the two. There is so much of dash and dare about an
   incitement to presumption that brave, Christ-loving spirits must be on
   their guard against it. Presumption will never work the wonders of
   faith. If Christ bids me come on the water to Him, faith shall tread
   the billow. But if I spring upon the water myself, to walk to Christ, I
   must expect to sink far sooner than Peter did!

   When our illustrious Commander puts a man upon an extraordinary work,
   He will give him extraordinary strength. But if a soldier runs without
   the captain's order and defies a giant adversary, he may not expect
   assistance and will be sure to return with defeat. What a needful
   prayer is that, "Show me what I am to do." In dilemmas between one duty
   and another it is so sweet to be humble as a child and wait with
   simplicity of soul upon the Lord. It is sure to be well with us when we
   feel and know our own folly and are heartily willing to be guided by
   the will of God. Such standing still has more true valor in it than the
   mad charges and dashes of an arrogant presuming. My Soul, seek
   earnestly the Divine Grace to stand still in obedience to your Lord's
   behest.

   But in what way are we to stand still, dear Friends? Surely it means
   among other things, that we are to wait awhile. Time is precious, but
   there are occasions when the best use we can make of it is to let it
   run on. If time flies, that is no reason why I am always to fly. Every
   experienced man knows that by being wrongly busy for one hour he may
   make mischief which a lifetime would hardly rectify. I may cut my
   fingers if I am too fast in reaching down for my sword. And if I run
   without waiting to enquire the way, I may run upon my ruin. Many who
   have been very busy in helping themselves had been better off if they
   had been waiting upon their Lord.

   Prayer is never a waste of time. A man who would ride posthaste had
   better wait till he is perfectly mounted or he may slip from the
   saddle. He who glorifies God by standing still is better employed than
   he who diligently serves his own self-will. Wait awhile, then. Wait in
   prayer, however. Call upon God and spread the case before Him. Tell Him
   your difficulty and plead His promise of aid. Express your unstaggering
   confidence in Him--wait in faith--for unfaithful, un-trusting waiting
   is but an insult to the Lord. Believe that if He shall keep you
   tarrying even till midnight, yet He will come at the right time. The
   vision shall come and shall not tarry.

   Wait in quiet patience, not murmuring because you are under affliction,
   but blessing God for it--never murmuring against the second cause, as
   the children of Israel did against Moses. Never wish you could go back
   to the world again, but accept the case as it stands. Put it, as it
   stands, simply and with your whole heart, without any self-will, into
   the hands of your Covenant God, saying, "Now, Lord, not my will, but
   Yours be done. I know not what to do. I am brought to extremities, but
   I will wait until You shall split the floods, or else drive back my
   foes. I will wait if You keep me many a day, for my heart is fixed upon
   You alone, O God, and my spirit waits for You in the full conviction
   that You will yet be my joy and my salvation, my refuge and my strong
   tower."

   Well, Brothers and Sisters, this is what is to be done. I dare say you
   will think it a very easy thing to stand still, but it is one of the
   postures which a Christian soldier learns not without years of
   teaching. I find that marching and quick marching are much easier to
   God's warriors than standing still. It is, perhaps, the first thing we
   learn in the drill of human armies, but it is one of the most difficult
   to learn under the Captain of our salvation. The Apostle seems to hint
   at this difficulty when he says, "Stand fast and having done all, still
   stand." To stand at ease in the midst of tribulation shows a veteran
   spirit, long experience, and much Divine Grace.

   2. But now, secondly, what is to be seen? You are to see, O Believer,
   the salvation of God in your present temporal trials. You are to see
   God's power and love manifested. Now I think I hear you say, "Well, one
   thing I know, I cannot deliver myself out of the dilemma in which I am
   now placed. I had some dependence once upon my own judgment and upon my
   own ability, but that dependence is entirely gone." I thank God for
   that. It is a good thing for you, sometimes, Christian, to be wholly
   weaned from yourself. When you are made sick of self-dependence it is
   not long before your spirit shall be in a healthy state of trustfulness
   in your God.

   "Well, but," you say, "I cannot conceive how God can deliver me. I have
   tried to think by what means He will interpose, but I cannot see a door
   open, nor a way of escape." This is well, too, for now this shows that
   human wisdom is dead. God has nonplussed your wit. He has made a fool
   of your judgment. He laughs to scorn all that keen intellect of yours
   which once was your confidence. Now you shall see Divine Wisdom. When
   self goes, God comes in. And when human wisdom goes, then God's Wisdom
   appears.

   "Well, but," says one, "whatever God may do for me, I can clearly
   perceive it must be His own doing, for I am powerless, paralyzed. I am
   so utterly broken by the strength of this tremendous current that if it
   is stemmed, it must be Divine energy that stems it. I cannot do it."
   And this is well, too, for now your power is dead. It is now that all
   the Glory will be to God. While you had some power to help yourself,
   you would have shared the crown. But now, since all might is centered
   in the Eternal Arms, the whole of the crown shall be put on the Eternal
   Head. I am glad that your flesh is thus brought to a state of utter
   death.

   "Ah, but," you say, "Sir, I cannot believe it possible that I should be
   delivered. I find my faith, this morning, reduced to the lowest ebb. It
   has run dry. I cannot believe the promise. Ah, now," you say, "even my
   faith fails me." Everything that is of the creature has now gone. You
   are like the poor lost one in the desert, your tongue fails for thirst.
   And now the Lord will save you, for the God of Israel will not forsake
   you. Evidently you are reduced to the extremity of an extremity, when
   hope and faith, alike, are drowned. But now it is that the Lord will
   manifest His mighty strength. But you are saying, "What shall I see?"
   Well, I know not precisely what you shall see, except I am sure of
   this--you shall see the salvation of God--and in that salvation you
   shall see two or three things, just as the children of Israel saw them.

   You shall see, if needs be, all nature and all Providence subservient
   to God's love. They saw the waters stand upright, contrary to nature.
   The east wind was made at once to obey God's behests and blow all that
   night. Thus they saw how there was nothing upon earth which could stand
   against the Divine will. And you shall see the same. If it is needful
   for your deliverance, fire shall not burn you, neither shall the floods
   drown you. If you cannot be helped in the common order of Providence,
   God will give some extraordinary proofs of His power. It may be that as
   you look back upon the method of your deliverance, you will be so
   surprised at it that you will say, "If anybody had told me this
   beforehand, I would have laughed at them. But now I admire and wonder
   at the love of God."

   You shall be led to see that all things, even the most deadly, work
   together for good to them that love God. The waters cannot drown them,
   but they shall drown their foes. You will see, again, if you will but
   stand still and see it, that the Lord reigns. You shall have such a
   picture of Jehovah sitting upon His Throne, controlling and overruling
   all things, that you shall extol Him with your whole heart as your God
   and King forever! You shall see most distinctly, if you will but wait
   and look for it, how He can make you a wonder. You shall be a wonder to
   yourself, and marvel how it is that God supports you. You shall be a
   wonder to your enemies. You shall do what they cannot do. You shall
   walk through the depths of the sea, which the Egyptians, wishing to do,
   were drowned.

   You shall see your enemies utterly destroyed, if you will but wait.
   God's bow shall be made quite naked. He shall make bare His arm. Death
   and Hell shall lie at your feet. Your spiritual and your temporal
   trials, too, shall be subdued under you. You shall tread them as straw
   is trod for the dunghill. And as for you, if you will but stand and see
   it, you shall go forth like Miriam with your timbrel of mirth and with
   your dance of joy! You cannot think it possible, shivering as you now
   are with the sight of your troubles, alarmed and afraid, that ever you
   should be singing, "O let us sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed
   gloriously." But you shall, in this life you shall praise Him. And if
   not, in the life which is to come. On that glorious shore you shall
   look back on all these perplexities and tribulations and you shall say,
   "Let us sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously. The horse
   and his rider has He cast into the sea." Only learn to "Stand still and
   see the salvation of the Lord."

   I have had this text burnt into my own consciousness. I desire to be
   found in that posture with regard to my own position in Christ's Church
   and the work that the Master would have me perform. There are hours of
   perplexity when the most willing spirit, anxiously desirous to serve
   the Lord, knows not what part to take. Then what shall it do? Vex
   itself by despair? Fly back in cowardice, turn to the right hand in
   fear, or rush forward in presumption? No, but just say, "Lord, You know
   what I know not. Make a plain path for my feet. Because of my enemies,
   be my Guide. Guide me with Your counsel while on earth and afterward
   receive me to Glory."

   Depend upon it, Beloved, if, by God's Grace, we can get and keep in
   that frame of mind, it will not be long before God shall say to us, as
   distinctly as ever Moses said to the people, "Go forward." And we shall
   go forward to our joy rejoicing, praising and magnifying His dear name!

   II. I intend to take the text in reference to THE SINNER BROUGHT INTO
   THE SAME CONDITION IN A

   MORAL SENSE. I will trust that I have in this House of Prayer this
   morning some who have been led by God's Spirit out of the Egypt of
   their sins, where they did eat the leeks and garlic and onions of their
   own sinful pleasures, but where they were made to smart as bond slaves
   under the Law. You have begun to feel some Divine awakenings. The
   Spirit of God has somewhat delivered you from the corruption of your
   former estate, but you are, as yet, under conviction.

   You have as yet found no peace, no solid peace. Your sins are around
   you. You can hear their hoarse voices as they threaten to drag you back
   or to destroy you. Before you flows the tempestuous and deep sea of
   Divine Wrath--you know how richly you deserve it. And your spirit sinks
   within you as you think how soon it may swallow you up. On the right
   hand and on the left you see no method of escape. You had hoped to
   deliver yourself by your own righteousness, but the Law, like Pi
   Hahiroth, rises up with craggy battlements and blocks the way. On the
   right hand you seek to escape by ceremonies, but some dreadful threat
   of God against the depravity of your nature at once shuts out all hope
   in that direction.

   You are come, this day, to a dead stand. Well, now, what are you to do?
   What is the Master's word to you? O Sinner, thus convicted of sin, my
   message from the Lord to you, is "Stand still." Understand what I mean,
   however, by it. I do not mean stand still in indifference, as though it
   were a little matter whether you are damned or not. I do not mean stand
   still in inaction, without prayer, without repentance, without faith.
   What I mean is this--"Stand still"--first in the renunciation of all
   your own righteousness and of all attempts to seek a righteousness by
   your own doings.

   Man, you have been hunting the whole world round to get something that
   may commend you to God--cease your hunting and stand still. You have
   toiled and trod many a weary league of performances, and prayers, and
   thoughts, and willings, and doings--and you are not an inch the better
   for it. You have tried to make yourself feel this, and to compel
   yourself to do the other, but you are still as much in darkness as you
   were at the first. O, leave, leave, I pray you, all these attempts to
   work out a salvation for yourself and with regard to them all, "Stand
   still." For, trembling Soul, how can you hope to save yourself by your
   own doings?

   Can you keep the Law? Remember it is exceedingly broad--it takes in all
   your actions, private as well as public. Your words, even your idle
   words--no, it touches your thoughts--the imagination and the thoughts
   of your heart. Can you keep a Law so spiritual as this? Do you believe
   that you can live without sinful thoughts? Now, mark you, if you had no
   acts of transgression, yet your thoughts, themselves, were enough to
   send you to the lowest Hell. Why, when first of all a Christian gets a
   true view of the spirituality and extent of the Divine command, when he
   hears the Master's Words and understands them, "Whosoever looks on a
   woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his
   heart." When he knows that this is true of every other command--that
   the thought of evil is sin--then he throws down the trowel with which
   he hoped to build himself a Babel tower of righteousness and he says:
   "I cannot do it, it is impossible. The Law is too great. I cannot
   attain unto it."

   Besides, remember your own weakness, Sinner. Have you tried to keep the
   Law? Have you not come down from your chamber in the morning full of
   good resolves as ever were in a man's heart and yet before the first
   meal was over, have you not committed yourself by some wrong
   expression? Some angry temper? Did you ever pass a day without sin?
   Could you do it? Your many failures all tell you that there is no
   strength in your hand sufficient to open the gates of Heaven, no power
   in your feet that shall be strong enough to make you tread the weary
   pathway that would lead to salvation by the works of the Law. Stand
   still, Sinner! Why attempt a task for which you are incapable?

   Do, I pray you, remember that if you could perform it in the future,
   yet your past sins--what about them? Why, man, remember your youth of
   folly? Did you always honor your father and your mother? Did your young
   tongue always speak the truth? Is it not true of you as the Apostle
   said, "They go astray from the womb, speaking lies"? Is it not one of
   the earliest things a child does--to lie? And do not all these things
   stand in the Book of God against you? There are your youthful sins. Who
   among us can look back upon our youth, with all its hot blood, without
   regret? "O God, lay not the sins of my youth at my door!" may be the
   prayer of even the most righteous man.

   And, what about the crimes of your age? O Soul, if you will but look
   back through the glass of the Revelation of God, remembering that your
   thoughts and your words come into the account, you will surely see it
   to be a long, black, dismal list of reasons for condemnation! You
   cannot find in your whole life any cause why mercy should be extended--
   but you can see twenty thousand reasons why justice should have its way
   with you! Why, then, do you seek, being already over head and ears in
   debt, to work out your own salvation by the Law? You have already
   broken it, why try to keep it? That alabaster vase of God's command--if
   you could have kept it spotless and whole, would have been a passport
   of entrance for you at the gates of Heaven. But you have broken
   it--broken it to shivers and your black and foul fingers have taken
   away all whiteness from it. O, be not so foolish as to seek to do what
   your past sins have rendered impossible!

   Moreover, Soul, I do beseech you to remember that you cannot satisfy
   Divine Justice. What if you should put your poor body through a
   thousand mortifications--starve it in a prison, or stretch it upon a
   rack, or broil it upon the fire, or drown it in the sea? None of these
   things could take away the anger of God against you for your sins. No,
   when you shall lie in Hell, though the flames are hot, yet there is no
   power in the torments of Hell to make expiation for sin. The sinner is
   still as much an object of God's righteous detestation, after millions
   of years of agony, as when first the Law's great whip began to fall.

   Why then, do you go about hoping to do what the Justice of God may well
   assure you no creature of the race of Adam can do? And will you
   remember, too, that if--if you could atone for the past--and if you
   could prevent one sin for the future, yet you, yourself, are vile. Your
   nature is as evil as your actions. The marrow of your bones is
   impregnated with your lusts, and in your blood there rolls a black
   stream of sin. You are yourself loathsome. Not only does evil come from
   you, but there is a fountain of evil within you. The leprosy lies deep
   within.

   You are yourself an enemy to God and your carnal mind cannot be
   reconciled to God. No power can reconcile it. God can give you a new
   mind and a new heart and a right spirit, but the old nature in you is
   so bad that it cannot be mended. It must be dead and buried, crucified
   and slain with Christ. For while it lives there is no perfection for
   you. It cannot help you. It can only mar God's work till God strikes
   the nail through its head, even as Jael slew Sisera of old.

   Sinner, why will you be trying your prayers, your Church attendance,
   your sacraments, your Chapel attendance, your Baptisms and the like?
   All these are a lie and a vanity, if you trust in them. Even God's own
   ordained ordinances become a farce and a delusion when once you make
   them the foundation of your hope--

   "None but Jesus, none but Jesus Can do helpless sinners good."

   SINNER, STAND STILL NOW!

   But now, in the second and last place upon this point, the sinner says,
   "Suppose then, I give up all hope and do no more by way of trusting to
   myself, what shall I see?" Why, you shall see the salvation of God! Do
   remark, dear Friends, that all the sinner can do is to see this
   salvation. He is not to work it out--he is not to help it on--he is to
   see it. Yet, mark you, that the sinner cannot even find out that
   salvation of itself. For if you notice, the next sentence to our text
   is, "which He will show you today." God must show it to us, or else we
   cannot see it. "No man can come to Me, except the Father which has sent
   Me draw him." There must be a manifestation of Christ to us before we
   shall ever be able to perceive Him.

   that the Lord would now, while I talk for a few more minutes, reveal
   His great salvation to some sinner who is standing still! Now, Soul,
   you are thoroughly prepared to give up your self-righteousness. You are
   willing to be nothing and to do nothing in order to save yourself. Then
   let me tell you, God has worked out and brought in a glorious and
   complete salvation--far more resplendent than that which He
   meritoriously worked for Israel in the Red Sea. I will tell you of it.
   First, it was ordained of old, like that deliverance of the Red Sea.
   God had planned that. Before Pharaoh lived, it was written in the
   eternal Decree, "For this purpose have I raised you up, that I might
   show forth My power in you."

   From old eternity God had chosen Israel to be the objects of His love,
   and to cast away Egypt that it might show His honor in His terrible
   justice. The salvation of God's people was ordained of old. Before
   yonder mountains lifted their heads, He ordained to save His people.
   And long before the ancient deeps began to roar in their channels, He
   had chosen them. God did not choose the Israelites because of any
   goodness in them. They were a stiff-necked generation. They had no hand
   in their own choice. He called their father, Abraham, as a Syrian ready
   to perish, and made him His chosen. And He made a covenant with
   Abraham's seed after him. And so God has prepared a salvation for His
   elect, chosen by Him not because of any goodness in them, but because
   He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy, and will have compassion
   on whom He will have compassion.

   Is not this a salvation that will suit you, O poor Sinner? If God had
   chosen them out of any merit, or if that choice depended on anything
   which men did or could do, you were a damned soul, for you have no
   goodness and you can do nothing. If God's election comes to those who
   are without merit, without hope, without strength--here is hope for
   you! In the next place, the salvation which God shows is one worked by
   a Mediator. Moses was the mediator of that time. He stretched his rod
   over the sea. Jesus is the great Mediator, of whom Moses was the feeble
   type. Sinner, Jesus Christ has divided the Red Sea of God's wrath,
   lifting up Himself upon the Cross, a far mightier weapon than Moses'
   rod.

   He made the floods of God's wrath retire that all His chosen might
   march through. If you believe in Him. If standing still, today you will
   but see the salvation of God, you may discern a path to Heaven over
   which no waters of Divine wrath can ever dash. Christ Himself has
   substituted His own Person for yours--He took your guilt and stood as a
   sinner in the sight of God. He was punished instead of your being
   punished, and it is impossible, according to equity, that God can
   punish two for the one offense. If Christ has paid the debt, the debt
   is paid.

   Since Jesus was the Substitute, wrath is gone. If Christ drank all the
   Hell-draught, then there is not a drop left for any of those for whom
   He died to drink. And if you can see this morning (it is all you have
   to do), if you can see that Christ has done this, rest assured that God
   who showed it to you, has not showed you a lie. Well do I remember when
   first my eyes saw the complete salvation of Christ Jesus. I had been
   gadding about after this and that and the other, but when I heard the
   Gospel message, "Look! Look unto Me and be you saved, all you ends of
   the earth," I did nothing. I only trusted Christ to save me.

   1 turned away from deadly doings and from soul-destroying feelings to
   the wounded body of the Savior and believed that He had saved me. I
   trusted to the merit of His life and to the prevalence of His death and
   to the mighty power of His plea. And then the Spirit of God bore
   witness with my spirit that I was born of God and sin was put away.
   Sinner, if you are standing still--I pray God you have been brought to
   that--then LOOK! Can you not see it? Was ever anything more plain?
   Jehovah's darling Son becomes a Man! Oh, mystery of mysteries! God was
   manifest in the flesh as a Man! He stands as the representative Head of
   all His elect.

   Being such, when Justice cried, "Bring here the sinner," Christ came
   forward bound like a captive and a malefactor. "Strip that sinner,"
   said Justice. And they stripped Him naked to His shame. "Bring forth
   the whip," said Justice. "Ply it hard." "He gave His back to the
   smiters and His cheeks to them that plucked off the hair." "Drag Him to
   execution," said Justice, "a sinner must die." They pierced His hands
   and His feet. They lifted Him up upon the tree. They gave Him vinegar
   to drink in the midst of His bitterest grief. They mocked Him in His
   extreme sorrows. He cried to God, but God could not help a sinner and
   Christ stood as such, though in Him was no sin. That shriek of, "Eloi,
   Eloi, lama sabach-thani," was the gathering up of all human misery!

   Hell did not know a more dolorous cry, than "My God, My God, why have
   you forsaken Me?" Let the thunderbolts be launched. Let the lightning
   scathe Him. Let every demon of the pit come up against Him. Let every
   friend forsake Him. Let His heart break, let His tongue cleave to His
   mouth. Let His mouth become a furnace. Let His heart be melted like
   wax. Let the joints of His bones be loosed. Let Him come into the jaws
   of death--the Law requires it all. It is done! Justice, have you any
   more to demand? She answers, "No." The mighty Substitute exclaims, "It
   is finished." And finished it is. The Red Sea of Justice is effectually
   and perpetually divided.

   "But," says one, "is this for the elect?" It is, and for them only.
   "But how do I know whether I am one of them?" The elect are known by
   this--"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me."
   The true mark of election is trust. If you will stand still and trust
   Christ you are as certainly one of His elect as the Apostles that are
   before His Throne. Trust is the infallible mark of election. It is by
   this we make our calling and election sure. Believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ and you shall be saved! Stand still, then, and see salvation in
   Jesus.

   "Well," says one, "but you really do not mean to say that I am now,
   just as I am, to trust Christ to save me and it is all done?" I do.
   Sinner, you have not misunderstood me. It is just that. Sinner, do
   nothing, either great or small. Jesus did it all, long, long ago. To
   add anything to Him were to insult His perfect work. To hope to
   complete His matchless righteousness were impertinence. To imagine that
   you could make better that which He has finished were an idle,
   soul-destroying dream. Take a finished Savior just as He is and you are
   saved now, even though you have no good thing of your own. Away with
   those rusty farthings of your own merit, those proposals and vows of
   your own doings! Take Jesus as He is and that act of accepting Christ
   through His merit saves your soul!

   After you have done this, then will come the command--"Go forward." For
   the present, all we have to say to you, poor Trembler, is, "Stand still
   and see the salvation of God." May the Lord bless these last words to
   the sinner, and my first words to the saint. And, by His Grace, we will
   together stand still and see what the Lord has worked. We will together
   sing unto Him, for He will triumph gloriously and all our enemies shall
   be cast into the midst of the sea! The Lord bless you for Jesus' sake.
   Amen.

                         Paul--His Cloak And His Books

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 29, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when you come, bring with
   you, and the books, but especially the parchments." 2 Timothy 4:13.

   FOOLISH persons have made remarks upon the trifles of Scripture. They
   have marveled why so little a matter as a cloak should be mentioned in
   an Inspired Book. But they ought to know that this is one of the many
   indications that the Book is by the same Author as the Book of Nature.
   Are there not things which our short-sightedness would call trifles in
   the volume of Creation around us? What is the peculiar value of the
   daisy upon the lawn, or the buttercup in the meadow? Compared with the
   rolling sea, or the eternal hills, how inconsiderable they seem!

   Why has the humming bird a plumage so wondrously bejeweled and why is
   so much marvelous skill expended upon the wing of a butterfly? Why such
   curious machinery in the foot of a fly, or such a matchless optical
   arrangement in the eye of a spider? Because to most men these are
   trifles, are they to be left out of Nature's plans? No. Because
   greatness of Divine skill is as apparent in the minute as in the
   magnificent--even so in Holy Writ--the little things which are embalmed
   in the amber of Inspiration are far from inappropriate or unwise.

   Besides, in Providence are there not trifles? It is not every day that
   a nation is rent by revolution, or a throne shaken by rebellion--far
   oftener a bird's nest is destroyed by a child, or an anthill overturned
   by a spade. It is not at every hour that a torrent inundates a
   province, but how frequently do the dewdrops moisten the green leaves?
   We do not often read of hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, but the
   annals of Providence could reveal the history of many a grain of dust
   borne along in the summer's gale, many a sear leaf rent from the poplar
   and many a rush waving by the river's brim.

   Learn to see in the little things of the Bible the God of Providence
   and Nature. Observe two pictures and you will, if thoroughly skilled in
   art, detect certain minute details which indicate the same authorship
   if they are by the same hand. The very little things often, to men of
   artistic eye, identify the painter more certainly than the more
   prominent strokes, which might far more easily be counterfeited.
   Experts detect a handwriting by a slight quivering in the upstrokes,
   the turn of the final mark, a dot, a cross, or even less matters.

   Can we not see the legible handwriting of the God of Nature and
   Providence in the very fact that the sublimities of Revelation are
   interspersed with homely, everyday remarks? But they are not trifles. I
   venture to say that my text has much in it of spiritual instruction. I
   trust that this cloak may warm your hearts this morning, that these
   books may give you instruction, and that the Apostle himself may be to
   you an example of heroism, fitted to stir your minds to imitation.

   I. First, let us LOOK AT THIS MEMORABLE CLOAK which Paul left with
   Carpus at Troas. Troas was a principal seaport town of Asia Minor. Very
   likely the Apostle Paul was seized at Troas on the second occasion of
   his being taken before the Roman emperor. The soldiers usually
   appropriated to themselves any extra garments in the possession of an
   arrested person, such things being considered as the perquisites of
   those who made the arrest. The Apostle may have been forewarned of his
   seizure, and therefore prudently committed his few books and his outer
   garment, which made up all his household stuff, to the care of a
   certain honest man named Carpus.

   Although Troas was a full six hundred miles' journey from Rome, yet the
   Apostle Paul is too poor to purchase a garment, and so directs Timothy,
   as he is coming that way, to bring his cloak. He needs it much, for the
   sharp winter is coming on and the dungeon is very, very chilly. This is
   a brief detail of the circumstances. What kind of cloak it was, certain
   learned commentators have spent whole pages in trying to discover. But
   as we know nothing at all about it, ourselves, we will leave the
   question to them--believing that they know as much as we do, but no
   more.

   1. But what does the cloak teach us? There are five or six lessons in
   it. The first is this--let us perceive here, with admiration, the
   complete self-sacrifice of the Apostle Paul for the Lord's sake.
   Remember, my dear Friends, what the Apostle once was. He was great,
   famous, and wealthy. He had been brought up at the feet of Gamaliel. He
   was so zealous among his brethren that he could not but have commanded
   their sincere respect. He was attended by a guard of soldiers when he
   went from Jerusalem to Damascus. I do not know whether the horse on
   which he rode was his own, but he must have been a man of importance to
   have been allotted so important a post in religious matters.

   He was a man of good standing in society and doubtless everybody
   looking at young Saul of Tarsus would have said, "He will make a great
   man. He has every chance in life. He has a liberal education, a zealous
   temperament, abundant gifts and the general esteem of the Jewish
   rulers. He will rise to eminence." But when the Lord met him that day
   on the road to Damascus, how everything changed with him! Then he could
   truly say, "But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for
   Christ. Yes, doubtless and I count all things but loss for the
   excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have
   suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung, that I may
   win Christ and be found in Him."

   He begins to preach--away goes his character. Now nothing is too bad
   for Paul among his Jewish associates. "Away with such a fellow from the
   earth. It is not fit that he should live," was the exact expression of
   Jewish feeling towards him. He continues his labors and away has gone
   his wealth--he has either scattered it among the poor, or it has been
   sequestered by his former friends. He journeys from place to place at
   no small sacrifice of comfort. The wife to whom he was probably once
   united--for no unmarried man could vote in the Sanhedrim as Paul did
   against Stephen--had fallen sick and died and the Apostle now preferred
   a life of singleness, that he might give himself entirely to his work.

   If only in this world he had hope, he would have been of all men the
   most miserable. He has at last grown gray, and now the very men who
   owed their conversion to him have forsaken him. When he first came into
   Rome they stood with him, but now they have all gone like winter's
   leaves, and the poor old man, "such an one as Paul the aged," sits with
   nothing in all the world to call property but an old cloak and a few
   books--and those are six hundred miles away. Ah, how he emptied
   himself, and to what extremity of destitution was he willing to bring
   himself for Christ's name sake!

   Do not complain that he mentions his clothes--a greater than he did so
   and did so in an hour more solemn than that in which Paul wrote the
   Epistle. Remember who it was that said, "They parted My garments among
   them and upon My vesture did they cast lots." The Savior must die in
   absolute nakedness and the Apostle is made something like He as he sits
   shivering in the cold.

   Brethren, was Paul right in all this? Were his sacrifices reasonable?
   Was the object which he contemplated worthy of all this suffering and
   self-denial? Was he carried away by an excessive heat of fanaticism to
   spend upon an inferior object what was not required of him? No Believer
   here thinks so. You all believe that if you could give up substance and
   talent and esteem, yes, and your own life, also, for Christ, it would
   be well spent. I say you think so, but how many of us have ever carried
   it out? Had I not better say, how few of us? There are some who seldom
   have an opportunity for sacrificing for Christ at all. What they give
   is spared from their superfluity--they never feel it.

   It is a high luxury when a man has such a love for Jesus that he is
   able to give until he pinches himself. If Paul were reasonable, what
   are you and I? If Paul only gives as a Christian should do, how ashamed
   should we be of ourselves? If he will bring himself to poverty for
   Christ, what shall we say of those base-born professors who will not
   lose a trifle in their trade for honesty's sake? What shall we say of
   those who say "I know how to get money and I know how to keep it, too,"
   and look with scorn upon those who are more generous than they? If you
   are content to condemn Paul and charge him with folly, do so. But if
   not, if this is but a reasonable service and such as the infinite Grace
   of God which Paul experienced required of him, then let us do something
   of the like sort. If you have experienced as much love, love the Lord
   as much and spend and be spent for the Lord Jesus!

   2. Secondly, dear Friends, we learn how utterly forsaken the Apostle
   was by his friends. If he had not a cloak of his own, could not some of
   them lend him one? Ten years before, the Apostle was brought in chains
   along the Appian way to Rome. And fifty miles before he reached Rome, a
   little band of members of the Church came to meet him. And when he came
   within twenty miles of the city, at the "Three Taverns," there came a
   still larger group of the disciples to escort him, so that the chained
   prisoner, Paul, went into Rome attended by all the Believers in that
   city.

   He was then a younger man. But now for some reason or other, ten years
   afterward, nobody comes to visit him. He is confined in prison and they
   do not even know where he is, so that Onesiphorus, when he comes to
   Rome, has to seek him out very diligently. He is as obscure as if he
   had never had a name and though he is still as great and glorious an
   Apostle as ever, men have so forgotten him, and the Church has so
   despised him that he is friendless! The Philippian Church, ten years
   before, had made a collection for him when he was in prison. And though
   he had learned in whatsoever state he was, to be content, yet he
   thanked them for their contribution as an offering of a sweet smelling
   savor unto God.

   Now he is old and no Church remembers him. He is brought to trial and
   there are Eubulus and Pudens and Linus-- will not some of them stand by
   his side when he is brought before the emperor? "At my first answer no
   man stood with me." Poor soul, he served his God and worked himself
   down to poverty for the Church's sake, yet the Church has forsaken him!
   Oh, how great must have been the anguish of the loving heart of Paul at
   such ingratitude! Why did not the few who were in Rome, if they had
   been ever so poor, make a contribution for him? Could not those who
   were of Caesar's household have found a cloak for the Apostle? No. He
   is so utterly left, that although he is ready to die of fever in the
   dungeon, not a soul will lend or give him a cloak.

   What patience does this teach to those similarly situated! Has it
   fallen to your lot, my Brother, to be forsaken of friends? Were there
   other times when your name was the symbol of popularity, when many
   lived in your favor like insects in your sunbeam? And has it come to
   this, now, that you are forgotten as a dead man out of mind? In your
   greatest trials do you find your fewest friends? Have those who once
   loved and respected you fallen asleep in Jesus? And have others turned
   out to be hypocritical and untrue? What are you to do now?

   You are to remember this case of the Apostle. It is put here for your
   comfort. He had to pass through as deep waters as any that you are
   called to ford, and yet remember, he says, "Notwithstanding, the Lord
   stood with me and strengthened me." So now, when man deserts you, God
   will be your Friend. This God is our God forever and ever--not in
   sunshiny weather only, but forever and ever! This God is our God in
   dark nights as well as in bright days.

   Go to Him, spread your complaint before Him. Murmur not. If Paul had to
   suffer desertion, you must not expect better usage. Let not your faith
   fail you as though some new thing had happened to you. This is common
   to the saints. David had his Ahithophel, Christ his Judas, Paul his
   Demas--and can you expect to fare better than they? As you look at that
   old cloak, as it speaks of human ingratitude, be of good courage and
   wait on the Lord, for He shall strengthen your heart. "Wait, I say, on
   the Lord."

   3. There is a third lesson. Our text shows the Apostle's independence
   of mind. Why did not the Apostle borrow a cloak? Why did he not beg
   one? No, no, no! That is not to the Apostle's taste at all. He has a
   cloak and though it is six hundred miles away, he will wait until it
   comes. Though there may be some that may lend, he knows that they who
   go a borrowing go a sorrowing, and that they who beg are seldom
   welcome. I do not think a Christian man should blush to borrow or to
   beg if he is absolutely brought to it, but I never like that class of
   people who do either systematically.

   I wish many of the poor would not damage the charity of others by being
   so ready to beg on every presence of necessity. A Christian man would
   do well to remember that it is never to his honor, though it is not
   always to his dishonor, to beg. "I cannot dig, to beg I am ashamed,"
   said the unfaithful steward. And if he had been a faithful one he would
   have been more ashamed, still. I say again, when it comes to the pinch
   and a man must ask of his fellows, let him do it boldly. But let him
   never be too ready to do it, but, like the Apostle, as long as he can
   do without it, let him say, "I have labored with my own hand and eaten
   no man's bread for nothing."

   He taught that the minister of God had a right to be supported by the
   people. "If you partake of their spirituals," says he, "it is right
   that you give of your temporals." He insists upon it that they are not
   to muzzle the mouth of the ox that treads out the corn. Yet though he
   holds this as a great general principle, he never takes anything
   himself. He follows his trade of tent making. He stitches away at the
   canvas and earns his own living so that he is chargeable unto no man.
   Noble example! How anxious all Christians ought to be to see that they
   do not come to want in their old age!

   Yet Paul does come to poverty--his independent spirit is not broken at
   the last, for he will wait till his own cloak is brought six hundred
   miles rather than ask any man to give or lend. Let the Christian man be
   quite as independent, for though independence is not a Christian grace,
   yet it is a common grace which, when wreathed with Christianity, is
   very beautiful and befits the character of a son of God.

   4. The fourth remark is--see here, how very little the Apostles thought
   about how they were dressed. Paul wants enough to keep him warm. He
   asks no more. There is no doubt whatever that the other parts of his
   garments were getting very dilapidated--that he was, indeed, in a state
   of rags. And so he needed the cloak to wrap about him. We read in olden
   times of many of the most eminent servants of God being dressed in the
   poorest manner. When good Bishop Hooper was led out to be burnt, he had
   been long in prison and his clothes were so gone from him that he
   borrowed an old scholar's gown, full of rags and holes, that he might
   put it on and went limping with pains of sciatica and rheumatism to the
   stake.

   We read of Jerome of Prague, that he lay in a damp, cold dungeon and
   was refused anything to cover him in his nakedness and cold. Some
   ministers are very careful lest they should not always be dressed in a
   canonical or gentlemanly manner. I like that remark of Whitfield's,
   when someone of a bad character wondered how he could preach without a
   cassock. "Ah," he said, "I can preach without a cassock, but I cannot
   preach without a character." What matters the outward garment, so long
   as the character is right?

   This is a lesson to our private members, too. We sometimes hear them
   say, "I could not come out on the Sunday--I had not fit clothes to come
   in." Any clothes are fit to come to the House of God with, if they are
   paid for, no matter how coarse they may be. If they are the best God
   has given you, do not murmur. Inasmuch as the trial of raiment is a
   very sharp one to some of the poorest of God's people, I think this
   text was put into the Bible for their comfort. Your Master wore no soft
   and dainty raiment. His garment was the simple peasant's
   smock-frock--woven from the top throughout without seam--and yet He
   never blushed to wear it in the presence of kings and priests.

   I shall always believe that the Christian ought to cultivate a noble
   indifference to these outward things. But when it comes to the pinch of
   absolute want of clothing, then he may comfort himself in this thought,
   "Now am I companion with the Master. Now do I walk in the same
   temptation as the Apostles. Now I suffer even as they also suffered."
   Every saint is an image of Christ. But a poor saint is His exact image,
   for Christ was poor. So, if you are brought to such a pinch with regard
   to poverty that you scarcely know how to provide things decent by way
   of raiment, do not be dispirited. But say, "My Master suffered the
   same, and so did the Apostle Paul." And so take heart and be of good
   cheer.

   5. Paul's cloak at Troas shows me how mighty the Apostle was to resist
   temptation. "I do not see that," you say. The Apostle had the gift of
   miracles. Our Savior, though able to work miracles, never worked
   anything like a miracle on His own account. Nor did His Apostles.
   Miraculous gifts were entrusted to them with Gospel ends and
   purposes--for the good of others and for the promotion of the Truth of
   God. But never for themselves. Our Savior was tempted of the devil, you
   will remember, when He was hungry, to turn stones into bread. That was
   a strong temptation--to apply miraculous powers which were intended for
   other ends--to His own comfort.

   But He rebuked Satan and said, "Man shall not live by bread alone."
   Paul also had power to have created a cloak if he had liked. Why could
   he not? His very shadow healed the sick! If he had willed it, he could
   have prevented the cold and damp from having any effect upon himself.
   He who had once raised to life dead Eutychus, when he had fallen from a
   loft, and brought back the vital heat, could certainly have kept the
   heat in his own body if he had chosen. And I am bold to say the devil
   often came to him and said, "If you are an Apostle of God, if you can
   work miracles, command this atmosphere to rise in temperature, or these
   rags to be joined together and form you a comfortable raiment."

   You do not know--you cannot tell, for you were never put to it--what
   were the stern struggles the Apostle must have had in resisting the
   foul temptation to use his miraculous gifts for himself. O Brothers and
   Sisters, I am afraid you and I are much more ready to give way to self
   than was the Apostle. We preach the Gospel and if God helps us, oh,
   directly the devil will have us to take some of the praise. "You
   preached a good sermon this morning," said one to John Bunyan, as he
   came down the stairs. "You are too late," said Honest John, "the devil
   told me that when I was preaching." Yes, God works the miracles, but we
   take the honor to ourselves.

   There is the temptation for any man who has gifts to use them to his
   own purposes. And if he does, he is an unfaithful steward to his
   Master. I do beseech you, whether in the Sunday school or the Church,
   never let the miracle-working power which God has given you be used for
   yourselves. You can do for Christ's sake mighty things through faith
   and prayer, but never let prayer and faith be prostituted to so base a
   purpose as to minister unto the flesh. I know carnal minds will not
   comprehend this, but spiritual minds, who know the temptations of the
   devil, will know how stern must be a life-long battle to keep ourselves
   back from doing that which might apparently make us happy, but which
   would at the same time make us unholy.

   6. The sixth lesson from this cloak is we are taught in this passage
   how precisely similar one child of God is to another. I know we look
   upon Abraham and Isaac and Jacob as being very great and blessed
   beings--we think that they lived in a higher region than we do. We
   cannot think that if they had lived in these times, they would have
   been Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. We suppose that these are very bad days
   and that any great height of Divine Grace, or self-denial is not very
   easily attainable.

   Brethren, my own conviction is that if Abraham, Isaac and Jacob had
   lived now--instead of being less, they would have been greater
   saints--for they only lived in the dawn, and we live in the noon. We
   hear the Apostles often called "Saint" Peter and "Saint" Paul. And thus
   they are set up on high as on an elevated niche. If we had seen Peter
   and Paul we should have thought them a very ordinary sort of
   people--wonderfully like ourselves. And if we had gone into their daily
   life and trials, we should have said, "Well, you are wonderfully
   superior to what I am in Grace, but somehow or other, you are men of
   like passions with me. I have a quick temper, so have you, Peter.

   "I have a thorn in the flesh, so have you, Paul. I have a sick house,
   Peter's wife's mother lies sick of a fever. I complain of the
   rheumatism, and the Apostle Paul, when aged, feels the cold and wants
   his cloak." Ah, we must not consider the Bible as a Book intended for
   transcendental super-elevated souls--it is an everyday Book and these
   good people were everyday people. They had more Divine Grace, but we
   can get more Grace as well as they could--the Fountain at which they
   drew is quite as full and as free to us as to them. We have only to
   believe after their fashion and trust to Jesus after their way--and
   although our trials are not the same as theirs, we shall overcome
   through the blood of the Lamb.

   I like to see religion brought out in everyday life. Do not tell me
   about the godliness of the Tabernacle. Tell me about the godliness of
   your shop, your counter, and your kitchen. Let me see how Divine Grace
   enables you to be patient in the cold, or joyful in hunger, or
   industrious in labor. Though Grace is no common thing, yet it shines
   best in common things. To preach a sermon, or to sing a hymn is but a
   paltry thing compared with the power to suffer cold and hunger and
   nakedness for Christ's sake.

   Courage then, courage then, fellow Pilgrim! The road was not smoothed
   for Paul any more than it is for us. There was no royal road to Heaven
   in those days any more than there is now. They had to go through
   sloughs and bogs and mire--just as we do--

   "They wrestled hard as we do now With sins and doubts and fears," but
   they have gained the victory at last, and even so shall we! So much
   then, for the cloak which was left at Troas with Carpus.

   II. We will LOOK AT HIS BOOKS. We do not know what the books were, and
   we can only form some guess as to what the parchments were. Paul had a
   few books which were left, perhaps wrapped up in the cloak, and Timothy
   was to be careful to bring them. Even an Apostle must read. Some of our
   very ultra-Calvinistic Brothers and Sisters think that a minister who
   reads books and studies his sermon must be a very deplorable specimen
   of a preacher. A man who comes up into the pulpit, professes to take
   his text on the spot and talks any quantity of nonsense is the idol of
   many.

   If he will speak without premeditation, or pretend to do so, and never
   produce what they call a dish of dead men's brains--oh, that is the
   preacher! How rebuked are they by the Apostle! He is Inspired and yet
   he wants books! He has been preaching at least for thirty years, and
   yet he wants books! He had seen the Lord, and yet he wants books! He
   had had a wider experience than most men, and yet he wants books! He
   had been caught up into the third Heaven and had heard things which it
   was unlawful for a men to utter, yet he wants books! He had written the
   major part of the New Testament, and yet he wants books!

   The Apostle says to Timothy, and so he says to every preacher, "Give
   yourself unto reading." The man who never reads will never be read. He
   who never quotes will never be quoted. He who will not use the thoughts
   of other men's brains proves that he has no brains of his own. Brothers
   and Sisters, what is true of ministers is true of all our people. You
   need to read. Renounce as much as you will all light literature, but
   study as much as possible sound theological works, especially the
   Puritan writers and expositions of the Bible. We are quite persuaded
   that the very best way for you to be spending your leisure is to be
   either reading or praying. You may get much instruction from books
   which afterward you may use as a true weapon in your Lord and Master's
   service. Paul cries, "Bring the books"--join in the cry.

   Our second remark is that the Apostle is not ashamed to confess that he
   does read. He is writing to his young son, Timothy. Now some old
   preachers never like to say a thing which will let the young ones into
   their secrets. They suppose they must put on a very dignified air and
   make a mystery of their sermonizing. But all this is alien from the
   spirit of truthfulness. Paul wants books and is not ashamed to tell
   Timothy that he does. And Timothy may go and tell Tychicus and Titus if
   he likes--Paul does not care.

   Paul herein is a picture of industry. He is in prison. He cannot
   preach--what will he do? As he cannot preach, he will read. As we read
   of the fishermen of old and their boats, the fishermen were out of
   them. What were they doing? Mending their nets. So if Providence has
   laid you upon a sick bed and you cannot teach your class--if you cannot
   be working for God in public, mend your nets by reading. If one
   occupation is taken from you, take another and let the books of the
   Apostle read you a lesson of industry.

   He says, "Especially the parchments." I think the books were Latin and
   Greek works but the parchments were Oriental. And possibly they were
   the parchments of Holy Scripture. Or, as likely, they were his own
   parchments, on which were written the originals of his letters which
   stand in our Bible as the Epistles to the Ephesians, the Philippians,
   the Colossians, and so on. Now, it must be, "Especially the parchments"
   with all our reading. Let it be especially the Bible. Do you attach no
   weight to this advice? This advice is more needed in England now than
   almost at any other time, for the number of persons who read the Bible,
   I believe, is becoming smaller every day.

   Persons read the views of their denominations as set forth in the
   periodicals. They read the views of their leader as set forth in his
   sermons or his works. But the Book, the good old Book, the Divine
   Fountainhead from which all Revelation wells up--this is too often
   left. You may go to human puddles until you forsake the clear crystal
   stream which flows from the Throne of God. Read the books, by all
   means, but especially the parchments. Search human literature, if you
   will, but especially stand fast by that Book which is Infallible, the
   Revelation of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

   III. We now want to have AN INTERVIEW WITH THE APOSTLE PAUL HIMSELF,
   for we may learn much from him. It is almost too dark to see him--we
   will find him in that frightful den! The horrid dungeon--the filth lies
   upon the floor till it looks like a road which is seldom scraped--the
   draft blows through the only little slit which they call a window. The
   poor old man, without his cloak, wraps his ragged garment about him.
   Sometimes you see him kneeling down to pray and then he dips his pen
   into the ink and writes to his dear son, Timothy. No companion, except
   Luke, who occasionally comes in for a short time. Now, how shall we
   find the old man? What sort of temper will he be in?

   We find him full of confidence in the religion which has cost him so
   much. For in the first chapter, at the twelfth verse, we hear him say,
   "For this reason I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not
   ashamed: for I know Whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is
   able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day." No
   doubt, often the tempter said to him, "Paul, why you have lost
   everything for your religion! It has brought you to beggary. See, you
   have preached it and what is the reward of it? The very men you have
   converted have forsaken you. Give it up, give it up, it cannot be worth
   all this. Why, they will not even bring you a cloak to wrap round you.
   You are left here to shiver and very soon your head will be struck from
   your body. Take off your hand from the standard and retire."

   "No," says the Apostle, "I know Whom I have believed." Why, I have
   heard of professors who say, "Ever since I have been a Christian I have
   lost in my business and therefore I will give it up." But our beloved
   Apostle clings to it with a life grip. And oh, there is no heart in our
   piety if our afflictions make us doubt the Truth of our religion. For
   these trials, inasmuch as they work patience, and patience experience,
   and experience hope, render us such that we are not ashamed, but we do
   the more firmly hold on to Christ. Just think, you hear the Apostle
   say, "I know Whom I believe." It is very easy for us to say it. We are
   very comfortable, sitting in our pews. We shall go home to our
   plentiful meal. We shall be clothed comfortably.

   We have friends about us who will smile at us and it is not hard to
   say, "I know Whom I have believed." But if you were vexed on the one
   hand by Hermogenes and Philetus, and on the other hand by Alexander the
   coppersmith, and De-mas, you would not find it quite so easy to say,
   "The Lord is faithful." Behold this noble champion who is just as much
   unmoved at the worst as he was at the best times. "I know how to be
   full," said he once. And now he can say, "I know how to suffer
   hunger--I know how to abound and how to suffer loss."

   But he is not only confident. You will notice that this grand old man
   is having communion with Jesus Christ in his sufferings. Turn to the
   second chapter, at the tenth verse. Did ever sweeter language than this
   come from anyone? "Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes,
   that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with
   eternal glory. It is a faithful saving: For if we are dead with Him, we
   shall also live with Him: If we suffer, we shall also reign with Him.
   If we deny Him, He also will deny us: if we believe not, yet He abides
   faithful: He cannot deny Himself." Ah, there are two in the
   dungeon--not only the man who is suffering trouble as an evildoer, even
   unto bonds--but there sits with him One like unto the Son of Man,
   sharing all his griefs and bearing all his despondencies and so lifting
   up his head. Well may the Apostle rejoice that he has fellowship with
   Christ in his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death.

   Nor is this all. Not only is he confident for the past and in sweet
   communion for the present, but he is resigned for the future. Look at
   the fourth chapter and the sixth verse. "I am now ready to be offered,
   and the time of my departure is at hand." It is a beautiful emblem
   taken from the sacrificial bullock. There it is, tied to the horns of
   the altar, and ready to be offered. So the Apostle stands as a
   sacrifice ready to be offered upon the altar. I am afraid that we
   cannot all say we are ready to be offered. Paul was ready to be a burnt
   offering. If God willed it, he would be burnt to ashes at the stake. Or
   he would be a drink offering, as he did become, when a stream of blood
   flowed under the sharp sword.

   He was ready to be a peace offering, if God willed it, to die in his
   bed. In any case, he was a freewill offering unto God, for he offered
   himself voluntarily. As he says, "I am now ready to be offered and the
   time of my departure is at hand." Glorious old man! Many a professed
   Christian has been clothed in scarlet, and fared sumptuously every day
   and yet never could say he was ready to be offered. Rather he looked
   upon the time of his departure with grief and sorrow. As you think,
   then, of poor, shivering, ragged Paul, think of the jewel which he
   carried in his breast. And O you sons of poverty, remember that the
   magnificence of a holy life and the grandeur and nobility of a
   consecrated heart can deliver you altogether from any shame which may
   cling to your rags and poverty! For as the sun at setting paints the
   clouds with all the colors of Heaven, so your very rags, poverty, and
   shame may make your life the more illustrious as the splendor of your
   piety lights them with heavenly radiance!

   We have not quite concluded with the Apostle. We find him not only
   resigned, but triumphant. "I have fought a good fight, I have finished
   my course, I have kept the faith." See the Grecian warrior just
   returned from battle? He has many wounds and there is a gash across his
   brow. His breast is streaming here and there with cuts and flesh
   wounds. One arm is dislocated. He halts, like Jacob, on his thigh. He
   is covered with the smoke and dust of battle. He is besmeared with much
   blood. He is faint, and weary, and ready to die, but what does he say?
   As he lifts up his right arm, with his buckler tightly clasped upon it,
   he cries, "I have fought a good fight, I have kept my shield." That was
   the object of ambition with every Grecian warrior. If he kept his
   shield he came home glorious.

   Now, faith is the Christian's shield. And here I see the Apostle,
   though he wears all the marks of the conflict, yet he triumphs in these
   marks of the Lord Jesus, saying, "I have fought a good fight. My very
   scars and wounds prove it. I have kept the faith." He looks to that
   golden buckler of the faith fastened to his arm and rejoices in it. The
   tyrant Nero, nor all the warriors of Rome never had such triumph as the
   Apostle Paul! None of them had such true glory as this solitary man who
   has trod the winepress alone. And of the people--there were none with
   him--who has stood against the lion, a solitary champion, with no eye
   to pity and no arm to save, still triumphant to the end? Brave spirit!
   Never mind the old cloak at Troas, so long as your faith is safe.

   Once more. He not only triumphs in the present, but he is in
   expectation of a crown. When the Grecian wrestler had fought a good
   fight, a crown was presented to him. And so Paul, who writes about the
   old cloak, also writes-- "Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
   righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at
   that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His
   appearing."

   When I was picturing Paul, and talking of the poverty of many
   Believers--"Ah," said the Sinner, "Who would be a Christian? Who would
   suffer so much for Christ? Who would lose everything as Paul did?"
   Worldly minds here are thinking--"What a fool, to be led away by such
   an excitement!" Ah, but see how the tables have turned! "Henceforth
   there is laid up for me a crown!" What if he had been robed in scarlet,
   had rolled in wealth, and been great? And what if there had been no
   crown for him in Heaven? No joy hereafter--but a fearful looking for of
   judgment? See, he springs from his dungeon to his throne! Nero may cut
   off his head, but that head shall wear a starry crown. Courage, then,
   you that are downtrodden, afflicted, and despairing! Be of good cheer,
   for the end will make up for the way. And all the roughness of the
   pilgrimage will be well recompensed by the Glory which shall await all
   those who are resting upon Christ Jesus.

   We close, having done with this old cloak, when we say, is it not
   beautiful as you read this Epistle, and, indeed, all the Apostle's
   letters, to see how everything which the Apostle thought of was
   connected with Christ? How he had concentrated every passion, every
   power, every thought, every act, every word--and set the whole upon
   Christ. I believe that there are many who love Christ after a sort,
   just as the sun shines today. But you know if you concentrate the rays
   of that sun with a magnifying glass and fix all the rays upon any
   object, then what heat there is, what burning, what flame, what fire!

   So many men scatter their love and admiration on almost any and every
   creature, and Christ gets a little, as we all get some rays of the sun.
   But that is the man, who, like the Apostle Paul, brings all his
   thoughts and words to a focus. Then he burns his way through life. His
   heart is on fire. Like coals of juniper are his words. He is a man of
   force and energy. He may have no cloak, yet for all that, he is a great
   man and the Czar in his imperial mantle is but a driveling dwarf by the
   side of this giant in the army of God. O, I wish we could set our
   thoughts on Christ this morning. Are we trusting in Him this morning?
   Is He all our salvation and all our desire? If He is, then let us live
   to Him.

   Those who are wholly Christ's are not many. O that we were espoused as
   chaste virgins unto Christ--that we might have no other lover and know
   no other object of delight! Blind are these eyes to all but Christ. And
   deaf these ears to any music but the voice of Christ. And lame these
   feet to any way but that of obedience to Him! Palsied these hands to
   anything but work for Him. And dead this heart to every joy if Jesus
   cannot move! Even as a straw floats upon the river and is carried to
   the ocean, so would I be bereft of all power, and will to do anything
   but that which my Lord would have me do--and be carried along by the
   stream of His Grace right onward, ready to be offered up, or ready to
   live, ready to suffer, or ready to reign just as He wills--only that He
   may be served in my living and dying!

   It will little matter what cloak you wear, or if you have not any at
   all, if you have but such a concentration of all your bodily and mental
   powers and spiritual energies upon Christ Jesus and upon Him alone. May
   those of you who have never trusted Jesus be ready to rely upon Him
   now. He did not forsake Paul, even in extremity, and He will not
   forsake you--

   "Trust Him, He will never deceive you, Though you hardly of Him deem.
   He will never, never leave you, Nor will let you quite leave Him."
   Therefore trust Him now and forever, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                        Once A Curse But Now A Blessing

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 6, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And it shall come to pass, that as you were a curse among the heathen,
   O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will Isave you and you shall
   be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong." Zechariah 8:13.

   AS these words came from the lips of Zechariah, doubtless they referred
   to the seed of Abraham, including the two tribes of Judah and the ten
   tribes of Israel. They have already received a minor fulfillment. But
   their most glorious accomplishment is yet to come. The Jews have for
   many a generation been cursed by all people. For ages no one had a good
   word or a kind look for the Jew. In every nation they have been
   persecuted and hunted like beasts of prey. The followers of the fierce
   Mohammed have not been their only enemies, for the children of the
   Babylonian harlot have equally thirsted for their blood in our own
   country.

   In the dark ages, it was accounted God's service to afflict the
   Israelites, and the day upon which the Church celebrated our Savior's
   passion was chosen for the public stoning of His own Brothers and
   Sisters if they ventured into the streets. To be a Jew was, in the
   estimation of that era, to be deserving of all scorn and cruelty, and
   of no pity or consideration. To what exactions, to what fines, to what
   imprisonments and tortures have not the sons of Jacob been subjected by
   the professed followers of the Messiah? It is perhaps the greatest of
   all modern miracles that there should be one Jew upon earth who is a
   Christian--for the treatment they have received from pretended
   Christians has been enough to make them hate the name of Jesus.

   It has been not simply villainous, but diabolical. Devils in Hell could
   not be more cruel to their victims than professed Christians have been
   to the sons of Abraham. They have been a curse, indeed. The whole
   vocabulary of abuse from "dog," down to "devil," has been exhausted
   upon them. Among all nations they have been a hissing and a byword. But
   the day is coming, yes, it dawns already, when the whole world shall
   discern the true dignity of the chosen seed. And they shall seek their
   company because the Lord has blessed them. In that day when Israel
   shall look upon Him whom they have pierced and shall mourn for their
   sins, the Jew shall take his true rank among the nations as an elder
   brother and a prince.

   The covenant made with Abraham, to bless all nations by his seed, is
   not revoked. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but the chosen nation
   shall not be blotted out from the book of remembrance. The Lord has not
   cast away His people. He has never given their mother a bill of
   divorce. He has never put them away. In a little wrath He has hidden
   His face from them, but with great mercies will He gather them. The
   natural branches shall again be engrafted into the olive together with
   the wild olive grafts from among the Gentiles. In the Jew, first and
   chiefly, shall Divine Grace triumph through the King of the Jews. O
   Time, fly with rapid wing and bring the auspicious day!

   Another meaning has been given to the passage by some very eminent
   expositors, namely, that the Jews have been for ages the model of a
   curse to all people. As old Master Trapp says, they bear upon their
   backs the wheels of God's rod, or, as he puts it yet more strongly,
   like Cain, they carry upon their foreheads the mark of God's wrath.
   They have been a people scattered and peeled, not numbered among the
   nations, men of weary foot and haggard countenances. Their nation has
   been the football of Providence, and the butt of misfortune. They have
   been shipwrecked upon every sea, overturned by every storm--the victims
   of every calamity and the objects of every misery.

   Everywhere have they been men evidently accursed of God and given up to
   His wrath. When men wanted a name to curse by, they said, "Let me be as
   accursed as the Jew." But the day is to come when they are to be quite
   as manifestly the blessed ones of God. Their conversion shall show how
   God favors them. Their gathering to their own land, the splendor of the
   reign of Messiah in their midst. All those latter-day glories which are
   dimly shadowed in the Book of the Revela- tion, and in the Book of the
   Vision of Daniel the Prophet--when all these shall come to pass--then
   the sons of men shall speak of the Jewish people as a royal priesthood
   and a peculiar people.

   The seed of Abraham, God's Friend, are very dear to Him--the darlings
   of His bosom, the flock of His pasture and the sheep of His hand. Oh,
   that the dark night would soon be over! Long has the Christian Church
   slept in forgetfulness of the Jew. Even faithful men have scarcely
   given a thought to Israel, and have left the Jew to perish as though
   his heart were too hard to be melted by Divine love. I trust that
   mistake has been discovered and that there are many now anxiously
   praying for the restoration of the glory unto Israel.

   But too many are still indifferent where earnestness is needed. May the
   Lord in His infinite mercy first put it into His people's hearts to
   pray for Israel, and then to work in love and labor in faith. May He
   hasten in His own time the fulfillment of His promises to Abraham,
   Isaac and Jacob. And then shall the whole earth be covered with the
   knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.

   We may work and we may toil, but till Israel is gathered, God's Glory
   cannot be universal, nor even widely spread. Until the Jew acknowledges
   Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah, the fullness of the times of
   restitution shall not have arrived. Make no tarrying, O our Lord! Come
   quickly and send as the herald of Your coming--Your own Brothers and
   Sisters who once despised You when You came to Your own and Your own
   received You not.

   You can clearly understand the text now in its literal signification
   without another word of exposition--"As you have been a curse among all
   nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you and
   you shall be a blessing."

   We feel ourselves perfectly justified in using the text in a broader
   sense. Our text teaches us that the unconverted are a curse. Secondly,
   that when converted they become a blessing. Thirdly, the text tells the
   means by which the transformation is worked--"I will save you." And it
   closes with a word of encouragement to those who desire
   salvation--"Fear not, but let your hands be strong."

   I. UNCONVERTED MEN ARE A CURSE. This they are positively forever.
   Unconverted man, no matter what may be his moral character, adds in his
   degree to the amount of evil in the world--he adds another handful of
   leaven to leaven the whole lump, another breath of death-bearing wind
   to scatter the plague of sin among the sons of men. Every unre-newed
   heart casts another stone upon the heap of iniquity and assists the
   rising Babel of rebellion to lift its head more proudly. As I see the
   ungodly advancing one by one, I hear the Prince of Darkness cry, "Here
   comes another soldier to swell the ranks of evil, another lance for
   Satan and another sword for the powers of evil."

   To the black banner, every man that is unconverted is a recruit. Let
   him do as he may and think as he will, he that is not with Christ is
   against Him. He that is not for the right is on the side of the wrong.
   How is the body corporate of humanity poisoned more and more as each
   man adds his grain of evil! How is the torrent swollen with another and
   another stream! A deluge of iniquity is but a collection of all the
   contributions from every fountain of the great deep. Every graceless
   spirit binds another millstone about the neck of the human race to sink
   it to the lowest Hell.

   Every sinner is a positive mischief-maker in the world. He is a deadly
   upas tree--every feat distilling poison. It is impossible that it
   should be otherwise, for as a black and filthy fountain must send forth
   unclean streams, so by a law of nature, as long as man is himself evil,
   he must do evil. One sinner destroys much good, and whatever sort of
   sinner he may be, whether his sin is written on his forehead, or only
   carried concealed in his right hand, he infects the world with evil.
   The sinner is a curse, then, because he adds to the positive evil in
   the world.

   He is yet more--he is a curse because he helps to bring down the wrath
   of Heaven upon the world. Another destroying angel to cry, "O Lord, how
   long before You smite iniquity and bathe Your sword in the blood of
   rebels?" Another voice to cry, "Awake! Awake! O sword of Justice! Smite
   the sinner and let him perish from the face of the earth." Doubtless
   every sin is a God-provoking thing. It stirs Him to jealousy. As the
   blood of Abel cried, "Vengeance," so does sin. It is a thorn in the
   side of justice, a stab at the heart of truth. God's great patience is
   expended at a tremendous rate by the sins of men. You unconverted Men!
   You make every day a draught upon the exchequer of long-suffering, and
   the day shall come when the golden sun shall all be expended and then
   woe unto the world, for then shall the last plagues be let loose and
   the last vials shall be poured out.

   Even when the ungodly man dies he has not finished his evil work. His
   life may be over, but the moral death caused by his life still
   continues. As the tree that has borne evil fruit sends to the winds its
   seeds and these are buried in their appointed places. Where young
   saplings spring up to become a forest of evil, so is it with the
   ungodly man--his words and his example, like seeds in the ground,
   germinate and bring forth the like in other men. Like produces like.
   His children in nature and spirit arise after him, and these prolong
   the echo of the dreadful curse which his life has pronounced upon the
   race.

   He cannot stay that curse even if he would--it is given to the course
   of time as a feather to the wind and on it must go forever. Those
   saplings which sprang from him as from the parent tree will all grow
   into death-yielding trees, and these will scatter their seeds and so
   on, and on and on, as long as the human race lasts. No, even in
   eternity the victims of his sin lie in torment and blaspheme God world
   without end, so that his curse is an everlasting curse, and the evil
   which he does lives on when he himself sleeps with the clods of the
   valley. The ungodly man is everlastingly a positive curse.

   But he is also a curse negatively. It is deplorable to think how much
   of good a man who knows not God keeps from this world. He cumbers the
   ground in which he grows. He extracts nourishment from the ground and
   covers it so that it cannot yield nourishment to any other plant, and
   yet he, himself, brings forth no fruit. Is this your position, my
   Hearer, this morning? Are you a do-nothing? If you are, remember that
   the spot which you occupy might have been occupied by a man who would
   have glorified God and done much for the spread of true religion. You
   have much time upon your hands, but you kill it. If another had it, it
   would be occupied with visitation of the sick, teaching the ignorant,
   comforting the weary and other acts which would glorify the name of
   Jesus.

   You have the time and it is ill-spent. You have money. You spend
   perhaps upon a feast for your own pleasure as much as might have sent a
   herald of the Cross to a foreign land. Many a man, if he had your
   means, would put clothes upon the backs of the naked and bread into the
   mouths of the hungry. In one respect money answers all things, but you
   make it answer to nothing except your own gratification. Ah, how much
   mischief you do in this way! You have influence. It may be you are a
   master with many servants, or placed in such a position that many wait
   upon you and your example is followed and your words are weighty. If
   another had your place, how would he lead a whole troop to Heaven! With
   what earnestness would he seek to bless those who dwell under his
   shadow.

   But you, what do you do? You cumber the ground. These many years there
   has not been found upon you one single ripe fruit such as may be
   acceptable to the Lord of the Vineyard. Beware, beware lest He cut you
   down! Don't you see what evil you are doing to others? The minister is
   preaching to you this morning, and he has to do it often. If it were
   not for stray sheep such as you are, he would have more time to see
   after the lambs of the flock. If he had not to cry out after you and
   against your sins, he might be led into the deep things of God, to the
   comfort and edification of the Lord's chosen people.

   While you are in this House you are spoiling the song--you are marring
   the prayer by the wandering and wantonness of your thoughts. If you
   should come into the midst of a company of God's people who were
   talking of Divine things, you would be like an iceberg chilling the
   atmosphere about you. How many young Christians you have hindered in
   their zeal by your indifference? If you did nothing else but damage the
   good, stop up the stream of love, and quench the light of the Truth of
   God, you would have done enough to make them a curse among men and to
   provoke God to smite you with the curse that withers body and soul
   forever and ever.

   This is true of every unconverted man. Many of you moral men, whose
   lives are admirable, have not your hearts right with God. What is the
   lesson that men learn from your conversation? Why, when the infidel
   wants to prove that there may be goodness apart from religion, he
   quotes you as an argument against the Word of God and against the
   necessity of a new heart and a right spirit. Have not many in your own
   position been hardened in their halt between two opinions by your
   example? Young people say, "There is Mrs. So-and-So and Mr.
   This-and-That, what good people they are and yet they have never given
   their hearts to God. "Surely," say they, "such people must know, and if
   there were anything in religion, they would certainly have followed in
   the right road and have put their trust in Christ."

   The better you are, the more do I deplore that you should be upon the
   wrong side. If my country were at war, it would be very little comfort
   to me to know that my enemies were good soldiers. No, I had rather that
   they were bad ones. For there were then the more hope of overcoming
   them. The weight of your character makes it the more sad that it should
   be thrown into the scale of self-righteousness. I say the very
   excellence of your morals renders it a more serious crime that you
   should not take your stand with Christ, the lover of holiness. You do
   mischief, I am sure.

   Possibly there is a measure of moral good effected by your example, but
   there is a more abundant spiritual evil, because many stop where you
   stop. Being affected by your example, they halt at your halting place,
   and as you will perish except you are born again, so will they. And the
   blood of their souls will lie at your door because your example was a
   curse to them.

   If this is true of the moral unconverted man, how much more certainly
   is it of the open follower of vice. Shall I continue? No. I will
   scarcely so much as use my pencil to portray the mischief which the
   votary of vice brings upon others. How does the drunkard drown
   multitudes in his cups? How does the man of lust destroy and damn both
   the body and the soul of his victims? How does the man who leads a
   licentious life spread poison by his very eyes--like the basilisk,
   doing mischief by his glance? "His feet," we may truly say, "are swift
   to shed blood." His hands are full of drawn swords and flaming
   firebrands to destroy souls.

   The profane swearer--what a pest he is! Young ears are bombarded with
   sin by him, and young hearts learn the crimes of old rebels. Ah, you
   are a curse, indeed! Better for someone to walk the streets with a
   deadly plague about him and to spread it in every house, than to have
   such as you are living in society, for you have the death plague and
   the damnation plague upon you! You are a walking malaria, a breather of
   pestilence--a myrmidon of Hell--a jackal to the infernal lion, the
   lackey and the slave of the Destroyer.

   Perhaps there are a few such here. Therefore let us be brief upon that
   point. It is the same with the sinner who makes ungodly men his
   associates--he is a curse. You do not drink as they do, you say, nor go
   to their excess of riot, nor curse with their curses. But yet you herd
   with them. You make them your associates, and, if you want a little
   pleasure, you seek their acquaintance. Sir, you are a curse. You are a
   curse to these men. I will not say you make them sinful, but I must say
   you add to their comfort in their sin. They see such as you are with
   them and as association always hardens the sinner, they grow more
   confirmed in evil. Many a drinking club would break up if it were not
   for the two or three sensible men in it, and yet what is the effect of
   their morality?

   Not so much to check the others as to keep the whole together and put a
   respectable face upon mischief. You who lie in the same bed with the
   wicked must take care when God smites the house that you do not perish
   in its overthrow. You that eat at their feasts, and drink of their
   cups, and laugh at their jokes, and revel in their vices, and take
   pleasure in their wantonness, mind when the Lord spreads His net to
   take these foul birds. He will take you in the same net and award you a
   portion with those that were His enemies.

   Nor can we spare here the men of thoroughly bad principles. The men who
   pretend to doubt the existence of a God, who question the Inspiration
   of the Scripture, deny the Deity of Christ, or impugn the veracity of
   Gospel promises--all such men are great destroyers of good. They will
   always be on the face of the earth and we must never expect to see them
   rooted up until the Lord's coming. It is wonderful that in England they
   should be so miserably small a party. If again infidelity should be as
   prevalent as Christianity, I should not much marvel, for it so suits
   the natural heart of man. The wonder is that there is not more of it
   abroad.

   But one infidel--O what a curse he is! In a workshop that one man of
   sharp shrewd sense will very soon make disciples! Like the Pharisees of
   old they compass sea and land to make one proselyte. Too often the
   Believer does not give that attention to the reading of Scripture, and
   to the finding up of arguments for his faith which the ungodly man will
   give in order to find arguments to shake the faith of others. I would
   that our members were more industrious, both in searching the
   Scriptures and in studying the evidences of their Inspiration and
   authenticity, that they might have their weapons ready to meet the
   attacks of infidels.

   For these infidels--men of much thinking and shrewdness and sagacity
   and wit--placed in the midst of poor uneducated Christians are terrible
   as wolves in the midst of a flock of sheep, and much havoc may they do.
   Though they cannot turn one truly blood-bought child of God out of the
   flock, nor yet make one that is born again apostatize from the Truth of
   God, yet they bring much misery into the heart. And doubtless many who
   are undecided are led by them into decisions for Satan and go straight
   away from all hopefulness of being converted to God. Now of such an one
   we may say he is a curse, indeed.

   But now I hear another say, "Well now, I do not come under the
   description of immoral, nor yet of those who spread infidel principles
   and practices." Ah, but still you may be a curse, if you have an evil
   spirit towards religion. There are some who say but little, but who
   hate the very name of Christ. Even if they hold their tongues, that
   shrug of the shoulder, that look, that cold, heartless reception which
   they give to the Truth of God must infallibly be observed by others.
   Children and those round about them cannot help detecting what they
   are, and who they are, and they will thus become very successful
   servants of the Prince of Darkness. O dear Friends, I fear that some of
   you know in your own conscience without any words of mine, that up to
   now your lives have been no blessing to your fellows, but rather,
   wherever you have gone, you have been a curse.

   I shall conclude this point by noticing that the unconverted man is a
   curse everywhere. In the family, what a curse he is! His wife, perhaps,
   is a Christian--what a life he leads her! Does he strike her? Perhaps
   not. But his words wound her even more than blows would have done. What
   about the children? Why, they will go as the father goes--his crooked
   words they learn to speak, and his crooked actions they will learn to
   do. It is not likely, though by Divine Grace it is possible, that they
   should be better than he. If we were to put a black cross upon every
   house where there is a husband who is a curse to the household, how
   many streets in London might have the black cross half the way down?
   Are you an ungodly man--and does your life teem with iniquity? Then
   think that the black cross is there as you go home and say, "Yes. I am
   a curse to this house. I lead them away from God."

   He is a curse in the workshop. As soon as he goes to it, those who
   would be decent are led to the public house by him and to places where
   sin is accustomed to be allowed. Let him become what is more
   respectable, as we say, in life. But he is a curse even there. Make him
   a master and give him many servants--then how haughty and how
   domineering he will be if he meets a servant who is a professor of
   religion! His misspending of his Sundays will be known to all his
   working men and they are always willing enough to follow the example of
   their employers in doing evil.

   Make him wealthy, he can indulge himself in all sorts of pleasures and
   his gold is spent in the service of Satan. Give him abilities--talents
   of thought and speech--he becomes a sort of sergeant-major in the ranks
   of Satan, a commander of others. Satan employs him as a decoy to bring
   others into the net. Now he goes abroad and is the call-bird of others,
   so that others, hearing his sweet notes, are lured into the fowler's
   snare and are taken and destroyed. Put him on a throne and he curses an
   empire. Give him but a small village, over which he shall be the
   squire, and he is a curse to all the parish.

   Let him become a professor and oh, this is the place where he can do
   the most of mischief. Clothe him with the garments of a Christian while
   his heart is rotten--and now, while pretending to be a disciple of
   Jesus--he will become more than ever a successful servant of Satan.
   Make him a minister and you have given him the worst possible position.
   In fact, the better the man's place, the more evil can he do. Oh, to be
   a minister--to be thought to be sent of God to the people and then to
   be delivering falsehood! To be either by one's life or one's teaching
   contradicting the oracles of God! Of such a man we may well say his
   damnation is sure. But this is not the worst of it, for, before he goes
   down to the pit himself, he drags as with a hundred ropes, multitudes
   of others down the dreadful steep.

   II. But secondly, here is a gracious promise made that THEY SHALL BE A
   BLESSING. Dear Friends, the true Christian is a blessing temporally in
   the world. If there were no life to come, yet is a converted man a
   blessing--since he arrests the judgments of God. Sodom shall stand if
   there are ten righteous found in it. The world shall last as long as
   there is salt enough in it to keep it from putrefaction. The world
   shall not be given up to blackness forever, so long as there are a few
   lights still shining in it. As the conducting rod prevents the
   dwellings of men from being destroyed by lightning, so Believers in a
   State, or in a town, are its preservation from the avenging judgments
   of God.

   Who will deny, again, that the Christian, the true Christian promotes
   morality--that his godly life settles the foundation of order? Where
   are the most revolutions? Where is the least of religion? Where has the
   guillotine fallen with its fatal drop? Where have heads rolled by
   hundreds in a basket? Where have streams of blood crimsoned the street?
   Where is there an empire, never safe except as the throne is supported
   by bayonets? Look across the Channel and you will see that the absence
   of religion is the absence of order in the State. It is England's Bible
   which is the keystone of England's institutions.

   The flag of old England is nailed to the mast, not so much by her
   soldiers and sailors, as by the men who love her God and bring down the
   blessing upon her continually by prayer. Do you think that we should
   have had a famine in the north and a stoppage of the mills without riot
   if it had not been for the wide spread of religion among the working
   men? The blessed restraints of holiness and goodness have produced
   order and patience. Dear Friends, the Christian man is the true
   patriot. He is a blessing to his country, be he where he may.

   Does not the Christian aid in every good work? He is no Christian if he
   does not. If there is an hospital, does he not delight as much to
   contribute towards the relief of sickness of the body as for the
   removal of disease of the soul? If education is needed by the lower
   classes, who shall be found to teach in the Sunday school and who will
   support institutions on the weekday more readily than Christian men?
   Anything which is pure and lovely and of good repute in this world,
   owes, if not its origin, yet its main support to the godliness of
   Believers. No one shall be able to estimate how much the presence of a
   good man in the State is a preventative as well as a cure. It prevents
   the breaking out or the more frightful forms of vice, or else drives it
   into seclusion and makes it hide its head for very shame. The
   Christian, I believe, is to a nation one of the greatest temporal
   blessings which God can send to it.

   And as for eternity, truly a Christian is a blessing there. If his
   example shall lead men to seek after God--if his words shall teach the
   sinner his need of a Savior--shall point him to the Cross--shall show
   him the wounds--oh, if his prayers shall be heard and the Spirit of God
   shall descend and his family shall be converted and his kinsfolk shall
   be reclaimed, then eternity shall know the music of the blessing which
   he scattered among the sons of men! You cannot bless men forever, in
   any other way than by yourself being a true follower of Jesus, and then
   seeking to bring them to a knowledge of the Truth of God.

   Now, as I said of the ungodly, that every ungodly man is a curse, so
   will I venture to say that every Christian man is a blessing in the
   degree in which he is true to his Christianity. If he has been moral
   before, now that he becomes a Christian, how that tells upon men like
   he! How those who would have been undecided are moved to go forth! The
   force of his former character and the excellence and amiability of his
   deportment operate upon those who knew him. If he has been a drunkard
   and a swearer before, this will not hinder him from being a blessing
   now. His old companions hear of the great change. They enquire how it
   was worked. They go with him to the House of God and they, too, are
   brought to Christ.

   Some of those who have brought more saints to God than others were once
   themselves the greatest of sinners. Let no one suppose that because his
   character has been up to now very vile, therefore, if converted, he
   would be of no use-- sometimes he will even be of the more use. What
   would all your old mates say, when they saw you were a Christian?
   "There must be something in it," say they, "if drunken William is
   saved." What if the swearer should wash his mouth and should preach
   God's Word! What if yonder voice should be heard at the Prayer Meeting,
   although once so loud in a brothel! Oh, would not men wonder, and would
   not there be many who would suddenly feel attracted to the Cross, as
   you have been, and say, "We will go with you, for we perceive that God
   has blessed you"?

   Such a man, even if he has been an infidel, becomes a blessing
   now--sometimes most a blessing to those to whom he was most a curse.
   Now he refutes himself. Now his own example becomes the best answer to
   his former false teaching. Now his love to Jesus is observed and
   noticed--all those whom he taught to hate the Lord will help to adore
   His sacred Person. And if the man has been through and through of a bad
   spirit, though he has not openly spoken against the things of God, yet
   when converted, how serviceable he becomes! For even if he is almost
   silent and can say but little, yet, as the bad spirit oozed through
   him, so now the Spirit of God will shine through him!

   There shall be a difference about his very face! And the manner of his
   walk and conversation shall be such that it will betray him. Out of the
   midst of him shall flow rivers of living water, whereof multitudes
   shall drink. No matter, O Christians, how poor you may be, or how
   ignorant you are, or how little influence you may have--you are and
   shall be a blessing, if God gives you a new heart and a right spirit.

   The converted man is a blessing everywhere. He is a blessing to his
   family. Daily prayer, Bible reading, teaching of the children--all
   these make his house a little Paradise. When he goes to the workshop,
   if any learn vice, it is not from him. If there are any who despise
   Christ, it is not from his example. He has a good word for Jesus. Now
   he begins to lament and pray over the sins of his fellow men. He speaks
   of the Cross of Christ and perhaps he brings some of them to repentance
   and to a saving faith. You may put him anywhere with safety. Make a
   king of him--he rules his dominions in the fear of God. Give him a
   large estate and you will find his substance expended as it should be.
   Now the hungry shall have their portion and the needy their share. The
   Church at home and missions abroad shall all be prospered by him.

   Let him make a profession--he does not dishonor it. He puts golden
   chains about the neck of piety by the excellence of his deportment. You
   may put him into the pulpit with safety. With a new heart he can be
   trusted, even at the altars of God. His soul, having been renewed,
   there will be nothing in his example, or word, of which a Christian
   could complain. Now you may take him to Heaven itself, for even there
   he shall be a blessing and help to swell the song of, "Hallelujah unto
   Him that washed our robes and made them white in His blood." I would to
   God we had a holy ambition to be more a blessing than we have been, for
   remember--if you have been converted and are not living consistently
   with your religion--then your life is not much of a blessing.

   Oh, it is so sad, so sad, to my own soul when I see those who might be
   a blessing, by some weakness or folly throw away their golden
   opportunities. There are some of you--I cannot tell what good you might
   do in the world, but either through natural infirmity or sin, you are
   of little service. Do not, I pray you, destroy your own power to bless
   your fellow men! Do not so act in the family and in business and in the
   Church as to make yourself a little blessing, when you might have been
   a great one! Ask the Lord to fill you so full with His Grace that you
   may be like a great cloud of mercy, resting continually over the sons
   of men and pouring forth its gracious shower day by day.

   III. The third point is HOW IS ALL THIS TO BE BROUGHT ABOUT? How is the
   man who was a curse to be made a blessing? Can he do it himself? Rests
   there a power in human will that by the magic of its might, men who
   were once a curse may be made a blessing? Ah no! This abides not in the
   creature, but with the Creator. So runs the text--"/ will save you."
   You that have been a curse, "/ will save you." Swearer, drunkard,
   whoremonger, whoever you may be, "I will save you, to show what
   Sovereign Grace can do." "I will save you and make you a blessing."

   But you say, "How, then, may I be saved?" Salvation from sin is one,
   but yet it is a salvation from sin in two senses--from the guilt of it
   and from the power of it. Sinner, cursed of God and cursing others--all
   the sin that you have done can be blotted out. No matter though it is
   red like scarlet, it may be as wool. And though it is as crimson, God
   can make it whiter than snow. In a moment all your sins can pass away
   so that if they were sought for, they could not be found. Yes, though
   an inquisition were made to search them out, yet could they not be
   discovered. And this can be done by the blood, the precious blood of
   Jesus. Jesus the Substitute, the Son of God and yet the Son of Man,
   took the sins of all Believers upon Himself and suffered the punishment
   of all their sins--

   "He for the sins of all the elect Has a complete atonement made. And
   justice never can expect That the same debt should twice be paid." If
   you believe, that is, if you trust in Christ, all the sins you have
   ever done were laid upon Christ. Your believing is the sign and mark of
   this. And from now on you have no sin, your sin is gone. You are an
   accepted and pardoned man. No, more--you are justified. The
   righteousness of Christ is yours. In the sight of God you stand
   accepted in the Beloved. And all this is to be had by the simple act of
   trusting. Whosoever you may be, "He that believes and is baptized,
   shall be saved." But then you say, "But how can I be delivered from the
   power of sin? If all my past sins were forgiven, yet I might go back
   and do as before and so remain as vile as ever."

   Yes, there is power in the Holy Spirit to make a new man of you. He can
   put into your heart the holy influences of Divine Grace so that though
   you naturally go towards evil, you shall, by supernatural influence, go
   towards the right. He shall give you that fiery motion, which, as the
   flame always ascends towards Heaven, shall make your heart ascend
   towards holiness. He shall subdue in you the powers of evil which now
   reign, shall keep your sins under your feet, and eventually cast them
   out forever and make you perfect before the Lord.

   Remember, this is to be done for you, not by you. You cannot make
   yourself a new man. It is impossible for you to work regeneration. One
   look at Jesus will take away past sins and will kill the power of sin
   for the future. Sprinkle His blood upon the old serpent and it dies.
   Put the water which flowed with the blood from Christ and the foulness
   of nature only remains to be subdued and eventually to be cast out when
   the Believer shall be taken up in perfection to dwell before the
   Father's Throne. God can save you, whoever you may be, and whatever
   your past life may have been. No doings of your own, no prayers, no
   penances, no almsgivings, are required. Simply trust Jesus who died for
   you and you are saved, saved on the spot--saved forever.

   IV. And then comes the last point. The text GIVES A WORD OR TWO OF
   ENCOURAGEMENT from this--"Let your hands be strong: fear not." Though
   you have been a curse until now, if you sincerely desire to be made a
   blessing, and if the Holy Spirit has made you willing to accept the
   perfect righteousness of Christ and to be washed in His most precious
   blood, then "fear not." Let not conscience make you fear. God will
   answer to your conscience. The blood of Christ shall purge it from dead
   works. Let not a sense of Divine Justice make you fear, Christ has
   satisfied Divine Justice and Justice is your friend. Let not the
   remembrance of past sins make you fear. They shall be cast into the
   depths of the sea-- not one of them shall rise to accuse you.

   Let not the thoughts of judgment make you fear. You shall have an
   Advocate at the Last Great Day to plead your cause. Fear not, but com,
   and welcome! Christ invites you by His wounds. The Father bids you come
   and trust His Only-

   Begotten Son. He earnestly entreats you to come unto Him and live.
   "Fear not," says He. And if doubts and fears stand at the door to keep
   you from coming, yet rush forward through them all, saying--"God has
   bid me fear not and, therefore, will I not fear, but boldly venture
   upon the finished work of Christ. And if I perish, I perish."

   "Let your hands be strong," especially the hand with which you grasp
   the Savior. Lay hold upon Him, Sinner. O may the Spirit of God help you
   to lay hold upon Him now! "Let your hands be strong." Grasp Him. Lay
   hold on eternal life. As a sinking man lays hold upon the rope that is
   cast to him, so lay hold on Christ. It is now or never with you. If
   Christ saves you not, you are damned forever. Grasp Him, then! He
   passes by. He may never pass this way again. This morning He comes in
   mercy to you to turn you, you Cursed One, into a blessing!

   Grasp Him. Even as Jacob laid hold upon the angel, lay hold on Christ!
   And if He struggles with you and seems as though He would not bless
   you, say unto Him--

   "No, I must maintain my hold, It is Your goodness makes me bold. I can
   no denial take, Pity me for Your love's sake."

   O for strong hands to grasp the Savior! Let your hands be strong to lay
   hold on His promises. They are such as these-- "Though your sins are as
   scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they are red like
   crimson, they shall be as wool." "Whosoever comes to Me, I will in no
   wise cast out." "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be
   saved." "He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto
   God by Him."

   Lay hold on these. Take them before God and say to Him, "Can You lie?
   Can You be untrue? If You are true, keep this promise for me. Have You
   not said, 'As you have been a curse, so I will make you a blessing'? I
   have been a curse--I admit it. I lament it. Make me a blessing, Lord.
   By the sufferings of Jesus--by the agony and bloody sweat--by His Cross
   and passion--by His precious death and burial--make me a blessing,
   Lord! You have but to speak the word and I, even I, shall repent. You
   have but to will it, and I shall behold Your face in Christ and believe
   in Him. Your Spirit is not to be resisted--send Him forth to raise my
   dead soul from the grave. Come and work in me! Turn the lion to a lamb,
   the raven to a dove."

   Sinner, if you can believe that God will do it, He will do it. For
   anything you will believe of Him, however high and great, He can do and
   will do, for He will never let your faith be in excess of His
   power--His unbounded power! Trust in Him! Rest upon Him! God help you
   to do it and may these poor stammering words of mine, by their very
   weakness, be fitted for your conversion, because my Master's Glory
   shall shine the better through my weakness! And His power to save shall
   be the more resplendent because of my feeble words! If it is so, I
   would sooner be dumb than speak with the tongues of men and angels, if
   He were not to be honored.

   Father, glorify Jesus! Glorify Him now in bringing some who have been a
   curse, to the making of them a blessing, for His name's sake. Amen.

                        Lessons From Lydia'S Conversion

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 13, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And on the Sabbath we went out of the citybya riverside, whereprayer
   was customarily made; and we sat down and spoke to the women who met
   there. And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city
   of Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened,
   that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul." Acts
   16:13,14.

   PHILIPPI is famous in classic history as the spot where the world's
   future trembled in the balance when Octavius met Brutus and Cassius in
   terrible conflict. The two republican generals here ended their stormy
   career and universal empire crouched at the feet of Caesar. As long as
   time endures, or human slaughter is thought worthy of a record,
   Phi-lippi will be remembered as one of the greatest names in martial
   history. But when time shall have passed away and the records of human
   guilt shall have been cast into oblivion, Philippi will still have a
   name as the place where the first herald of the Cross cried, "Europe
   for Jesus."

   There was struck the first blow at the demon of evil and the first
   victory won in that quarter of the world. More fraught with blessings
   to the human race was that conquest of a woman's heart than all the
   laurels which Octaves had reaped upon the bloody field. Angels looked
   on while Paul threw down the gauntlet of defiance to all the powers of
   darkness and invaded our fair continent in the name of Jesus of
   Nazareth. We may well look back with admiration to the gallant advance
   of the little band, the Apostle and his few companions, who were the
   pioneers of the Lord's elect army in the western world. Philippi is
   enrolled forever in the record of the battles of peace.

   The introduction of Christianity into Europe is a very humble affair.
   There is nothing very stately in the architecture of the house where
   Jesus is first preached. In fact, we have no evidence that there was
   any building at all--probably it was an open-air service by the
   riverside. Happy omen of the results of open-air preaching in after
   times! There were not enough Jews in the military city of Philippi to
   admit of the erection of a synagogue and therefore a few women met in a
   quiet spot by the river's bank. A stranger might walk through Philippi
   a hundred times and never know of the existence of the Jews' meeting
   place--it was a nook so retired and frequented by so few.

   Heathendom might seem to the ordinary observer to be universal in its
   reign. For who would care to notice the feeble company who met in
   retirement to offer prayers unto the Most High God of Israel? We will
   go to the meeting place this morning, and in spirit mingle with the few
   women and listen to that strange man who in burning accents is
   addressing them. And let us mark the result produced in the heart of
   yonder seller of purple, who has come with her wares from the city of
   Thyatira.

   First, we shall consider Lydia's conversion in itself. Secondly, in
   contrast with another which is recorded in the chapter. Thirdly, in
   comparison with that other. And lastly, as a type and model of
   multitudes of conversions in our own day.

   I. First, in LYDIA'S CONVERSION there are many points of interest.
   Observe that it was brought about by Providential circumstances. She
   was a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira. That city was famous
   for its dyeing trade which had flourished there ever since the days of
   Homer. The mode of producing a peculiarly delicate and valuable purple
   seems to have been known to the women of Thyatira. It may be that Lydia
   had come to Philippi upon a journey, or that while her manufactures
   were carried on at Thyatira, she resided during a part of the year at
   Philippi to dispose of her goods.

   The communication between the two places was very easy and she may have
   frequently made the journey. At any rate, Providence brings her there
   when the hour of her conversion is come. You will remember that
   Thyatira was situated in that part of the country into which Paul was
   forbidden by the Spirit to go and preach. Therefore, had Lydia been at
   home, she could not have heard the Truth of God. And as "Faith comes by
   hearing, and hearing by the Word of God," she must have remained
   unconverted. But Providence brings her to Philippi at the right time.
   Here is the first link of the chain.

   But how is Paul to be brought there? He must, first of all, be kept out
   of Bithynia. And he must be silenced in his journey through Mysia. He
   must be brought to Troas, close by the margin of the sea. He must look
   across the blue sea and muse upon Europe's needs. He must fall asleep
   and in the visions of the night he must be prompted to cross to
   Macedonia. He shall ask for a ship--that ship shall be bound for
   Samothrace and for no other place. He must land at Neapolis and by the
   same instinct, he must make his way to Philippi. He cannot go in any
   other direction. He must be brought there at the very time when Lydia
   is present. He must discover the little oratory by the river's brink,
   for God ordains that Lydia shall be saved.

   Now, how many different threads were all interwoven here to make up the
   fabric of her providential conversion? In this case God rules and
   overrules all things to bring that woman and that Apostle to the same
   spot. And, Beloved, everything in God's Providence is working together
   for the salvation of His elect. If there is an elect soul whom God
   predestinates to be converted by my word, He may have fetched him home
   from Australia today by some troublesome accident, as it seems to him.
   Or He may have set sail for America and the ship may have been drifted
   back. But this I know--God will shake Heaven and earth sooner than
   suffer one elect soul to miss the predestined moment.

   When the eternal counsel runs--"On such a day that man shall be
   arrested by Sovereign Grace and shall be made willing in the day of
   God's power"--happen what may, and occur whatever may, God's purpose
   shall stand! He will do all His pleasure. We do not well if we forget
   the expectant Providences which work before our conversion to bring us
   unto that spot where God was pleased to manifest Himself unto us.

   Observe next, that in Lydia's case there was not only preventing
   Providence, but there was also Divine Grace in a certain manner
   preparing the soul. The woman did not know the Savior. She did not
   understand the things which make for her peace, yet she knew many
   truths which were excellent steppingstones to a knowledge of Jesus. If
   not a Jewess by birth, she was a proselyte of the gate, and therefore
   well acquainted with the oracles of God. She was one who worshipped
   God--no, she was one of the most devout of God's worshippers among the
   Jews. Though she was far away from the synagogue--some forget the
   Sunday when they travel in foreign lands--yet when the day came round,
   she was found with that little handful at the riverside oratory.

   I doubt not that she had read Isaiah the Prophet and that she could
   carry in her heart and remember such words as these, "He is despised
   and rejected of men; a Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief . . .
   He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her
   shearers is dumb, so He opened not His mouth." As in the case of the
   Ethiopian eunuch, the Scriptures she had read, though they were not
   understood for want of some man to guide her, had prepared her
   mind--the ground had been plowed already for the good seed. It was not
   a hard rock as in the jailer's case.

   She worshipped God. She worshipped Him in sincerity. She worshipped Him
   looking for the coming of the Messiah, Israel's Consolation. And so her
   mind was prepared for the reception of the Gospel. Doubtless, dear
   Friends, in many of us there was a preparation for Christ before Christ
   came to us in quickening Grace. I know that in some of our cases the
   pious example of a godly father, and the loving instruction of a tender
   mother had softened us somewhat so that though still we were unsaved
   and still out of Christ, yet we were like the man who laid at the pool
   of Bethesda. We were close by the edge of the healing stream and there
   was not in our case that sudden, that astounding change which we have
   seen in others.

   Still, dear Friends, we ought to ascribe all this preparatory work to
   Sovereign Grace, for Grace--free favor--does much in which no Grace of
   effectual salvation is perceptible. I mean that before Divine Grace
   renews the heart, there is Grace preparing us for Grace--Grace may be
   setting the mind in activity, clearing us from prejudice, ridding us of
   a thousand infidel and skeptical thoughts. And so it is raising a
   platform from which Divine Grace conducts us into the region of the new
   life. Such was the case of Lydia. Such is the case of many. Providence
   and Grace co-work before the effectual time is come.

   Note concerning her conversion, in the third place, that it took place
   in the use of the means. On Sunday she went to her gathering of her
   people. Although God works great wonders and calls men when they are
   not hearing the Word, yet usually we must expect that being in the way,
   God will meet with them. It is somewhat extraordinary that the first
   convert in Europe was converted at a very small Prayer Meeting.

   There were only a few women there. We have no reason to think that
   there were any more males than just Paul and his friend, Luke. And
   these, you see, had called in, as we say, accidentally, and had been
   moved to give an address at the Prayer Meeting. And that address it was
   which was the means in God's hand of opening her heart. Beloved
   Friends, let us never neglect the means of Divine Grace. Wherever we
   are, let us not forget the assembling of ourselves together, as the
   manner of some is. I say again, God may bless us when we are not in His
   House, but we have the best reason to hope that He will when we are in
   communion with His saints.

   Oh, what a joy it is to see so many constantly thronging our House of
   Prayer because we have good hope that the God of Salvation will meet
   with them. No, it is not mere hope, but a confident expectation, for I
   suppose there never is a sermon preached in this House which is not the
   means of the conversion of some. We have, ourselves, abundant testimony
   that so often as Christ is lifted up here, the wounded in the camp
   forbear to die. May it ever be the case and may you ever have, even if
   as yet you are unconverted, a love to the courts of the Lord's House
   and to the place where His people meet together. Love the Prayer
   Meeting--do not say of it--"Only a Prayer Meeting"!

   God loves to put honor upon prayer, upon the assembly of His people
   directly for His worship. And you may hope, dear Friends, that even if
   the sermon shall not have been useful, and if the common Sunday service
   may not have been blessed, yet, perhaps, on the Monday
   evening--perhaps, too, in that little cottage, when there are only a
   few women pre-sent--you may meet with God, who did not appear to you in
   the greater assembly. Be diligent in the use of the means. Be
   constantly in God's House, as often as the doors are open, and your
   engagement will prevail, for Lydia's conversion takes place in the use
   of the means.

   Note again, for we will only hint at these things rather than dwell
   upon them, that it was assuredly a work of Divine Grace, for we are
   expressly told, "whose heart the Lord opened." She did not open her own
   heart. Her prayers did not do it. Paul did not do it. The Lord Himself
   must open the heart to receive the things which make for our peace. To
   operate savingly upon human hearts belongs to God, alone. We can get at
   human brains, but God alone can arouse human affections. We may reach
   them, we grant you, in the natural and common way. But to reach them as
   that the enemy of God shall become His friend, and that the stony heart
   shall be turned into flesh, is the work of Divine Grace and nothing
   short of Divine power can accomplish it.

   We pray you, Brothers and Sisters, never forget this. We think it meet,
   according to Scriptural warrant and example, to speak to you and exhort
   you to arise from the dead, that Christ may give you life. But we
   remind you and trust you never may forget it--that all the work must
   always be of the Holy Spirit and of Him alone. I am told, in preaching
   the Gospel, to command you to, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and
   you shall be saved." But well I am aware and may you be aware of it,
   too, that faith is the gift of God. Though the Scripture bids us say,
   "Wash you, make you clean. Put away the evil of your doings from before
   My eyes; cease to do evil." Though it cries, "Let the wicked forsake
   his ways and the unrighteous man his thoughts. And let him return unto
   the Lord and He will have mercy upon him."

   Though our Savior, Himself, puts it, "Strive to enter in at the strait
   gate. Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that which endures
   unto eternal life," yet we know that salvation is neither by your
   striving, nor by your laboring, nor by your reforming and amending, but
   that all these are the fruit of an inward and mysterious work which the
   Holy Spirit alone can perform. Give unto God the glory if you have been
   converted, praise Him alone--"Not by might, not by power, but by My
   Spirit says the Lord." He alone can cut the bands which fasten the
   heart. He alone can put the key into the hole of the door and open it
   and get admittance for Himself.

   He is the heart's Master as He is the heart's Maker, and conversion in
   every case is the Lord's work, alone. Yet-- because one Truth of God
   must always march arm in arm with another, and no man gets at correct
   ideas by merely grasping one Truth--he has two eyes and two hands, so
   let him be content to use them both. Although the Lord opened the
   heart, Paul's words were the instrument of her conversion. The heart
   may be opened and willing to receive, but then if the Truth of God
   enters not, what would be the use of an open door? But God always takes
   care to open the heart at a time when the messenger of mercy shall be
   going by, that the heart may give him admittance.

   There shall be the plowed field, but there shall be no cry, "Where is
   the sower?" for when the plow has done its work, here comes the sower
   and begins to scatter the seed. Paul speaks the Word as surely as God
   opens the heart. Do not decry the ministry. It is a temptation of
   modern times to be always talking as though the ministry were a
   magnifying of man, as though to listen to the preacher were a
   glorification of the creature at the expense of the Maker. Now I
   believe there is nothing in the world which shows our humility of
   spirit and tends more to glorify God than a cheerful willingness to
   receive at His hands the golden treasure of His Grace out of an earthen
   vessel.

   The weakness of the preacher becomes a foil to set forth His Glory, and
   by no means derogates from the honor due to the Lord Himself. God has
   worked, and always will work, by means--by chosen men upon whom He puts
   the anointing of His Spirit. And when the men are lacking to serve the
   Lord, then is the Church always in a weak state. While she has her
   Pauls to preach, she shall not be without her God to open hearts to
   receive the Word.

   Now only one more thought upon her conversion--it was distinctly
   perceptible by the signs which followed. She was baptized. As soon as
   she had believed in Jesus, she put on, together with her household, the
   profession of her faith in Christ Jesus. Happy Lydia, to have a
   household which believed in Jesus! Happy Lydia, to see them all
   baptized with her! Now there is a danger in certain sections of the
   Church to make too much of Baptism by linking it with regeneration, as
   baptismal regeneration. But there is an equally great danger among us
   who are called Baptists of making too little of Baptism. We cannot make
   too much of it, because our belief that none ought to be baptized but
   those who are regenerate already, will always be a healthy check for
   our making too much of it.

   But we may make too little of it. We ought to insist very strongly upon
   the duty of all Believers who have found the Savior to obey the second
   Gospel command. "He that believes and is baptized, shall be saved." We
   do not doubt but that all who believe shall be saved, but still for our
   part, when we see Baptism put in so close connection with believing, we
   would not be disobedient to our Master's command. We think it to be a
   sweet sign of an humble and broken heart when the child of God is
   willing to obey a command which is not essential to his
   salvation--which is not forced upon him by a selfish fear of damnation.
   We say it is a great sign of Divine Grace, when, as a simple act of
   obedience and of communion with his Master in his burial to the world
   and resurrection to a new life, the young convert yields himself to be
   baptized.

   Lydia was baptized, but her good works did not end at the water. She
   then would have the Apostles come to her house. She will bear the shame
   of being thought to be a follower of the crucified Jew, a friend of the
   despised Jewish Apostle, the renegade, the turncoat--she will have him
   in her house. And though he says, "No," out of his bashfulness to
   receive anything, yet she constrains him, for love is in her heart and
   she has a generous spirit. And while she has a crust, it shall be
   broken with the man who brought her to Christ. She will give not only
   the cup of cold water in the Prophet's name, but her house shall
   shelter him.

   Brethren, I do not think much of a conversion where it does not touch a
   man's substance--and those people who pretend to be Christ's people and
   yet live only for themselves and do nothing for Him or for His Church
   give sorry evidence of having been born again. A love to the people of
   God has always been a distinguishing mark of the true convert. Look,
   then, at Lydia, and remember that she is but a specimen of many. Let
   her case rest before you and let the prayer go up, "Lord, bring in
   Lydias this morning, according to Your mighty Grace."

   II. We now look at the case again BY WAY OF CONTRAST. There is another
   story in the chapter. Read it carefully, for there is a remarkable
   contrast between the two. In the case of the jailer, we see nothing
   like a previouspreparation for the reception of the Word. He seems to
   be coarse, rough, brutal. It may be he did no more than his orders
   required of him when he treated Paul so harshly, for it is written,
   "Having received such a charge he thrust them into the inner prison."
   But the probabilities are that he did this with a very hearty goodwill.
   And, looking with a thorough contempt upon the two enthusiasts who had
   plunged themselves into this trouble, he was not at all likely to
   adjust the stocks in any comfortable manner, or see to their ease in
   any way.

   He was probably a rough, veteran soldier, who had been elevated to the
   jailer's office. He had gone to sleep. No preparation, surely, in sleep
   for the reception of the Word! The earthquake comes. The man springs
   out of his bed in terror! He grasps his sword and would have killed
   himself--he is in the very act of committing suicide, when a voice is
   heard--"Do yourself no harm, we are all here." Now we cannot discover
   the slightest atom of preparation for his conversion. He is as far off
   from hope as a man can be, and is just upon the edge of perdition--near
   to running before the bar of his Maker with hands red with his own
   blood.

   Beloved, there are conversions such as these. They may not be very
   plentiful, but there are such and there have been such in this House of
   Prayer. Men have come under the sound of the Word with an intention of
   despising and laughing at it. They have come with their hearts full of
   venom and enmity. They have despised the preacher and despised the
   Truth of God. They have come fresh from the foulest haunts of sin and
   they were proposing, yet further, to plunge into the depths of
   iniquity. They were enemies to God by wicked works. They made their
   hearts hard as a stone, and yet, all of a sudden, the ponderous hammer
   of the Word has come upon them, and the flint was made to fly into a
   thousand shivers! And, by God's Grace, the proud sinner became humble
   as a little child.

   Paul's case is somewhat similar to that of the jailer. You will
   remember it, and there are cases of persons here today who can, as they
   read the jailer's story say, "Such was I once--as great a stranger from
   God as he and as little likely to be called by Divine Grace as he
   was--and yet Grace came and made me a new creature in Christ Jesus."
   Here was no preparation, while in Lydia's case there was much which
   went to prepare the way for the Grace of God.

   Another contrast is perceptible in the fact that she was in the way
   where the Grace of God was likely to meet with her. She was in God's
   House, at least in the spot which had been dedicated to His worship.
   She was engaged in prayer, and though not a formal prayer, but as far
   as her light went, it was acceptable to God and was, at any rate,
   sincere, coming from her heart. But not so the jailer. He is not in a
   place where the Gospel is at all likely to come. His office keeps him
   in the midst of felons, of murderers, and criminals of all sorts. If
   Divine Grace shall come to the jail, it will come to a graceless place,
   indeed. His occupation was not that which would foster any religious
   ideas. Superstitions, doubtless, were present, and there was no point
   upon which a Roman was more superstitious than concerning an
   earthquake.

   It was one of the things which made the stout hearts of Roman soldiers
   tremble in a moment. It was the earthquake which made the guards at the
   tomb of our Savior become like dead men, swooning from fright. And this
   earthquake had much the same effect upon the jailer. He was not seeking
   after God. He had not a thought about God--his thoughts were hellish
   and his course was towards the pit. But in a moment, at God's voice,
   the current of his thoughts changes its direction and flows where it
   had never gone before! So have I known men who have been going on with
   all their might towards the realms of darkness with their free and
   stout will, determining to inherit eternal damnation. But the hour has
   struck, Sovereign Mercy has come forth--and they, wonders to all--but
   greatest wonders to themselves, have suddenly become heirs of God and
   children of the Most High! May such wonders still be worked.

   Yet further, we do not find in Lydia's case that there was anything
   like an earthquake. There were no great shakings and alarms. It was a
   "still, small voice." The jailer sprang in and came trembling. We doubt
   not that Lydia felt her need of a Savior and that her cry was, "What
   must I do to be saved?" But still we find very little about her
   trembling, or being overwhelmed with the terrors of conscience. She was
   gently led by the finger of the eternal Father. The light dawned upon
   her as the morning's dawn, a gradual enlightening of the darkness.
   Grace came upon her as the shower which first begins as a mist, then
   thickens into a heavy dew, and then becomes a gentle sprinkling and
   afterward empties the clouds upon the soil.

   To the jailer it was like an April storm beginning with big drops and
   dashing into a torrent in a few moments--to the jailer it was as though
   the sun should rise in an instant and turn the thickest night into full
   blaze of noon. Not so, in Lydia's case. Now do note, dear Friends,
   these differences, because they may help to solve many of your
   difficulties. Do not expect all to be converted in the same way. Do not
   suppose you are all to pass through the same terrors, nor all to be led
   by the same gentle methods. Our God is the God of variety in creation
   and in Providence. There are no two things exactly alike, and in the
   works of Divine Grace we are not to have Christians run into a mold, or
   dropped down like shot, all fashioned in the same shape.

   There must be in every conversion a something distinct and separate
   from every other--and every man must expect to perceive in the glass of
   his experience some things about the features of his conversion
   different from those of any other. Why, do you not see that the means
   which converted Lydia would not have been of any use to the jailer? The
   jailer would not go to the place by the riverside. He would have
   laughed at the idea of sitting down with a parcel of women! You would
   not find him listening to Paul. He would smile at the very thought--"I
   go and listen to a renegade Jew, whom his own nation has cast off?
   Nothing of the kind."

   On the other hand, an earthquake would not have been appropriate to
   Lydia's character. Good, gentle soul, it might have frightened her out
   of her wits and instead of making her cry, "What must I do to be
   saved?" it is very likely she would have been in a swoon, if not
   altogether dead. The same quantity of alarm which will bring a stronger
   man down into something like reason, will just drive a woman out of her
   reason altogether. Gentle Lydia and the rough jailer are two very
   different people. They were of different sexes to begin with, and the
   woman is more easily moved by that which gently appeals to the
   affections than is the man. She, again, had been a moral and excellent
   woman. He has, probably, been tutored in sin. There must be different
   methods with different temperaments.

   Does the farmer use the same machines in threshing different kinds of
   grain? Are all seeds sown after the same fashion? Do we not feel with
   regard to our children that we can speak a sharp word to one and he
   will scarcely feel it, but that the same expression will break another
   boy's heart? One child needs the rod and there are others upon whom a
   touch of the rod might work mischief. Certainly, then, it must be so in
   the constitution of the soul. And therefore God deals with each of us
   in different ways and we are not to question the sincerity of our
   conversion because it is not precisely like our favorite model. We are
   rather to see whether its fruits are the same, whether it comes of God,
   whether it leads to Christ, and if it does all this it matters not in
   what mold it is formed.

   III. So much for that point. But here, as I generally like, if I can,
   to place two Truths side by side, we have our third point, namely, THE
   COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO, because they are essentially alike, though
   circumstantially different.

   In both cases, dear Friends, Providence co-worked with Divine Grace.
   Providence brings Lydia to Philippi-- Providence shakes the prison. God
   makes the realm of nature subservient to His will in both cases. There
   is a demand for purple at Philippi. I do not know how it came about. I
   cannot tell whether there were new fashions among the ladies at
   Philippi at that time, or what it was--but for some reason or other
   Lydia gets to Philippi because there is a great market for her purple.
   Well now, that is Providence which brings her there. The same
   Providence by another revolution of its wheel has appointed that
   particular jailer to keep the prison. Why was he jailer to that
   particular prison? Why is Paul brought to Philippi at all?

   And how is it that through the accidental circumstance of the demoniac
   woman having been healed, Paul is beaten with rods and thrust into
   prison? Then comes the earthquake! Link within link and wheel within
   wheel, Providence works its way. So is it in every case--whether it is
   conversion by thunder and lightning, or by the "still, small voice."
   There was in both cases a distinct work of God. We see it in Lydia's
   case, and have dwelt upon it. Even more distinctly we perceive it in
   the jailer's case, for what but Irresistible Grace could have made him
   cry, "What must I do to be saved?"

   In both instances, too, the Word of God is essential, for we read
   concerning the jailer, as we did before, concerning Lydia, "They spoke
   unto him the Word of the Lord and to all who were in his house." The
   earthquake cannot dispense with the minister. And though the mighty
   power of God can take the natural bonds from every prisoner, yet he
   does not choose to take away the spiritual bonds from any one soul
   without the proclamation of the Word. It pleases God, "by the
   foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."

   And again, in both cases, the same signs followed. The jailer is
   baptized with all his house, and we are told that they all believed. He
   washes Paul and Luke's stripes. Just as Lydia had entertained them, so
   he begins to wash their poor backs which were all black and blue and
   probably bleeding with the hard blows of the lictor's elm rods. He sets
   meat before them and entertains them with the best he has and glad
   enough is he, in the morning, when he finds they are not to be kept in
   durance any longer, but may go their way. Here is the same result, the
   same love to the Brothers and Sisters, the same obedience to the Divine
   command, "Arise and be baptized."

   There is an unmistakable likeness among all the people of God. All the
   children have the father's features, yet they are not any one of them
   precisely like his fellow. They are all brought by Divine Grace and
   Grace does its work in the same way. Yet, as to the minutiae of the
   details of their conversion, they are as wide as the poles asunder.

   IV. We take Lydia's conversion to be A MODEL OF MULTITUDES OF
   CONVERSIONS WHICH ARE GOING ON IN OUR MIDST AT THE PRESENT TIME, AND IN
   OTHER CHURCHES, WHERE GOD IS MAKING BARE HIS ARM. The expression used
   is, "The Lord opened Lydia's heart, to attend to the things that were
   spoken."

   Now what is meant by this? I think we have a summary of the work of the
   Holy Spirit here. There are several things meant. No doubt the Lord
   removed prejudice. This prejudice is an evil which we have to fight
   against in very many. In Lydia's case it would be Jewish
   prejudice--perhaps the report had reached her, as it had most of the
   Jews, concerning Jesus of Nazareth. She knew that her race had hounded
   Him to the death, that her nation had even said, "His blood be on us
   and on our children." Paul the Apostle was the subject of much of this
   prejudice among the Jews. You will recall that when writing his Epistle
   to the Hebrews he does not begin with his name, as he does in all the
   other Epistles, because he felt that the very name, "Paul," from the
   fact of his having been an eminent Pharisee and having become a
   Christian, was distasteful to the Hebrew people.

   But God removed all this prejudice from Lydia's mind--she sat down to
   listen to Paul with a determination to give him a fair hearing and to
   weigh the matter and see whether these things were so or not--somewhat
   like the Bereans of old who also had their hearts in a measure opened,
   for they searched the Scriptures to see whether things were so. The
   devil often covers men from head to foot in a coat of mail so that when
   they come where the arrows of God are flying, there is very little hope
   of their being wounded because there is scarce a joint of the harness
   which the devil has not protected by an iron rivet of prejudice.

   You know how he tries in these days to do it. Some silly tales are set
   afloat about the minister--some inventions of addled brains--or else
   some old stories which were true of eccentric men whom the worms have
   eaten one hundred years before--all these are appended to the preacher
   that so he may be made to appear in a ridiculous light, in order, as
   the devil thinks, that there may be a prejudice against the Word which
   comes from his lips. Or else it is the denomination or the sect, as it
   is called, to which the preacher belongs. "Of course, I can get no good
   from him," says one, "I am a Churchman." Or, says another, "I could not
   expect that I should be blessed under him--I am an Arminian."

   So these things raise prejudices and many make up their minds
   beforehand that they will not like the preaching-- and they come into
   the place, as it were, with their ears stuffed full of wool--and you
   cannot get a word in. They have their hearts already so occupied with
   certain set notions, that though an angel from Heaven should minister
   the Truth, it would need to have the earthquake of the jailer before
   the Truth could enter in. In Lydia's case there was nothing of the
   sort. She was willing to hear and to give a candid attention to the
   preacher. Much is gained when this is done.

   In the next place, when her heart was opened her desires were awakened.
   She felt now a wish to understand this matter and if there was anything
   in what the Apostle was saying about eternal salvation--about complete
   pardon by the blood of Him who was the "Lamb slain from before the
   foundation of the world." She said to herself, "I should like to know
   about it. I hope it may be true. I wish I may get an interest in these
   things." So she listens, anxiously desiring to be impressed by the
   Word. She has a hunger and a thirst--and these people have this
   blessing--"They shall be filled." When we get our people, by God's
   Grace, as far as hungering and thirsting, then we are very thankful to
   say this is the opening of the heart. As the oyster when the tide comes
   up opens its shell, so when the tide of Grace is coming, God often
   makes men open their hearts, so that now they may get the spiritual
   supply.

   Well, there was a desire awakened, but this was not all. There came
   another kind of opening--her understanding was now enlightened. "Yes,"
   as the Apostle went from one point to the other point--"yes, I see that
   God did promise a Prophet like unto Moses. This man Jesus is like
   Moses, for He is a Prophet mighty in word and deed, which none of our
   Prophets were, except Moses. Yes," she said, "yes, Isaiah does speak of
   Him as being 'despised and rejected of men.' That is right and David
   does say, 'They pierced My hands and My feet, they parted My garments
   among them. For My vesture did they cast lots.' Yes," she said, "I see
   it--in the Person of the Man Christ Jesus, whom Paul preaches, I
   perceive the Messiah who is spoken of in the Law and in the Prophets."

   And then he went on to say that faith in this Christ Jesus, who was
   fastened to the tree, would take away all sin, because this same Christ
   Jesus had carried upon His blessed shoulders the transgression of all
   Believers. "Yes," she said," I see that this is a reasonable doctrine,
   that of Substitution. I can see how God is just, for He does punish sin
   in Christ. And I can see how He is gracious, too, for He is able now to
   freely give out of the fullness of His heart, such Divine Grace as poor
   sinners require." So her understanding was opened. She clearly viewed
   the Gospel. She could see in its height and depth and length, just that
   which her soul wanted.

   Then came something else. Now her affections were excited. She felt
   growing within her a love to Him who, though He was equal with God, yet
   took upon Himself the form of a servant. As she heard Paul describe His
   sufferings, as she pictured to herself the scene around the Cross, she
   thought she could hear the death-shriek and mark the flowing blood and
   she seemed to think, "Yes, I love that Man. I love that God. My heart
   goes after Him. O that He were mine! Yes," she said, I love that
   preaching. Sweet to my ears are those doctrines of mercy." She began,
   already, to rejoice and, "Blessed are the people that know the joyful
   sound," for if they do not yet walk in the light of God's countenance,
   yet they shall, for so the promise runs.

   All this, I think, is included in the term, "Her heart was opened." Her
   affections were now kindling towards Divine things. And then came
   faith. She believed the whole of the record. She took it to be
   absolutely true, as Paul had stated, that there had been a Messiah.
   That He, according to Scripture, was the Son of God and was also the
   Son of Man. That He had suffered, the Just for the unjust, and that
   she, believing in Him, had her sins forgiven. Faith came now through
   hearing. She took God at His Word. She simply and humbly put her soul
   at the feet of that Cross where the blood was dropping, believing that
   as it fell from Heaven, it pleaded for her. And as it dropped on her it
   gave her peace with God through Jesus Christ.

   Faith being given, all the Graces followed. Now she hated her sins, she
   repented. Now she loved righteousness, she sought after holiness. Now
   she had a bright hope of the many mansions in the Father's house! Now
   she began to run with holy and happy feeling in the ways of obedience
   to Christ's commands and she became, not merely a Believer in the
   elements of Christianity, but she went on towards perfection, adding to
   her faith courage, and to her courage, experience, and to her
   experience, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, love. Onward
   she went in the way of her God. All this the Master did by opening her
   heart to attend to the things that were spoken of by Paul.

   And now, Beloved, the practical lesson is that we must pray for those
   who are round about us, and the many hopeful ones, that God would make
   them like Lydia. Let us put up this petition for our sons and
   daughters, that the God who has put them in the way of the means and,
   to a degree, has prepared their minds for the reception of the Truth of
   God, would be pleased to work effectually and savingly and bring them
   to accept the Savior.

   As for those in whom God is thus working, O that the Word I speak this
   morning might lead them to lay hold on Jesus! Remember, there is
   nothing for you to do--you have but to trust Jesus and you are saved.
   And to do this, as your warrant, there are no good works required, nor
   good feelings, nor deep experiences, either. You have, just as you are,
   to believe that Christ can save you and trust yourself to Him as the
   Savior and He will save you! He will save you NOW with a great, present
   and complete salvation. The Lord help you to trust in Him and He shall
   have the praise. Amen.

                             The Holy Child, Jesus

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 20, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "That signs and wonders may be done by the name of Your holy Child,
   Jesus."

   Acts 4:30.

   THE opposition of the world is often a very great blessing to the
   Church. If it is met by holy boldness, it is sure to yield a glorious
   triumph for the servants of God. Sanctified by the Holy Spirit, out of
   the eater comes forth honey, for it becomes an incentive to greater
   zeal. Now that the enemy is determined to conquer, the Church will be
   resolved to hold its own. Pressure from without drives the members of
   the Church together and so promotes holy love. And when love and zeal
   come together, then there is such a blessed unity of action and such a
   power in every effort that great success must follow. Woe unto the
   world when it persecutes the Church, for it kicks with its naked foot
   against the pricks! It stirs up a nest of hornets about its own ears!
   Yes, it provokes the Lion of the tribe of Judah to spring upon His
   enemies.

   Our text is a portion of an Apostolic song which celebrated the release
   of Peter and John and the confusion of the priests and scribes. Every
   persecution shall yield songs of victory for the people of God. There
   is one sweet result which always flows from the opposition of the
   world, namely, that it draws true disciples nearer to their Master. You
   will perceive that they sing concerning the birth and death and
   resurrection of Jesus Christ--the Lord is the theme of their grateful
   song. The title by which they salute Him, "Your holy Child, Jesus," is
   most appropriate to their case. The history of the Church is Christ's
   life written out in length.

   Our Lord enters upon the world a holy Child--when the Church begins her
   history, she is as a holy child, too, and therefore rejoices in the
   childhood of her gracious Lord. How precious is it to see Jesus as made
   in all points like His people, and how rapturous for His people to see
   their Redeemer's features drawn by the pencil of fellowship in
   themselves. Trial is often sanctified to this noble end. Let the world
   oppress the Church. Let the members of that Church be thoroughly weaned
   from any other ground of comfort. Let the Lord Jesus be their only rock
   and refuge and they will soon perceive analogies in the history of
   Christ beautifully explaining their own--analogies which they never
   would have discovered except in the glare of the furnace.

   In the chapter before us, the Apostles are thrown back upon the Person
   of Jesus for comfort, and they revel in the thought of His being a
   child, because they discover in this His likeness to the Church, which,
   in its infancy, the enemy sought to destroy, even as Herod sought to
   slay the newborn King of the Jews.

   Brethren, whenever we endure adversities, or tribulations, or
   distresses, it is ours to turn to Christ and consider the Apostle and
   High Priest of our profession. For we may rest assured that the black
   finger of our distresses will often point out beauties in the Person of
   Immanuel up to now unseen. There is a certain spot from which alone
   each glorious trait in the Savior's Character can be seen--and many of
   our most painful positions are ordained for us in order that we may,
   from their vantage ground, behold the Lamb of God.

   Our subject this morning may, perhaps, be suitable to the experience of
   some. May the Lord make it useful to all. Taking the text as we find
   it, we shall, first of all, meditate upon the humanity of Christ as
   here declared. Secondly, we shall view it as here described--"A holy
   Child." And thirdly, we shall then behold it in the glory which
   surrounds it--signs and wonders are worked by the name of the holy
   Child, Jesus.

   I. First, then, dear Friends, may our hearts be enlightened to see, as
   the Apostles did, the beauty and excellence of THE REAL HUMANITY OF OUR
   LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST.

   While we always contend that Christ is God, very God of very God, let
   us never lose the firm conviction He is most certainly and truly a Man.
   He is not a God humanized, nor yet a human being deified. But as to His
   Godhead, pure Godhead, equal and co-eternal with the Father. As to His
   Manhood, perfect Manhood--made in all respects like unto the rest of
   mankind, sin alone excepted. His humanity was real, for He was born. He
   lay hidden in the virgin's womb, and in due time was born into a world
   of suffering. The gate by which we enter upon the first life, He also
   passed through.

   He was not created, nor transformed, but His humanity was begotten and
   born. As He was born, so in the circumstances of His birth, He is
   completely Human. He is as weak and feeble as any other babe. He is not
   even royal, but Human. Those who were born in marble halls of old were
   wrapped in purple garments and were thought by the vulgar to be a
   superior race. But this Babe is wrapped in swaddling cloths and has a
   manger for His cradle--that the true Humanity of His Being may come
   out.

   More than a Man--He is a Prince of the House of David. He knows the
   woes of a peasant's child. As He grows up, the very growth shows how
   completely Human He is. He does not spring into full manhood at once,
   but He grows in stature and in favor both with God and man. When He
   reaches man's estate, He gets the common stamp of manhood upon His
   brow. "In the sweat of your brow shall you eat bread" is the common
   heritage of us all and He receives no better. The carpenter's shop must
   witness to the toils of a Savior, and when He becomes the Preacher and
   the Prophet, still we read such significant words as these--"Jesus,
   being weary, sat thus on the well."

   We find Him needing to betake Himself to rest in sleep. He slumbers at
   the stern of the vessel when it is tossed in the midst of the tempest.
   Brethren, if sorrow is the mark of real manhood, and, "man is born to
   trouble as the sparks fly upward," certainly Jesus Christ has the true
   evidence of being a Man. If to hunger and to thirst are signs that He
   was no shadow, and His manhood no fiction, you have these. If to
   associate with His fellow men and eat and drink as they did will be
   proof to your mind that He was none other than a Man--see Him sitting
   at a feast one day--at another time He graces a marriage supper.

   And on another occasion He is hungry and "has not where to lay His
   head." Since the day when the prince of the power of the air obtained
   dominion in this world, men are tempted and He, though He is born pure
   and holy, must not be delivered from temptation--

   "The desert His temptation knew
   His conflict and His victory, too."

   The garden marked the bloody sweat as it started from every pore while
   He endured the agony of conflict with the prince of this world.

   If, since we have fallen and must endure temptation, we have need to
   pray, so had He--

   "Cold mountains and the midnight air Witnessed the fervor of His
   prayer." Strong crying and tears go up to Heaven mingled with His pleas
   and entreaties! What clearer proof could we have of His being Man of
   the substance of His mother, and man like ourselves, than this, that He
   was heard in that He feared? There appeared unto Him an angel
   strengthening Him. To whom but men are angels ministering spirits?

   Brethren, we have never discovered the weakness of our manhood more
   than when God has deserted us. When the spiritual consolations which
   comforted us have been withdrawn and the light of God's face has been
   hidden from us, then we have said, "I am a worm and no man." And out of
   the dust and ashes of human weakness have we cried unto the most high
   God. Let, "Eloi! Eloi! lama sabachthani" assure you that Christ has
   felt the same. Follow man wherever you will, and you find the
   footprints of the Son of Mary. Go after man where you will, into scenes
   of sorrow of every hue, and you shall find traces of Jesus' pilgrimage
   there. You shall find in whatever struggle and conflict of which man is
   capable, the Captain of our salvation has had a share.

   Leave out sin and Christ is the perfect picture of humanity. Simple as
   the truth is and lying as it does at the very basis of our
   Christianity, yet let us not despise it, but try to get a personal grip
   of it if we can. Jesus, my Mediator, is a Man-- "Immanuel, God with
   us." He is a Child born. He is better than that, for "unto us a Child
   is born, unto us a Son is given." He is to us a Brother. He is bone of
   our bone today. As a man leaves his father and mother and cleaves unto
   his wife and they, two, become one flesh, so has He left the Glory of
   His Father's house and become one flesh with His people. Flesh and
   bone, and blood and heart, that may ache and suffer, and be broken and
   be bruised, yes, and may die-- such is Jesus.

   For herein He completes the picture. As the whole human race must yield
   its neck to the great iron-crowned monarch, so must Christ Himself say,
   "Into Your hands I commend My spirit, Father." He, too, must yield up
   the ghost. Oh, Christian, see your nearness to Him and be glad this
   morning! Oh, Sinner, see His nearness to you! Come to Him with
   confidence, for in body and soul He is completely Human. Having thus
   insisted upon the Humanity of Christ, let us gather a few reflections
   from it. There are a thousand things which it indicates, but as the
   garden is too full of flowers for us to bring them all, we have
   gathered but a handful.

   As the first meditation, let us marvel at His condescension. It is the
   greatest miracle that was ever heard or read of, that, "the Word was
   made flesh and dwelt among us." Cyprian well said, "I do not wonder at
   any miracle, but I do marvel at this, which is a miracle among
   miracles, that God should become Man." That God should make a creature
   out of nothing is certainly a marvelous manifestation of power, but
   that God should enter into that creature and should take it into
   intimate union with His own Nature--this is the strangest of all acts
   of condescending love!

   Indeed, so marvelous is it, that in all the heathen mythologies--though
   imagination has there played strange freaks--in their theology we do
   find instances of the gods appearing in the likeness of men--yet never
   do we find anything like the hypostatical union of the two natures in
   the Person of Christ. Human wisdom in its most happy moments has never
   risen to anything like the thought of Deity espousing manhood, that man
   might be redeemed. To you and to me the marvel lies in the motive which
   prompted the Incarnation. What could it have been that brought Immanuel
   to such a stoop as this? What unrivalled, indescribable, unutterable
   love was this that made Him leave His Father's Glory, the adoration of
   angels, and all the hallowed joy of Heaven, that He might be made a Man
   like ourselves, to suffer, to bleed, to die?

   "He was seen of angels," says the Apostle, and this was a great wonder,
   for the angels had worshipped at His Throne! But their created eyes
   could not bear to look upon the brightness of His Person--they veiled
   their faces with their wings when they cried "Holy! Holy! Holy!" And
   yet, angels saw the Son of God lying in a manger! They saw the Lord of
   All wrestling with a fallen spirit in the wilderness! They saw the
   Prince of Peace hanging upon the tree on Calvary! "Seen of angels" was
   one of the wonders concerning the Incarnation of Christ.

   But that He should be seen of men? No, that He should be the Associate
   of the worst of men. That He should be called the Friend of publicans
   and sinners, so perfectly incarnating Himself and condescending so low
   that He comes to the very lowest state of humanity--all this, my
   Brothers and Sisters, is condescension concerning which words fail me.
   A prince who puts aside his crown and clothes himself with beggar's
   rags to investigate the miseries of his country is but a worm
   condescending to his fellow worm. An angel that should lay aside his
   beauty and become decrepit and lame and walk the streets in pain and
   poverty to bless the race of man were nothing, for this were but a
   creature humbling himself to creatures a little lower than himself.

   But here is the Creator taking the creature into union with Himself!
   The Immortal becoming mortal, the Infinite an infant, the Omnipotent
   taking weakness, even human weakness into union with His own Person! We
   may truly say of Jesus that He was weak as the dust and yet as mighty
   as the Eternal God. He was subject to suffering and yet God over all,
   blessed forever. O the depth of the love of Jesus!

   Let us reflect upon another theme. See the fitness of Christ for His
   work! He is perfect Man--He could not be a Priest if He were not. But
   now, "He can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, seeing He
   was tempted in all points like as we are." Being not ashamed to call us
   Brothers and Sisters, He can compassionate the ignorant and those who
   are out of the way. O Brothers and Sisters, if He were not Man, He
   could not have been our Substitute. Man sinned and man must pay the
   penalty--He must be perfect Man to make Atonement. If He were not Man,
   His righteousness would not have availed us, for while we want a Divine
   righteousness to cover the infiniteness of God's demands, we want a
   righteousness which is human, for it is that which the Law requires. O
   Soul, if you are in sadness and sickness today, let your arms embrace
   the Man Christ Jesus. Feel in the fact that He is your Brother how
   suitable is such a Savior to your poverty, your weakness and your sin.

   Let us think, too, of another thought. Inasmuch as Christ is Man, think
   of His near relationship and union to His people. He is no stranger of
   whom we speak--He is our Brother--no, more than that, He has become our
   Head. Not a Head of gold and feet of clay, or limbs of baser metal. But
   as we are, so was He, that as He is, so might we be. It is Manhood
   which is at the Head of the Church, as it is manhood which constitutes
   the members. Union to Jesus is, methinks, the sweetest doctrine in
   Revelation. There are other doctrines which possess a more transcendent
   grandeur, but the doctrine of union is the quintessence of all
   delights. What is Heaven but union to Christ realized? And what shall
   be the fore- taste of Heaven but union to Christ believed? As you see
   Him then completely--such as you are--know, Christian, how near, how
   dear, how intimately one with Him you are and be glad this day!

   Let me give you another flower. See the glory of manhood now, restored!
   Man was but a little lower than the angels and had dominion over the
   fowl of the air and over the fish of the sea. That royalty he lost. The
   crown was taken from his head by the hand of sin and the beauty of the
   image of God was dashed by his rebellion. But all this is given back to
   us. We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the
   suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor. And at this day all
   things are put under Him, waiting, as He does, and expecting the time
   when all His enemies shall be beneath His feet and the last enemy,
   Death, shall be destroyed by man--by the very Man whom he boasted that
   he had destroyed.

   It is our nature, Brothers and Sisters, Jesus in our manhood, who is
   now Lord of Providence. It is our nature which has hanging at its
   girdle the sovereign keys of Heaven and earth and Hell. It is our
   nature which sits upon the Throne of God at this very day. No angel
   ever sat upon God's Throne, but a Man has done it and is doing it now!
   Of no angel was it ever said, "You shall be King of kings and Lord of
   lords, they that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before You, and Your
   enemies shall lick the dust." But this is said of a Man. It is the Man
   who shall judge the world in righteousness. The Man who shall
   distribute crowns of reward--the Man who shall denounce, "Depart, you
   cursed."

   The Man, the thunder of whose words shall make Hell shrink with fright.
   Oh, how glorious is renovated manhood! What an honor it is, my Brothers
   and Sisters, to be man, not of the fallen first Adam, but man made in
   the image in the second Adam! Let us, with all our weaknesses and
   infirmities and imperfections yet bless and praise God, who made us
   what we are by His Divine Grace, for Man, in the Person of Christ, is
   second only to God--no, is in such union with God, that he cannot be
   nearer to Him.

   When we think of the true and proper Manhood of Christ, ought we not to
   rejoice that a blessed channel is opened by which God's mercy can come
   to us? "How can God reach man?" was once the question. But now,
   Brothers and Sisters, there is another question--"How can God refuse to
   bless those men who are in Christ? "The everlasting Father must bless
   His Only-Begotten Son and in blessing Him He has blessed a Man, and
   that Man, having all the elect in His loins, they are necessarily all
   blessed in Him. Look upon the Person of Christ as that of a
   representative individual. Whatever Christ is, all His elect are, just
   as whatever Adam was all men who were in him became.

   If Adam fell, all manhood fell. If Christ stands and is honored and
   glorified, then all who are in Christ--that is the goodly fellowship of
   His elect--are all blessed in Him. Now it is utterly impossible but
   that God should bless Jesus Christ, for Jesus Christ is forever One
   with God and His Manhood is also One with Godhead. As an old writer
   observes, "The nearest union that we know of is the union between the
   Humanity and the Divinity in the Person of Christ. That of the three
   Persons in the Trinity may rather be called a unity than a union--but
   this is the closest union we know of--the union between Humanity and
   Deity in Christ."

   So complete is it that you cannot think of Christ aright as a Man apart
   from God, nor as God apart from Man. The very idea of Christ has in it
   the two Natures and it is a clear impossibility that the Godhead should
   not impart of its blessedness to the Manhood. And that Manhood being
   thus blessed, every elect soul is necessarily blessed, also. O see what
   a channel is thus opened! A channel through which the stream cannot but
   flow! A golden pipe through which Divine Grace cannot but come! The
   laws of nature might be reversed, but not the Laws of God's Nature and
   it is a Law of God's Nature that in the Person of Christ the Deity must
   bless the Manhood.

   And that Manhood being blessed, it is another Law that elect manhood
   must be blessed, since that elect manhood is forever indissolubly bound
   up with the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. See what a deep and broad
   river is here opened for us, and what a fullness there is in that
   river--for all the fullness of the Deity dwells in Christ and the
   fullness of that Deity thus flows to man.

   See again, Beloved, what a door of access is thus opened between us and
   God! I am a man. Christ is a Man. I come to the Man Christ Jesus--no I
   have not even to do that--I am in the Man Christ. If I am a Believer, I
   am a portion of Him. Well, being a portion of the Man Christ and God
   being united with Him, I am very near unto God. I have such nearness of
   access, then, to God, that whatever may be my desires and my prayers, I
   have no need to climb to Heaven nor to descend into the depth in order
   to obtain them. For God's ear must be near to me inasmuch as God is in
   Christ, and my soul being in Christ I am very, very near to God.

   Christ's Body is the veil that hangs before the majesty of God. That
   veil was rent. And whoever by a living faith knows how to come through
   the rent Body of the Man, Christ, comes at once into the Presence of
   God. Such communion, such sacred commerce--such blessed interchanges
   between mankind and God could never have taken place in any other plan.
   That ladder which Jacob saw was but a faint and dreamy picture of this.
   This is no ladder, but the access is such as though God, who was at the
   top of Jacob's ladder, had come down to Jacob as he lay sleeping there.
   There is no ladder wanted now--the Person of Christ brings God to
   man--brings man to God in closer contact than the ladder can ever
   picture. Brethren, let us come boldly unto the Throne of the heavenly
   Grace, to obtain Grace to help in every time of need.

   Another thing I cannot leave out is this--Beloved, do see it, do see
   it--how safe we are! Our soul's estate was once put in the hands of
   Adam--he was a fallible man--how unsafe our salvation was then! The
   salvation of every Believer now is in the hand of a Man. It is the Man
   Christ Jesus! And what a Man! Can He fail? Can He sin? Can He fall? O
   no, Beloved, for the Deity is in intimate union with the manhood and
   the Man Christ Jesus, since He can never sin, can never fall and is
   therefore a sure foundation for the perpetual salvation of all the
   elect. When the angels were all in Heaven, before the fall of Satan,
   methinks they could never be perfectly happy because they knew that if
   they sinned they would perish. And this surely would mar their
   bliss--because there was a fear of their losing all their glory.

   But, Beloved, our salvation does not rest with ourselves. We may have
   all the joy of perfect security because it rests in the hands of One
   who cannot by any possibility sin. One who cannot err, cannot fail, but
   who stands fast forever, from everlasting to everlasting God. See then,
   the comfort and security of God's people! But, indeed, there are so
   many sheaves in this field of Incarnation that I cannot possibly unbind
   them all for you. You must come and pluck an ear or two for yourselves
   and rub them in your hands on this Sunday, that your hunger may be
   relieved.

   Beloved, do you not see that here is your adoption? You become sons of
   God because Christ becomes a son of man. Do you not perceive that here
   is your acceptance? The Man, Christ, is accepted and you, since He
   stands for you, are accepted in Him. No, there is not a mercy in the
   Covenant, there is not a single stream of blessing which flows to the
   Believer that does not spring from the fact that Christ is to be called
   the "holy Child Jesus," being most certainly and properly a Man. Thus
   much, then, upon the first point.

   II. Now let us VIEW THE HUMANITY AS IT IS HERE DESCRIBED. The words
   teach it to us--holy Child.

   Christ's Humanity was perfectly holy. Upon this doctrine you are well
   established--but you may well wonder that Jesus was always holy. He is
   conceived of a woman and yet no sort of sin comes from His birth. "That
   holy Thing which is born of you shall be called the Son of God." He is
   educated in the midst of sinful persons. It could not be otherwise, for
   there were none on earth that could be called good--all having become
   unprofitable--and although residing in the midst of sinners, in Him is
   no taint or trace of sin.

   He goes into the world, and as a physician must mingle with the sick,
   so He is found in the very worst of society. The harlot may speak to
   Him and from the publican He turns not away. Yet from none of these did
   He receive any corrupt influence. He is tempted and it is usually
   supposed that a man can scarcely be tempted, even should he overcome
   the temptation, without receiving some injury to his innocence. But the
   prince of this world came and had nothing in Christ--his fiery darts
   fell upon the Nature of Christ as upon water and were quenched at once.
   Satan was but as one who should whip the sea. He left no mark upon the
   perfect holiness of Christ.

   Imputation of sin would be the nearest approach to making our Lord a
   sinner. But let it ever be remembered that though Jehovah made Him to
   be sin for us, yet He knew no sin. The world's sin was put upon the
   shoulders of Christ and yet He had no sin for all that. The imputation
   was accomplished in such a manner that it did not in any sense or in
   any degree derogate from His title to perfect holiness. I have read
   sermons upon the imputation of sin to Christ which have left painful
   impressions upon my mind, because I remember to have met with the
   expression that Christ was the greatest sinner that ever lived, because
   He stood in the place of millions of sinners.

   Now it is true that Jesus took the sinner's place, but yet He never was
   a sinner, nor ever can in any sense be thought of as unholy. The great
   Redeemer stood perfect, pure, spotless. Even in the conflict, when all
   the powers of Hell were let loose against Him and when God Himself had
   withdrawn--that withdrawal of God from us would have hardened our
   hearts--but it did not harden His heart. The taking away of God's Grace
   from us is the ruin of our graces. But He had a wellspring of Divine
   Grace within Himself and His purity lived on when God had withdrawn
   from Him. From the first dawn of His humanity in the womb to the time
   when He is laid in the new tomb, He is "holy."

   The next word is one that requires most attention. Why is Christ called
   a "holy Child"? We can understand His being called a Child while He was
   so, but why a "holy Child" now that He is ascended up on High? Why,
   dear Friends, because the Character of Christ is more aptly pictured by
   that of a child than that of a man! If you conceive of a perfectly holy
   Child, you have, then, before you a representation of Christ. There is
   that in childhood, in holy childhood, which you cannot find even in
   holy manhood. You note in childhood its simplicity--the absence of all
   cunning.

   We dare not in manhood usually wear our heart upon our sleeve as
   children do. We have lost the trustfulness of our youth and are upon
   our guard in society. We have learned by very painful experience to
   suspect others and we walk among our fellow men often with our heart
   locked up with many locks, thinking that when thieves are abroad, good
   housekeepers must not leave the door open. We have to practice the
   wisdom of serpents, as well as the harmlessness of doves.

   But a child is perfectly guileless. It prattles out its little heart.
   It has no caution or reserve. It cannot scheme, for it cannot go round
   about with the skillful words of the politician. It knows not how to
   spin the web of sophistry. It is plain, transparent, and you see
   through it. Now such was Christ. Not foolish, for there is much
   difference between simplicity and folly. He was never foolish. They who
   mistook Him for such and sought to entrap Him soon discovered that the
   Child was a wise Child. Still He is ever a Child--He tells His heart
   out everywhere. He eats, He drinks like other men. They call Him a
   drunken man and a wine-bibber. Does He, then, from prudential motives,
   cease to eat and drink as other men? O no! He is quite a Child! In
   everything that He does there is an artless simplicity. You see through
   Him and you can trust Him, because there is a trustfulness about His
   whole Nature. He knows what is in man, yet He does not act with
   suspicion towards men, but ever with simplicity.

   In a child we expect to see much humbleness. There is a humbleness of
   association. There is a little child yonder--it is a king's daughter
   and here is another little child belonging to a gypsy woman. Leave the
   two in a room and see if they will not be at play together in five
   minutes. If it had been the queen and the gypsy woman, they would have
   sat as far apart as possible. O no! They do not associate together at
   all! Distinctions of rank and all that kind of thing they studiously
   maintain and, therefore, remain isolated. But the two children will be
   down on the floor together and if there happens to be some little heap
   of dust or a few pieces of broken crock, the princess will find in them
   almost as much mirth as the beggar woman's child. Here is humbleness of
   mind.

   So with Christ--He is King of kings and Prince of the house of
   David--yet He is always with the poor and needy, and sympathizes with
   them just as heartily as though He were altogether such as they were.
   You do not find little children sitting down and planning how they
   shall win crowns--in what way they shall obtain popularity or applause.
   O no! They are quite satisfied to do their father's will and live on
   his smile. It is so with Christ. What a childlike act that was--when
   they would have made Him a king, He went and hid Himself! And how
   childlike does He seem when He rides upon the colt, the foal of an ass,
   through the streets of Jerusalem and must have the mother ass there,
   too, lest either of the two creatures should be distressed. He is the
   Friend of the brute creation as well as of man in general--so
   thoughtful and so kind, so simple, so humble in all that He does.

   We picture a holy Child as being all obedient. You have but to say to
   it, "Do this," and it does it. It asks no questions. Was it not so with
   Jesus His whole life long? "My meat and My drink is to do the will of
   Him that sent Me." "Know you not that I must be about My Father's
   business?" So, again, we look in holy children for a forgiving temper.
   We know that sometimes the blood comes up in the little face and a
   little angry quarrel ensues, but it is soon over and with their arms
   about each other's neck, and many a loving kiss, it is soon made up
   again by the little ones. Well, with Jesus this characteristic of
   childhood is carried out to the fullest extent, for His latest words
   are, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."

   Ah, holy Child! No fire from Heaven do You call, like John. No
   denunciations come from Your lips against sinners. "Neither do I
   condemn you. Go and sin no more," says He to the woman taken in
   adultery. He is the child all through. Scripture calls Him the
   Man-Child and what if we call Him the great Child-Man? He was a Child
   when He had become a Man. He never had childish things to put away in
   the sense in which the Apostle speaks of it, for as to all the folly
   and the littleness and giddiness of youth, Christ knew not these. He
   knew everything that is beautiful, and lovely and just, in the virgin
   innocence of a pure and holy Child--such as children would have been,
   if their parents had not fallen. All this you see in the Person of
   Christ Jesus.

   Beloved, I think there is something very sweet in this picture of
   Christ's Humanity, because we are none of us afraid to approach a
   child. Men that are childlike men--we are never afraid of. You know
   certain people in the world--you could not tell your trouble to them.
   They have a haughty manner. They look down upon you. You feel that you
   can never reach their hearts. There are certain others with an open and
   honest face and you instinctively feel, "There, I can tell that man
   anything. I know I can. If I were in any kind of distress, or trouble,
   I would go to him--I know he would help me if he could." Well, that is
   because such a man has a degree of childlikeness about him.

   Now in the Person of Christ there is all this carried out to the
   fullest degree. Come, then, and tell Jesus everything. Whatever your
   trouble or difficulty may be, stand not back through shame or fear.
   Will you fear Immanuel, or dread the Lamb of God? Will you be afraid of
   a holy Child? No, rather come, and like Simeon, take Him in your arms
   and own Him as your consolation and your trust. I would I could get a
   hold this morning on those timid ones who always say, "I am afraid of
   Jesus." Why, dear Friends, how can you talk so? You do Him wrong. You
   know Him not, or you would not thus speak. This is the unkindest cut of
   all, to think that He is unwilling to forgive. Dying for you, living as
   a holy Child for you--O can it be, can it be possible that He should be
   hard to forgive and receive you?

   Thinking of a holy child while I looked through this verse, I turned to
   Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe's story of Eva and little Topsy. She gives a
   graphic picture there of a holy child, indeed. There is the Law in the
   person of Miss Ophelia-- she whips the child, but the more she whips
   her, the worse she is, she gets no further than, "I's so wicked, I
   can't help it. I's so wicked." That is all the Law can do. It can only
   make a man feel he is "so wicked," that he cannot help it, and he goes
   on sinning. But what a picture is that when St. Clair draws the curtain
   and sees the two little children sitting with their cheeks together.

   Eva says, "What does make you so bad, Topsy? Why won't you try and be
   good? Don't you love anybody, Topsy?" "Don't no nothing 'bout love. I
   loves candy and sich, that's all," said Topsy. "But you love your
   father and mother?" "Never had none, you know. I telled you that, Miss
   Eva." "Oh, I know," said Eva sadly, "but hadn't you any brother, or
   sister, or aunt, or--" "No, none of 'em--never had nothing nor nobody."
   "But, Topsy, if you'd only try to be good, you might." "Couldn't never
   be nothin' but a Nigger, if I was ever so good," said Topsy.

   "O Topsy, poor child, I love you!" said Eva, with a sudden burst of
   feeling. And laying her little thin white hand on Topsy's shoulder, she
   said, "I love you because you haven't had any father, or mother, or
   friends--because you've been a poor, abused child! I love you and I
   want you to be good. I am very unwell, Topsy, and I think I shan't live
   a great while. And it really grieves me to have you be so naughty. I
   wish you would try to be good for my sake. It's only a little while I
   shall be with you." The round, keen eyes of the black child were
   overcast with tears--large, bright drops rolled heavily down, one by
   one, and fell on the little white hand.

   Yes, in that moment, a ray of real belief, a ray of heavenly love had
   penetrated the darkness of her heathen soul! She laid her head down
   between her knees, and wept and sobbed--while the beautiful child,
   bending over her, looked like the picture of some bright angel stooping
   to reclaim a sinner. Now something like this, only in a far nobler
   style, Jesus Christ has behaved towards us. He sees us lost and ruined,
   wicked--hopelessly wicked--and He comes as a holy Child and sits down
   by our ruined humanity. And He says, "I love you--I love you because
   you are so lost, so ruined, so hopelessly ruined--because I know the
   dreadful doom into which you will fall. There is nothing in you that
   makes Me loves you, but I do love you. I cannot bear to see you die
   like this. I would sooner die than you should remain a sinner. I would
   sooner die and bear My Father's wrath for you, than that you should be
   a sinner and disobedient to Him."

   The holy Child sits down by you this morning and weeps for you. Will
   you grieve Immanuel? Will you break the heart of Jesus, your soul's
   Lover? Oh, will you open His wounds afresh and crucify Him again? If
   you would not, then trust Him now--fly to Him--give yourselves up to
   Him. He waits to be gracious to you. His loving arms are wide open to
   receive you. "Whosoever will," says He, "let him come and him that
   comes to Me I will in no wise cast out." Such is the coming of the
   "holy Child Jesus."

   III. To conclude--it seems that the name of this holy Child is to work
   great wonders. Only for one second let us turn aside and behold THE
   GLORY OF HIS HUMANITY. Although Christ was a Man, all the powers of
   nature knew their Master and crouched at His feet. He could command the
   sea or the boisterous wind--diseases, the myrmidons of death, and Death
   their prince, all owned allegiance to Him who is immortality and life.
   After His resurrection He endowed His disciples with His own power and
   more than His own power--"For greater works than these shall you do,
   because I go unto My Father."

   The name of Jesus was uttered, uttered by feeble men--and devils fled,
   dumb mouths began to sing, lame men leaped like a hart and the blind
   began to see--no, in several instances the grave, itself, yielded up
   its prey when the name of Jesus sounded through its hollow vaults! The
   age of miracles passed off, it was well it should. Miracles are but the
   cradle in which the man-child, the Church, must be rocked. When the
   Church became strong enough to stand alone, she left her swaddling
   bands behind her. But the name of Jesus has not less power today
   because no risen dead, no opened eyes follow in our train.

   At this hour, dead souls hear the voice of God and live. At this
   moment, spiritual eyesight is restored--hearts that were stone are
   turned to flesh--and tongues that were ready enough at cursing begin to
   sing. The miracles of the spirit world are infinitely greater than
   those of the natural. It is little to turn a stone into bread, but it
   is much to turn a stony heart into flesh. It is comparatively little to
   open a blind eye, but it is Divine, indeed, to enlighten the
   understanding and illuminate the dark heart. The name of Jesus is just
   as mighty in this Tabernacle, today, as it was on the lips of Paul upon
   Mars Hill, or when he stood in his own hired house in Rome.

   Do not say that you entertain a doubt concerning it. Look around and
   see the proofs. O Brothers and Sisters, you and I have been the willing
   trophies of the power of that great name in this House, or in the
   Surrey Music Hall and elsewhere, where that name was proclaimed! We
   received a broken heart--we who once had hearts hard as adamant! There
   the tears of repentance began to flow. There the griefs, the heavy
   glooms of our spirit were scattered by the Sun of Righteousness. If we
   have been made to walk in holiness, this is one of the signs and
   wonders of His name. If drunkenness and lust have been shaken off,
   this, too, is to His praise.

   If the demoniac, the man who was full of devilry, has been clothed and
   made to sit in his right mind at the feet of Jesus, this is another of
   the signs and wonders in this place--not only in this great chamber,
   but below stairs in our classes and in our Sunday schools, too, signs
   and wonders are worked by the name of the holy Child, Jesus. And in
   other places of worship in London, wherever Christ is lifted
   up--wherever His sacrifice is made the prominent theme--the dry bones
   in the valley come together--the Spirit breathes upon them and they
   live as an exceeding great army! We defy the whole world to show
   anything comparable to the power of Jesus' name!

   There is more magic in it than ever was in Moses' rod. It is more
   mighty even than his voice, though he divided the Red Sea and brought
   water out of the rock. Brethren, let us spread His name. Let it be
   always on our tongues. Let us each, in our proper sphere, declare His
   glory and we shall see His kingdom come and His will shall be done on
   earth even as it is in Heaven. I wonder whether there is anyone here
   who will be a sign and wonder of the love of Christ! Do you wish to be?
   Ah, then, I hope you are. Do you wish to be? Then, the door is open.
   "Whosoever believes in Him is not condemned." One look at Jesus, and
   you are saved--a trustful casting of yourself on Him and you are
   delivered!

   God enable you to do this now and you shall see in the change which is
   worked within you, an internal evidence of the majesty of Christ's
   Person, which shall never fail you. You shall be established by that
   which you feel within in so sure and certain a manner that the
   arguments of infidelity or deism shall never be able to shake you off
   the Rock. May God grant this for His holy name's sake. Amen.

                                Alpha And Omega

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 27, 1863, BY THE REV. C.
   H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the
   Last."

   Revelation 22:13.

   EVERY Sunday school child knows that there is no great mystery hidden
   in the words, "Alpha and Omega." We have here the names of the first
   and last letters of the Greek alphabet, so that the sense would be, "I
   am A and great O," in the Greek, or in plain English, "I am A and Z."
   "Jesus is the Alpha and Omega: A and Z: the Beginning and the End, the
   First and the Last."

   Our text demands no preface. Indeed, I do not know how I could venture
   to put a single letter before Alpha. Let us therefore come to our
   subject at once. In three ways I shall talk of the text. First, I shall
   bring certain doctrines to it. Secondly, we will look at the doctrines
   which are really in it. And then thirdly, at the lessons which
   naturally flow from it.

   I. At the outset, WE SHALL BRING CERTAIN TRUTHS OF GOD TO THE TEXT.
   This is a much too common method of preaching and one which I am very
   far from admiring as a custom. When some preachers get a text, the
   enquiry is not what Truth is in the passage, but what sense shall they
   thrust upon it. Full often the poor text is served as a cook treats a
   bird. It is first killed and then stuffed with any kind of fancies that
   the preacher may have chopped up ready to hand. By frankly stating that
   my first observations are not in the verse before us, I shall avoid
   sanctioning such methods of abusing God's Word. The thoughts to which I
   now give utterance have been suggested by many commentators and
   certainly, if they are not the legitimate offspring of the text, are
   closely connected with it.

   1. Of things which we may fairly bring to the text, let us notice first
   that our Lord may well be described as the Alpha and Omega in the sense
   of rank. He is Alpha, the First, the Chief, the Foremost, the
   First-Born of every creature, the Eternal God. Man by nature is not the
   first even among creatures, for angels excel him by far. Nor are angels
   the chief, for our glorious Lord infinitely transcends them. He who
   made is greater than they who are made. And He who sends is greater
   than those who are sent. Jesus Christ stands Alpha in honorable
   degree--no angel can vie with Him.

   "Being made so much better than the angels, as He has by inheritance
   obtained a more excellent name than they." "For unto which of the
   angels said He at any time, you are My Son, this day have I begotten
   you"? "And again, when He brings in the first begotten into the world,
   He says, And let all the angels of God worship Him." As for the Son, He
   has appointed Him heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds,
   but of the angels it is asked--"Are they not all ministering spirits,
   sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?"

   Alpha was frequently used by the Hebrews to signify the best, just as
   we are accustomed to use the letter A. We say of a ship, for instance,
   that it is "A-1." So Jesus Christ may truly be said to be the Alpha,
   the First in this sense. Call Him by whatever title Scripture has
   affixed to Him and He is the First in it. Is He a Prophet? Then all the
   Prophets follow at a humble distance, bearing witness of Him. Is He a
   Priest? Then He is the Great High Priest of our profession. He is the
   fulfillment of all that which the priest did but typically set forth.
   Let Him mount His Throne as King, then he is King of kings and Lord of
   lords.

   "His dominion is an everlasting dominion and His kingdom is from
   generation to generation." If He is the builder of His Church, He is
   the wise Master-Builder. If a Shepherd, He is the Great Shepherd who
   shall appear. If the cornerstone, He is the Chief Cornerstone--in fact,
   it matters not what title, or which character He bears, He is in all
   these respects the Alpha, as much surpassing all things that may be
   compared to Him--as the sun excels the stars, or as the sea exceeds the
   drops of the dew.

   But, Beloved, though our blessed Lord is thus Alpha--the First--He was
   once in His condescension made Omega, the Last. How shall I describe
   the mighty descent of the Great Savior? Down from the loftiness of His
   Father's Glory and from the grandeur of His own Divine estate, He
   stooped to become Man. There is a vast distance from the Alpha of
   Deity, down to that letter which stands for manhood. But to this He
   came, He was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of
   death. But this is not enough. He stoops lower than man. Yes, there is
   a verse in which He seems to put Himself on a level with the least of
   all creatures that have life--He says, "I am a worm and no man, a
   reproach of men and despised of the people."

   His Father forsook Him--the wrath of Heaven rolled over Him. He was so
   utterly crushed and broken that He was poured out like water and
   brought into the dust of death. Marshal the creatures of God in their
   order, in the dread day when Jesus hangs upon the Cross, and you must
   put Him for misery, for weakness, for shame as the Last, the Omega. How
   marvelous is this tremendous sweep of His humiliation, that from the
   highest Throne in Glory He should descend into the lowest depths of the
   tomb!

   Death brings the creature to its very lowest degradation and makes it
   as though it were nothing. Jesus died and as I see the incorruptible
   Body lying in Joseph's sepulcher, I can but marvel that ever the great
   Alpha should come so low as to yield up the ghost, being subjugated
   beneath the power of the last Adversary. Now, this is not in the text,
   but it may be fairly brought to it, I think, and without any
   compulsion, it may shake hands with the passage as being near of kin to
   it.

   2. We will make another observation which is not in the text, but which
   is still a very precious Truth of God, namely, that Jesus Christ is
   Alpha and Omega in the Book of Holy Scripture. Open the first page and
   a discerning eye will see Jesus Christ in Genesis. We know that the
   worlds were made by Him, and as we hear that majestic sentence, "Let Us
   make man in Our own Image after Our likeness," we at once discern Him
   as one of the sacred Trinity. We go onward to the Fall and at the gates
   of Eden the promise of the woman's Seed consoles us.

   We advance to the days of Noah and lo, we see the Savior typified in
   the ark, which bears a chosen company out of the old world of death
   into the new world of life. We walk with Abraham, as he sees Messiah's
   day. We dwell in the tents of Isaac and Jacob, feeding upon the
   gracious promise. We leave the venerable Israel talking of Shiloh on
   his deathbed. We see his seed brought out of Egypt and eating the Lamb
   of God's Passover. We reach the age of the Law and here the types crowd
   in upon us. But time permits not even a glance--suffice it to say, in
   brief, that we view the face of Jesus in almost every page and behold
   His Character painted to the life in nearly every Book.

   Prophets and kings, priests and preachers, all look one way--they all
   stand as the cherubs did, over the ark, desiring to look within and to
   read the mystery of God's great Propitiation. In the New Testament we
   find our Lord the one constant theme of every page. It is not an ingot
   here and there, or dust of gold thinly scattered--but here you stand
   upon a solid floor of gold--for the whole substance of the New
   Testament is Jesus crucified. What would be left of the Evangelists if
   you could remove Christ from them? What are Paul's Epistles if Jesus is
   taken away? The whole of the Pauline literature sinks in a moment if
   Jesus is withdrawn. And what have Peter, James, Jude, or John to write
   upon but the same Subject? Is it not Jesus still?

   Do not shut the Book too hastily, for see its closing sentence is
   bejeweled with the Redeemer's name. "Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even
   so, come, Lord Jesus. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you
   all. Amen." Brethren, we should always read Scripture in this light. We
   should consider the Word to be as a mirror into which Christ looks down
   from Heaven. And then, looking into it, we see His face reflected as in
   a glass--darkly, it is true, but still in such a way as to be a blessed
   preparation for seeing Him as we shall see Him face to face.

   This volume contains Jesus Christ's letters to us, perfumed by His
   love. These pages are the garments of our King and they all smell of
   myrrh and aloes and cassia. Scripture is the golden chariot in which
   Jesus rides and it is paved with love for the daughters of Jerusalem.
   The Scriptures are the swaddling bands of the holy Child, Jesus--unroll
   them and you find your Savior. Talk not to us of bodies of
   divinity--the only body of Divinity is the Person of Christ. As for
   theology, Christ is the true Theology--the incarnate Word of God. And
   if you can comprehend Him you have grasped all Truth. He is made unto
   us Wisdom--getting Him you have the Wisdom of the Scriptures. The
   quintessence of the Word of God is Christ. Distill the Book--reach its
   essential quality and you have discovered Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of
   God and the king of the Jews. He is the Alpha and Omega of Holy
   Scripture.

   3. Another fact is also sweetly true, although not, perhaps, in our
   text. Jesus Christ is the Alpha and Omega of the great Law of God.
   Brethren, the Law of God finds not a single letter in human nature to
   meet its demands. You and I are neither Alpha nor Omega to the Law, for
   we have broken it altogether. We have not even learned its first
   letter--"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart," and
   certain I am we know but very little of the next--"your neighbor as
   yourself." Even though renewed by Divine Grace, we are very slow to
   learn the holiness and spirituality of the Law.

   We are so staggered by the letter that we often miss its spirit
   altogether. But, Beloved, if you would see the Law fulfilled, look to
   the Person of our blessed Lord and Master. What love to God is there! O
   Brothers and Sisters, where shall we find anything to be compared to
   it? "The zeal of Your house has eaten Me up." "Know you not that I must
   be about My Father's business?" "My meat and My drink is to do the will
   of Him that sent Me." What love to man you find in Him. Talk not of the
   good Samaritan. Here is One who is better than he--the Samaritan did
   but give his wine and his oil and his two-pence. Jesus gives
   Himself--gives His heart's blood instead of wine and the anointing of
   the Holy Spirit instead of oil.

   While for food He gives His own Flesh and Blood for poor humanity to
   feed upon. Jesus loved in such a way that, as we said on Thursday
   night, all the love that ever gleamed in human bosoms, if it could be
   gathered together, would be but as a spark--while His great love to man
   would be as a flaming furnace heated seven times hotter than human
   imagination can conceive. Do not, beloved Friends, if you are in Christ
   Jesus, permit legal fears to distress you at the remembrance of your
   failures in obedience, as though they would destroy your soul.

   Seek after holiness, but never make holiness your trust. Seek after
   virtue--pant for it--but when you see your own imperfections, do not
   despair. Your saving righteousness is the righteousness of Christ--that
   in which God accepts you is Christ's perfect obedience. And we say of
   that again, in the words of the text, Jesus Christ is "Alpha and Omega,
   the Beginning and the End." There is not a precept which He has not
   fulfilled in its widest sense.

   As for the spirit of the Law, it breathes through His whole life of
   holiness and service. And as for the letter of the Law, He has carried
   it out to its extremity. The Commandment may be exceedingly broad, but
   not broader than the life of Christ. The Law may ask perfection, but it
   could not ask and could not have a greater perfection than is found in
   the Person of Him whose name is "The Lord our Righteousness."

   Brethren, these three matters I cannot affirm to be in the text, but
   can you blame me for bringing them forward? They stand in such a near
   connection with the exact sense of the passage that they cannot well be
   omitted. May the Lord bless them to you.

   II. Now we will take the text itself. And show what are THE TRUTHS
   WHICH WE ASSUREDLY BELIEVE TO BE IN IT

   1. Our Lord Jesus is Alpha and Omega in the great alphabet of being.
   Reckon existences in their order and you begin--"In the beginning was
   the Word." Proceed to the conclusion. Suppose that all the universe has
   melted like the hoarfrost of the morning--imagine that all worlds are
   extinguished as the sparks from the forge--conceive that, as a painted
   bubble passes away forever, so the whole creation has departed--What
   then? What is the Omega? Why assuredly Jesus Christ would still be "God
   over all, blessed forever. Amen."

   This we are quite sure is in the text, because the expression, "Alpha
   and Omega," is only used four times in Scripture. And on the second
   occasion we find it in the eleventh verse of the first chapter of the
   Book of the Revelation, in a connection which leads us to conclude that
   it must relate to the eternity and self-existence of our Lord. For the
   seventeenth verse explains the eleventh thus, "Fear not. I am the First
   and the Last: I am He that lives and was dead. And, behold, I am alive
   forevermore. Amen. And have the keys of Hell and of death."

   Those expressions manifestly refer to the eternity of Christ. To His
   self-existence, His having life in Himself. To the fact that death did
   by no means destroy His self-existence and that now since His
   resurrection, He lives forevermore, death has no more dominion over
   Him. Beloved, this is a great theme. When we begin to talk of the
   eternity of the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, we are overwhelmed by
   the glory of our subject. We need the eagle eyes and the eagle wings of
   John to see and soar into heavenly things. I read the other day a word
   by an ancient author and in the chapter upon the eternity of God I
   could not help noticing that there was hardly a word of more than one
   or two syllables--sure sign of the sublimity of the theme and of the
   inability of man to see more than its most simple outline.

   Will you go back six thousand years, when the world has newly emerged
   from darkness? Will you fly on, if you can, through all the ages of the
   geological periods, if such there were? Can you journey back millions
   of years? Can you, can you? Can you reach in spirit the time when as
   yet cherubim were not born, when the solemnity of silence had never
   been disturbed by song of seraph, when the unnavigated ether had never
   been stirred by the wings of angels? There is no world, no sun, no
   stars--space alone exists. Can you go further back till space is gone?
   You cannot. It is impossible. You are lost. For you can only think of
   space and time.

   But if you could by any stretch of imagination multiply the millions of
   years of which we dreamed just now, by another million times and that a
   million million million times more--and those on still as far as ever
   human arithmetic can go--yes, and beyond the possibilities of angelic
   computation, yet even then you have not begun to fathom the eternity in
   which God has dwelt alone. Certainly there was an age in which God was
   dwelling alone, not in solitude, for, as the fathers very rightly say,
   you must not use the term "solitude" in reference to God, since the
   three Divine Persons everlastingly delighted in each Other and so knew
   no solitude--yet there was and is an aloneness in our God, since He is
   before all things.

   Can your thoughts attain to that age of God in lonely Glory--in that
   eternity we know that Jesus was? He, whom though we have not seen His
   face, unceasingly we do adore, was then the eternal Son. The Word was
   God. Jesus was Alpha. To fly as far in the other direction--when the
   little river of time shall have been absorbed into the deep ocean of
   eternity, when all the world shall have departed even as the motes
   which dance in the sunbeam are seen no more when the sunbeam is
   gone--still Jesus shall be the Omega. It has been well observed by Dr.
   Gill, that no doubt the words, "Alpha and Omega," are
   comprehensive--they take in all the letters between.

   Certainly God comprehends all creatures. God is that without Whom there
   is nothing and in Whom are all things. Philo, the Jew, compares the
   great God to a tree and all creatures to the leaves and fruits, which
   are all in the tree. But the metaphor is not complete because you may
   remove fruit from the tree, but there can be no creature out of the
   power and will of God by which alone it can exist at all. If you remove
   the fruit from the tree, the tree has at least lost something. But if
   all creatures were destroyed, yet still the Lord would be as infinitely
   God as He is now. If the creatures were multiplied, God were no
   more--and if diminished, He were no less.

   The creatures may be likened to the waves and God to the great sea. The
   waves cannot exist apart from the sea, nor the creatures apart from
   God--but no earthly figure of the Divine can be complete. The waves are
   a portion of the sea, but the creatures are not God, nor do they
   contribute to His Essence or attributes. The sea would be diminished if
   the waves were gone. But if you could take all creatures away, God
   would be no less God nor less Infinite than He is now. In fact, the
   moment we begin to talk of infiniteness, we know nothing of diminishing
   or of increasing.

   O Brothers and Sisters, we must leave this subject in the silence of
   reverent humility, for my little boat is out of sight of shore already.
   I must not venture further on this great and wide sea--

   " Great God, how infinite are You! What worthless worms are we! Let the
   whole race of creatures bow, And pay their praise to You."

   A deaf and dumb man in one of the institutions in Paris was asked to
   write upon the slate his idea of God's eternity, and he wrote the
   following forcible lines: "It is duration without beginning or end.
   Existence without bounds or dimensions. Present without past or future.
   His eternity is youth without infancy or old age. Life without birth or
   death. Today without yesterday or tomorrow." "I am Alpha and Omega, the
   Beginning and the End, the First and the Last."

   2. Another Truth of God is most certainly in the text, namely, that
   Jesus Christ is Alpha and Omega in the alphabet of creating operations.
   Who was it that began to make? Not an angel, for the angel must first
   be made. Did matter create itself? Was there an effect without a cause?
   It is contrary to our experience and our reason to believe any such
   thing. The first cause stands first. And the first cause is God in the
   Divine Trinity, the Son being one Person of that Trinity. He is Alpha
   because His hand first of all winged angelic spirits and made His
   ministers a flame of fire.

   He first made all things out of nothing. He molded the clay from which
   man was made. All things were made by Him and without Him was not
   anything made that is made. As He alone began, so His power maintains
   the fabric of creation. All things consist by Him. Christ is the great
   iron pillar of the universe and the creatures twine about Him as the
   vine does about its prop. These things are not, they vanish like a
   dream if Jesus withdraws His power. He upholds all things by the word
   of His power. Brethren, there may be creations going on at the present
   moment--fresh globes may even now be fashioned between the hands of
   Omnipotence. If so, in every one of these Immanuel has a share.

   At this very moment new comets may be launched like thunderbolts upon
   their fiery way, but not without the Son of God. Human souls issue from
   the womb of creation every hour, but in their sustenance and sending
   forth, the mighty

   God is ever present. On, on, on, as the works of God shall be enlarged
   and extended, as the universe shall grow on every side, Christ shall be
   there still--His Father's delight, with whom He takes counsel--His
   equal, bearing with Him the name of Alpha and Omega. If this world
   shall be rolled up like a worn-out vesture, He shall roll it up. If the
   stars shall wither, it shall be at Jesus' bidding--if the sun shall be
   quenched, His breath shall blow out its coal. And if the moon shall be
   black as sackcloth of hair, Christ's hand shall extinguish the lamp. He
   shall do it all, even until the end shall come, for He is Omega as well
   as Alpha.

   3. So again, beyond a doubt, our text intends that Christ is Alpha and
   Omega in all Covenant transactions. Beloved, here is a theme worthy of
   many discourses from the most eminent Divines. The thoughts of God, the
   eternal Decrees, the inscrutable purposes of Jehovah--these are deep
   things--but we know this concerning them, that from first to last they
   all have a relation to Christ. Concerning our race and the elect out of
   it, the whole matter is encompassed in the Person of the Redeemer.

   Do you speak of election? "Mine elect in whom My soul delights," is
   Christ's name. We are chosen in Him from before the foundation of the
   world. Speak of our being predestinated to be sons--we are only made so
   in Him who stands as the elder Brother. Every separate individual of
   the chosen tribe stands only by virtue of an union which was
   established from of old between his person and the Person of the
   Redeemer. Search for the celestial fountain from which Divine streams
   of Divine Grace have flowed to us and you find Jesus Christ as the
   wellspring of Covenant love. If your eyes shall ever see the Covenant
   roll, if you shall ever be permitted in a future state to see the whole
   plan of redemption as it was mapped out in the chambers of eternity,
   you shall see the blood-red line of atoning sacrifice running along the
   margin of every page. And you shall see that from beginning to end one
   object was always aimed at--the glory of the Son of God.

   The Father begins with exalting Jesus and concludes with glorifying Him
   with the Glory which He had with Him before the world was. How I do
   love the Doctrines of Grace when they are taken in connection with
   Christ! Some people preach the Calvinistic points without Jesus. But
   what hard, dry, marrow preaching it is. Oh, dear Friends, the letter
   kills. It breeds in men a controversial, quarrelsome spirit. But when
   you preach the Doctrines of Grace as they are in Christ, as Dr. Hawker
   would have preached them! When you talk of them as Rutherford would
   have talked of them--oh, then a holy unction rests upon them and they
   become inestimably precious!

   And let every Believer remember he does not get these doctrines as he
   should get them unless he receives them in Christ. Everywhere the Lord
   Jesus is to be considered! Not as the Friend of a day, or our Savior
   only in His life on earth--but as the Lamb slain from before the
   foundation of the world--anointed Mediator set up from everlasting
   days. By faith I see Him as the eternal Son of God. I see Him standing
   in the purpose of the Father as the Covenant Head of the elect. I see
   Him in due time born of a woman, but I do not forget that His goings
   forth are of old from everlasting, and that before the daystar knew its
   place, His delights were with the sons of men.

   I see Him. He cries, "It is finished!" He bows His head. I do not,
   however, forget that He is not dead, but that when the world shall die
   and time shall conclude its reign, then He who is the Ancient of Days
   shall live and shall flourish in immortal youth. Alpha and Omega is
   Jesus Christ, then, in the eternal purposes and in the Covenant
   transactions of God.

   4. Jesus Christ is certainly Alpha and Omega in all salvation-work as
   it becomes apparent in act and deed. That this is the meaning of the
   text I am clear, because in the first passage where the Alpha and Omega
   occurs--namely, in the first chapter of the Revelation, eighth
   verse--you will see that all the works of salvation are ascribed to our
   Lord. Read the fifth verse, "Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness
   and the First-born of the dead and the Prince of the kings of the
   earth. Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own
   blood and has made us kings and priests unto God and His Father. To Him
   be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. Behold, He comes with
   clouds. And every eye shall see Him . . . I am Alpha and Omega."

   Now, we have here a summary of the great transactions of Saving Grace.
   You have here that He loved us--loved us before the world was, with an
   everlasting love. You have next, that He washed us from our sins in His
   own blood, in which you have His redemption and our consequent pardon,
   justification and sanctification, all of which come to us through Him.
   As for our glory, it is the result of His second advent. Therefore,
   "Behold, He comes," makes Him the Omega, as the, "Unto Him that loved
   us," made Him the Alpha. I need not repeat to you who know so well
   that, "There is none other name given under Heaven whereby we must be
   saved," and that in no part or portion of that salvation can any other
   name be admitted into partnership with His.

   Jesus must begin. Jesus must conclude. It is very striking to observe
   the commencement and the perfection of the spiritual life both laid at
   Jesus' door in the sixth verse of the twenty-first chapter--"I am Alpha
   and Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give unto him that is
   athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely." So then, if you
   have any thirst, you must come to Jesus Christ at the beginning to get
   the water of life. If you have been led to know your own emptiness--if
   you have received from His Spirit a hungering and a thirsting after
   righteousness, go not to the Law-- look not within. But come to the
   Alpha, drink and be satisfied.

   If, on the other hand, life is near its close--if you have been
   preserved in holiness, if you have been kept in righteousness--remember
   still to trust in the Omega. For these words follow, "He that overcomes
   shall inherit all things. And I will be his God, and he shall be My
   son." So that the inheriting of all things, the final overcoming of all
   spiritual foes comes through Jesus, just as did the first drink of
   living water. The first breath which heaves the spiritual lungs, the
   first light which greets the newly-opened eyes, comes from Jesus who is
   the Beginning. And the last shout of faith, the last shout of holy joy
   which shall admit the saints into the Paradise of God shall proceed
   from Him who is the End.

   Beloved, lay back upon Christ with all your strength--lean on Him with
   all your weight. He who began will finish--He never was Alpha yet
   without being Omega, too. Nothing shall change His purpose--neither
   Heaven, nor earth, nor Hell can afford a motive to turn Him from His
   way of love. "He is of one mind and who can turn Him? What His soul
   desires, even that He does."

   5. There is one more Truth of God which I conceive to be in the text.
   Jesus is Alpha and Omega not only in the individual salvation of every
   saint, but in the whole chain of the Church's history. Where shall I
   say that the Church began? Why, very speedily after there was a seed of
   the serpent, there was also a Seed of the woman. Surely the line of
   demarcation began hard by the gates of Eden. There we see Abel
   worshipping God in faith and Cain who was of the Wicked One and slew
   his brother.

   Do we not, thus early see in Abel's sacrifice the Lamb of God which
   takes away the sin of the world? Follow the Church through all her
   varied fortunes and you will find her always bearing the banner of the
   Lion of the Tribe of Judah at her forefront. No matter if she wanders
   about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, afflicted, tormented.
   Christ is still the Daystar of her comfort in her victories. His name
   is the loudest note--others may have slain their thousands, but the Son
   of David his ten thousands. No name wakes up the songsters of Israel
   like the name of Messiah, the Coming One. Nothing can move the feet of
   Zion's maidens so joyously in the sacred dance, nothing can make the
   daughters of Jerusalem smite their timbrels to a more joyful strain
   than this--"He comes--He comes who shall judge the world in
   righteousness and His people with Truth."

   Since the first advent of our Lord, has not the Church ever carried
   Jesus as her standard? Where will you find the Church without Christ?
   Jesus is yonder, among the snowy mountains of Switzerland, and His
   Church is with Him though her sons bear the names of heretics,
   schismatic, traitors, and worse. The Church of Rome has forgotten her
   first husband and played the harlot, committing fornication with the
   kings of the earth. But there was a faithful bride found for the Son
   among the Albigenses and the Waldenses, in whose homes Jesus dwelt.
   What was their battle cry? What was the note they chanted round the
   family hearth? What was the name they pressed to their bosom when they
   dared not sing for fear the foe should fall upon them? Was it not the
   name of Jesus?

   And when the dark ages passed away, what light do I see gleaming
   yonder? What does Luther proclaim? What does Calvin teach? It is the
   great name of Jesus which is their common theme! What do you say,
   Brothers and Sisters? Do you not join hands in solemn covenant, and say
   today, "His name shall endure forever! His name shall be remembered as
   long as the sun"? Do you not long for the time when, "all nations shall
   be blessed in Him, all people shall call Him blessed"? Surely you
   yourselves will help to fulfill the promise, "one generation shall
   praise His name to another and shall declare His mighty acts."

   But the end comes. Jehovah's banner will soon be furled--His sword
   shall be sheathed forever--the unsuffering kingdom shall be proclaimed.
   Swords shall be broken and spears shall be snapped. The sun shall look
   upon no battlefield, but shall greet the reign of universal peace. What
   then? Jesus' name shall then be known everywhere. Men shall talk of Him
   and think of Him by day and by night. Prayer, also, shall be made for
   Him continually, and daily shall He be praised. They who dwell in the
   wilderness shall bow before Him and His enemies shall lick the dust.
   Then comes the end. The Judgment Throne is set. The wicked are
   summoned. The righteous on the right hand have received their rewards--
   from whose hands? From the hands of the Omega who closes the chapter
   with His benediction, "Come, you blessed of My Father."

   There are the wicked. Hell is gaping for them. The tongues of flames
   lick up the multitudes as the lion devours his prey. Who is this that
   pronounces the thundering sentence, "Depart, you cursed"? It is the
   Omega. That same Face which once was bedewed with tears, is now
   brighter than the sun with flashes of lightning. The Voice which said,
   "Come to Me, you weary," now says, "Depart, you cursed." He began--He
   ends--the Alpha is the Omega. But it is an end without end. Long, long
   through the ages of eternity, amid Heaven's perfect inhabitants, His
   name shall be the perpetual theme of song.

   Down there, amidst the howls of the damned, they shall, against their
   will, declare His awful justice--they shall proclaim, in their eternal
   moans, the power of the pierced feet which shall tread them as clusters
   in the winepress until their blood flows forth to the horses' bridles
   in eternity. Heaven and earth and Hell shall adore Jesus as Alpha and
   Omega. Hallelujah, hallelujah! Jesus Christ reigns still as the Lord
   God omnipotent--Alpha and Omega! III. By your patience we will notice A
   FEW THINGS WHICH FLOW OUT OF THE TEXT.

   1. The first is this--Sinner, Saint, let Jesus be Alpha and Omega to
   you today in your trust. Poor Soul, are you willing to be saved? But do
   you say, "I have not this qualification, or that recommendation?" Ah,
   do not begin with yourself as the Alpha! Come to Jesus as you are and
   let Him be Alpha to you. Are you black with sin? Let Him wash you. Is
   your heart hard? Let Him soften it. Are you a dead good-for-nothing
   soul? Are you ragged and wretched? Are you lost, ruined and undone? Do
   not stop to write Alpha first. Do not stop to begin your own salvation.

   Sinner, remember there is no preparation wanted for Christ. Just lean
   upon Him wholly. Take Him to begin with-- no, let Him take you to begin
   with. Drop into His arms now, repose upon Him now. You will never get
   true salvation unless the first letter in it is Christ, for He is the
   Alpha. It will all have to begin over again if you begin with
   humblings, with repentings, with convictions, or with anything but
   Christ. It must all be done over again, I say, unless you begin with
   Jesus. There He is. His wounds are flowing, His heart is breaking, His
   soul is in anguish--there is the Alpha of your salvation.

   Look and live. "Look unto Me and be you saved all you ends of the
   earth." Child of God, let Him be the Omega of your salvation. If you
   have begun with Him, do not now confide in yourself. Shall I say to you
   as Paul did to the Gala-tians, "Having begun in the Spirit, are you now
   made perfect in the flesh?" "As you have received Christ Jesus the
   Lord, so walk in Him." Your first hope was through looking to Jesus,
   will you now look to your sanctifications, to your prayers, to your
   evidences, to your humbling, to your communing? Away with all these if
   they pretend to be the ground of your soul's comfort! Remember, child
   of God, that to the end of the chapter it must be as it was in the
   beginning--

   "None but Jesus, none but Jesus, Can do helpless sinners good." Up in
   that chamber of yours, with strong crying and tears you turned to God,
   and you never had any comfort till you looked to Jesus only. And in
   that other chamber where you shall lie dying with the dampness of death
   heavy on your brow--you shall have no comfort but Jesus only. You
   passed through the river of conviction and Jesus forbade your drowning.
   You shall go through the stream of death and He shall still keep your
   head above the waves. Alpha and Omega should Christ be to everyone of
   us as our trust this morning.

   2. Beloved, if we have trusted Him, let Him be Alpha and Omega in our
   love. Oh, give Him the first place in your love. Young Woman, may the
   Holy Spirit win your young heart for my Lord and Savior. Let the flower
   of your heart be offered to Him in the bud. O you, young Children, who
   are your mother's delight and your father's care--I pray that your
   first dawning days may be consecrated to the Savior. Let him be Alpha
   with you. I trust He is Alpha to some of us and has been so for years.
   We can use the words of the Psalmist, "I was cast upon You from the
   womb. You have been my God from my youth up. Truly I am Your servant
   and the son of Your handmaid."

   You who are growing old and gray-headed, let Him have the Omega of your
   love. As you lean upon your staff, bending downward as if to salute
   your grave, bear loving recollection of all the years of His patience
   and the days of His faith- fulness to you. Breathe the prayer, "Now,
   also, when I am old and gray-headed, O God, forsake me not." See to it
   that you forsake Him not, but clasp Him with an expiring grasp as the
   Omega of your soul's delight.

   3. But, surely, Brothers and Sisters, our Lord should be the Alpha and
   Omega of our life's end and aim. What is there worth living for but
   Christ? Oh, what is there in the whole earth that is worth a thought
   but Jesus? Well did an old writer say, "If God is the only Eternal,
   then all the rest is but a puff of smoke and shall I live to heap up
   puffs of smoke? And shall I toil and slave merely to aggrandize myself
   with smoky treasures that the wind of death shall dissipate forever?"
   No, Beloved let us live for eternal things and what is there of eternal
   things that can be chosen but our Lord? O let us give Him next year the
   Alpha of our labor.

   Let us begin the year by working in His vineyard! Toiling in His
   harvest field this year is almost over. There is another day or two
   left--let us serve Him till the year is ended, going forward with
   double haste because the days are now so few. "Lord teach us to number
   our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom." Let your time and
   your talents, your substance and your energies all be given to my
   Master, who is worthy to be your soul's Alpha and Omega.

   4. Lastly, Jesus crucified should be the Alpha and Omega of all our
   preaching and teaching. Woe to the man who makes anything else the main
   subject of his ministry. "God forbid that I should glory save in the
   Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me
   and I unto the world." Do not tell me you preach sound doctrine--you
   preach rotten doctrine, if you do not preach Christ--preach nothing up
   but Christ and nothing down but sin. Preach Christ! Lift Him up high on
   the pole of the Gospel, as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
   wilderness, and you will accomplish your life's end.

   Preach orthodoxy, or any form of doxy--if you have left out
   Christ--there is no manna from Heaven, no water from the rock, no
   refuge from the storm, no healing for the sick, no life for the dead.
   If you leave out Christ, you have left the sun out of the day and the
   moon out of the night. You have left the waters out of the sea and the
   floods out of the river. You have left the harvest out of the year, the
   soul out of the body--you have left joy out of Heaven--yes, you have
   robbed all of its All. There is no Gospel worth thinking of, much less
   worth proclaiming in Jehovah's name, if Jesus is forgotten. We must
   have Jesus, then, as Alpha and Omega in all our ministrations among the
   sons of men.

   And now I am very conscious, this morning, that I have only plowed the
   surface. I wish I could drive into the subsoil of such a glorious text
   as this, but I suppose that the plowman who can do this had need to
   have been caught up to the third Heaven and even then would fail. Who
   shall know anything of God but those who have seen Him and have beheld
   His Glory in Heaven? As for us, our eyes are lacking. We have Jesus
   among us, but we perceive not His excellent Glory. Like Peter and James
   and John, we sleep while Jesus is transfigured.

   The theme is far too high for me. Who can know God but God? Who can
   reveal Him but the Only-Begotten? And who can comprehend the fullness
   of Him who is the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last? It is
   enough if we have a saving acquaintance with the Redeemer, enough for
   our peace and joy, but gracious Lord, by Your Grace, teach us more.
   Amen.
