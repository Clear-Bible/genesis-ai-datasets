ONLY A BRANCH


   "I am the vine, ye are the branches."--John 15.5




   "Tis only a little Branch,

   A thing so fragile and weak,

   But that little Branch hath a message true

   To give, could it only speak.


   "I'm only a little Branch,

   I live by a life not mine,

   For the sap that flows through my tendrils small

   Is the life-blood of the Vine.


   "No power indeed have I

   The fruit of myself to bear,

   But since I'm part of the living Vine,

   Its fruitfulness I share.


   "Dost thou ask how I abide?

   How this life I can maintain?--

   I am bound to the Vine by life's strong band,

   And I only need remain.


   "Where first my life was given,

   In the spot where I am set,

   Upborne and upheld as the days go by,

   By the stem which bears me yet.


   "I fear not the days to come,

   I dwell not upon the past,

   As moment by moment I draw a life,

   Which for evermore shall last.


   "I bask in the sun's bright beams,

   Which with sweetness fills my fruit,

   Yet I own not the clusters hanging there,

   For they all come from the root."


   A life which is not my own,

   But another's life in me:

   This, this is the message the Branch would speak,

   A message to thee and me.


   Oh, struggle not to "abide,"

   Nor labor to "bring forth fruit,"

   But let Jesus unite thee to Himself,

   As the Vine Branch to the root.


   So simple, so deep, so strong

   That union with Him shall be:

   His life shall forever replace thine own,

   And His love shall flow through thee.


   For His Spirit's fruit is love,

   And love shall thy life become,

   And for evermore on His heart of love

   Thy spirit shall have her home.

PREFACE

   I have felt drawn to try to write what young Christians might easily
   apprehend, as a help to them to take up that position in which the
   Christian life must be a success. It is as if there is not one of the
   principal temptations and failures of the Christian life that is not
   met here. The nearness, the all-sufficiency, the faithfulness of the
   Lord Jesus, the naturalness, the fruitfulness of a life of faith, are
   so revealed, that it is as if one could with confidence say, Let the
   parable enter into the heart, and all will be right.

   May the blessed Lord give the blessing. May He teach us to study the
   mystery of the Vine in the spirit of worship, waiting for God's own
   teaching.

THE VINE

   I am the True Vine--John 15.1


   All earthly things are the shadows of heavenly realities--the
   expression, in created, visible forms, of the invisible glory of God.
   The Life and the Truth are in Heaven; on earth we have figures and
   shadows of the heavenly truths. When Jesus says: "I am the true Vine,"
   He tells us that all the vines of earth are pictures and emblems of
   Himself. He is the divine reality, of which they are the created
   expression. They all point to Him, and preach Him, and reveal Him. If
   you would know Jesus, study the vine.

   How many eyes have gazed on and admired a great vine with its beautiful
   fruit. Come and gaze on the heavenly Vine till your eye turns from all
   else to admire Him. How many, in a sunny clime, sit and rest under the
   shadow of a vine. Come and be still under the shadow of the true Vine,
   and rest under it from the heat of the day. What countless numbers
   rejoice in the fruit of the vine! Come, and take, and eat of the
   heavenly fruit of the true Vine, and let your soul say: "I sat under
   His shadow with great delight, and His fruit was sweet to my taste."

   I am the true Vine.--This is a heavenly mystery. The earthly vine can
   teach you much about this Vine of Heaven. Many interesting and
   beautiful points of comparison suggest themselves, and help us to get
   conceptions of what Christ meant. But such thoughts do not teach us to
   know what the heavenly Vine really is, in its cooling shade, and its
   life-giving fruit. The experience of this is part of the hidden
   mystery, which none but Jesus Himself, by His Holy Spirit, can unfold
   and impart.

   I am the true Vine.--The vine is the living Lord, who Himself speaks,
   and gives, and works all that He has for us. If you would know the
   meaning and power of that word, do not think to find it by thought or
   study; these may help to show you what you must get from Him to awaken
   desire and hope and prayer, but they cannot show you the Vine. Jesus
   alone can reveal Himself. He gives His Holy Spirit to open the eyes to
   gaze upon Himself, to open the heart to receive Himself. He must
   Himself speak the word to you and me.

   I am the true Vine.--And what am I to do, if I want the mystery, in all
   its heavenly beauty and blessing, opened up to me? With what you
   already know of the parable, bow down and be still, worship and wait,
   until the divine Word enters your heart, and you feel His holy presence
   with you, and in you. The overshadowing of His holy love will give you
   the perfect calm and rest of knowing that the Vine will do all.

   I am the true Vine.--He who speaks is God, in His infinite power able
   to enter into us. He is man, one with us. He is the crucified One, who
   won a perfect righteousness and a divine life for us through His death.
   He is the glorified One, who from the throne gives His Spirit to make
   His presence real and true. He speaks--oh, listen, not to His words
   only, but to Himself, as He whispers secretly day by day: "I am the
   true Vine! All that the Vine can ever be to its branch, "I will be to
   you."

   Holy Lord Jesus, the heavenly Vine of God's own planting, I beseech
   Thee, reveal Thyself to my soul. Let the Holy Spirit, not only in
   thought, but in experience, give me to know all that Thou, the Son of
   God, art to me as the true Vine.

THE HUSBANDMAN

   And My Father is the Husbandman--John 15.1


   A vine must have a husbandman to plant and watch over it, to receive
   and rejoice in its fruit. Jesus says: "My Father is the husbandman." He
   was "the vine of God's planting." All He was and did, He owed to the
   Father; in all He only sought the Father's will and glory. He had
   become man to show us what a creature ought to be to its Creator. He
   took our place, and the spirit of His life before the Father was ever
   what He seeks to make ours: "Of him, and through him, and to him are
   all things." He became the true Vine, that we might be true branches.
   Both in regard to Christ and ourselves the words teach us the two
   lessons of absolute dependence and perfect confidence.

   My Father is the Husbandman.--Christ ever lived in the spirit of what
   He once said: "The Son can do nothing of himself." As dependent as a
   vine is on a husbandman for the place where it is to grow, for its
   fencing in and watering and pruning. Christ felt Himself entirely
   dependent on the Father every day for the wisdom and the strength to do
   the Father's will. As He said in the previous chapter (14:10): "The
   words that I say unto you, I speak not from Myself; but the Father
   abiding in Me doeth his works." This absolute dependence had as its
   blessed counterpart the most blessed confidence that He had nothing to
   fear: the Father could not disappoint Him. With such a Husbandman as
   His Father, He could enter death and the grave. He could trust God to
   raise Him up. All that Christ is and has, He has, not in Himself, but
   from the Father.

   My Father is the Husbandman.--That is as blessedly true for us as for
   Christ. Christ is about to teach His disciples about their being
   branches. Before He ever uses the word, or speaks at all of abiding in
   Him or bearing fruit, He turns their eyes heavenward to the Father
   watching over them, and working all in them. At the very root of all
   Christian life lies the thought that God is to do all, that our work is
   to give and leave ourselves in His hands, in the confession of utter
   helplessness and dependence, in the assured confidence that He gives
   all we need. The great lack of the Christian life is that, even where
   we trust Christ, we leave God out of the count. Christ came to bring us
   to God. Christ lived the life of a man exactly as we have to live it.
   Christ the Vine points to God the Husbandman. As He trusted God, let us
   trust God, that everything we ought to be and have, as those who belong
   to the Vine, will be given us from above.

   Isaiah said: "A vineyard of red wine; I the Lord do keep it, I will
   water it every moment; lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day."
   Ere we begin to think of fruit or branches, let us have our heart
   filled with the faith: as glorious as the Vine, is the Husbandman. As
   high and holy as is our calling, so mighty and loving is the God who
   will work it all. As surely as the Husbandman made the Vine what it was
   to be, will He make each branch what it is to be. Our Father is our
   Husbandman, the Surety for our growth and fruit.

   Blessed Father, we are Thy husbandry. Oh, that Thou mayest have honor
   of the work of Thy hands! O my Father, I desire to open my heart to the
   joy of this wondrous truth: My Father is the Husbandman. Teach me to
   know and trust Thee, and to see that the same deep interest with which
   Thou caredst for and delightedst in the Vine, extends to every branch,
   to me too.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE BRANCH

   Every Branch in me that Beareth Not Fruit, He taketh It away--John 15.2


   Here we have one of the chief words of the parable--branch. A vine
   needs branches: without branches it can do nothing, can bear no fruit.
   As important as it is to know about the Vine, and the Husbandman, it is
   to realize what the branch is. Before we listen to what Christ has to
   say about it, let us first of all take in what a branch is, and what it
   teaches us of our life in Christ. A branch is simply a bit of wood,
   brought forth by the vine for the one purpose of serving it in bearing
   its fruit. It is of the very same nature as the vine, and has one life
   and one spirit with it. Just think a moment of the lessons this
   suggests.

   There is the lesson of entire consecration. The branch has but one
   object for which it exists, one purpose to which it is entirely given
   up. That is, to bear the fruit the vine wishes to bring forth. And so
   the believer has but one reason for his being a branch--but one reason
   for his existence on earth --that the heavenly Vine may through him
   bring forth His fruit. Happy the soul that knows this, that has
   consented to it, and that says, I have been redeemed and I live for one
   thing--as exclusively as the natural branch exists only to bring forth
   fruit, I too; as exclusively as the heavenly Vine exists to bring forth
   fruit, I too. As I have been planted by God into Christ, I have wholly
   given myself to bear the fruit the Vine desires to bring forth.

   There is the lesson of perfect conformity. The branch is exactly like
   the vine in every aspect--the same nature, the same life, the same
   place, the same work. In all this they are inseparably one. And so the
   believer needs to know that he is partaker of the divine nature, and
   has the very nature and spirit of Christ in him, and that his one
   calling is to yield himself to a perfect conformity to Christ. The
   branch is a perfect likeness of the vine; the only difference is, the
   one is great and strong, and the source of strength, the other little
   and feeble, ever needing and receiving strength. Even so the believer
   is, and is to be, the perfect likeness of Christ.

   There is the lesson of absolute dependence. The vine has its stores of
   life and sap and strength, not for itself, but for the branches. The
   branches are and have nothing but what the vine provides and imparts.
   The believer is called to, and it is his highest blessedness to enter
   upon, a life of entire and unceasing dependence upon Christ. Day and
   night, every moment, Christ is to work in him all he needs.

   And then the lesson of undoubting confidence. The branch has no cure;
   the vine provides all; it has but to yield itself and receive. It is
   the sight of this truth that leads to the blessed rest of faith, the
   true secret of growth and strength: "I can do all things through Christ
   which strengtheneth me."

   What a life would come to us if we only consented to be branches! Dear
   child of God, learn the lesson. You have but one thing to do: Only be a
   branch--nothing more, nothing less! Just be a branch; Christ will be
   the Vine that gives all. And the Husbandman, the mighty God, who made
   the Vine what it is, will as surely make the branch what it ought to
   be.

   Lord Jesus, I pray Thee, reveal to me the heavenly mystery of the
   branch, in its living union with the Vine, in its claim on all its
   fullness. And let Thy all-sufficiency, holding and filling Thy
   branches, lead me to the rest of faith that knows that Thou workest
   all.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE FRUIT

   Every Branch in me That Beareth Not Fruit, He Taketh It Away--John 15.2


   Fruit.--This is the next great word we have: the Vine, the Husbandman,
   the branch, the fruit. What has our Lord to say to us of fruit? Simply
   this--that fruit is the one thing the branch is for, and that if it
   bear not fruit, the husbandman takes it away. The vine is the glory of
   the husbandman; the branch is the glory of the vine; the fruit is the
   glory of the branch; if the branch bring not forth fruit, there is no
   glory or worth in it; it is an offense and a hindrance; the husbandman
   takes it away. The one reason for the existence of a branch, the one
   mark of being a true branch of the heavenly Vine, the one condition of
   being allowed by the divine Husbandman to share the life the Vine
   is--bearing fruit.

   And what is fruit? Something that the branch bears, not for itself, but
   for its owner; something that is to be gathered, and taken away. The
   branch does indeed receive it from the vine sap for its own life, by
   which it grows thicker and stronger. But this supply for its own
   maintenance is entirely subordinate to its fulfillment of the purpose
   of its existence--bearing fruit. It is because Christians do not
   understand or accept of this truth, that they so fail in their efforts
   and prayers to live the branch life. They often desire it very
   earnestly; they read and meditate and pray, and yet they fail, they
   wonder why? The reason is very simple: they do not know that
   fruit-bearing is the one thing they have been saved for. Just as
   entirely as Christ became the true Vine with the one object, you have
   been made a branch too, with the one object of bearing fruit for the
   salvation of men. The Vine and the branch are equally under the
   unchangeable law of fruit-bearing as the one reason of their being.
   Christ and the believer, the heavenly Vine and the branch, have equally
   their place in the world exclusively for one purpose, to carry God's
   saving love to men. Hence the solemn word: Every branch that beareth
   not fruit, He taketh it away.

   Let us specially beware of one great mistake. Many Christians think
   their own salvation is the first thing; their temporal life and
   prosperity, with the care of their family, the second; and what of time
   and interest is left may be devoted to fruit-bearing, to the saving of
   men. No wonder that in most cases very little time or interest can be
   found. No, Christian, the one object with which you have been made a
   member of Christ's Body is that the Head may have you to carry out His
   saving work. The one object God had in making you a branch is that
   Christ may through you bring life to men. Your personal salvation, your
   business and care for your family, are entirely subordinate to this.
   Your first aim in life, your first aim every day, should be to know how
   Christ desires to carry out His purpose in you.

   Let us begin to think as God thinks. Let us accept Christ's teaching
   and respond to it. The one object of my being a branch, the one mark of
   my being a true branch, the one condition of my abiding and growing
   strong, is that I bear the fruit of the heavenly Vine for dying men to
   eat and live. And the one thing of which I can have the most perfect
   assurance is that, with Christ as my Vine, and the Father as my
   Husbandman, I can indeed be a fruitful branch.

   Our Father, Thou comest seeking fruit. Teach us, we pray Thee, to
   realize how truly this is the one object of our existence, and of our
   union to Christ. Make it the one desire of our hearts to be branches,
   so filled with the Spirit of the Vine, as to bring forth fruit
   abundantly.
     __________________________________________________________________

MORE FRUIT

   And Every Branch That Beareth Fruit, He Cleanseth, That it May Bear
   More Fruit--John 15.2


   The thought of fruit is so prominent in the eye of Him who sees things
   as they are, fruit is so truly the one thing God has set His heart
   upon, that our Lord, after having said that the branch that bears no
   fruit is taken away, at once adds: and where there is fruit, the one
   desire of the Husbandman is more fruit. As the gift of His grace, as
   the token of spiritual vigor, as the showing forth of the glory of God
   and of Christ, as the only way for satisfying the need of the world,
   God longs and fits for, more fruit.

   More Fruit--This is a very searching word. As churches and individuals
   we are in danger of nothing so much as self-contentment. The secret
   spirit of Laodicea--we are rich and increased in goods, and have need
   of nothing--may prevail where it is not suspected. The divine
   warning--poor and wretched and miserable--finds little response just
   where it is most needed.

   Let us not rest content with the thought that we are taking an equal
   share with others in the work that is being done, or that men are
   satisfied with our efforts in Christ's service, or even point to us as
   examples. Let our only desire be to know whether we are bearing all the
   fruit Christ is willing to give through us as living branches, in close
   and living union with Himself, whether we are satisfying the loving
   heart of the great Husbandman, our Father in Heaven, in His desire for
   more fruit.

   More Fruit--The word comes with divine authority to search and test our
   life: the true disciple will heartily surrender himself to its holy
   light, and will earnestly ask that God Himself may show what there may
   be lacking in the measure or the character of the fruit he bears. Do
   let us believe that the Word is meant to lead us on to a fuller
   experience of the Father's purpose of love, of Christ's fullness, and
   of the wonderful privilege of bearing much fruit in the salvation of
   men.

   More Fruit--The word is a most encouraging one. Let us listen to it. It
   is just to the branch that is bearing fruit that the message comes:
   more fruit. God does not demand this as Pharaoh the task-master, or as
   Moses the lawgiver, without providing the means. He comes as a Father,
   who gives what He asks, and works what He commands. He comes to us as
   the living branches of the living Vine, and offers to work the more
   fruit in us, if we but yield ourselves into His hands. Shall we not
   admit the claim, accept the offer, and look to Him to work it in us?

   "That it may bear more fruit": do let us believe that as the owner of a
   vine does everything to make the fruitage as rich and large as
   possible, the divine Husbandman will do all that is needed to make us
   bear more fruit. All He asks is, that we set our heart's desire on it,
   entrust ourselves to His working and care, and joyfully look to Him to
   do His perfect work in us. God has set His heart on more fruit; Christ
   waits to work it in us; let us joyfully look up to our divine
   Husbandman and our heavenly Vine, to ensure our bearing more fruit.

   Our Father which art in Heaven, Thou art the heavenly Husbandman. And
   Christ is the heavenly Vine. And I am a heavenly branch, partaker of
   His heavenly life, to bear His heavenly fruit. Father, let the power of
   His life so fill me, that I may ever bear more fruit, to the glory of
   Thy name.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE CLEANSING

   Every Branch That Beareth Fruit, He Cleanseth It, That It May Bear More
   Fruit--John 15.2


   There are two remarkable things about the vine. There is not a plant of
   which the fruit has so much spirit in it, of which spirit can be so
   abundantly distilled as the vine. And there is not a plant which so
   soon runs into wild wood, that hinders its fruit, and therefore needs
   the most merciless pruning. I look out of my window here on large
   vineyards: the chief care of the vinedresser is the pruning. You may
   have a trellis vine rooting so deep in good soil that it needs neither
   digging, nor manuring, nor watering: pruning it cannot dispense with,
   if it is to bear good fruit. Some tree needs occasional pruning; others
   bear perfect fruit without any: the vine must have it. And so our Lord
   tells us, here at the very outset of the parable, that the one work the
   Father does to the branch that bears fruit is: He cleanseth it, that it
   may bear more fruit.

   Consider a moment what this pruning or cleansing is. It is not the
   removal of weeds or thorns, or anything from without that may hinder
   the growth. No; it is the cutting off of the long shoots of the
   previous year, the removal of something that comes from within, that
   has been produced by the life of the vine itself. It is the removal of
   something that is a proof of the vigor of its life; the more vigorous
   the growth has been, the greater the need for the pruning. It is the
   honest, healthy wood of the vine that has to be cut away. And why?
   Because it would consume too much of the sap to fill all the long
   shoots of last year's growth: the sap must be saved up and used for
   fruit alone. The branches, sometimes eight and ten feet long, are cut
   down close to the stem, and nothing is left but just one or two inches
   of wood, enough to bear the grapes. It is when everything that is not
   needful for fruit-bearing has been relentlessly cut down, and just as
   little of the branches as possible has been left, that full, rich fruit
   may be expected.

   What a solemn, precious lesson! It is not to sin only that the
   cleansing of the Husbandman here refers. It is to our own religious
   activity, as it is developed in the very act of bearing fruit. It is
   this that must be cut down and cleansed away. We have, in working for
   God, to use our natural gifts of wisdom, or eloquence, or influence, or
   zeal. And yet they are ever in danger of being unduly developed, and
   then trusted in. And so, after each season of work, God has to bring us
   to the end of ourselves, to the consciousness of the helplessness and
   the danger of all that is of man, to feel that we are nothing. All that
   is to be left of us is just enough to receive the power of the
   life-giving sap of the Holy Spirit. What is of man must be reduced to
   its very lowest measure. All that is inconsistent with the most entire
   devotion to Christ's service must be removed. The more perfect the
   cleansing and cutting away of all that is of self, the less of surface
   over which the Holy Spirit is to be spread, so much the more intense
   can be the concentration of our whole being, to be entirely at the
   disposal of the Spirit. This is the true circumcision of the heart, the
   circumcision of Christ. This is the true crucifixion with Christ,
   bearing about the dying of the Lord Jesus in the body.

   Blessed cleansing, God's own cleansing! How we may rejoice in the
   assurance that we shall bring forth more fruit.

   O our holy Husbandman, cleanse and cut away all that there is in us
   that would make a fair show, or could become a source of
   self-confidence and glorying. Lord, keep us very low, that no flesh may
   glory in Thy presence. We do trust Thee to do Thy work.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE PRUNING KNIFE

   Already Ye Are Clean Because of the Word I Have Spoken Unto You--John
   15.3


   What is the pruning knife of this heavenly Husbandman? It is often said
   to be affliction. By no means in the first place. How would it then
   fare with many who have long seasons free from adversity; or with some
   on whom God appears to shower down kindness all their life long? No; it
   is the Word of God that is the knife, shaper than any two-edged sword,
   that pierces even to the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit, and
   is quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart. It is only
   when affliction leads to this discipline of the Word that it becomes a
   blessing; the lack of this heart-cleansing through the Word is the
   reason why affliction is so often unsanctified. Not even Paul's thorn
   in the flesh could become a blessing until Christ's Word--"My strength
   is made perfect in weakness"--had made him see the danger of
   self-exaltation, and made him willing to rejoice in infirmities.

   The Word of God's pruning knife. Jesus says: "Ye are already clean,
   because of the word I have spoken unto you." How searchingly that word
   had been spoken by Him, out of whose mouth there went a sharp two-edged
   sword, as he had taught them! "Except a man deny himself, lose his
   life, forsake all, hate father and mother, he cannot be My disciple, he
   is not worthy of Me"; or as He humbled their pride, or reproved their
   lack of love, or foretold their all forsaking Him. From the opening of
   His ministry in the Sermon on the Mount to His words of warning in the
   last night, His Word had tried and cleansed them. He had discovered and
   condemned all there was of self; they were now emptied and cleansed,
   ready for the incoming of the Holy Spirit.

   It is as the soul gives up its own thoughts, and men's thoughts of what
   is religion, and yields itself heartily, humbly, patiently, to the
   teaching of the Word by the Spirit, that the Father will do His blessed
   work of pruning and cleansing away all of nature and self that mixes
   with our work and hinders His Spirit. Let those who would know all the
   Husbandman can do for them, all the Vine can bring forth through them,
   seek earnestly to yield themselves heartily to the blessed cleansing
   through the Word. Let them, in their study of the Word, receive it as a
   hammer that breaks and opens up, as a fire that melts and refines, as a
   sword that lays bare and slays all that is of the flesh. The word of
   conviction will prepare for the word of comfort and of hope, and the
   Father will cleanse them through the Word.

   All ye who are branches of the true Vine, each time you read or hear
   the Word, wait first of all on Him to use it for His cleansing of the
   branch. Set your heart upon His desire for more fruit. Trust Him as
   Husbandman to work it. Yield yourselves in simple childlike surrender
   to the cleansing work of His Word and Spirit, and you may count upon it
   that His purpose will be fulfilled in you.

   Father, I pray Thee, cleanse me through Thy Word. Let it search out and
   bring to light all that is of self and the flesh in my religion. Let it
   cut away every root of self-confidence, that the Vine may find me
   wholly free to receive His life and Spirit. O my holy Husbandman, I
   trust Thee to care for the branch as much as for the Vine. Thou only
   art my hope.

   Abide in Me, and I in You--John 15.4


   When a new graft is placed in a vine and it abides there, there is a
   twofold process that takes place. The first is in the wood. The graft
   shoots its little roots and fibers down into the stem, and the stem
   grows up into the graft, and what has been called the structural union
   is effected. The graft abides and becomes one with the vine, and even
   though the vine were to die, would still be one wood with it. Then
   there is the second process, in which the sap of the vine enters the
   new structure, and uses it as a passage through which sap can flow up
   to show itself in young shoots and leaves and fruit. Here is the vital
   union. Into the graft which abides in the stock, the stock enters with
   sap to abide in it.

   When our Lord says: "Abide in me, and I in you," He points to something
   analogous to this. "Abide in me": that refers more to that which we
   have to do. We have to trust and obey, to detach ourselves from all
   else, to reach out after Him and cling to Him, to sink ourselves into
   Him. As we do this, through the grace He gives, a character is formed,
   and a heart prepared for the fuller experience: "I in you," God
   strengthens us with might by the Spirit in the inner man, and Christ
   dwells in the heart by faith.

   Many believers pray and long very earnestly for the filling of the
   Spirit and the indwelling of Christ, and wonder that they do not make
   more progress. The reason is often this, the "I in you" cannot come
   because the "abide in me" is not maintained. "There is one body and one
   spirit"; before the Spirit can fill, there must be a body prepared. The
   graft must have grown into the stem, and be abiding in it before the
   sap can flow through to bring forth fruit. It is as in lowly obedience
   we follow Christ, even in external things, denying ourselves, forsaking
   the world, and even in the body seeking to be conformable to Him, as we
   thus seek to abide in Him, that we shall be able to receive and enjoy
   the "I in you." The work enjoined on us: "Abide in me," will prepare us
   for the work undertaken by Him: "I in you."

   In--The two parts of the injunction have their unity in that central
   deep-meaning word "in." There is no deeper word in Scripture. God is in
   all. God dwells in Christ. Christ lives in God. We are in Christ.
   Christ is in us: our life taken up into His; His life received into
   ours; in a divine reality that words cannot express, we are in Him and
   He in us. And the words, "Abide in me and I in you," just tell us to
   believe it, this divine mystery, and to count upon our God the
   Husbandman, and Christ the Vine, to make it divinely true. No thinking
   or teaching or praying can grasp it; it is a divine mystery of love. As
   little as we can effect the union can we understand it. Let us just
   look upon this infinite, divine, omnipotent Vine loving us, holding us,
   working in us. Let us in the faith of His working abide and rest in
   Him, ever turning heart and hope to Him alone. And let us count upon
   Him to fulfill in us the mystery: "Ye in me, and I in you."

   Blessed Lord, Thou dost bid me abide in Thee. How can I, Lord, except
   Thou show Thyself to me, waiting to receive and welcome and keep me? I
   pray Thee show me how Thou as Vine undertaketh to do all. To be
   occupied with Thee is to abide in Thee. Here I am, Lord, a branch,
   cleansed and abiding--resting in Thee, and awaiting the inflow of Thy
   life and grace.

EXCEPT YE ABIDE

   As the Branch Cannot Bear Fruit of Itself, Except It Abide In the Vine;
   No More Can Ye, Except Ye Abide in Me--John 15.4


   We know the meaning of the word except. It expresses some indispensable
   condition, some inevitable law. "The branch cannot bear fruit of
   itself, except it abide in the vine. No more can ye, except ye abide in
   me." There is but one way for the branch to bear fruit, there is no
   other possibility, it must abide in unbroken communion with the vine.
   Not of itself, but only of the vine, does the fruit come. Christ had
   already said: "Abide in me"; in nature the branch teaches us the lesson
   so clearly; it is such a wonderful privilege to be called and allowed
   to abide in the heavenly Vine; one might have thought it needless to
   add these words of warning. But no--Christ knows so well what a
   renunciation of self is implied in this: "Abide in me"; how strong and
   universal the tendency would be to seek to bear fruit by our own
   efforts; how difficult it would be to get us to believe that actual,
   continuous abiding in Him is an absolute necessity! He insists upon the
   truth: Not of itself can the branch bear fruit; except it abide, it
   cannot bear fruit. "No more can ye, except ye abide in me."

   But must this be taken literally? Must I, as exclusively, and
   manifestly, and unceasingly, and absolutely, as the branch abides in
   the vine, be equally given up to find my whole life in Christ alone? I
   must indeed. The except ye abide is as universal as the except it
   abide. The no more can ye admits of no exception or modification. If I
   am to be a true branch, if I am to bear fruit, if I am to be what
   Christ as Vine wants me to be, my whole existence must be as
   exclusively devoted to abiding in Him, as that of the natural branch is
   to abiding in its vine.

   Let me learn the lesson. Abiding is to be an act of the will and the
   whole heart. Just as there are degrees in seeking and serving God, "not
   with a perfect heart," or "with the whole heart," so there may be
   degrees in abiding. In regeneration the divine life enters us, but does
   not all at once master and fill our whole being. This comes as matter
   of command and obedience. There is unspeakable danger of our not giving
   ourselves with our whole heart to abide. There is unspeakable danger of
   our giving ourselves to work for God, and to bear fruit, with but
   little of the true abiding, the wholehearted losing of ourselves in
   Christ and His life. There is unspeakable danger of much work with but
   little fruit, for lack of this one thing needful. We must allow the
   words, "not of itself," "except it abide," to do their work of
   searching and exposing, of pruning and cleansing, all that there is of
   self-will and self-confidence in our life; this will deliver us from
   this great evil, and so prepare us for His teaching, giving the full
   meaning of the word in us: "Abide in me, and I in you."

   Our blessed Lord desires to call us away from ourselves and our own
   strength, to Himself and His strength. Let us accept the warning, and
   turn with great fear and self-distrust to Him to do His work. "Our life
   is hid with Christ in God!" That life is a heavenly mystery, hid from
   the wise even among Christians, and revealed unto babes. The childlike
   spirit learns that life is given from Heaven every day and every moment
   to the soul that accepts the teaching: "not of itself," "except it
   abide," and seeks its all in the Vine. Abiding in the Vine then comes
   to be nothing more nor less than the restful surrender of the soul to
   let Christ have all and work all, as completely as in nature the branch
   knows and seeks nothing but the vine.

   Abide in Me. I have heard, my Lord, that with every command, Thou also
   givest the power to obey. With Thy "rise and walk," the lame man
   leaped, I accept Thy word, "Abide in me," as a word of power, that
   gives power, and even now I say, Yea, Lord, I will, I do abide in Thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE VINE

   I am The Vine, Ye Are The Branches--John 15.5


   In the previous verse Christ had just said: "Abide in me." He had then
   announced the great unalterable law of all branch-life, on earth or in
   Heaven: "not of itself"; "except it abide." In the opening words of the
   parable He had already spoken: "I am the vine." He now repeats the
   words. He would have us understand--note well the lesson, simple as it
   appears, it is the key of the abiding life--that the only way to obey
   the command, "Abide in me," is to have eye and heart fixed upon
   Himself. "Abide in me...I am the true vine." Yea, study this holy
   mystery until you see Christ as the true Vine, bearing, strengthening,
   supplying, inspiring all His branches, being and doing in each branch
   all it needs, and the abiding will come of itself. Yes, gaze upon Him
   as the true Vine, until you feel what a heavenly Mystery it is, and are
   compelled to ask the Father to reveal it to you by His Holy Spirit. He
   to whom God reveals the glory of the true Vine, he who sees what Jesus
   is and waits to do every moment, he cannot but abide. The vision of
   Christ is an irresistible attraction; it draws and holds us like a
   magnet. Listen ever to the living Christ still speaking to you, and
   waiting to show you the meaning and power of His Word: "I am the vine."

   How much weary labor there has been in striving to understand what
   abiding is, how much fruitless effort in trying to attain it! Why was
   this? Because the attention was turned to the abiding as a work we have
   to do, instead of the living Christ, in whom we were to be kept
   abiding, who Himself was to hold and keep us. we thought of abiding as
   a continual strain and effort--we forget that it means rest from effort
   to one who has found the place of his abode. Do notice how Christ said,
   "Abide in Me; I am the Vine that brings forth, and holds, and
   strengthens, and makes fruitful the branches. Abide in Me, rest in Me,
   and let Me do My work. I am the true Vine, all I am, and speak, and do
   is divine truth, giving the actual reality of what is said. I am the
   Vine, only consent and yield thy all to Me, I will do all in thee."

   And so it sometimes comes that souls who have never been specially
   occupied with the thought of abiding, are abiding all the time, because
   they are occupied with Christ. Not that the word abide is not needful;
   Christ used it so often, because it is the very key to the Christian
   life. But He would have us understand it in its true sense--"Come out
   of every other place, and every other trust and occupation, come out of
   self with its reasonings and efforts, come and rest in what I shall do.
   Live out of thyself; abide in Me. Know that thou art in Me; thou
   needest no more; remain there in Me."

   "I am the Vine." Christ did not keep this mystery hidden from His
   disciples. He revealed it, first in words here, then in power when the
   Holy Spirit came down. He will reveal it to us too, first in the
   thoughts and confessions and desires these words awaken, then in power
   by the Spirit. Do let us wait on Him to show us all the heavenly
   meaning of the mystery. Let each day, in our quiet time, in the inner
   chamber with Him and His Word, our chief thought and aim be to get the
   heart fixed on Him, in the assurance: all that a vine ever can do for
   its branches, my Lord Jesus will do, is doing, for me. Give Him time,
   give Him your ear, that He may whisper and explain the divine secret:
   "I am the vine."

   Above all, remember, Christ is the Vine of God's planting, and you are
   a branch of God's grafting. Ever stand before God, in Christ; ever wait
   for all grace from God, in Christ; ever yield yourself to bear the more
   fruit the Husbandman asks, in Christ. And pray much for the revelation
   of the mystery that all the love and power of God that rested on Christ
   is working in you too. "I am God's Vine," Jesus says; "all I am I have
   from Him; all I am is for you; God will work it in you."

   I am the Vine. Blessed Lord, speak Thou that word into my soul. Then
   shall I know that all Thy fullness is for me. And that I can count upon
   Thee to stream it into me, and that my abiding is so easy and so sure
   when I forget and lose myself in the adoring faith that the Vine holds
   the branch and supplies its every need.
     __________________________________________________________________

YE THE BRANCHES

   I Am The Vine, Ye Are the Branches--John 15.5


   Christ had already said much of the branch; here He comes to the
   personal application: "Ye are the branches of whom I have been
   speaking. As I am the Vine, engaged to be and do all the branches need,
   so I now ask you, in the new dispensation of the Holy Spirit whom I
   have been promising you, to accept the place I give you, and to be My
   branches on earth." The relationship He seeks to establish is an
   intensely personal one: it all hinges on the two little words I and
   You. And it is for us as intensely personal as for the first disciples.
   Let us present ourselves before our Lord, until He speak to each of us
   in power, and our whole soul feels it: "I am the Vine; you are the
   branch."

   Dear disciple of Jesus, however young or feeble, hear the voice. "You
   are the branch." You must be nothing less. Let no false humility, no
   carnal fear of sacrifice, no unbelieving doubts as to what you feel
   able for, keep you back from saying: "I will be a branch, with all that
   may mean--a branch, very feeble, but yet as like the Vine as can be,
   for I am of the same nature, and receive of the same spirit. A branch,
   utterly helpless, and yet just as manifestly set apart before God and
   men, as wholly given up to the work of bearing fruit, as the Vine
   itself. A branch, nothing in myself, and yet resting and rejoicing in
   the faith that knows that He will provide for all. Yes, by His grace, I
   will be nothing less than a branch, and all He means it to be, that
   through me, He may bring forth His fruit."

   You are the branch.--You need be nothing more. You need not for one
   single moment of the day take upon you the responsibility of the Vine.
   You need not leave the place of entire dependence and unbounded
   confidence. You need, least of all, to be anxious as to how you are to
   understand the mystery, or fulfill its conditions, or work out its
   blessed aim. The Vine will give all and work all. The Father, the
   Husbandman, watches over your union with and growth in the Vine. You
   need be nothing more than a branch. Only a branch! Let that be your
   watchword; it will lead in the path of continual surrender to Christ's
   working, of true obedience to His every command, of joyful expectancy
   of all His grace.

   Is there anyone who now asks: "How can I learn to say this aright, Only
   be a branch!' and to live it out?" Dear soul, the character of a
   branch, its strength, and the fruit it bears, depend entirely upon the
   Vine. And your life as branch depends entirely upon your apprehension
   of what our Lord Jesus is. Therefore never separate the two words: "I
   the Vine--you the branch." Your life and strength and fruit depend upon
   what your Lord Jesus is! Therefore worship and trust Him; let Him be
   your one desire and the one occupation of your heart. And when you feel
   that you do not and cannot know Him aright, then just remember it is
   part of His responsibility as Vine to make Himself known to you. He
   does this not in thoughts and conceptions--no--but in a hidden growth
   within the life that is humbly and restfully and entirely given up to
   wait on Him. The Vine reveals itself within the branch; thence comes
   the growth and fruit, Christ dwells and works within His branch; only
   be a branch, waiting on Him to do all; He will be to thee the true
   Vine. The Father Himself, the divine Husbandman, is able to make thee a
   branch worthy of the heavenly Vine. Thou shalt not be disappointed.

   Ye are the branches. This word, too Lord! O speak it in power unto my
   soul. Let not the branch of the earthly vine put me to shame, but as it
   only lives to bear the fruit of the vine, may my life on earth have no
   wish or aim, but to let Thee bring forth fruit through me.
     __________________________________________________________________

MUCH FRUIT

   He That Abideth in Me, and I in Him, the Same Bringeth Forth Much
   Fruit--John 15.5


   Our Lord had spoken of fruit, more fruit. He now adds the thought: much
   fruit. There is in the Vine such fullness, the care of the divine
   Husbandman is so sure of success, that the much fruit is not a demand,
   but the simple promise of what must come to the branch that lives in
   the double abiding--he in Christ, and Christ in him. "The same bringeth
   forth much fruit." It is certain.

   Have you ever noticed the difference in the Christian life between work
   and fruit? A machine can do work: only life can bear fruit. A law can
   compel work: only love can spontaneously bring forth fruit. Work
   implies effort and labor: the essential idea of fruit is that it is the
   silent natural restful produce of our inner life. The gardener may
   labor to give his apple tree the digging and manuring, the watering and
   the pruning it needs; he can do nothing to produce the apple: "The
   fruit of the Spirit is love, peace, joy." The healthy life bears much
   fruit. The connection between work and fruit is perhaps best seen in
   the expression, "fruitful in every good work." (Col. 1.10). It is only
   when good works come as the fruit of the indwelling Spirit that they
   are acceptable to God. Under the compulsion of law and conscience, or
   the influence of inclination and zeal, men may be most diligent in good
   works, and yet find that they have but little spiritual result. There
   can be no reason but this--their works are man's effort, instead of
   being the fruit of the Spirit, the restful, natural outcome of the
   Spirit's operation within us.

   Let all workers come and listen to our holy Vine as He reveals the law
   of sure and abundant fruitfulness: "He that abideth in me, and I in
   him, the same bringeth forth much fruit." The gardener cares for one
   thing--the strength and healthy life of his tree: the fruit follows of
   itself. If you would bear fruit, see that the inner life is perfectly
   right, that your relation to Christ Jesus is clear and close. Begin
   each day with Him in the morning, to know in truth that you are abiding
   in Him and He in you. Christ tells that nothing less will do. It is not
   your willing and running, it is not by your might or strength, but--"by
   my Spirit, saith the Lord." Meet each new engagement, undertake every
   new work, with an ear and heart open to the Master's voice: "He that
   abideth in me, beareth much fruit." See you to the abiding; He will see
   to the fruit, for He will give it in you and through you.

   O my brother, it is Christ must do all! The Vine provides the sap, and
   the life, and the strength: the branch waits, and rests, and receives,
   and bears the fruit. Oh, the blessedness of being only branches,
   through whom the Spirit flows and brings God's life to men!

   I pray you, take time and ask the Holy Spirit to give you to realize
   the unspeakably solemn place you occupy in the mind of God. He has
   planted you into His Son with the calling and the power to bear much
   fruit. Accept that place. Look much to God, and to Christ, and expect
   joyfully to be what God has planned to make you, a fruitful branch.

   Much fruit! So be it, blessed Lord Jesus. It can be, for Thou art the
   Vine. It shall be, for I am abiding in Thee. It must be, for Thy Father
   is the Husbandman that cleanses the branch. Yea, much fruit, out of the
   abundance of Thy grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

YOU CAN DO NOTHING

   Apart From Me Ye Can Do Nothing--John 15.5


   In everything the life of the branch is to be the exact counterpart of
   that of the Vine. Of Himself Jesus had said: "The Son can do nothing of
   himself." As the outcome of that entire dependence, He could add: "All
   that the Father doeth, doeth the Son also likewise." As Son He did not
   receive His life from the Father once for all, but moment by moment.
   His life was a continual waiting on the Father for all He was to do.
   And so Christ says of His disciples: "Ye can do nothing apart from me."
   He means it literally. To everyone who wants to live the true disciple
   life, to bring forth fruit and glorify God, the message comes: You can
   do nothing. What had been said: "He that abideth in me, and I in him,
   the same beareth much fruit," is here enforced by the simplest and
   strongest of arguments: "Abiding in Me is indispensable, for, you know
   it, of yourselves you can do nothing to maintain or act out the
   heavenly life."

   A deep conviction of the truth of this word lies at the very root of a
   strong spiritual life. As little as I created myself, as little as I
   could raise a man from the dead, can I give myself the divine life. As
   little as I can give it myself, can I maintain or increase it: every
   motion is the work of God through Christ and His Spirit. It is as a man
   believes this, that he will take up that position of entire and
   continual dependence which is the very essence of the life of faith.
   With the spiritual eye he sees Christ every moment supplying grace for
   every breathing and every deepening of the spiritual life. His whole
   heart says Amen to the word: You can do nothing. And just because he
   does so, he can also say: "I can do all things in Christ who
   strengtheneth me." The sense of helplessness, and the abiding to which
   it compels, leads to true fruitfulness and diligence in good works.

   Apart from me ye can do nothing.--What a plea and what a call every
   moment to abide in Christ! We have only to go back to the vine to see
   how true it is. Look again at that little branch, utterly helpless and
   fruitless except as it receives sap from the vine, and learn that the
   full conviction of not being able to do anything apart from Christ is
   just what you need to teach you to abide in your heavenly Vine. It is
   this that is the great meaning of the pruning Christ spoke of--all that
   is self must be brought low, that our confidence may be in Christ
   alone. "Abide in me"--much fruit! "Apart from me"--nothing! Ought there
   to be any doubt as to what we shall choose?

   The one lesson of the parable is--as surely, as naturally as the branch
   abides in the vine, You can abide in Christ. For this He is the true
   Vine; for this God is the Husbandman; for this you are a branch. Shall
   we not cry to God to deliver us forever from the "apart from me," and
   to make the "abide in me" an unceasing reality? Let your heart go out
   to what Christ is, and can do, to His divine power and His tender love
   to each of His branches, and you will say evermore confidently: "Lord!
   I am abiding; I will bear much fruit. My impotence is my strength. So
   be it. Apart from Thee, nothing. In Thee, much fruit."

   Apart from Me--you nothing. Lord, I gladly accept the arrangement: I
   nothing--Thou all. My nothingness is my highest blessing, because Thou
   art the Vine, that givest and workest all. So be it, Lord! I, nothing,
   ever waiting on Thy fullness. Lord, reveal to me the glory of this
   blessed life.
     __________________________________________________________________

WITHERED BRANCHES

   If a Man Abide Not in Me, He is Cast Forth as a Branch, and is
   Withered; and They Gather Them, and Cast Them into the Fire, and They
   are Burned--John 15.6


   The lessons these words teach are very simple and very solemn. A man
   can come to such a connection with Christ, that he counts himself to be
   in Him, and yet he can be cast forth. There is such a thing as not
   abiding in Christ, which leads to withering up and burning. There is
   such a thing as a withered branch, one in whom the initial union with
   Christ appears to have taken place, and in whom yet it is seen that his
   faith was but for a time. What a solemn call to look around and see if
   there be not withered branches in our churches, to look within and see
   whether we are indeed abiding and bearing fruit!

   And what may be the cause of this "not abiding." With some it is that
   they never understood how the Christian calling leads to holy obedience
   and to loving service. They were content with the thought that they had
   believed, and were safe from Hell; there was neither motive nor power
   to abide in Christ--they knew not the need of it. With others it was
   that the cares of the world, or its prosperity, choked the Word: they
   had never forsaken all to follow Christ. With still others it was that
   their religion and their faith was in the wisdom of men, and not in the
   power of God. They trusted in the means of grace, or in their own
   sincerity, or in the soundness of their faith in justifying grace; they
   had never come even to seek an entire abiding in Christ as their only
   safety. No wonder that, when the hot winds of temptation or persecution
   blew, they withered away: they were not truly rooted in Christ.

   Let us open our eyes and see if there be not withered branches all
   around us in the churches. Young men, whose confessions were once
   bright, but who are growing cold. Or old men, who have retained their
   profession, but out of whom the measure of life there once appeared to
   be has died out. Let ministers and believers take Christ's words to
   heart, and see, and ask the Lord whether there is nothing to be done
   for branches that are beginning to wither. And let the word Abide ring
   through the Church until every believer has caught it--no safety but in
   a true abiding in Christ.

   Let each of us turn within. Is our life fresh, and green, and vigorous,
   bringing forth its fruit in its season? (See Ps. 1.3; 92.13, 14; Jer.
   17.7, 8.) Let us accept every warning with a willing mind, and let
   Christ's "if a man abide not" give new urgency to His "abide in me." To
   the upright soul the secret of abiding will become ever simpler, just
   the consciousness of the place in which He has put me; just the
   childlike resting in my union with Him, and the trustful assurance that
   He will keep me. Oh, do let us believe there is a life that knows of no
   withering, that is ever green; and that brings forth fruit abundantly!

   Withered! O my Father, watch over me, and keep me, and let nothing ever
   for a moment hinder the freshness that comes from a full abiding in the
   Vine. Let the very thought of a withered branch fill me with holy fear
   and watchfulness.
     __________________________________________________________________

WHATSOEVER YE WILL

   If Ye Abide in Me, and My Words Abide in You, Ask Whatsoever Ye Will,
   and it Shall be Done Unto You--John 15.7


   The Whole place of the branch in the vine is one of unceasing prayer.
   Without intermission it is ever calling: "O my vine, send the sap I
   need to bear Thy fruit." And its prayers are never unanswered: it asks
   what it needs, what it will, and it is done.

   The healthy life of the believer in Christ is equally one of unceasing
   prayer. Consciously or unconsciously, he lives in continual dependence.
   The Word of his Lord, "You can do nothing," has taught him that not
   more unbroken than the continuance of the branch in the vine, must be
   his asking and receiving. The promise of our text gives us infinite
   boldness: "Ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you."

   The promise is given in direct connection with fruit-bearing. Limit it
   to yourself and your own needs, and you rob it of its power; you rob
   yourself of the power of appropriating it. Christ was sending these
   disciples out, and they were ready to give their life for the world; to
   them He gave the disposal of the treasures of Heaven. Their prayers
   would bring the Spirit and the power they needed for their work.

   The promise is given in direct connection with the coming of the
   Spirit. The Spirit is not mentioned in the parable, just as little as
   the sap of the vine is mentioned. But both are meant all through. In
   the chapter preceding the parable, our Lord had spoken of the Holy
   Spirit, in connection with their inner life, being in them, and
   revealing Himself within them (14.15-23). In the next chapter He speaks
   of the Holy Spirit in connection with their work, coming to them,
   convincing the world, and glorifying Him (16.7-14). To avail ourselves
   of the unlimited prayer promises, we must be men who are filled with
   the Spirit, and wholly given up to the work and glory of Jesus. The
   Spirit will lead us into the truth of its meaning and the certainty of
   its fulfillment.

   Let us realize that we can only fulfill our calling to bear much fruit,
   by praying much. In Christ are hid all the treasures men around us
   need; in Him all God's children are blessed with all spiritual
   blessings; He is full of grace and truth. But it needs prayer, much
   prayer, strong believing prayer, to bring these blessings down. And let
   us equally remember that we cannot appropriate the promise without a
   life given up for men. Many try to take the promise, and then look
   round for what they can ask. This is not the way; but the very
   opposite. Get the heart burdened with the need of souls, and the
   command to save them, and the power will come to claim the promise.

   Let us claim it as one of the revelations of our wonderful life in the
   Vine: He tells us that if we ask in His name, in virtue of our union
   with Him, whatsoever it be, it will be done to us. Souls are perishing
   because there is too little prayer. God's children are feeble because
   there is too little prayer. We bear so little fruit because there is so
   little prayer. The faith of this promise would make us strong to pray;
   let us not rest till it has entered into our very heart, and drawn us
   in the power of Christ to continue and labor and strive in prayer until
   the blessing comes in power. To be a branch means not only bearing
   fruit on earth, but power in prayer to bring down blessing from Heaven.
   Abiding fully means praying much.

   Ask what ye will. O my Lord, why is it that our hearts are so little
   able to accept these words in their divine simplicity? Oh, give me to
   see that we need nothing less than this promise to overcome the powers
   of the world and Satan! Teach us to pray in the faith of this Thy
   promise.

IF YE ABIDE

   If Ye Abide in Me, and My Words, Abide in You, Ask Whatsoever Ye Will,
   and it Shall be Done Unto You--John 15.7


   The reason the Vine and its branches are such a true parable of the
   Christian life is that all nature has one source and breathes one
   spirit. The plant world was created to be to man an object lesson
   teaching him his entire dependence upon God, and his security in that
   dependence. He that clothes the lilies will much more cloth us. He that
   gives the trees and the vines their beauty and their fruits, making
   each what He meant it to be, will much more certainly make us what He
   would have us to be. The only difference is what God works in the trees
   is by a power of which they are not conscious. He wants to work in us
   with our consent. This is the nobility of man, that he has a will that
   can cooperate with God in understanding and approving and accepting
   what He offers to do.

   If ye abide--Here is the difference between the branch of the natural
   and the branch of the spiritual Vine. The former abides by force of
   nature: the latter abides, not by force of will, but by a divine power
   given to the consent of the will. Such is the wonderful provision God
   has made that, what the power of nature does in the one case, the power
   of grace will do in the other. The branch can abide in the Vine.

   If ye abide in me...ask whatsoever ye will--If we are to live a true
   prayer life, with the love and the power and the experience of prayer
   marking it, there must be no question about the abiding. And if we
   abide, there need be no question about the liberty of asking what we
   will, and the certainty of its being done. There is the one condition:
   "If ye abide in me." There must be no hesitation about the possibility
   or the certainty of it. We must gaze on that little branch and its
   wonderful power of bearing such beautiful fruit until we truly learn to
   abide.

   And what is its secret? Be wholly occupied with Jesus. Sink the roots
   of your being in faith and love and obedience deep down into Him. Come
   away out of every other place to abide here. Give up everything for the
   inconceivable privilege of being a branch on earth of the glorified Son
   of God in Heaven. Let Christ be first. Let Christ be all. Do not be
   occupied with the abiding--be occupied with Christ! He will hold you,
   He will keep you abiding in Him. He will abide in you.

   If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you--This He gives as the
   equivalent of the other expression: "I in you. If my words abide in
   you"--that is, not only in meditation, in memory, in love, in
   faith--all these words enter into your will, your being, and constitute
   your life--if they transform your character into their own likeness,
   and you become and are what they speak and mean--ask what ye will; it
   shall be done unto you. Your words to God in prayer will be the fruit
   of Christ and His words living in you.

   Ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you--Believe in the truth
   of this promise. Set yourself to be an intercessor for men; a
   fruit-bearing intercessor, ever calling down more blessing. Such faith
   and prayer will help you wonderfully to abide wholly and unceasingly.

   If ye abide. Yes, Lord, the power to pray and the power to prevail must
   depend on this abiding in Thee. As Thou art the Vine, Thou art the
   divine Intercessor, who breathest Thy spirit in us. Oh, for grace to
   abide simply and wholly in Thee, and ask great things!

THE FATHER GLORIFIED

   Herein is My Father Glorified, that Ye Bear Much Fruit--John 15.8


   How can we glorify God? Not by adding to His glory or bringing Him any
   new glory that He has not. But simply by allowing His glory to shine
   out through us, by yielding ourselves to Him, that His glory may
   manifest itself in us and through us to the world. In a vineyard or a
   vine bearing much fruit, the owner is glorified, as it tells of his
   skill and care. In the disciple who bears much fruit, the Father is
   glorified. Before men and angels, proof is given of the glory of God's
   grace and power; God's glory shines out through him.

   This is what Peter means when he writes: "He that ministers, let him
   minister as of the ability that God giveth, that God in all things may
   be glorified through Jesus Christ." As a man works and serves in a
   power which comes from God alone, God gets all the glory. When we
   confess that the ability came from God alone, he that does the work,
   and they who see it, equally glorify God. It was God who did it. Men
   judge by the fruit of a garden of what the gardener is. Men judge of
   God by the fruit that the branches of the Vine of His planting bears.
   Little fruit brings little glory to God. It brings no honor to either
   the Vine or the Husbandman. "That ye bear much fruit, herein is my
   Father glorified."

   We have sometimes mourned our lack of fruit, as a loss to ourselves and
   our fellow men, with complaints of our feebleness as the cause. Let us
   rather think of the sin and shame of little fruit as robbing God of the
   glory He ought to get from us. Let us learn the secret of bringing
   glory to God, serving of the ability which God giveth. The full
   acceptance of Christ's Word, "You can do nothing"; the simple faith in
   God, who worketh all in all; the abiding in Christ through whom the
   divine Husbandman does His work and gets much fruit--this is the life
   that will bring glory to God.

   Much fruit--God asks it; see that you give it. God can be content with
   nothing less; be you content with nothing less. Let these words of
   Christ--fruit, more fruit, much fruit--abide in you, until you think as
   He does, and you be prepared to take from Him, the heavenly Vine, what
   He has for you. Much fruit: herein is my Father glorified. Let the very
   height of the demand be your encouragement. It is so entirely beyond
   your power, that it throws you more entirely upon Christ, your true
   Vine. He can, He will, make it true in you.

   Much fruit--God asks because he needs. He does not ask fruit from the
   branches of His Vine for show, to prove what He can do. No; He needs it
   for the salvation of men: it is in that He is to be glorified. Throw
   yourself in much prayer on your Vine and your Husbandman. Cry to God
   and your Father to give you fruit to bring to men. Take the burden of
   the hungry and the perishing on you, as Jesus did when He was moved
   with compassion, and your power in prayer, and your abiding, and your
   bearing much fruit to the glory of the Father will have a reality and a
   certainty you never knew before.

   The Father glorified. Blessed prospect--God glorifying Himself in me,
   showing forth the glory of His goodness and power in what He works in
   me, and through me. What a motive to bear much fruit, just as much as
   He works in me! Father, glorify Thyself in me.
     __________________________________________________________________

TRUE DISCIPLES

   Herein is My Father Glorified, that Ye Bear Much Fruit: So Shall Ye Be
   My Disciples--John 15.8


   And are those who do not bear much fruit not disciples? They may be,
   but in a backward and immature stage. Of those who bear much fruit,
   Christ says: "These are My disciples, such as I would have them
   be--these are true disciples." Just as we say of someone in whom the
   idea of manliness is realized: That is a man! So our Lord tells who are
   disciples after His heart, worthy of the name: Those who bear much
   fruit. We find this double sense of the word disciple in the Gospel.
   Sometimes it is applied to all who accepted Christ's teaching. At other
   times it includes only the inner circle of those who followed Christ
   wholly, and gave themselves to His training for service. The difference
   has existed throughout all ages. There have always been a smaller
   number of God's people who have sought to serve Him with their whole
   heart, while the majority have been content with a very small measure
   of the knowledge of His grace and will.

   And what is the difference between this smaller inner circle and the
   many who do not seek admission to it? We find it in the words: much
   fruit. With many Christians the thought of personal safety, which at
   their first awakening was a legitimate one, remains to the end the one
   aim of their religion. The idea of service and fruit is always a
   secondary and very subordinate one. The honest longing for much fruit
   does not trouble them. Souls that have heard the call to live wholly
   for their Lord, to give their life for Him as He gave His for them, can
   never be satisfied with this. Their cry is to bear as much fruit as
   they possibly can, as much as their Lord ever can desire or give in
   them.

   Bear much fruit: so shall ye be My disciples--Let me beg every reader
   to consider these words most seriously. Be not content with the thought
   of gradually doing a little more or better work. In this way it may
   never come. Take the words, much fruit, as the revelation of your
   heavenly Vine of what you must be, of what you can be. Accept fully the
   impossibility, the utter folly of attempting it in your strength. Let
   the words call you to look anew upon the Vine, an undertaking to live
   out its heavenly fullness in you. Let them waken in you once again the
   faith and the confession: "I am a branch of the true Vine; I can bear
   much fruit to His glory, and the glory of the Father."

   We need not judge others. But we see in God's Word everywhere two
   classes of disciples. Let there be no hesitation as to where we take
   our place. Let us ask Him to reveal to us how He ask and claims a life
   wholly given up to Him, to be as full of His Spirit as He can make us.
   Let our desire be nothing less than perfect cleansing, unbroken
   abiding, closest communion, abundant fruitfulness--true branches of the
   true Vine.

   The world is perishing, the church is failing, Christ's cause is
   suffering, Christ is grieving on account of the lack of wholehearted
   Christians, bearing much fruit. Though you scarce see what it implies
   or how it is to come, say to Him that you are His branch to bear much
   fruit; that you are ready to be His disciple in His own meaning of the
   word.

   My disciples. Blessed Lord, much fruit is the proof that Thou the true
   Vine hast in me a true branch, a disciple wholly at Thy disposal. Give
   me, I pray Thee, the childlike consciousness that my fruit is pleasing
   to Thee, what Thou countest much fruit.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE WONDERFUL LOVE

   Even as the Father Hath Loved Me, I Also Have Loved you--John 15.9


   Here Christ leaves the language of parable, and speaks plainly out of
   the Father. Much as the parable could teach, it could not teach the
   lesson of love. All that the vine does for the branch, it does under
   the compulsion of a law of nature: there is no personal living love to
   the branch. We are in danger of looking to Christ as a Saviour and a
   supplier of every need, appointed by God, accepted and trusted by us,
   without any sense of the intensity of personal affection in which
   Christ embraces us, and our life alone can find its true happiness.
   Christ seeks to point us to this.

   And how does He do so? He leads us once again to Himself, to show us
   how identical His own life is with ours. Even as the Father loved Him,
   He loves us. His life as vine dependent on the Father was a life in the
   Father's love; that love was His strength and His joy; in the power of
   that divine love resting on Him He lived and died. If we are to live
   like Him, as branches to be truly like our Vine, we must share in this
   too. Our life must have its breath and being in a heavenly love as much
   as His. What the Father's love was to Him, His love will be to us. If
   that love made Him the true Vine, His love can make us true branches.
   "Even as the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you."

   Even as the Father hath loved Me--And how did the Father love Him? The
   infinite desire and delight of God to communicate to the Son all He had
   Himself, to take the Son into the most complete equality with Himself,
   to live in the Son and have the Son live in Him--this was the love of
   God to Christ. It is a mystery of glory of which we can form no
   conception, we can only bow and worship as we try to think of it. And
   with such a love, with this very same love, Christ longs in an infinite
   desire and delight to communicate to us all He is and has, to make us
   partakers of His own nature and blessedness, to live in us and have us
   live in Himself.

   And now, if Christ loves us with such an intense, such an infinite
   divine love, what is it that hinders it triumphing over every obstacle
   and getting full possession of us? The answer is simple. Even as the
   love of the Father to Christ, so His love to us is a divine mystery,
   too high for us to comprehend or attain to by any effort of our own. It
   is only the Holy Spirit who can shed abroad and reveal in its
   all-conquering power without intermission this wonderful love of God in
   Christ. It is the vine itself that must give the branch its growth and
   fruit by sending up its sap. It is Christ Himself must by His Holy
   Spirit dwell in the heart; then shall we know and have in us the love
   that passeth knowledge.

   As the Father loved Me, so have I loved you--Shall we not draw near to
   the personal living Christ, and trust Him, and yield all to Him, that
   He may love this love into us? Just as he knew and rejoiced every
   hour--the Father loveth Me--we too may live in the unceasing
   consciousness--as the Father loved Him, so He loves me.

   As the Father loved Me, so have I loved you. Dear Lord, I am only
   beginning to apprehend how exactly the life of the Vine is to be that
   of the branch too. Thou art the Vine, because the Father loved Thee,
   and poured His love through Thee. And so Thou lovest me, and my life as
   branch is to be like Thine, a receiving and a giving out of heavenly
   love.
     __________________________________________________________________

ABIDE IN MY LOVE

   Even as the Father Hath Loved Me, I Also Have Loved You: Abide Ye in My
   Love--John 15.9


   Abide in My love--We speak of a man's home as his abode. Our abode, the
   home of our soul, is to be the love of Christ. We are to live our life
   there, to be at home there all the day: this is what Christ means our
   life to be, and really can make it. Our continuous abiding in the Vine
   is to be an abiding in His love.

   You have probably heard or read of what is called the higher, or the
   deeper life, of the richer or the fuller life, of the life abundant.
   And you possibly know that some have told of a wonderful change, by
   which their life of continual failure and stumbling had been changed
   into a very blessed experience of being kept and strengthened and made
   exceeding glad. If you asked them how it was this great blessing came
   to them, many would tell you it was simply this, that they were led to
   believe that this abiding in Christ's love was meant to be a reality,
   and that they were made willing to give up everything for it, and then
   enabled to trust Christ to make it true to them.

   The love of the Father to the Son is not a sentiment--it is a divine
   life, an infinite energy, an irresistible power. It carried Christ
   through life and death and the grave. The Father loved Him and dwelt in
   Him, and did all for Him. So the love of Christ to us too is an
   infinite living power that will work in us all He delights to give us.
   The feebleness of our Christian life is that we do not take time to
   believe that this divine love does really delight in us, and will
   possess and work all in us. We do not take time to look at the Vine
   bearing the branch so entirely, working all in it so completely. We
   strive to do for ourselves what Christ alone can, what Christ, oh, so
   lovingly, longs to do for us.

   And this now is the secret of the change we spoke of, and the beginning
   of a new life, when the soul sees this infinite love willing to do all,
   and gives itself up to it. "Abide ye in my love." To believe that, it
   is possible so to live moment by moment; to believe that everything
   that makes it difficult or impossible will be overcome by Christ
   Himself; to believe that Love really means an infinite longing to give
   itself wholly to us and never leave us; and in this faith to cast
   ourselves on Christ to work it in us; this is the secret of the true
   Christian life.

   And how to come to this faith? Turn away from the visible if you would
   see and possess the invisible. Take more time with Jesus, gazing on Him
   as the heavenly Vine, living in the love of the Father, wanting you to
   live in His love. Turn away from yourself and your efforts and your
   faith, if you would have the heart filled with Him and the certainty of
   His love. Abiding means going out from everything else, to occupy one
   place and stay there. Come away from all else, and set your heart on
   Jesus, and His love, that love will waken your faith and strengthen it.
   Occupy yourself with that love, worship it, wait for it. You may be
   sure it will reach out to you, and by its power take you up into itself
   as your abode and your home.

   Abide in My love. Lord Jesus, I see it, it was Thy abiding in Thy
   Father's love that made Thee the true Vine, with Thy divine fullness of
   love and blessing for us. Oh, that I may even so, as a branch, abide in
   Thy love, for its fullness to fill me and overflow on all around.
     __________________________________________________________________

OBEY AND ABIDE

   If Ye Keep My Commandments, Ye Shall Abide In My Love--John 15.10


   In our former meditation reference was made to the entrance into a life
   of rest and strength which has often come through a true insight into
   the personal love of Christ, and the assurance that that love indeed
   meant that He would keep the soul. In connection with that transition,
   and the faith that sees and accepts it, the word surrender or
   consecration is frequently used. The soul sees that it cannot claim the
   keeping of this wonderful love unless it yields itself to a life of
   entire obedience. It sees too that the faith that can trust Christ for
   keeping from sinning must prove its sincerity by venturing at once to
   trust Him for strength to obey. In that faith it dares to give up and
   cut off everything that has hitherto hindered it, and to promise and
   expect to live a life that is well pleasing to God.

   This is the thought we have here now in our Saviour's teaching. After
   having in the words, "Abide in my love," spoken of a life in His love
   as a necessity, because it is at once a possibility and an obligation,
   He states what its one condition is: "If ye keep my commandments, ye
   shall abide in my love." This is surely not meant to close the door to
   the abode of His love which he had just opened up. Not in the most
   distant way does it suggest the thought which some are too ready to
   entertain, that as we cannot keep His commandments, we cannot abide in
   His love. No; the precept is a promise: "Abide in my love," could not
   be a precept if it were not a promise. And so the instruction as to the
   way through this open door points to no unattainable ideal; the love
   that invites to her blessed abode reaches out the hand, and enables us
   to keep the commandments. Let us not fear, in the strength of our
   ascended Lord, to take the vow of obedience, and give ourselves to the
   keeping of His commandments. Through His will, loved and done, lies the
   path to His love.

   Only let us understand well what it means. It refers to our performance
   of all that we know to be God's will. There may be things doubtful, of
   which we are not sure. A sin of ignorance has still the nature of sin
   in it. There may be involuntary sins, which rise up in the flesh, which
   we cannot control or overcome. With regard to these God will deal in
   due time in the way of searching and humbling, and if we be simple and
   faithful, give us larger deliverance than we dare expect. But all this
   may be found in a truly obedient soul. Obedience has reference to the
   positive keeping of the commandments of our Lord, and the performance
   of His will in everything in which we know it. This is a possible
   degree of grace, and it is the acceptance in Christ's strength of such
   obedience as the purpose of our heart, of which our Saviour speaks
   here. Faith in Christ as our Vine, in His enabling and sanctifying
   power, fits us for this obedience of faith, and secures a life of
   abiding in His love.

   If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love--It is the
   heavenly Vine unfolding the mystery of the life He gives. It is to
   those abiding in Him to whom He opens up the secret of the full abiding
   in His love. It is the wholehearted surrender in everything to do His
   will, that gives access to a life in the abiding enjoyment of His love.

   Obey and abide. Gracious Lord, teach me this lesson, that it is only
   through knowing Thy will one can know Thy heart, and only through doing
   that will one can abide in Thy love. Lord, teach me that as worthless
   as is the doing in my own strength, so essential and absolutely
   indispensable is the doing of faith in Thy strength, if I would abide
   in Thy love.
     __________________________________________________________________

YE, EVEN AS I

   If Ye Keep My Commandments, Ye Shall Abide in My Love, Even as I have
   Kept My Father's Commandments, and Abide in His Love--John 15.10


   We have had occasion more than once to speak of the perfect similarity
   of the vine and the branch in nature, and therefore in aim. Here Christ
   speaks no longer in a parable, but tells us plainly out of how His own
   life is the exact model of ours. He had said that it is alone by
   obedience we can abide in His love. He now tells that this was the way
   in which He abode in the Father's love. As the Vine, so the branch. His
   life and strength and joy had been in the love of the Father: it was
   only by obedience He abode in it. We may find our life and strength and
   joy in His love all the day, but it is only by an obedience like His we
   can abide in it. Perfect conformity to the Vine is one of the most
   precious of the lessons of the branch. It was by obedience Christ as
   Vine honored the Father as Husbandman; it is by obedience the believer
   as branch honors Christ as Vine.

   Obey and abide--That was the law of Christ's life as much as it is to
   be that of ours. He was made like us in all things, that we might be
   like Him in all things. He opened up a path in which we may walk even
   as He walked. He took our human nature to teach us how to wear it, and
   show us how obedience, as it is the first duty of the creature, is the
   only way to abide in the favor of God and enter into His glory. And now
   He comes to instruct and encourage us, and asks us to keep His
   commandments, even as He kept His Father's commandments and abides in
   His love.

   The divine fitness of this connection between obeying and abiding,
   between God's commandments and His love, is easily seen. God's will is
   the very center of His divine perfection. As revealed in His
   commandments, it opens up the way for the creature to grow into the
   likeness of the Creator. In accepting and doing His will, I rise into
   fellowship with Him. Therefore it was that the Son, when coming into
   the world, spoke: "I come to do thy will, O God"! This was the place
   and this would be the blessedness of the creature. This was what he had
   lost in the Fall. This was what Christ came to restore. This is what,
   as the heavenly Vine, He asks of us and imparts to us, that even as He
   by keeping His Father's commandments abode in His love, we should keep
   His commandments and abide in His love.

   Ye, even as I--The branch cannot bear fruit except as it has exactly
   the same life as the Vine. Our life is to be the exact counterpart of
   Christ's life. It can be, just in such measure as we believe in Him as
   the Vine, imparting Himself and His life to His branches. "Ye, even as
   I," the Vine says: one law, one nature, one fruit. Do let us take from
   our Lord the lesson of obedience as the secret of abiding. Let us
   confess that simple, implicit, universal obedience has taken too little
   the place it should have. Christ died for us as enemies, when we were
   disobedient. He took us up into His love; now that we are in Him, His
   Word is: "Obey and abide; ye, even as I." Let us give ourselves to a
   willing and loving obedience. He will keep us abiding in His love.

   Ye, even as I. O my blessed Vine, who makest the branch in everything
   partake of Thy life and likeness, in this too I am to be like Thee: as
   Thy life in the Father's love through obedience, so mine in Thy love!
   Saviour, help me, that obedience may indeed be the link between Thee
   and me.
     __________________________________________________________________

JOY

   These Things Have I Spoken Unto You, That My Joy May Be in You, and
   That Your Joy May Be Fulfilled--John 15.11


   If any one asks the question, "How can I be a happy Christian?" our
   Lord's answer is very simple: "These things," about the Vine and the
   branches, "I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that
   your joy may be fulfilled." "You cannot have My joy without My life.
   Abide in Me, and let Me abide in you, and My joy will be in you." All
   healthy life is a thing of joy and beauty; live undividedly the branch
   life; you will have His joy in full measure.

   To many Christians the thought of a life wholly abiding in Christ is
   one of strain and painful effort. They cannot see that the strain and
   effort only come, as long as we do not yield ourselves unreservedly to
   the life of Christ in us. The very first words of the parable are not
   yet opened up to them: "I am the true Vine; I undertake all and provide
   for all; I ask nothing of the branch but that it yields wholly to Me,
   and allows Me to do all. I engage to make and keep the branch all that
   it ought to be." Ought it not to be an infinite and unceasing joy to
   have the Vine thus work all, and to know that it is none less than the
   blessed Son of God in His love who is each moment bearing us and
   maintaining our life?

   That My joy may be in you--We are to have Christ's own joy in us. And
   what is Christ's own joy? There is no joy like love. There is no joy
   but love. Christ had just spoken of the Father's love and His own
   abiding in it, and of His having loved us with that same love. His joy
   is nothing but the joy of love, of being loved and of loving. It was
   the joy of receiving His Father's love and abiding in it, and then the
   joy of passing on that love and pouring it out on sinners. It is this
   joy He wants us to share: the joy of being loved of the Father and of
   Him; the joy of in our turn loving and living for those around us. This
   is just the joy of being truly branches: abiding in His love, and then
   giving up ourselves in love to bear fruit for others. Let us accept His
   life, as He gives it in us as the Vine, His joy will be ours: the joy
   of abiding in His love, the joy of loving like Him, of loving with His
   love.

   And that your joy may be fulfilled--That it may be complete, that you
   may be filled with it. How sad that we should so need to be reminded
   that as God alone is the fountain of all joy, "God our exceeding joy,"
   the only way to be perfectly happy is to have as much of God, as much
   of His will and fellowship, as possible! Religion is meant to be in
   everyday life a thing of unspeakable joy. And why do so many complain
   that it is not so? Because they do not believe that there is no joy
   like the joy of abiding in Christ and in His love, and being branches
   through whom He can pour out His love on a dying world.

   Oh, that Christ's voice might reach the heart of every young Christian,
   and persuade him to believe that His joy is the only true joy, that His
   joy can become ours and truly fill us, and that the sure and simple way
   of living in it is--only this--to abide as branches in Him our heavenly
   Vine. Let the truth enter deep into us--as long as our joy is not full,
   it is a sign that we do not yet know our heavenly Vine aright; every
   desire for a fuller joy must only urge us to abide more simply and more
   fully in His love.

   My joy--your joy. In this too it is: as the Vine, so the branch; all
   the Vine in the branch. Thy joy is our joy--Thy joy in us, and our joy
   fulfilled. Blessed Lord, fill me with Thy joy--the joy of being loved
   and blessed with a divine love; the joy of loving and blessing others.

LOVE ONE ANOTHER

   This is My Commandment, That Ye Love One Another--John 15.12


   God is love. His whole nature and perfection is love, living not for
   Himself, but to dispense life and blessing. In His love He begat the
   Son, that He might give all to Him. In His love He brought forth
   creatures that He might make them partakers of His blessedness.

   Christ is the Son of God's love, the bearer, the revealer, the
   communicator of that love. His life and death were all love. Love is
   His life, and the life He gives. He only lives to love, to live out His
   life of love in us, to give Himself in all who will receive Him. The
   very first thought of the true Vine is love--living only to impart His
   life to the branches.

   The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of love. He cannot impart Christ's life
   without imparting His love. Salvation is nothing but love conquering
   and entering into us; we have just as much of salvation as we have of
   love. Full salvation is perfect love.

   No wonder that Christ said: "A new commandment I give unto you"; "This
   is my commandment"--the one all-inclusive commandment--"that ye love
   one another." The branch is not only one with the vine, but with all
   its other branches; they drink one spirit, they form one body, they
   bear one fruit. Nothing can be more unnatural than that Christians
   should not love one another, even as Christ loved them. The life they
   received from their heavenly Vine is nothing but love. This is the one
   thing He asks above all others. "Hereby shall all men know that ye are
   my disciples...love one another." As the special sort of vine is known
   by the fruit it bears, the nature of the heavenly Vine is to be judged
   of by the love His disciples have to one another.

   See that you obey this commandment. Let your "obey and abide" be seen
   in this. Love your brethren as the way to abide in the love of your
   Lord. Let your vow of obedience begin here. Love one another. Let your
   intercourse with the Christians in your own family be holy, tender,
   Christlike love. Let your thoughts of the Christians round you be,
   before everything, in the spirit of Christ's love. Let your life and
   conduct be the sacrifice of love--give your self up to think of their
   sins or their needs, to intercede for them, to help and to serve them.
   Be in your church or circle the embodiment of Christ's love. The life
   Christ lives in you is love; let the life in which you live it out be
   all love.

   But, man, you write as if all this was so natural and simple and easy.
   Is it at all possible thus to live and thus to love? My answer is:
   Christ commands it: you must obey. Christ means it: you must obey, or
   you cannot abide in His love.

   But I have tried and failed. I see no prospect of living like Christ.
   Ah! that is because you have failed to take in the first word of the
   parable--"I am the true Vine: I give all you need as a branch, I give
   all I myself have." I pray you, let the sense of past failure and
   present feebleness drive you to the Vine. He is all love. He loves to
   give. He gives love. He will teach you to love, even as He loved.

   Love one another. Dear Lord Jesus, Thou art all love; the life Thou
   gavest us is love; Thy new commandment, and Thy badge of discipleship
   is, "Love one another." I accept the charge: with the love with which
   Thou lovest me, and I love Thee, I will love my brethren.
     __________________________________________________________________

EVEN AS I HAVE LOVED YOU

   This is My Commandment, That Ye Love One Another, Even as I Have Loved
   You--John 15.12


   This is the second time our Lord uses the expression--Even as I. The
   first time it was of His relation to the Father, keeping His
   commandments, and abiding in His love. Even so we are to keep Christ's
   commandments, and abide in His love. The second time He speaks of His
   relation to us as the rule of our love to our brethren: "Love one
   another, as I have loved you." In each case His disposition and conduct
   is to be the law for ours. It is again the truth we have more than once
   insisted on--perfect likeness between the Vine and the branch.

   Even as I--But is it not a vain thing to imagine that we can keep His
   commandments, and love the brethren, even as He kept His Father's, and
   as He loved us? And must not the attempt end in failure and
   discouragement? Undoubtedly, if we seek to carry out the injunction in
   our strength, or without a full apprehension of the truth of the Vine
   and its branches. But if we understand that the "even as I" is just the
   one great lesson of the parable, the one continual language of the Vine
   to the branch, we shall see that it is not the question of what we feel
   able to accomplish, but of what Christ is able to work in us. These
   high and holy commands--"Obey, even as I! Love, even as I"--are just
   meant to bring us to the consciousness of our impotence, and through
   that to waken us to the need and the beauty and the sufficiency of what
   is provided for us in the Vine. We shall begin to hear the Vine
   speaking every moment to the branch: "Even as I. Even as I: My life is
   your life; and have a share in all My fullness; the Spirit in you, and
   the fruit that comes from you, is all just the same as in Me. Be not
   afraid, but let your faith grasp each "Even as I" as the divine
   assurance that because I live in you, you may and can live like Me."

   But why, if this really be the meaning of the parable, if this really
   be the life a branch may live, who do so few realize it? Because they
   do not know the heavenly mystery of the Vine. They know much of the
   parable and its beautiful lessons. But the hidden spiritual mystery of
   the Vine in His divine omnipotence and nearness, bearing and supplying
   them all the day--this they do not know, because they have not waited
   on God's Spirit to reveal it to them.

   Love one another, even as I have loved you--"Ye, even as I." How are we
   to begin if we are really to learn the mystery? With the confession
   that we need to be brought to an entirely new mode of life, because we
   have never yet known Christ as the Vine in the completeness of His
   quickening and transforming power. With the surrender to be cleansed
   from all that is of self, and detached from all that is in the world,
   to live only and wholly as Christ lived for the glory of the Father.
   And then with the faith that this "even as I" is in very deed what
   Christ is ready to make true, the very life the Vine will maintain in
   the branch wholly dependent upon Him.

   Even as I. Ever again it is, my blessed Lord, as the Vine, so the
   branch--one life, one spirit, one obedience, one joy, one love.

   Lord Jesus, in the faith that Thou art my Vine, and that I am Thy
   branch, I accept Thy command as a promise, and take Thy "even as I" as
   the simple revelation of what Thou dost work in me. Yea, Lord, as Thou
   hast loved, I will love.

CHRIST'S FRIENDSHIP: ITS ORIGIN

   Greater Love Hath No Man Than This, That a Man Lay Down His Life for
   His Friends--John 15.13


   In the three following verses our Lord speaks of His relation to His
   disciples under a new aspect--that of friendship. He point us to the
   love in which it on His side has its origin (v.13): to the obedience on
   our part by which it is maintained (v.14); and then to the holy
   intimacy to which it leads (v.15).

   Our relation to Christ is one of love. In speaking of this previously,
   He showed us what His love was in its heavenly glory; the same love
   with which the Father had loved Him. Here we have it in its earthly
   manifestation--lay down His life for us. "Greater love hath no man than
   this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." Christ does indeed
   long to have us know that the secret root and strength of all He is and
   does for us as the Vine is love. As we learn to believe this, we shall
   feel that here is something which we not only need to think and know
   about, but a living power, a divine life which we need to receive
   within us. Christ and His love are inseparable; they are identical. God
   is love, and Christ is love. God and Christ and the divine love can
   only be known by having them, by their life and power working within
   us. "This is eternal life, that they know thee"; there is no knowing
   God but by having the life; the life working in us alone gives the
   knowledge. And even so the love; if we would know it, we must drink of
   its living stream, we must have it shed forth by the Holy Spirit in us.

   "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man give his life for his
   friends." The life is the most precious thing a man has; the life is
   all he is; the life is himself. This is the highest measure of love:
   when a man gives his life, he hold nothing back, he gives all he has
   and is. It is this our Lord Jesus wants to make clear to us concerning
   His mystery of the Vine; with all He has He has placed Himself at our
   disposal. He wants us to count Him our very own; He wants to be wholly
   our possession, that we may be wholly His possession. He gave His life
   for us in death not merely as a passing act, that when accomplished was
   done with; no, but as a making Himself ours for eternity. Life for
   life; He gave His life for us to possess that we might give our life
   for Him to possess. This is what is taught by the parable of the Vine
   and the branch, in their wonderful identification, in their perfect
   union.

   It is as we know something of this, not by reason or imagination, but
   deep down in the heart and life, that we shall begin to see what ought
   to be our life as branches of the heavenly Vine. He gave Himself to
   death; He lost Himself, that we might find life in Him. This is the
   true Vine, who only lives to live in us. This is the beginning and the
   root of that holy friendship to which Christ invites us.

   Great is the mystery of godliness! Let us confess our ignorance and
   unbelief. Let us cease from our own understanding and our own efforts
   to master it. Let us wait for the Holy Spirit who dwells within us to
   reveal it. Let us trust His infinite love, which gave its life for us,
   to take possession and rejoice in making us wholly its own.

   His life for His friends. How wonderful the lessons of the Vine, giving
   its very life to its branches! And Jesus gave His life for His friends.
   And that love gives itself to them and in them. My heavenly Vine, oh,
   teach me how wholly Thou longest to live in me!
     __________________________________________________________________

CHRIST'S FRIENDSHIP: ITS EVIDENCE

   Ye Are My Friends, if Ye Do the Things Which I Command You--John 15.14


   Our Lord has said what He gave as proof of His friendship: He gave His
   life for us. He now tells us what our part is to be--to do the things
   which He commands. He gave His life to secure a place for His love in
   our hearts to rule us; the response His love calls us to, and empowers
   us for, is that we do what He commands us. As we know the dying love,
   we shall joyfully obey its commands. As we obey the commands, we shall
   know the love more fully. Christ had already said: "If ye keep my
   commandments, ye shall abide in my love." He counts it needful to
   repeat the truth again: the one proof of our faith in His love, the one
   way to abide in it, the one mark of being true branches is--to do the
   things which He commands us. He began with absolute surrender of His
   life for us. He can ask nothing less from us. This alone is a life in
   His friendship.

   This truth, of the imperative necessity of obedience, doing all that
   Christ commands us, has not the place in our Christian teaching and
   living that Christ meant it to have. We have given a far higher place
   to privilege than to duty. We have not considered implicit obedience as
   a condition of true discipleship. The secret thought that it is
   impossible to do the things He commands us, and that therefore it
   cannot be expected of us, and a subtle and unconscious feeling that
   sinning is a necessity have frequently robbed both precepts and
   promises of their power. The whole relation to Christ has become
   clouded and lowered, the waiting on His teaching, the power to hear and
   obey His voice, and through obedience to enjoy His love and friendship,
   have been enfeebled by the terrible mistake. Do let us try to return to
   the true position, take Christ's words as most literally true, and make
   nothing less the law of our life: "Ye are my friends, if ye do the
   things that I command you." Surely our Lord asks nothing less than that
   we heartily and truthfully say: "Yea, Lord, what Thou dost command,
   that will I do."

   These commands are to be done as a proof of friendship. The power to do
   them rests entirely in the personal relationship to Jesus. For a friend
   I could do what I would not for another. The friendship of Jesus is so
   heavenly and wonderful, it comes to us so as the power of a divine love
   entering in and taking possession, the unbroken fellowship with Himself
   is so essential to it, that it implies and imparts a joy and a love
   which make the obedience a delight. The liberty to claim the friendship
   of Jesus, the power to enjoy it, the grace to prove it in all its
   blessedness--all come as we do the things He commands us.

   Is not the one thing needful for us that we ask our Lord to reveal
   Himself to us in the dying love in which He proved Himself our friend,
   and then listen as He says to us: "Ye are My friends." As we see what
   our Friend has done for us, and what as unspeakable blessedness it is
   to have Him call us friends, the doing His commands will become the
   natural fruit of our life in his love. We shall not fear to say: "Yea,
   Lord, we are Thy friends, and do what Thou dost command us."

   If ye do. Yes, it is in doing that we are blessed, that we abide in His
   love, that we enjoy His friendship. "If ye do what I command you!" O my
   Lord, let Thy holy friendship lead me into the love of all Thy
   commands, and let the doing of Thy commands lead me ever deeper into
   Thy friendship.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHRIST'S FRIENDSHIP: ITS INTIMACY

   No Longer Do I Call You Servants; for the Servant Knoweth Not What His
   Lord Doeth: But I Have Called You Friends; for All Things That I Heard
   From My Father, I Have Made Known Unto You--John 15.15


   The highest proof of true friendship, and one great source of its
   blessedness, is the intimacy that holds nothing back, and admits the
   friend to share our inmost secrets. It is a blessed thing to be
   Christ's servant; His redeemed ones delight to call themselves His
   slaves. Christ had often spoken of the disciples as His servants. In
   His great love our Lord now says: "No longer do I call you servants";
   with the coming of the Holy Spirit a new era was to be inaugurated.
   "The servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth"--he has to obey without
   being consulted or admitted into the secret of all his master's plans.
   "But, I have called you friends, for all things I heard from my Father
   I have made known unto you." Christ's friends share with Him in all the
   secrets the Father has entrusted to Him.

   Let us think what this means. When Christ spoke of keeping His Father's
   commandments, He did not mean merely what was written in Holy
   Scripture, but those special commandments which were communicated to
   Him day by day, and from hour to hour. It was of these He said: "The
   Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that he doeth, and he
   will show him greater things." All that Christ did was God's working.
   God showed it to Christ, so that He carried out the Father's will and
   purpose, not, as man often does, blindly and unintelligently, but with
   full understanding and approval. As one who stood in God's counsel, He
   knew God's plan.

   And this now is the blessedness of being Christ's friends, that we do
   not, as servants, do His will without much spiritual insight into its
   meaning and aim, but are admitted, as an inner circle, into some
   knowledge of God's more secret thoughts. From the Day of Pentecost on,
   by the Holy Spirit, Christ was to lead His disciples into the spiritual
   apprehension of the mysteries of the kingdom, of which He had hitherto
   spoken only by parables.

   Friendship delights in fellowship. Friends hold council. Friends dare
   trust to each other what they would not for anything have others know.
   What is it that gives a Christian access to this holy intimacy with
   Jesus? That gives him the spiritual capacity for receiving the
   communications Christ has to make of what the Father has shown Him? "Ye
   are my friends if ye do what I command you." It is loving obedience
   that purifies the soul. That refers not only to the commandments of the
   Word, but to that blessed application of the Word to our daily life,
   which none but our Lord Himself can give. But as these are waited for
   in dependence and humility, and faithfully obeyed, the soul becomes
   fitted for ever closer fellowship, and the daily life may become a
   continual experience: "I have called you friends; for all things I have
   heard from my Father, I have made known unto you."

   I have called you friends. What an unspeakable honor! What a heavenly
   privilege! O Saviour, speak the word with power into my soul: "I have
   called you My friend, whom I love, whom I trust, to whom I make known
   all that passes between my Father and Me."
     __________________________________________________________________

ELECTION

   Ye Did Not Choose Me, But I Chose You, and Appointed You That Ye Should
   Go and Bear Fruit--John 15.16


   The branch does not choose the vine, or decide on which vine it will
   grow. The vine brings forth the branch, as and where it will. Even so
   Christ says: "Ye did not choose me, but I chose you." But some will say
   is not just this the difference between the branch in the natural and
   in the spiritual world, that man has a will and a power of choosing,
   and that it is in virtue of his having decided to accept Christ, his
   having chosen Him as Lord, that he is now a branch? This is undoubtedly
   true. And yet it is only half a truth. The lesson of the Vine, and the
   teaching of our Lord, points to the other half, the deeper, the divine
   side of our being in Christ. If He had not chosen us, we had never
   chosen Him. Our choosing Him was the result of His choosing us, and
   taking hold of us. In the very nature of things, it is His prerogative
   as Vine to choose and create His own branch. We owe all we are to "the
   election of grace." If we want to know Christ as the true Vine, the
   sole origin and strength of the branch life, and ourselves as branches
   in our absolute, most blessed, and most secure dependence upon Him, let
   us drink deep of this blessed truth: "Ye did not choose me, but I chose
   you."

   And with what view does Christ say this? That they may know what the
   object is for which He chose them, and find, in their faith in His
   election, the certainty of fulfilling their destiny. Throughout
   Scripture this is the great object of the teaching of election.
   "Predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son." (to be
   branches in the image and likeness of the Vine). "Chosen that we should
   be holy." "Chosen to salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit."
   "Elect in sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience." Some have
   abused the doctrine of election, and others, for fear of its abuse,
   have rejected it, because they have overlooked this teaching. They have
   occupied themselves with its hidden origin in eternity, with the
   inscrutable mysteries of the counsels of God instead of accepting the
   revelation of its purpose in time, and the blessings it brings into our
   Christian life.

   Just think what these blessings are. In our verse Christ reveals His
   twofold purpose in choosing us to be His branches: that we may bear
   fruit on earth, and have power in prayer in Heaven. What confidence the
   thought that He has chosen us for this gives, that He will not fail to
   fit us for carrying out His purpose! What assurance that we can bear
   fruit that will abide, and can pray so as to obtain! What a continual
   call to the deepest humility and praise, to the most entire dependence
   and expectancy! He would not choose us for what we are not fit for, or
   what He could not fit us for. He has chosen us; this is the pledge, He
   will do all in us.

   Let us listen in silence of soul to our holy Vine speaking to each of
   us: "You did not choose Me!" And let us say, "Yea, Lord, but I chose
   You! Amen, Lord!" Ask Him to show what this means. In Him, the true
   Vine, your life as branch has its divine origin, its eternal security,
   and the power to fulfill His purpose. From Him to whose will of love
   you owe all, you may expect all. In Him, His purpose, and His power,
   and His faithfulness, in His love let me abide.

   I chose you. Lord, teach me what this means--that Thou hast set Thy
   heart on me, and chosen me to bear fruit that will abide, and to pray
   prayer that will prevail. In this Thine eternal purpose my soul would
   rest itself and say: "What He chose me for I will be, I can be, I shall
   be."
     __________________________________________________________________

ABIDING FRUIT

   I Chose You, and Appointed You, That Ye Should Go and Bear Fruit, and
   That Your Fruit Should Abide--John 15.16


   There are some fruits that will not keep. One sort of pears or apples
   must be used at once; another sort can be kept over till next year. So
   there is in Christian work some fruit that does not last. There may be
   much that pleases and edified, and yet there is no permanent impression
   made on the power of the world or the state of the Church. On the other
   hand, there is work that leaves its mark for generations or for
   eternity. In it the power of God makes itself lastingly felt. It is the
   fruit of which Paul speaks when he describes the two styles of
   ministry: "My preaching was not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in
   demonstrations of the Spirit and of power; that your faith should not
   stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God." The more of man
   with his wisdom and power, the less of stability; the more of God's
   Spirit, the more of a faith standing in God's power.

   Fruit reveals the nature of the tree from which it comes. What is the
   secret of bearing fruit that abides? The answer is simple. It is as our
   life abides in Christ, as we abide in Him, that the fruit we bear will
   abide. The more we allow all that is of human will and effort to be cut
   down short and cleansed away by the divine Husbandman, the more
   intensely our being withdraws itself from the outward that God may work
   in us by His Spirit; that is, the more wholly we abide in Christ, the
   more will our fruit abide.

   What a blessed thought! He chose you, and appointed you to bear fruit,
   and that your fruit should abide. He never meant one of His branches to
   bring forth fruit that should not abide. The deeper I enter into the
   purpose of this His electing grace, the surer my confidence will become
   that I can bring forth fruit to eternal life, for myself and others.
   The deeper I enter into this purpose of His electing love, the more I
   will realize what the link is between the purpose from eternity, and
   the fruit to eternity: the abiding in Him. The purpose is His, He will
   carry it out; the fruit is His, He will bring it forth; the abiding is
   His, He will maintain it.

   Let everyone who professes to be a Christian worker, pause. Ask whether
   you are leaving your mark for eternity on those around you. It is not
   your preaching or teaching, your strength of will or power to
   influence, that will secure this. All depends on having your life full
   of God and His power. And that again depends upon your living the truly
   branchlike life of abiding--very close and unbroken fellowship with
   Christ. It is the branch, that abides in Him, that brings forth much
   fruit, fruit that will abide.

   Blessed Lord, reveal to my soul, I pray Thee, that Thou hast chosen me
   to bear much fruit. Let this be my confidence, that Thy purpose can be
   realized--Thou didst choose me. Let this be my power to forsake
   everything and give myself to Thee. Thou wilt Thyself perfect what Thou
   hast begun. Draw me so to dwell in the love and the certainty of that
   eternal purpose, that the power of eternity may posses me, and the
   fruit I bear may abide.

   That ye may bear fruit. O my heavenly Vine, it is beginning to dawn
   upon my soul that fruit, more fruit--much fruit--abiding fruit is the
   one thing Thou hast to give me, and the one thing as branch I have to
   give Thee! Here I am. Blessed Lord, work out Thy purpose in me; let me
   bear much fruit, abiding fruit, to thy glory.
     __________________________________________________________________

PREVAILING PRAYER

   I Appointed You That Ye Should Go and Bear Fruit, and That Your Fruit
   Should Abide: That Whatsoever Ye Shall Ask of the Father in My Name, He
   May Give It You--John 15.16


   In the first verse of our parable, Christ revealed Himself as the true
   Vine, and the Father as the Husbandman, and asked for Himself and the
   Father a place in the heart. Here, in the closing verse, He sums up all
   His teaching concerning Himself and the Father in the twofold purpose
   for which He had chosen them. With reference to Himself, the Vine, the
   purpose was, that they should bear fruit. With reference to the Father,
   it was, that whatsoever they should ask in His name, should be done of
   the Father in Heaven. As fruit is the great proof of the true relation
   to Christ, so prayer is of our relation to the Father. A fruitful
   abiding in the Son, and prevailing prayer to the Father, are the two
   great factors in the true Christian life.

   That whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it
   you.--These are the closing words of the parable of the Vine. The whole
   mystery of the Vine and its branches leads up to the other
   mystery--that whatsoever we ask in His name the Father gives! See here
   the reason of the lack of prayer, and of the lack of power in prayer.
   It is because we so little live the true branch life, because we so
   little lose ourselves in the Vine, abiding in Him entirely, that we
   feel so little constrained to much prayer, so little confident that we
   shall be heard, and so do not know how to use His name as the key to
   God's storehouse. The Vine planted on earth has reached up into Heaven;
   it is only the soul wholly and intensely abiding in it, can reach into
   Heaven with power to prevail much. Our faith in the teaching and the
   truth of the parable, in the truth and the life of the Vine, must prove
   itself by power in prayer. The life of abiding and obedience, of love
   and joy, of cleansing and fruit-bearing, will surely lead to the power
   of prevailing prayer.

   Whatsoever ye shall ask--The promise was given to disciples who were
   ready to give themselves, in the likeness of the true Vine, for their
   fellow men. This promise was all their provision for their work; they
   took it literally, they believed it, they used it, and they found it
   true. Let us give ourselves, as branches of the true Vine, and in His
   likeness, to the work of saving men, of bringing forth fruit to the
   glory of God, and we shall find a new urgency and power to pray and to
   claim the "whatsoever ye ask." We shall waken to our wonderful
   responsibility of having in such a promise the keys to the King's
   storehouses given us, and we shall not rest till we have received bread
   and blessing for the perishing.

   "I chose you, that ye may bring forth fruit, and that your fruit may
   abide; that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may
   give it to you." Beloved disciple, seek above everything to be a man of
   prayer. Here is the highest exercise of your privilege as a branch of
   the Vine; here is the full proof of your being renewed in the image of
   God and His Son; here is your power to show how you, like Christ, live
   not for yourself, but for others; here you enter Heaven to receive
   gifts for men; here your abiding in Christ has led to His abiding in
   you, to use you as the channel and instrument of His grace. The power
   to bear fruit for men has been crowned by power to prevail with God.

   "I am the vine, my Father is the Husbandman." Christ's work in you is
   to bring you so to the Father that His Word may be fulfilled in you:
   "At that day ye shall ask in my name; and I say not that I will pray
   the Father for you; for the Father himself loveth you." The power of
   direct access to the Father for men, the liberty of intercession
   claiming and receiving blessing for them in faith, is the highest
   exercise of our union with Christ. Let all who would truly and fully be
   branches give themselves to the work of intercession. It is the one
   great work of Christ the Vine in Heaven, the source of power for all
   His work. Make it your one great work as branch: it will be the power
   of all your work.

   In My name. Yes, Lord, in Thy name, the new name Thou hast given
   Thyself here, the true Vine. As a branch, abiding in Thee in entire
   devotion, in full dependence, in perfect conformity, in abiding
   fruitfulness, I come to the Father, in Thee, and He will give what I
   ask. Oh, let my life be one of unceasing and prevailing intercession!
   Amen!
