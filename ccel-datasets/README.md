#CCEL-texts

The files found in /originals were harvested from [Christian Classic Ethereal Library](https://www.ccel.org/) the last week of August, 2023. They are reproduced without change.

The files found in /modified are renamed files from /originals, which over time will have other modifications. For example, moving notes to their citation positions in a text.

The [Christian Classic Ethereal Library](https://www.ccel.org/) has grown and maintained this collection for more than two decades. Add your name to its regular visitors and support it as you can.
